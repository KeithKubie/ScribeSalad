00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:03.010
Voiceover:So we have a
polynomial right over here.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.631
We have a function p(x)
defined by this polynomial.

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.891
It's clearly a 7th degree polynomial,

00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:11.444
and what I want to do is think about,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:16.340
what are the possible number of real roots

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.370
for this polynomial right over here.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.907
So what are the possible
number of real roots?

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.949
For example, could you have 9 real roots?

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.847
And so I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:27.540
and think about, what are all the possible

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.287
number of real roots?

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.884
So I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:34.819
so the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:40.208
tells us that we are definitely
going to have 7 roots

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.676
some of which, could be actually real.

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:45.760
So we're definitely not going to have

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.948
8 or 9 or 10 real roots,

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.214
at most we're going to have 7 real roots,

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:52.380
so possible number of real roots,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.127
so possible - let me write this down -

00:00:55.127 --> 00:01:01.636
possible number of real roots.

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.703
Well 7 is a possibility.

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:05.549
If you graphed this out,

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.947
it could potentially
intersect the x-axis 7 times.

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:14.024
Now, would it be possible
to have 6 real roots?

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.002
Is 6 real roots a possibility?

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.892
Is this a possibility?

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.584
Well, let's think about
what that would imply

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:23.572
about the non-real complex roots.

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:27.368
If you have 6 real, actually
let's do it this way.

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:31.373
Let me write it this way.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:40.986
So real roots and then non-real, complex.

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:42.766
The reason I'm not just saying complex

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.848
is because real numbers

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:46.719
are a subset of complex numbers,

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.177
but this is being clear
that you're talking

00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:50.291
about complex numbers that are not real.

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:55.167
So you could have 7 real roots,

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.769
and then you would have no non-real roots,

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.615
so this is absolutely possible.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:03.159
Now could you have 6 real roots,

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.976
in which case that would imply that you

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.927
have 1 non-real root.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.328
Well no, you can't have
this because the non-real

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:15.117
complex roots come in
pairs, conjugate pairs,

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:16.252
so you're always going to have

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:18.781
an even number of non-real complex roots.

00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.751
So you can't just have 1,
so let's rule that out.

00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:26.501
Now what about having 5 real roots?

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:30.630
That means that you would
have 2 non-real complex,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.328
adding up to 7, and that
of course is possible

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:36.322
because now you have a pair here.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:38.432
So I think you're
starting to see a pattern.

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:41.787
Essentially you can have
an odd number of real roots

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:44.366
up to and including 7.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.408
So for example,this is possible

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:47.985
and I could just keep going.

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:51.517
I could have, let's see, 4 and 3.

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:52.561
This is not possible

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:53.686
because I have an odd number here.

00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:55.594
You're going to have
to have an even number

00:02:55.594 --> 00:02:57.710
of non-real complex roots.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.758
So rule that out, but
then if we go to 3 and 4,

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:03.099
this is absolutely possible.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.261
You have two pairs of
non-real complex roots.

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:09.256
And then we can go to 2 and 5,

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.011
once again this is an odd number,

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:13.881
these come in pairs,
so this is impossible.

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:19.552
And then you could go to
1 real and 6 non-real.

00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:22.638
Completely possible,
this is an even number.

00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:24.951
And then finally, we could consider having

00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:28.755
0 real and 7 non-real complex

00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:30.397
and that's not possible because these

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:31.990
are always going to
come in pairs, so you're

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.596
always going to have an even number here.

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.085
So the possible number of real roots,

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:38.929
you could have 7 real roots, 5 real roots,

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.591
3 real roots or 1 real root

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.177
for this 7th degree polynomial.
