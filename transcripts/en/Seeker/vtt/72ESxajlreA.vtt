00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.959
*sneeze*
What the heck

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:07.150
*sneeze*
Why?!

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.949
*SNEEZE*
STOP IT.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.350
Sneezing is a thing we do, right?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.840
Everyone does it, it's a natural process,
but WHY?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.920
What's going on up in there?!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.650
A sneeze is a reaction to a foreign contaminant.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.160
The cilia -- or tiny hairs -- are detecting
something in your nasal passages that it needs

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.240
to GET OUT.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.030
Not just dust or a bit of pepper… sneezing
also removes bacteria, viruses and mucus;

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.510
medically it's called sternutation.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.170
Once your nose feels the contaminant, it sends
a signal through the trigeminal cranial nerve

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.960
to the ventromedial spinal trigeminal nuclei
and in the adjacent pontomedullary lateral

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.470
reticular formation in the brain -- we'll
just call it the sneeze center, it's near

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.470
the brain stem.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.470
The signals trigger a reaction to close your
eyes, mouth, and throat -- to build pressure

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.420
behind the vocal chords -- then when your
chest muscles squeeze REALLY fast, air, saliva

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.070
and mucus are shotgunned out of your nose
and mouth at a little less than 100 mph.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.860
With that mucosal propulsion, are about 100,000
microorganisms.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.280
Other than dust or foreign contaminants, the
sun can make you sneeze too!

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
It's called photic sneeze reflex -- OR Autosomal-dominant
Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic -- yes.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.810
That is now the nerdiest joke you know.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.210
Sunshine triggers sneezes in 10 to 35 percent
of the population, scientists think, because

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.920
that trigeminal nerve, which connects the
face to the brain, runs right NEXT to the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
optic nerve!

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.200
And sometimes when a bunch of light hits the
retina, the sudden flood of electrical energy

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.290
can overflow into the trigeminal nerve and
trigger a sneeze!

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.460
Some people sneeze when they pluck their eyebrows,
because of that trigeminal nerve; but even

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.830
more strange, is some people have been documented
to sneeze after sex, or because of a full

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.830
stomach!

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.310
Post-sneeze, the little cilia are highly active
for a few minutes, before calming back down.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.170
That’s why sometimes, one sneeze isn't enough.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.290
I swear, my Mom sneezes in odd numbers; threes
and fives.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.880
If you've heard of this, you're not crazy,
it's real, but it hasn't been studied much

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.060
-- mainly because it doesn't harm anyone.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.150
They know it might be genetic, and is predictable
in family groups -- with sneezes usually coming

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.620
in twos or threes.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.239
After a sneeze, people feel the need to SAY
something.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.239
Ancient peoples were noted as wishing people
well, and LOTS of other cultures still go

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.340
the health route: gesundheit, salud, bud zdorov,
bai sui, or saúde…

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.650
But in the sixth century, Pope Gregory the
Great started saying, "God Bless You," and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.710
that one stuck around in the West pretty good.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.830
We at DNews just say, "Science," because…

00:02:36.830 --> 00:03:09.870
I dunno... it seems silly to me to ward off
nose demons…
