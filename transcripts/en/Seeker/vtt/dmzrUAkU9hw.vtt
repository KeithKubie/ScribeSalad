00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.200
I went to college with a guy who was allergic
to peanut butter.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.799
I always felt bad he will never know the glory
of a PB&amp;J sandwich.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.870
If only there was a way to prevent allergies...

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.650
Hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.831
Can we really prevent allergies?

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:23.050
A new study from New England Journal of Medicine
suggests yes... maybe.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.660
The researchers found that babies who ate
peanuts could reduce their risk of developing

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.669
an allergy by 80%.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.890
This goes against what i’ve heard is the
current wisdom, that babies shouldn’t eat

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.080
peanuts until at least a year old.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.130
15 years ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics
told parents to make sure their kids avoid

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.130
peanuts.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.420
But they retracted that advice in 2008, and
said there was too little evidence to support

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
it.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.210
However researchers noticed a lower rate of
peanut allergy in Israeli children, who ate

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
peanuts regularly.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
They wondered if early consumption of peanuts
had anything to do with it.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
In the large study, researchers followed 600
infants between 4 and 11 months old.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
Some were told to avoid peanuts completely
others were told to eat 6 grams of peanut

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.420
protein a week.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.830
They found that in the group that avoided
peanuts, 14 of out of every 100 kids would

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.670
develop an allergy, but in the group that
eat peanuts regularly only 2 out of 100 would.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.890
The researchers however did not include infants
that already showed signs of a strong allergy

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.890
to peanuts.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.740
So don’t go too overboard with feeding little
johnny peanuts to get rid him of his allergies.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.980
Talk to your doctor before you try anything.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.570
But maybe you should make him wash some dishes.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.350
Another recent study published in the journal
Pediatrics, found that kids who grew up in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.299
a house where dishes were hand-washed, not
where they were sterilized in a dishwasher,

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.690
had fewer allergies.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.960
The kids also reportedly had reduced rates
of related illnesses like eczema, asthma,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.260
and hay fever.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.380
Not ready to give up your dishwasher just
yet?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.869
Maybe you should look into getting a pet!

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.530
Children who had two or more dogs or cats
had a reduction, up to 77 percent, of risk

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.580
of allergies, according to a study published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.310
These kids were also less allergic to other
things like dust and ragweed.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.740
So what’s going on?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.320
Well there’s a hypothesis that we’re too
clean.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.930
It’s called the hygiene hypothesis.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.720
The idea is that humans moving to a more sterile
environment led to the rise of certain diseases,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
like asthma.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.150
Basically your body is always trolling for
invaders.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.590
Trying to keep out infections and bad bacteria.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.010
But if our environment is too clean, there’s
less for the body to attack, so it turns on

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.730
benign things, like peanuts.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.390
It seems early exposure to potential allergens
actually prevents the allergy from developing.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.510
Early exposure trains your immune system and
not having these experiences might lead the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.310
immune system to overreact later in life,
hence nasty allergies.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.340
But we shouldn’t exactly throw out our dishwashers
and cover ourselves in dirt.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.569
Before the invention of proper hygiene techniques
a lot of people died from microbes, infections,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.569
parasites.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.890
Yeah, it was not a good time..

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.239
So it’s not a bad thing at all we keep things
clean.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.990
But maybe we might just have taken cleanliness
too far.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:04.480
To learn what’s going on when you’re allergic
to something, check out Tara’s video:

And we’ve got a link in the description
below if you wanna watch that full episode.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.410
So what do you think?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.550
Would lose your dishwasher if it meant fewer
allergies?

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.150
