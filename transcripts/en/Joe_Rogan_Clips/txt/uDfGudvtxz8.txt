Speaker 1:          00:00          But some stuff's real out. Well, I love the way you communicate this because it takes into consideration human nature. And like I loved Dawkins. He's fantastic. I think he's very, very, very valuable. But he likes to call people idiots. And the problem with that is people go, fuck you. You're an idiot. Like is a natural inclination when you insult people to argue back and to sort of dig their heels in. Yeah. And a, you don't do that. And I think that's very important. And I think that it kind guy like Dawkins just gets frustrated from all these years of debates with people who are uneducated, are saying ridiculous things and he's a bit of a curmudgeon, you know, when he seems to be softening as he's getting older. Well, he's an evolutionary biologist and that's the, the front line in some sense, isn't it? Yes, that is.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Yeah. I mean, you think about particle physics is that you don't get a lot of shit because people don't understand what you're talking about. Evolutionary your biologies. Right. That so I understand his frustration. Oh, I do too. Having said that, you know, I've kind of softened a bit over the years actually, because now I think at this point, both in the u s actually and in Britain and in some other countries, we are a, an a point, you've sort of alluded to it, where everybody's angry, there's a lot of anger and a lot of it is justified by the way, who could talk about that, you know, income inequality and all those things. So it's justified anger. But it seems to me that there are people of goodwill who need to band together to diffuse the anger. Now Society's otherwise we won't have countries like the United States.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Yes. As United States, cause it's United and everybody, and you've got the United, the American flag there. You know, there's a sense of belonging and identity and togetherness in a country which you've got to preserve. And so I've stopped actually, um, picking, I used to, for example, quite enjoy picking fights with Deepak Chopra on Twitter. You know, and it's just for me to laugh, you know, and you just do it and he says some crazy stuff, then he's end. But I've sort of, I've stopped doing it going well, but relative to some of the other people is a, he's someone who means it means well. Yes, I don't agree with virtually anything he says. However, he's a well meaning person. And so I've started trying to seek common ground now. That's why I get, for example, gave a talk to the bishop's asked me to call me.

Speaker 1:          02:22          I don't agree with them on the framework, their theological framework, but they mean well, most of them. Yeah. So I think seeking consensus and diffusion, anger, as you said, is it is incumbent on all of us, especially people like us who have a public voice. We need to diffuse some of this anger because otherwise it will consume everyone. Yes. I've, I've tried very hard to evolve in that respect and just get better at communicating ideas and get better at understanding how people receive those ideas. And I think that's, it's there's, it's easy to get lazy and to insult and to yeah. And he's fine. He's fine. Yeah. Well, especially me. I mean, I'm a comedian. That's part of what I do is insult people. Yeah. But I use it funny for humor. I want to entertain people. That's the whole idea behind it. But I think in terms of like discussing ideas especially that are so personal to people like religion.

Speaker 1:          03:17          I've, I've uh, I've reexamined the way I interpret these ideas and the way I owe. I talk about these things. Yeah. That's uh, it's interesting. There's a, I did a BBC program at age to, I was asked to do it on the, this thing called the wreath lunches at the BBC. The BBC had done to his 1952, I think it was. And Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53. And it was, it's fascinating. You can get the transcripts online, they're free and you can get one recording of the five they taped over the other four. Can you believe it? Why they raised them? Because they wanted to tape for something else. It's just unbelievable. But one of them exist often home are given these latches. Oh my God. I know. But you can read thick from Katie by more tapes and virtual veteran muscle didn't do the, they tapes over them.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Bertrand Russell's cause tape was so expensive, but he talks crazy. But it's brilliant. It's called science in the common understanding. And they weren't very well received because he thought it was going to talk about the Manhattan project. So they thought it was going to talk about the atom bomb. You know, cause he was, he ran it basically. But you didn't, you talked about how thinking like a scientist, which means thinking in the way that nature forces you to think can be valuable in other areas. And it's a, that's an insight in itself. The great thing, the unique thing about science, there's nature forces you to think like that. You can't have an opinion. Can I have an opinion about gravity? We jumped to build and you can hit the ground. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't matter what your opinion is. And he said, so if you think about, for example, quantum mechanics.

Speaker 1:          04:58          So, uh, sometimes you think of as Pascal, like an electron, sometimes it has to, it's a point like object may behave like a little Billy a bowl thing, the pool ball that bounces around, but sometimes it behaves like an extended thing, like a wavy thing and nature forces you to hold both ideas in your head at the same time in order to get a complete picture of the object there a description of an electron. And he said that's the valuable thing about quantum mechanics. You know, unless you're doing electronics, I'm inventing lasers and you don't need to know this stuff. But if you want to learn how to think, it's valuable to be forced to hold different ideas in your head at the same time. It's really teaching you not to be an absolutist straight teaching you the example he uses his, cause he was, I think he has had problems with McCarthy and all those things.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Didn't he say, you think he's still, he's writing in the 50s. So he said you can either be, you can be a communist, which in his definition would be that you think the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Right. So say society is all that matters. Oh, it could be a libertarian or right on the far conservative and where you think that the individual is the only thing that matters then that's it. But actually of course, to have a function in society, you need a mixture of the two and we can wait it one way or the other, but you need to hold both ideas in your head at the same time. And that's, he said that one of the most valuable things about science because it forces you into modes of thought that are valuable. And that's what we're talking about here, which is one of the absolute positions are always, uh, uh, uh, just uh, a blinkered sort of subsets of what's actually happening.

Speaker 1:          06:34          You can't understand the world by being an extremist. Yeah. You got to hold all these views in your head. Well that I find that so often on this podcast because I talk with people I agree with and disagree with and I always try to put myself in the head of the person that I disagree with. I will always try to figure out how they're coming to those conclusions are where they're coming from. Yeah. And I think it's so, it's so important to not be married to ideas. I got a conversation with someone about this and they said, sometimes you change your opinions a lot. I go, yeah, I do. I do. Because if he's a bad thing, I'm flip flopping. I'm not a politician. Like I'm not flip flopping. I'm thinking, yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Like I, I will have one opinion on a thing, whether it's a controversial thing, like universal basic income.

Speaker 1:          07:27          I'll change my mind 100% in two weeks. Yeah. I'll go, no, no, no, no. Now I think it's probably a good idea. Yeah. And then I'll go back and forth. No, no, no, no, no. People need about eight to his cruise. It seems they need motivation. They need. And I don't know, I bounce around with these things. Yeah. But I've tried really hard as I've gotten older to have less absolute opinions. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Richard Fineman, another great physicist or a similar essay at a similar time to Oppenheimer. And he also worked on the Manhattan project and it's called the value of science. And I think that was 1955 and they both shared actually, uh, uh, a surprise. I think that they were still alive because they thought that the power they'd given to the politicians, the atom bomb would destroy everything. They didn't think that the political system would control it.

Speaker 1:          08:11          And he did. So that's an emerging malleable thing. Yeah, we're still here. But in, in, in that essay, he said the, um, the, the, the most valuable thing about science is the realization that we don't know. And he said, he said in that statement equals signs a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, by the way. And he said in that statement is the open door, the open channel, he called it. So if we want to make progress, we have to understand that we don't know everything. And we have to leave things to future generations and we can be uncertain and we can change our minds. And he said that that's, that is a great last line. I can't exactly what he says, but he said it's something like it's our duty as scientists to communicate value of uncertainty and the value of freedom of thoughts to all future generations.

Speaker 1:          08:59          That's the point. That's what freedom of thought means. Freedom of thought means the freedom to change your mind. In fact said. That's what democracy is. If you think about it, democracy is a trial and error system. So it's the, it's the admission that we don't know how to do. It therefore will change. Every four years will change the president or every eight years will change the president. Why? Because the president who doesn't know how to do it. So someone that's there will be someone better that comes along and then someone worse and someone better, but it's a trial and error system and he's right and it is right that that is the open door. That's the, that's the road to progress is certainly better than humility. Yeah. One of the things that I love so much about Bertrand Russell and about Fineman was how human they were.

Speaker 1:          09:43          There were very human mean fireman, like the play, the bongos and chasing girls. And Bertrand Russell was addicted to tobacco. He would talk about how he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke. Like he had to get us was back when they had smoking sections on airplanes and he had his pipe and he just refused to fly without tobacco. He couldn't imagine being without tobacco. And like that's so strange for the Joe, a brilliant guide to be addicted to such a gross thing. Yeah, you're, you're right. Because I think these, these are people that found existence joyous. Right? They wanted to know, they just wanted to know stuff. They didn't want to know everything because you can't know everything. Right. Um, you know that I'm, I suppose that's what you think about what the job of a scientist is. It's to, it's to stand on the edge of the known because you're a research scientist.

Speaker 1:          10:32          So if there's nothing to know, then you've got no job. Right. So you have to be naturally comfortable with not knowing. And I, if there's one thing I really do think we was, how do we begin to patch our countries back off again? One of the reasons I think in education is to teach people the value of uncertainty, of not knowing it is not weak to not know. It's actually natural not to know. And that's one the problem is with religion is to say that you know when you do not, or to say that you have absolute truth and absolute knowledge of something. Yeah. When it can't really exist. Yeah.
