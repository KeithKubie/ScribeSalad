00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.540
WIL WILLIS: Gentlemen, your
(inaudible) spears look deadly.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.210
So let's find out if they
really are in our weapons test.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.830
Up first-- the kill test.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.710
Doug?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.960
DOUG MARCAIDA: Bladesmiths,
I will take your Zande spear

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.880
and deliver killing blows
on this ballistics stomach.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.880
Drew, you're up first.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.210
You ready?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.710
Let's make those
intestines out-testines.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.500
All right, let's do that.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.670
I like that.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.750
DREW (VOICEOVER): Right now,
I'm about to hear Doug say,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.080
it will kill.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.080
And that's the only
thing I'm here for.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.750
To help me out today, please
welcome back RJ Marcaida.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.880
He will have the pleasure of
wielding your Zande spear.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.500
All right, Drew.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.170
It feels very good in the hand.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.120
It lacerates deep when we
thrust into the chest cavity,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.790
into the heart.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.620
On its way out, not only does
it take some skin with it,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.080
but it also took out some ribs.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.210
Your tines right here
from the side entry--

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.120
the spear went all the way
through, and on its way out,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.750
it took everything
that was in its path.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210
But there is one issue.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.290
As you can see, your tip
right here broke off.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.120
But other than that, this
is a weapon that is deadly.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.380
And it will kill.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.880
Thank you.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.290
DOUG MARCAIDA: All
right, Jason, your turn.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.710
You ready?
- I know it'll cut.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620
It bit me four times making it.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.120
I'm thinking it's going
to wreck this thing's day.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.830
DOUG MARCAIDA: All right, Jason.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170
The balance of your
weapon feels good.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830
When it penetrated into the
chest cavity, it hit a rib

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.500
and broke it in half.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.670
Got into the heart, and there
was no edge damage on your tip.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.420
All these hooks
right here did what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.960
it's supposed to do-- into the
abdomen, ripped everything up.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.500
Even the barb.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.420
And the beautiful thing
about this is it will kill.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.620
Say hello to my
little friend here.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.540
Today, we're going to
test the overall strength

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.960
and construction of
your Zande spears by--

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.210
well, we're going to fire
'em out of this cannon

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.210
into this wood block wall.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.380
Now, I'm not
concerned about what

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.880
your spears do to the wall.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.710
I want to see how well your
spears survive the wall.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.120
Drew, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.290
No.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.540
Well, we're
gonna do it anyway.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.460
Let's do it.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.040
I don't even know what to think.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.670
This thing is gonna be launched.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.210
I'm scared.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.750
That worked really well, Drew.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.210
Despite the fact that you did
lose a little bit of your tip

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.080
in the kill test,
didn't have any effect

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.920
going into that block wall.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.380
Matter of fact, you sunk
all the way down here.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.710
Very impressive.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.920
Your shaft is fine.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.670
Nothing loosened
up, nothing cracked.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.080
Your spear head is still solid.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.750
Overall, survived.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.500
Very good.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.000
Thank you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.880
So Jason, what you thinking?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.420
Thinking, let's
make splinters.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.080
I'm a little bit worried
they're gonna shoot this thing

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.250
at a wall, and it could break.
We don't want that.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.620
J NEILSON: That's a problem.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.290
Oh god, no.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.540
I'm seeing it hang up I'm bit
on the barrel, and my heart

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.460
just absolutely sinks.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.420
Jason, we've got
a big problem here.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.250
The parameters that we
set for these weapons

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.960
are for testing purposes.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.620
Because your blade didn't meet
the inch and a half parameter

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.750
with a circular
cross-section, we cannot fit

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.460
the shaft of your
weapon down the barrel

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.040
of our testing apparatus here.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.960
And because we can't
test it evenly and fairly

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.080
with Drew's blade, I have to ask
you to please leave the forge.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.330
This was absolutely
worst-case scenario.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.920
Neither Drew nor I wanted
to see either of us going

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.620
out on something like this.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.830
I was over those
dimensions 100 times,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.500
and apparently somewhere
in there, there was

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500
one little spot that I missed.
