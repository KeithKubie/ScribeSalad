00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.480
Most machines of any degree of complexity, that we opt to live around.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.480
Are offered to us with an instruction manual.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.780
A guide to how the unfamiliar machine works.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.180
What we can except from it!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.820
How to get the best out of it!

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.900
And how to interpret its signals.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.980
The assumption being,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.280
that it would be so much easier and less enraging

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340
to deal with this machine,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.520
when we have taken some time systematically and patiently

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.000
to learn,  how it operates.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.080
And yet one area, when we tend not to have manuals to read

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.780
is when it comes to other people and their functioning.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
This causes us immense troubles.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.000
We going to relationship without any real sense

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.680
of where the others peculiarities will lie

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.840
and vice versa.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.420
We are wittingly proceed

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.300
as if operating another person might be an intuitive skill

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180
will just pick up along the way.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.020
It can take a painful decade or more

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
to work out the very basics.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.540
Mostly, human machines work in extremely odd ways.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.500
And yet tend not to explain, the origins of their madness.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.700
For example: They don't calmly lay out

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.320
that certain incidents in childhood

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.800
have given them a disposition to shout at airport,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.660
to be suspicious of authority

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020
or to be shifty in owning up to debts.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.800
We must work backwards, from outward behavior,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.280
to possible  causes,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.700
without any help, from the machines themselves.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.400
Sometimes, the signals are just completely confusing.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
"Fuck off, I really don't want to see you."

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.940
Turns out to mean:

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
I am so worried you don't want me

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.500
and I am getting in early with my revenge.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
Please tidy away your clothes

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.600
and put away the dishes.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.800
Might mean:

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.020
I am trying to control you procedurally

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.000
because I fell so out of touch with you emotionally.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100
We would safe so much time

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.100
if we knew how to give one another manuals, early on.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560
If we could explain:

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900
when I am hurt I go cold

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
or I am especially prone to be subservient,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.120
but then, resentful

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
or I get brutal when I am at most vulnerable.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.420
or I feel a need to talk about other possible lovers,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
because I feel so unattractive to you deep down.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.060
Instead, the weaknesses of machines

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.660
are usually discovered in a heat of conflicts.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.780
In context where they would have wounded the other person.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.920
And therefore

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.800
will be denied to the good will that might have ensured that could be forgiven.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.860
Many of the difficult patterns of behavior of human machines

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.500
have very sympathetic points of origin.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.420
But, once they have caused the partner humiliation

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.560
they are unlikely ever to be looked upon charitably.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.560
We don't need people to be perfect,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.280
We only need them to be able to see their faults,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.100
to teach us about them, when we are unthreatened

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.420
and to apologize for the difficulties they causes in good time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.820
In other words, the greatest, most loving and luxurious gift

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.920
any partner could ever give another

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.460
is an instruction manual.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.000
To their own rather tortured, odd

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.800
but ultimately, always really rather lovable soul.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
