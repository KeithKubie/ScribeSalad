00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.790
You see them at work, on the bus, I've even
seen them on airplanes.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:20.140
E-cigs are everywhere, are they REALLY that
awesome?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.929
E-cigarettes are everywhere and new studies
on vaping come out all the time.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.680
If somehow you're unfamiliar, vapes involve
three pieces, a battery, container of liquid,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.829
and a heating element.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.110
This simple device can be used to deliver
everything from tobacco or THC to flavored

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.850
mists and caffeine.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.780
The Vapor Market in the U.S. hit an estimated
2.5 billion dollars -- 60 percent of which

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.460
was just for customizable mods and juices.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.970
Over the last five years, aggressive marketing,
and limiting of the cigarette market has caused

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.080
the market to explode.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.190
That being said, there are precious few regulations
or studies exploring what vaping is doing

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.900
to the inside of users, especially over the
long term; and NO studies on long-term exposure

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.030
in living animals.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.670
The American Heart Association weighed in
last May -- and it wasn't awesome for fans

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.240
of vaping -- you can check out Laci's video
for some background on that, but since then

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.310
-- more has come to light.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.190
The latest study to ROCK the vaping world
comes out of Johns Hopkins - researchers exposed

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.640
mice to vapor from e-cigs.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.710
To do so, they used a modified smoking machine
which inhaled for 2 seconds once every 10

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.710
seconds.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.400
Other studies have found smokers showed a
biomarker called cotinine; so they exposed

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.340
the mice to a concentration of nicotine that
would produce similar nicotine biomarkers

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.100
to a heavy smoker.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.240
They even measured the entirety of the vapor
and mixed it with filtered air before exposing

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.370
the mice for 1.5 hours a day total over two
weeks.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.670
They also exposed some mice to just regular
air.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.360
They found there are over 700 billion particulate
free radials per puff of a vape.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.810
Normally, free radicals are a product of heating,
so these are actual particles that will enter

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.940
the lungs and QUOTE "could be potentially
toxic to cells."

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.160
Though more research is needed to determine
that toxicity.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.620
Aside from that, they exposed the mice to
the bacteria which cause pneumonia, or the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.239
influenza virus -- our little friend the flu.

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.019
As you've probably guessed, this study doesn't
go well for vapes, the lead researcher says

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.819
the lungs ARE definitely affected by the chemicals
in liquid nicotine e-cigs.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.349
The mice who were vaping had lung inflammation
and protein damage; and when exposed to infection

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.659
their defenses were significantly reduced.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.969
The mice were unable to clear bacteria from
their lungs, and those with the flu experienced

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.959
weight loss and some died!

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.909
It's important to point out, this is one type
of vape, there are many iterations and mods

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.889
available which might change the results -- and
they each require their own scientific scrutiny.

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.739
Studies have conclusively shown, however,
that vapor DOES contain free radicals, formaldehyde,

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.939
and other carcinogens.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.279
On average, e-cigs contain only 1-percent
the number of chemicals of an average cigarette,

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:03.290
but even THAT surprised the researchers since
manufacturers claim otherwise.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.939
In the end, the scientific community and the
regulatory community are still trying to figure

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.050
this crap out.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.749
Queen Mary University of London published
a piece in Addiction which said regulating

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.530
e-cigs the same way as tobacco isn't necessary
because of their vast differences.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.599
At the same time, both the American Heart
Association and Food and Drug Administration

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.609
encourage cigarette-like regulations!

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.989
Frankly, the medical community is very clear;
in comparison to smoking cigarettes, vaping

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.810
IS better, but that doesn't mean it gets a
gold star.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.389
Looks like science has some work to do.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.389
What do you think?

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.329
We followed up on this because Nexy_Dre and
Saurini wanted to know more!

00:03:41.329 --> 00:04:01.299
If you have anything you want to know 
about tell us!
