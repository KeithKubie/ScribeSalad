00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.519
The variety of sushi served with raw sea food
has given rise to the notion that sushi is

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.900
any dish served with raw fish.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.109
In fact though, sushi is more often than not
served in the western world with fully cooked

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.430
sea food, including: cooked imitation crab
(California roll); smoked salmon (Seattle

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.360
roll); grilled squid or octopus; fully cooked
shrimp; and fully cooked clam.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.050
It is also often served with fried and battered
sea food of varying types.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.750
There are also a variety of vegetarian sushi
dishes, including the very popular maki (cucumber

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.750
rolls).

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.010
Perhaps the reason sushi is so strongly thought
of as “raw fish” in the western world

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.450
is that, whatever the toppings, it is commonly
served cold.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.110
Also, the general idea of raw fish isn’t
exactly to the liking of most westerners conceptually,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.280
so that form of sushi stood out more when
it was first introduced; giving rise to the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.100
notion that sushi was any dish that included
raw fish.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.790
The term sushi, literally means “it’s
sour”, and comes from an ancient grammatical

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.350
form that is no longer used in other contexts.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.040
The “sour” description comes from the
ancient way of preparing sushi by fermentation

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.000
of meat, generally sea food, packed in rice
with salt used as a preservative.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.900
The vinegar produced from the fermenting rice
ends up breaking down the fish meat into amino

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900
acids.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.000
This, in turn, results in a strong umami flavor,
which is one of the five basic tastes the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.840
human tongue can detect.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
Once the meat was properly fermented, thus
preserved, the rice would then be discarded

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.360
and only the meat itself would be eaten.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.229
Basically, it was just a handy way to preserve
meat before ice boxes and refrigerators.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.869
Modern forms of sushi are not typically prepared
in this way and the rice is now the main part

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:53.909
of the meal.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.480
Around the Muromachi period (1336-1573 AD),
they began adding vinegar, which aided in

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.920
preserving the food and in improving the flavor.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.790
Eventually, this lead to the fermentation
process being shortened and ultimately abandoned

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.700
in favor of just eating it right away with
the rice.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.060
A few centuries later, osaka and sushi combined
to form oshi-zushi.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.050
In this type of sushi, various types of sea
food and rice are pressed using molds.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.489
This eventually led to the version of sushi
created by Hanaya Yohei, in the 19th century,

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.659
which most of the world thinks of as “sushi”
today.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.659
In this form, the sushi can be prepared extremely
quickly and eaten with one hand, making it

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:48.730
one of the earliest forms of fast food.
