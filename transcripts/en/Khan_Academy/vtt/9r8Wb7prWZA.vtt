00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
We're on problem 70.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:17.530
If x plus 5 is greater than 2,
and x minus 3 is less than 7,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.055
the value of x must be between
which of the following pairs

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:21.300
of numbers?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630
Well for this top one, let's
just subtract 5 from both

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.495
sides of this equation.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.710
If you subtract 5 from both
sides, you get x is greater

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
than, what's 2 minus 5, x
is greater than minus 3.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.970
For this bottom one, let's
add four to both

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.720
sides of the equation.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.150
So x minus 3-- sorry,
lets add 3 to both

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.045
sides of this equation.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:45.430
So x minus 3 plus 3, that's x,
is less than, what's 7 plus 3?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.410
10.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
So x is greater than minus 3--
I just wrote this the other

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.610
way around-- and it's
less than 10.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.890
So that's A.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.000
Problem 71, a gym class can be
divided into 8 teams with an

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.480
equal number of players on each
team-- 8, that means you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.130
get an equal number-- or into 12
teams with an equal number

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.380
on each team.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.000
Fair enough.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330
What is the lowest possible
number of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.040
students in the class?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.640
So essentially it's saying, that
the number of students in

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.600
the classes is divisible
by both 8 and 12.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.580
So what they want to know is,
what's the smallest number

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.390
that's divisible by
both 8 and 12.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.330
That's the least common
multiple of 8 and 12.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.600
That might ring a bell
from middle school.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.490
So what's the smallest number
that's divisible by 8 and 12?

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980
So let's think about
8's multiples.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.510
8 is indivisible by 12.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.740
16 is indivisible by 12.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.950
What about 24?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.390
Well yeah, sure, 24 is
divisible by 12.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.430
So the least common multiple
is 24, which is B.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.210
Clearly you can divide a gym
class into 3 groups of 8, or 2

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.170
groups of 12.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.040
72.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.610
At least 2/3 of the 40 members
of a committee must vote in

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.595
favor of a resolution
for it to pass.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170
What is the greatest number of
members who could vote against

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.490
the resolution and still
have it to pass?

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.030
So essentially they're saying,
what is the least number that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.120
we need to have it pass, and
then 40 minus that is the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.220
greatest number that could
vote against it.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.090
So we have to have at
least 2/3 of 40.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
So what's 2/3 times 40?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.280
Well that's equal to 80/3.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580
That's 3 goes into 80,
let's figure it out.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.330
3 goes into 8 2 times.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.890
2 times 3 is 6, 20.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.640
3 goes into 20 6 times.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.600
6 times 3 is 18.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.040
You bring down a
2 and then a 0.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460
So it's going to just
keep repeating.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.440
So you have to have at least
26.6 people vote for it.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.330
But clearly you can't have
a 0.6 person vote for it.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.150
26 people isn't going
to be good enough.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.340
So you need at least
27 people.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.920
So if 27 are going to
vote for, how many

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.330
going to vote against?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.620
Well that means 40 minus
27, that means 13

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.440
against, which is E.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.750
That is the greatest number.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.090
Because if a larger number voted
against it, you would

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.660
have less people
voting for it.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.490
Problem 73.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.480
In the Johnson's monthly budget,
the dollar amounts

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.303
allocated to household expenses,
food-- so I'll say h

00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:02.010
for household expenses, f for
food-- and miscellaneous

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.960
items, are in the ratio of
5:2:1-- fair enough--

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.870
respectively.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.180
If the total amount allocated
to these three categories is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.100
$1,800, so $1,800 is the total,
what is the amount

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.280
allocated to food?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.840
So we could view it this way.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.890
So food is going to be twice
times miscellaneous, and

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.420
household items is going to
be equal to 5 times the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.670
miscellaneous.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.750
So we could say that household
plus food plus miscellaneous

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.830
is going to be equal to $1,800
This ratio tells us that food

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.170
is 2 times miscellaneous,
household is 5 times

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.896
miscellaneous.

00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:54.120
So let's just substitute
that in.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.020
5 times miscellaneous plus 2
times miscellaneous plus

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.965
miscellaneous is equal to $1,800
Let's see, 5 plus 2 is

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.750
7 plus 1 is 8.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.710
8 times miscellaneous is equal
to $1,800 So m is equal to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.780
$1,800 over 8.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.010
Let's see, what does
that turn into?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:24.670
That is equal to 900 over 4,
which is equal to 450 over 2.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.610
That's how my brain works,
I have to go in steps.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.110
What's 450 divided by 2?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.850
That's 225.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.480
That's miscellaneous.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.340
They want to know how much
is allocated to food.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.846
Well, food is 2 times
miscellaneous.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:47.590
So 2 times 225 is equal
to, we're back at 450.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.035
And that is choice D.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.350
Problem 74.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.640
There are 4 more women
than men on

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.110
Centerville's Board of Education.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.740
So 4 more women, so women
is equal to men plus 4.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.820
If there are 10 members on the
board, how many are women?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.030
So we know that men plus
women is equal to 10.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.850
We want to solve for women.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.580
So let me solve for men here,
then substitute there.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.000
So you get men is equal
to 10 minus the women.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.890
We could substitute
that back there.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.530
We get women is equal to m, or
the men, which we just figured

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.490
out is 10 minus the
women plus 4.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.800
My brain was jumping ahead.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.970
So let's add w to both sides.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.460
So you get 2w is equal to 10
plus 4, which is equal to 14.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.655
w is equal to 7.

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:58.130
There are seven women on
the board, so that's D.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.270
Problem 75.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.865
After this video, I think I'm
going to call it for a night

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:03.590
and go watch a movie
or something.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.620
75.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.280
Leona bought a 1 year $10,000
certificate of deposit that

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.340
pays interest at an
annual rate of 8%.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.520
So 1 year, $10,000, and
it paid a rate of 8%.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.540
Compounded semi-annually, what
was the total amount of

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.280
interest paid on the certificate
at maturity?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.360
So when you say compound
semi-annually, that means you

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.080
collect half of the interest
every half year.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.000
That's something I don't know
if the GMAT, they should be

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.010
expecting you to know that, it's
something you probably

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.250
would learn in business
school.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:56.020
But anyway, so after 6 months
you're going to get 4% on the

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.800
original amount.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.840
So you're going to have
$10,000 dollars.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.720
And you're going to 4%
percent of this.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.850
So they're going to owe you--
compounded semi-annually, what

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.690
was the total amount of
interest paid on the

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.400
certificate at maturity?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.890
So they're going to pay you
$10,000 times half of it,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.980
because only six months
have gone by.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.330
8% is for the full year.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.050
So for half the year, you're
going to get times 4%.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.110
So let's see, $10,000 times
4%, what is that?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:37.360
$10,000 times 0.04.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.879
Let's look at it this way, 4
times $10,000 is $40,000.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:49.150
We have two numbers behind the
decimal place, so it's $400.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.010
So they're going to
pay you $400.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.480
So then you can view
it essentially,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.660
they owe you $10,400.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.920
That's essentially how
much they borrowed.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.190
Because they're not going to
give it to you just then.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.240
You're going to get all your
money back at the end.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.710
So at the end, they're going to
have to pay you another 4%.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.750
But this time, it's not going
to be off of the $10,000.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.220
It's going to be off
of the $10,400.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.020
So $10,400 times 0.04.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.140
4 times 0 is 0.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.920
4 times 0 is 0.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.910
4 times 4 is 16.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.240
4 times 0 is 0 plus 1 is 1.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.260
4 times 1 is 4.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.980
Then we have two numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.190
So now they're going to pay you
$416, the second payment.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.890
What was the total amount
of interest?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:51.500
So it's going to be $416 plus
$400, which is $816,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.120
which is choice C.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.390
I'm a little surprised that they
expect you to know what

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.110
compounding semi-annually
means.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.830
But since it's there, I guess
you should know it.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.380
When it compound semi-annually,
it means that

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.190
each semi-annual point in time,
you divide the annual

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.610
interest rate by 2, and
you get that much.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.500
But then the next interest you
get is off of, not just the

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.180
initial amount, but the initial
amount plus the

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.330
previous interest, because they
haven't paid you yet.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.500
But anyway, I hope you don't
find that too confusing.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.740
You might want to look it
up on the internet.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.720
You could also compound
monthly, or daily, or

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.180
continuously.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.350
I actually have a couple of
videos on the Khan Academy.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.840
But anyway, I'm all out of time,
so I'll see you in the

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.300
next video.
