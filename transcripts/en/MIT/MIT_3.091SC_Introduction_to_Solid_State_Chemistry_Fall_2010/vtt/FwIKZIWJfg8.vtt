00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.260
Hi there.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.710
Welcome.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.590
I'm Brian Spatocco.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.570
We're going to be going
over exam 2 from

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.590
the fall 2009 semester.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.420
The logical place to start on
this exam is problem 1.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
And what I usually do for all
the problems is discuss the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.740
things we need to know
before we start it.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.130
So I would recommend reviewing
these concepts before

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.890
attempting the problem.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.510
And then attempt the
problem and then

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.960
identify your weak spots.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.030
So here's what I personally
found to be important

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.300
information to know before
attempting the problem.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.810
So I call it what I need, (W
I N), if you want to win.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.870
There's four things.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.230
The first are Miller Indices.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.170
This is a crystallographic
notation for figuring out and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.840
communicating planes and
directions in crystals.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840
So review Miller Indices

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.420
We have plane/direction
notation.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.870
I'll explain a little bit more
what that is in a second.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.150
Definition of planar density.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.460
And for that matter, linear and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.380
three-dimensional density as well.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.630
And 4, the concept of
a crystal basis.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.700
And this is actually the concept
that most students had

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.250
trouble with on this particular
question.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.520
So those are the things I would
recommend you look at

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.070
before starting.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.280
And if you haven't,
check it out now.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
So let's start off with
part a of problem 1.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.650
And so the question asks us to
draw the crystallographic

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.410
feature indicated and
label it clearly.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.030
It doesn't actually say if
we're drawing planes or

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.780
directions and that's left to
the exam taker to identify.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.090
So the first thing I note on
that problem, part a, is that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.580
we're asked to draw
0, 1 bar, 2 bar.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.300
And 1 1 1 bar.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.980
So the first thing I notice
about these two particular

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.190
crystallographic features
is how they're actually

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.840
encapsulated.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.720
So the first one is
in parentheses.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.030
The next one is in
square brackets.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.410
That actually tells us some
information about the problem.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.940
The first part, a part one,
is 0 1 bar 2 bar.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.940
So you actually need to know
what this implies.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.240
Parentheses mean we're looking
at a particular plane

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.060
orientation.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.400
Now I'm not saying a plane.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.700
I'm saying a plane
orientation.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.850
Which means there are infinitely
many planes in a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.270
crystal which have
this orientation.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.420
OK so that's distinguishing
between just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.350
one plane and a crystal.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.710
The second part, b, we
have square brackets.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.920
That implies we're either
looking at a direction or a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.420
place in a crystal.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.480
We also have things like this,
which we're not seeing on the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.200
exam this time but may
show up later.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.480
We have these curly brackets
and we have

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.470
these angled brackets.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.010
The curly brackets denote
a family of planes.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.070
And the angled brackets denote
a family of directions.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.230
And it's markedly different
than a particular or plane

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.560
orientation and a particular
direction.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.330
So let's do some visuals here
to explain what we mean.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.220
So let's start off with a 1.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.250
Now we're asked for
0 1 bar 2 bar.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.170
Now the bars indicate
negative signs.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.070
So you would know that from your
Miller Indices review.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.430
Now the way to do
this problem--

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.540
what I find is the easiest way
we reviewed in recitation--

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.430
was to not be afraid to
move your origin.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.200
A lot of people are afraid to
move their origin around but

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.250
we have to remember in a
crystal, basically what a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.890
crystal is, it's a unit lattice
repeated infinitely in

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.460
three dimensions.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.920
So it's OK to move your origin
as long as you choose some

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.830
reasonable point.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.090
So in this problem we're looking
in the back bottom

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.600
left corner.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.250
That's our defined origin
on the paper.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.020
But to do this problem,
I would recommend

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.810
choosing a new origin.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.410
I chose this one.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.170
And that's really going to
facilitate doing this problem

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.130
a lot more easily.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.280
So let's look at what
we have to dran now.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.790
0 1 bar 2 bar.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.730
The 0 indicates that we're never
actually intersecting

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.020
the x-axis.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.680
OK, so at no point
will this plane--

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.710
we know it's a plane because
the parentheses--

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.500
intersect the x-axis.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.730
The 1 bar indicates that we are
intersecting the y-axis at

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.130
1 lattice parameter spacing.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.550
Miller Indices are a little
tricky because they're

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.270
somewhat inverted.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.520
1 implies you are
going the full

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.530
distance of the unit cell.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.820
2 implies you're going
half the distance.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.530
3 implies you are going
1/3 the distance and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.180
so on and so forth.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.353
So for 1, we're going to
go the distance of 1.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.060
We're going to move
negative 1 in y.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.340
So we're going to
move negative 1.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.410
We're going to go to here.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.010
That's in our y.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.120
And when we actually make
this a little clearer.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.640
I've chosen a new origin.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.930
So here's my y prime.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.110
Here's my z prime.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.700
Here's my x prime.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.020
So we're moving negative
1 and y.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.320
We're going to move half,
negative 1/2 and z.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.090
And we're also told that
this plane doesn't

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.120
intersect the x-axis.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.270
So it must run parallel
to that asix.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.000
Which tells me that it's going
to run along the x-axis.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.042
We're going to get a
plane like this.

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:38.292
And here's our plane.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.220
That's the answer to part a 1.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.890
Pretty easy and most students
got this correct.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.340
For part a 2 we're asked to draw
a direction or point to a

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.440
particular place in space.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.390
I also moved my origin
on this problem.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.100
And I found it easiest to
redefine my origin up here.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.370
Which means that my new set
of axes are going to

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.630
be x prime, y prime.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.900
I'm going to keep z because
z didn't move at all.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.170
OK note how, when I'm drawing
these things--

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.490
we're going to draw
this one now--

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.420
that the way I choose to move
my origin generally tracks

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.380
with the negative signs that I
have. This problem I had a

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.860
negative y and negative z, I
moved in the negative y,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.600
negative z directions.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.780
Here I had a negative z.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.910
So I just moved up in
the negative z.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.230
That kind of told me how
to move my origin.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.050
It made life a little easier.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.910
And now it's pretty
easy from here.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.742
Now what we're going to do is
draw 1 in the x, we'll go 1 in

00:06:42.742 --> 00:06:45.450
the y, we'll go negative
1 in z.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.510
We're pointing to this point.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.380
There we go.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.880
That's our direction.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.860
So pretty easy.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.580
Part a 1.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.940
Part a 2.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.460
So we're batting
100 right now.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.630
And just don't be afraid
to move your origin.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.990
That's the take-away
from this part.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.290
The problem, of course,
gets a little harder.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.360
That's something that we pride
ourselves on in 3.091.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.375
If it was always this easy,
everyone would pass the class

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:12.530
and get 100s.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.200
So the second part, part b, is
asking us to calculate the

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.710
density of atoms in a plane.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.240
So this gets back to what
I was saying before.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.920
We need to understand the

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.800
definition of a planar density.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.470
OK, so I've sort of
defined it here.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.810
This is rho.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.650
Not p. rho planar.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.770
And rho planar, I define--

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.800
to help me, maybe
it'll help you--

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.780
is the number of full atoms
in a particular plane--

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.130
in this case we're looking
at 0 0 1--

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.650
divided by some area.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.280
Because the plane is denoted
by an area not a volume.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.350
Don't be afraid, I mean
densities don't always have to

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.580
be mass over volume.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.520
It can be some unit
over some specific

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.330
distance or area or volume.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.750
So that's general density.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.590
So we're looking at the number
of full items in a plane

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.730
divided by the area.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.420
We're told that we're looking
at Dalium, of course named

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.770
after Salvador Dali.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.640
And so we're also told
that we're looking

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.960
at the 0 0 1 plane.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.250
I've drawn a bcc crystal here.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.220
As a scientist or an engineer,
when you're given a bcc fcc,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.620
simple cubic, the first thing
you put on that paper is the

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.500
actual crystal structure.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.860
So I drew the Dalium up here.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.100
Not a real element, but
a make-believe one.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.360
And we're going to identify
our 0 0 1 plane.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.090
This is good practice.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.670
So there's our x, y and
our z is right here.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.030
Our 0 0 1 plane, so we're
not intersecting x.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.220
We're not intersecting y.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.090
We're only intersecting z.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.710
So here's our 0 0 1 plane.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.660
Let me sort of bring
this down for you.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.500
So we can look down
on it from above.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.250
It's a square, with sides a.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:03.070
And here's our atoms. So now the
question is, how many full

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.080
atoms do we have and
what's the area?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.030
The area's obviously
a squared.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.490
And the number of full atoms in
this area is we have four

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.690
quarters of an atom.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.270
When you're in two-dimensional
space an atom looks like a

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.280
circle to you.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.470
When you're in three-dimensional
space it

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.680
looks like a sphere.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.000
So if you lived in the
two-dimensional plane, you

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.030
would see a quarter of an
atom, a quarter of an

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.850
atom, and so on.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.810
You'd have one full atom
in this plane.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.660
So this is sort of what
we're looking for.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.940
And you say, oh,
well I'm done.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.180
A lot people left it at that.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.840
But that's not the answer
we're looking for.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.340
We want an actual numerical
answer.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.550
So the question now becomes,
what is a?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.980
So we're going to digress and
find a and then we'll know

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.780
exactly the answer to
the planar density.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.620
So a--

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.500
this is where you have to
be a little clever.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.710
How do you find a?

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.350
The lattice parameter,
the lattice spacing.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.620
So the best way to do this is to
think both small scale and

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.550
large scale.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.720
So first let's think
about a unit cell.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.510
Let me ask you, what's
the three-dimensional

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.390
density of a unit cell.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.300
So how many atoms do we
have per unit cell?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.130
We have our bcc.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.500
We know in bcc there are two
atoms. We have eight corner

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.050
atoms and they're each 1/8.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.370
We have one body atom.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.640
So there's two atoms. So
we have 2 atoms per--

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.010
what's the volume--

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.522
well the volume is a cubed.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.350
Now we got a cubed.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.170
We didn't really make any
progress here, we still have

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.970
an unknown variable.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.560
But the question is, how do
we get solved for a cubed.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.700
So let's zoom out from
that unit cell.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.500
Let's zoom out to a
mole of material.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.610
OK, so a mole of material,
how many atoms are

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.700
in a mole of material?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.350
Well by definition, it's
Avogadro's Number.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.320
6.02 times 10 to the 23.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.120
And then what's the volume
of a mole of material?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.530
Well looking back at
the problem, we're

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.620
given the molar volume.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.830
Which is something that I would

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.230
recommend you write down.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.230
You know all the information
you're given,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.780
see what you've got.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.200
The volume of a mole
is the molar

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.250
volume, which we're given.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.450
So now it's pretty easy.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.510
We know Avogadro's, we
know molar volume.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.830
So we can solve for a.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.430
So not too bad.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:36.570
You'll find that a is about 2.8
times 10 to the negative 8

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.250
centimeters.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.020
You could give me 2.85, 2.79.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.420
We're worried about
the concepts

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.620
here, not the numbers.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.110
So don't go back and
waste a lot of time

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.700
getting the exact number.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.690
That's our a.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.450
And now that we've got a, we've
got our planar density.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.390
Very easy.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.370
I'm going to write rho plan,
just to save some time.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.235
And that equals 1 over
this number squared.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.350
That's one atom, by the way.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.860
And that's all squared.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.950
And we're going to find in the
end that our planar density is

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.870
going to be equal to 1.27
times 10 to the 15.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.220
And the units are important.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.335
That's atoms per centimeter,
squared.

00:12:29.335 --> 00:12:31.670
If you don't give us the units
then we have no idea if you're

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.710
right or wrong.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.450
So always include your
units at the end.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.950
So hopefully that helped.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.070
We're going to take a second
and clean off the boards.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.320
And we're going to start
with part c.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.390
OK we're back.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.650
We're going to finish problem
1 now from the 2009 exam 2.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.330
We're on part c.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.190
So thus far in part a, we've
talked about Miller Indices,

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.380
we've talked about the plane
and direction notation with

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.260
the parentheses and
the brackets.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.990
We've also talked about
planar density.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.010
And I would invite you to
review those things.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.960
Now we're going to go to part c,
which is really the concept

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.170
of the crystal basis.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.840
And this was the part of the
problem that most students

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.680
lost points on.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.890
So it's the thing that
I would emphasize the

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.150
most on this problem.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.530
The problem asks us to--

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.840
and I put a sad face because
that's how people felt after

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.770
this part--

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.320
the problem asks us to
draw a particular

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.830
plane in a fcc crystal.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.190
So we're given Magnesia, MgO.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.600
They want us to draw that plane
and show the atoms. And

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.670
we also want you to show the
relative sizes of the atoms.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.650
You know we have anions
and cations.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.760
And we actually give you the
sizes of those ions, so it

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.660
shouldn't be too tricky
on that part.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.890
But I think the best way to
start is to go over the answer

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.400
that was given that was wrong.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.300
And then we're going to talk
about why it was wrong and how

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.660
to get the right answer.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.690
So to start off, we want you
to draw this crystal.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.130
The best place to start is by
actually drawing the crystal

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.590
in 3-D and then we're
going to take the

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.650
projection after that.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.320
So people think, MgO, they see
fcc, and they say, oh that's

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.020
not so bad.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.860
I know what fcc looks like.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.190
Let me draw fcc.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.430
I'm going to use for this
problem, I'm going to use this

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.235
red chalk to represent magnesium
and the blue chalk

00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:24.150
to represent oxygen.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.310
OK so magnesium, we're
going to have it as

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.350
a circle like this.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.362
This is magnesium, 2 plus.

00:14:32.362 --> 00:14:34.850
And we're going to
have the oxygen--

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.510
it's going to be slightly bigger
because it's an anion.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.850
This is O 2 minus.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.190
Maybe I'll color this in too.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.880
People said, OK easy. fcc.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.380
This is a simple problem,
easy points.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.895
They drew what they thought
to be an fcc crystal.

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:53.960
So they did--

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.575
let's say they put the
Mgs on the corners.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.470
And they said, OK now
I need my faces.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.040
So maybe the oxygen
are the faces.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.840
So I'm going to put in my 6 face
atoms. So here are my 1

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.490
side here, and I've got the
bottom and the top.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.200
There's my 6 faces.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.440
And they said, OK, easy.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.290
I'm done.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.380
And then they took the
projection of 0 1 1.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.230
We also know, when you
put the axes on here

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.720
just to make it clear.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.990
And here's our z, You know
0 1 1, we know it doesn't

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.110
intersect the x but it
intersects the y and the z at

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.580
one lattice spacing.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.370
So x doesn't intersect.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.000
It intersects z here,
intersects y here's.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.750
We've got this kind of
plane going on here.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.850
We've got something like this.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.200
And they just drew this.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.430
It's a little bit of 3-D
visualization But they drew

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.010
that and they got 0 points.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.350
The reason that that is not a
correct answer is because that

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.230
is not what MgO-- it's rock salt
structure-- that's not

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.340
what it looks like.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.260
And the reason they got it wrong
is because they didn't

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.650
understand the concept
of the basis.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.780
So I'm going to make a
statement right now.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.410
This is a really important
statements so I urge you to

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.760
think about it.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:21.430
A crystal equals a lattice
plus a basis.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.700
Here's the difference.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.110
A lattice is a collection
of points.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.670
So you have an fcc lattice, you
have a bcc lattice, you

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.200
have a simple cubic lattice.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.900
Those are points where atoms--

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.040
I use atoms plurally,
perhaps--

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.150
can exist.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.360
OK, a basis I like to
think of as a stamp.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.210
A basis represents the most
fundamental pattern that you

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.180
stamp at every lattice point.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:51.070
So let's draw an fcc lattice.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.870
So I'm going to drawn
an fcc lattice on

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.370
this cube right here.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.360
I'm going to put points.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.510
So I'm going to make
them white.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.060
They're just points.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.272
I got all the corners.

00:17:01.272 --> 00:17:02.130
They're hard to see.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.600
But they're all the corners.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.870
I got the faces.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.200
Side, back, front and bottom.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.620
You're saying to yourself,
that's like the same

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.050
thing you just drew.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.470
It's really not.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.590
What I drew the first time,
I put atoms in.

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.350
That's a crystal I drew.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.460
I just a lattice right now.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.440
This isn't a crystal,
this is a lattice.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.440
So to actually answer the
question, we want to figure

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.030
out, we want to draw the 2-D
projection of a crystal.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.680
So we've got to draw the
crystal eventually.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.280
Now we're dealing with MgO.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.240
We're told MgO is face-centered
cubic.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.240
Which means that our basis must
have 1 Mg and 1 O atom.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.980
So I'm going to do
that right now.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.630
I'm going to draw what I'm going
to call to be my stamp.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.020
You can use whatever method you
think is best. But I call

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.320
this my stamp.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.570
I'm going to draw
it like this.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.150
So here's an oxygen atom.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.150
Here's a Magnesium atom.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.000
And this little white dot
is the point that's

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.140
going to get stamped.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.800
And here's my stamp.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.460
And the idea is I'm going to
take the stamp, this basis--

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.920
that's what it is,
it's a basis--

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.550
and I'm going to stamp it
at every lattice point.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.580
OK so note I have 8 corner
lattice points and I have 6

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.000
face lattice points so I'm going
to be stamping 14 times.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.210
So I'll do the first
couple very slowly.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.500
I'll take my stamp and
I'll stamp here.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.130
Here is my O.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.630
Here's my Mg.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.200
I'll stamp over at
this corner.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.460
Here's my O, here's my Mg.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.890
I'll stamp in the face.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.840
Here's the face, the
front face one.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.070
Here's my O, here's my Mg.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.332
So you can see what's
happening.

00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:48.910
Let me just circle it for you.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.060
I'll circle one of them.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.310
Here's my stamp.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.790
I'm going to go ahead,
I'm going to finish

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.490
drawing this in.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.030
It's going to get a little
messy for a board.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.420
But I hope that you can go home
and do it on some graph

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.670
paper as well.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.716
All four corners.

00:19:08.716 --> 00:19:10.030
The face is here.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.600
I have a tendency to leave
off faces sometimes.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.456
Let me make sure I've
got them all.

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:18.706
I already did that one.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.380
Yep that's right.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:25.870
Is that right?

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.210
No.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.480
OK, now let me finish with the
magnesiums. The magnesiums--

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.440
it's going to be hard to
see-- exist at the

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.690
center of every edge.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.370
So it's a little tricky but
let me explain what we're

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.000
looking at.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.210
What you should be looking at.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.050
We have what looks to be oxygen
in the face center

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.210
cubic arrangement.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.740
And we have magnesium
at all the edges.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.910
So you're thinking,
this is weird this

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.190
isn't face center cubic.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.010
Look at the magnesium,
this doesn't

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.360
look face center cubic.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.020
Well the thing I would challenge
you to do at home is

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.060
actually draw this unit
cell out 4 more times.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.260
And then you will actually be
able to find face center cubic

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.790
magnesium lattic cell in
that larger unit cell.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.320
So this is actually
the answer.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.120
This is what a rock salt
structure looks like.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.450
This is MgO.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.690
You have oxygen,
looks like your

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.240
traditional face center cubic.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.620
And you've got these magnesium
stuck on all the edges.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.790
So now we're just going to
take our projection.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.870
Let me use white
chalk for that.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.420
Or rather we're going
to take our plane.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.690
We're looking at the
0 1 1 plane.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.950
Here's our axes again.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.200
Remember it's always
right-handed.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.850
We're going to do 0 1 1.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.090
Not intersecting the
x and were going to

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.530
intersect z and y.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:51.810
So we're going to come
down across the face.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.940
We've got this.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.260
This is pretty terrible
looking.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.180
But this is one of the tricks
of the problem.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.310
You have to be able to visualize
these in 3-D space.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.960
So let's slowly transcribe what
this plane here looks

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.240
like projected out
on the board.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.690
We know that at our corners and
also at the faces of this

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.600
cube, we've got oxygen.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.580
So here's a corner.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.990
These are our corners.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.820
At the faces, two faces,
we've got oxygen.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.030
What else do we have?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.600
We know we must be hitting
some magnesium.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.710
Well we know that at
all the edges--

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.860
here's an edge, here's
an edge--

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.300
we've got some magnesium.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.610
What about the center?

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.500
Well the center we do too
because we know that when we

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.010
made this stamp, the bottom face
with this oxygen, we also

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.560
stamped halfway up
a magnesium.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.670
So there's actually a magnesium
right here.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.420
It's there.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.650
It's right there.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.930
Believe me.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.180
There's our magnesium.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.440
And this is what we've got.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.070
This is the answer
to the problem.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.690
Notice how I've giving my
oxygens larger than my

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:10.880
magnesiums and I've got
it looking like this.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.890
In fact let me let me emphasize
this even more.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.470
The fact that you could actually
have drawn this

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.710
differently.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.890
You could have drawn
it like this.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.810
And it would have been exactly
the same thing.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.220
You would have gotten
full credit.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.750
You could have drawn this.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:32.840
This is the thing that I would
recommend you try at home to

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.090
prove that this is true.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.780
These two are equivalent
It's the same thing.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.290
It all depends on what you
choose as your stamp point.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.890
So I could have chosen
to put my red at

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:51.210
every point, my magnesium.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.170
So this is the answer
to part c.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.360
This part, most people
did not get correct.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.920
Less than half the class
got this correct.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.080
So think about a little bit.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.830
Identify crystal as lattice
plus basis.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.490
And then think about the full
scope of the problem.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.260
What do we go over? when went
over Miller Indices, went over

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.390
designation and crystallographic
notation, so

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.870
plane and direction notation.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.350
We went over the definition
of planar density.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.130
Think about what linear density
means, think about

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.650
what three-dimensional
density means.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.790
Don't be afraid to
not use mass.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.410
And the last thing we just
covered was the crystal basis.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.700
So review those and hopefully
you did well.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.950
Thanks.
