[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.220
PATRICK BRADY: I'm Patrick Brady
from the Android Auto team.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.010
And I'm here with
Lauren, Rasekh, and Dean

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.040
to give you an update
on Android in cars.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.770
We've got a lot to cover today
and a lot of automotive puns.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.280
So let's buckle up
and get driving.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.860
We're incredibly excited
about the automotive space

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.660
right now because
we see it going

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.970
through huge
transformations, from

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.290
electrification to
connectivity, sensors and input

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.160
devices, sharing and autonomy.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.760
Cars are rapidly turning into
full-blown computers on wheels,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.670
with high-speed mobile
connections, microphones,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.210
cameras, and screens everywhere
of all shapes and sizes.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.730
It's a computing transformation
unlike many we've seen before.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.890
And it opens up
new opportunities

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.300
for innovation and
for developers.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.080
Android Auto is an effort
from Google and our partners

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.690
to bring these advances
together and create

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.560
a safe and seamless connected
experience for drivers

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.420
everywhere.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.890
Of course, that's a lot
easier said than done.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.900
There are dozens of
different car platforms

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.330
today, many different
input types,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.540
from touch screens to touch
pads and rotary controllers,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.760
many different screen shapes,
and sizes, and resolutions.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.640
Layer on top of that the
myriad driver distraction

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.830
guidelines and regulations
across the globe.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.340
If every software
developer had to deal

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.440
with this level
of complexity, we

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.470
would never be able to realize
the potential that automotive

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.900
holds.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.950
Well, at Google, we
believe that platforms

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.580
can reduce that complexity and
allow developers to just focus

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.990
on innovation.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.080
We saw that happen on
the web and in mobile.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.140
And we're working hard to
do the same thing here,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.110
making Android the
platform for the car.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.720
Today, you can see that
vision at work in any Android

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.460
Auto-compatible car.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.770
Drivers have access
to their favorite apps

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.600
right from the car's display.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.750
And developers build their
app once for every car,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.630
without having to worry about
the make and model, the screen

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.400
size, the input type.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.770
We started this
journey back in 2014,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.570
partnering with
leading car brands

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.244
to bring Android
Auto to their cars.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.910
We've made a lot of
progress since then,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.035
and I'd like to give you
just a quick update on how

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:30.820
things are going.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.480
We continue to see incredible
growth in compatible cars

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.960
and aftermarket systems,
with over 500 models

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.260
available today from
50 different brands.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.680
Since last I/O, we've seen
first launches from Fiat,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.700
Alfa Romeo, Tata Motors,
and Smart; and 2018,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.540
bringing exciting new launches
from Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.260
and many more.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.430
Just last month, JVC and Kenwood
launched the first head unit

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670
supporting Android
Auto wireless.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.304
We're really excited
about wireless,

00:03:03.304 --> 00:03:05.720
and we look forward to more
partner launches in the months

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.220
ahead.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
With these great partnerships,
we're well on our way to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.560
making Android the platform,
the developer platform,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.516
for every new car shipped.

00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:20.810
But what about the 1 billion
cars on the road that

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.700
predated Android Auto?

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.379
What do we do for those cars?

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.920
Well, of course, we
know not everyone

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.600
has a compatible vehicle.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.440
So we made the Android Auto app
available to all Android users

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360
as a standalone experience.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.360
And this opens up the
platform and the ecosystem

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.910
to many millions of drivers,
no matter what kind of car

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.520
they drive.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.890
And as we've made Android Auto
available to more cars and more

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.470
drivers, we're happy to
say that the strong user

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.920
growth continues.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.256
Here's where we
were in I/O 2016,

00:03:55.256 --> 00:04:00.740
I/O 2017, and
today, at I/O 2018.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.370
We've seen over 300% user
growth in the last year alone.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.220
In fact, as you can
see on the chart,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.110
our growth is
accelerating as we make

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.100
Android Auto available to
more cars and more drivers.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.370
And that consistent platform
and large install base

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.079
is a great opportunity
for developers.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.910
So we continue to see strong
growth on that front, as well.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.650
In the last year,
with some popular apps

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.020
like Waze, Google Play Books,
TextMe, Sirius XM, and Plex

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.810
launching Android
Auto, Google Play

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.140
now has thousands of
Android Auto apps available.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.250
And that's a 200%
growth from last year.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.890
In January, we also launched
the Google Assistant

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.640
in Android Auto, opening
up a new way for drivers

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.540
to stay safely connected in
the car and for developers

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.420
to build car-friendly
experiences.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.770
And the great thing is actions
built for the Google Assistant

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.200
work across the
Assistant services,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.110
from smart speakers to
TVs, wearables, and mobile.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.760
We're excited about some of the
early favorites in automotive,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.150
such as Spot Hero, which
helps you find and reserve

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.620
parking spots; busuu, bringing
personalized language learning

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.410
right into your car;
and CNBC, bringing you

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.550
the most up-to-date
business news and market

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.330
insights on the go.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.950
The Actions on Google
ecosystem is exploding,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.730
and we're super excited to
see what you all build next.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.980
But of course, that's just the
beginning for Android in cars.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.840
As cars advance, we
have the opportunity

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.110
to create an even more seamless
experience by building Android

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.490
right into the car itself.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.600
And that's why we started
an effort back in 2016

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.150
to build automotive support
right into the platform.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.800
The first demo of that work
was right here at I/O in 2016

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.150
with this concept Maserati.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.590
With a lot of help
from the industry,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.690
we're investing in building
automotive features

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.420
into each Android release,
making Android a turnkey

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.000
platform for infotainment,
just as it's been

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.500
a turnkey solution for phones.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.410
And the rest of the
industry is taking notice.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.130
Last year, two of the world's
most innovative car makers,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.860
Audi and Volvo, announced
that Android will power

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.230
their future in-car experiences.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.240
If you had a chance to see
the in-car demos last year,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.742
we think you'll understand
our excitement for the future

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:34.700
and why we look forward
to many more car makers

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.170
following in their tracks.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.450
Earlier this week,
Volvo and Google

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.420
announced a partnership
to bring Google services

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.920
to the next-generation,
Android-powered Volvo cars.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.410
With the Google Assistant,
Google Maps, and the Play Store

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.330
seamlessly integrated
into the Sensus system,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.230
were creating a new benchmark
for the connected driving

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.960
experience and a
great opportunity

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.720
for all of you, our developers.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.690
And of course, this all works
no matter what kind of phone

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.500
the driver has, or even if
they leave their phone at home.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.890
To get a preview of
that experience today,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.670
swing by the Android
Auto Sandbox,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.650
where you can see it live and
in action in the next C40.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.480
So we've made a lot of progress
since Android Auto first

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.290
hit the road.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.480
And we're well on our way
to establishing Android

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.610
as the platform for automotive
in old cars, new cars,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.280
and the next generation of
cars coming up the road ahead.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.980
But of course, it's not enough
to just make Android available

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.060
everywhere.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.220
We're also working
hard to make sure it's

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.380
the best possible experience for
our users and our developers.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.690
We've listened to them a
lot over the last year,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.680
talking with great developers,
like Spotify and others,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.064
to hear what they want to
see from Android Auto next.

00:07:57.064 --> 00:07:59.230
And today, I'd like to give
you a sneak peek at some

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.180
of the exciting
changes we're making

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.670
and what it means for
the developer community.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.790
So now, I'd like
to invite up Lauren

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.876
to tell us where
Android is going next.

00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:11.206
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:15.510
LAUREN WUNDERLICH: Good
morning, and hello, everyone.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.340
My name is Lauren.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.715
I'm going to be speaking about
some of the new challenges

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:23.440
we are facing on the auto space
and how we're adjusting them.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.770
We've spoken before about
why we building Android Auto.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.930
And at the core
of our experience

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.890
is our overarching commitment
to bringing a safe and connected

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.450
experience to every vehicle.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.980
This is particularly important,
as the primary responsibility

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.380
of the driver is to drive.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.909
Everything else we
do is secondary.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.480
To really highlight
this, we showed a photo

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.950
of a driver playing Pokemon
Go during one of our research

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.360
sessions.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.490
Don't worry, everyone was safe.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.710
We were parked.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.170
But this extreme example
showcases the struggle

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.420
we face while balancing
the tension we

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.480
feel between balancing our
digital and our physical lives.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.780
By developing strategies
to manage attention,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.750
we can provide a safer
in-car experience

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.468
to keep drivers connected.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.740
And as you heard
from Patrick, screens

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.760
are getting bigger, wider,
taller, more shapes, and more

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.680
inputs, such as touchpad.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.140
We are starting to think about
how to evolve our UI to better

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.300
scale and adapt for the future.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.120
The best part is,
as developers, you

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.120
don't have to worry about these
layout changes, display size

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.000
variants, or even supporting
those input mechanisms,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.980
because the Android
Auto platform takes

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.400
on these challenges for you.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.900
Furthermore, we're
looking to see where

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.240
Android Auto is going next.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.700
As part of our commitment to
developing the best possible

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.980
in-vehicle experience,
we are developing

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.980
a built-in experience that feels
more at home in the cockpit.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.135
So I'd like to introduce our
new Google In-Car Concept.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.920
From design's point of view,
the goal of this concept

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.210
is to adopt Android
Auto's design

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.570
to a vehicle-specific theme.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.330
This includes additional
ergonomic details

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.400
and nods to the vehicle's
interior design.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.260
We can leverage these
vehicle concepts to prove out

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.140
new features and designs,
working with our partners

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.340
to bring them to life.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.680
And besides abstracting
hardware complexity,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.300
we're also thinking about how
to enhance our core experiences

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.340
and introduce new ways
to promote your content.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.340
Today, we'll be highlighting
some of the updates

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.410
to messaging and
media experiences.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.120
But be sure to stay
tuned as we roll out

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.130
all of these updates this year.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.480
For a live demo
of these vehicles,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.030
including a preview of
this onscreen experience,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.870
stop over to the
Android Auto Sandbox.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.810
As part of helping
drivers stay connected,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.570
with user interfaces that are
safer and more predictable,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.520
we have developed
multiple ways for you

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.350
to integrate with
Android Auto, depending

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.390
on the nature of your service.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.190
For navigation apps,
we work directly

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.490
with developers to ensure they
follow our strict distraction

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.520
guidelines.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.990
And you can also integrate
with the Google Assistant,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.900
which is voice-centric
and ideal for in-car use.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.390
Be sure to check out their
sessions this year at I/O.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.856
Messaging and media make up
the largest number of apps.

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:41.230
And today, we'll be speaking
about the updates we've made

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.250
to both of those experiences.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.210
So let's dive in.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.510
Beginning with messaging
updates, communication apps,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.150
like WhatsApp,
Telegram, and Messages,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.300
integrate with a
messaging template

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.710
and are displayed
via notifications.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.600
Notifications
require less effort

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.180
and are highly visible
throughout the experience.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:07.450
We've improved the
notification layer this year,

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.140
including more and
unified actions.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.810
More and unified actions
across the surfaces

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.940
help drivers react
to incoming content

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.240
without ever leaving
their current experience.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.230
And group messaging, a
feature developers and drivers

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.242
have been asking for--

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.200
now you can stay connected
with multiple people

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.908
at the same time.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.390
Media apps, like Spotify,
Pandora, Pocket Casts,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.734
and iHeartRadio, integrate
with the media template.

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:37.150
The template is
designed to remove

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.680
these complexities,
such as input,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.080
screen sizes, and orientations.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.290
And they're also designed with
the industry's best practices,

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.270
promoting predictability
for drivers

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.160
across all of our
systems, including

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.520
the phone screen, car display,
and built-in experiences.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.380
We are thrilled to showcase some
of the biggest redesigns we've

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.860
made to the media experience
since launching Android Auto.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.830
By focusing on these
three key areas--

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.970
media template-- we
have personalized

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.550
a modern, content-forward
experience

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.040
for all of our drivers.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.150
New architecture, more flexible
UI components, and new search

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.910
capabilities make up the
majority of our updates.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.420
So let's dive in--

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.770
new architecture.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.490
Before, when drivers
got going, they

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.360
would have to navigate to the
media section, open the drawer,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.880
and find that very
special commute playlist.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.320
Now, when a driver gets
going, they no longer

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.740
have to seek out the
content they wish to play,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.510
but the content is brought
forward in a very visual way.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.990
We've re-architectured the
media template in order

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.620
to pull the content
out of the drawer.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.990
Drivers can easily see content,
saving additional taps,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.630
and getting on the
road just faster.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.420
Our new foundation has created
many more opportunities for you

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.030
to showcase content,
for which we've

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.650
introduced more components
to promote a new flexibility

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.140
and ability to express your
content in a more familiar way

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.223
that is native to the app.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.240
Now, you can create more
customized layouts with list

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.290
views and subheadings,
as well as

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.150
grid views with really large
graphics, additional, richer

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.550
metadata hints, such as explicit
content tags, downloaded tags,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.870
and new and in progress tags.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.080
With the added benefit
of the template approach,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.080
each of these new additions are
available regardless of theme.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.240
From the Android on the
phone or on a screen up,

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.250
as well as customized
by the OEM,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.605
your branding and layouts
will be respected.

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.980
See firsthand how we're doing
that with the Google In-Car

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.630
Concept at the Android Sandbox.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.260
Our last major update showcases
a new search and pivot

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.280
functionality.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.020
Search is still hands free.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.412
And when a driver asks for
a specific song or artist,

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.370
it just begins playing.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.160
In addition to playing the
best-matched song or artist

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.380
automatically,
drivers can now pivot

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.520
into the app for app-provided
content and related

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.560
suggestions.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.090
With the new search
functionality,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.160
we've further optimized
the search results

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.680
to include more
digestible format.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.679
Things like subheadings
and subgroups

00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:39.220
help drivers find
the content they're

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.380
looking for even faster.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.830
So that's what we've
been working on

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.580
to enable a healthy
in-car ecosystem.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.250
I've showcased the new messaging
updates and media updates

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.190
by focusing on the new
structure, new components,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.260
and more search capabilities.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.540
So I'd like to turn
it over to Rasekh

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.340
to teach you how to get
started with these new updates.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.089
Thanks.

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:08.311
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:09.560
RASEKH RIFAAT: Thanks, Lauren.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.230
Hi, I'm Rasekh, and--

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.985
oh, there we go--

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:15.860
I'm here to talk to you
about what developers

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.680
need to do to support our
new messaging and media app

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.690
features.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.580
Today, I'll go through
some code examples that

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.850
will let messaging apps use
support group notifications

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.130
and using MessagingStyle.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.590
I'll also go over our
media architecture

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.960
and show you how to provide
those in-app search results

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.740
that Lauren just mentioned.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.950
And then finally, I'll
look at code changes

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.790
for media apps to enable our
content browsing visuals.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.960
Let's start with an example.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.179
So I live in Seattle.

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:47.220
And one of the best things
to do on the weekend--

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.980
grab a group of friends
and head out to the hills

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.660
to hit the slopes.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.350
Let's use that as
our example today.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.350
Luckily, all of us are using
Android Auto in the car.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.410
And we can start to-- we can
interact with it by voice,

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.079
keeping our hands on the wheel
and our eyes on the road.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.490
But we need to coordinate
things, like breakfast, gas,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.800
and just our general progress.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.440
When Android Auto started
supporting messaging,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.650
there wasn't a standard way
to do messaging notifications

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.970
on Android.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.550
We introduced Car
Extender helper class

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.220
for one-on-one conversations.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.940
But Android notifications have
come a long way since then.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.910
MessagingStyle is a newer,
standard helper class

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.910
for generating large-format
notifications that

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.110
include multiple back-and-forth
messages of varying types

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.300
between any number of people.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.570
You should already be using
it to write rich notifications

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.496
on mobile devices today.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.870
And enabling
Android Auto support

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.224
is a few short changes
away from that.

00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:49.640
So let's take a
look at some code.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.330
So here's Stephan asking, which
run are we going to hit first?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.900
All right, we set that up in our
MessagingStyle as the message.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.580
We set our conversation
title, Ski Trip.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.670
And since it's a
group conversation,

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.680
we set that to be true.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.130
Next, we set up
our reply action.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.940
We use a semantic action, which
is new to Messaging Style.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.790
This allows Android Auto
and the Google Assistant

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.910
to know what they should be
sending to the pending intent.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.310
After the Google Assistant
has recognized your voice

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.550
and composed your reply, it
can launch the messaging app

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.420
to send that reply.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.260
Next, we'll create a
Mark As Read action.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.810
You can imagine a scenario
where I'm in the car,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.000
and I listen to my message,
but I don't really--

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.190
I'm not really
ready to reply yet.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.230
This gives the
messaging app a callback

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.330
to say, oh, the user read this.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.180
Mark it as read and
let other participants

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.270
in the conversation know.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.980
Finally, we bring
all that together

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.950
in a standard way with
Android notifications.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.260
We had our reply action,
our MessagingStyle,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.002
and our Mark As Read action.

00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:03.710
And the Mark As Read
action won't show up

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.090
in the standard Android UI.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.910
And we can see the final
result. Our conversation title

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.150
is set up.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.710
The group messaging
icons are all

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.600
set up from the notification.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.130
And then Assistant
and Android Auto

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.410
know that you can
reply by voice.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.234
And even if you just
listen to the message,

00:19:22.234 --> 00:19:23.650
we can tell the
other participants

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.620
in the conversation
that they've seen it.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.880
So now that we've
coordinated with everyone,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.622
we've figured out
where we're going,

00:19:34.622 --> 00:19:36.330
we want to listen to
something on the way

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.200
out to the mountains, all right?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.060
Media in the car is one of
the core user experiences.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.950
And getting drivers
access to their content

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.150
should be front and center.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.770
Now, for media apps to
integrate with Android Auto,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.660
they have to implement
two services.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.380
The MediaBrowserService
provides a tree

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.610
of playable and browsable items.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.210
And browsable
items are basically

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.660
folders to help apps organize
their content so they're not

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.200
returning a giant list
of songs or podcasts.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.100
Once a user has picked something
playable from the Browse tree,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.830
the Media Session Service,
which the app implements,

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.730
is used to start music and to
provide metadata and controls

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.470
for what's currently playing.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.270
You can see, in this
example, the app

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.020
supports play, pause, skip
to next, skip previous.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.570
And there's also a mechanism
for setting up custom actions--

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.230
things like a 30-second skip.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.110
Once a media app has
implemented these two services,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.940
the Google Assistant just
works out of the box.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.211
They say, hey, Google,
play my ski jams.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.910
The Google Assistant will
recognize your voice,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:53.170
issue the query, and music
starts playing right away.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.890
What we're introducing today
for our in-app searching is

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.980
the ability to implement
an extra function

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.880
on the MediaBrowserService
to get those in-app results--

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.430
MediaBrowserService on search.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.510
In this case, the app has
surfaced my ski jams from 2018,

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.130
as well as my playlist from
my skiing trip last year.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.001
Awesome.

00:21:17.001 --> 00:21:19.000
Now, let's look at the
code to make this happen.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.220
So for apps which already
support Android Auto,

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.270
this is actually
really familiar.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.210
You have a function
which has issued

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.300
the query, an extras
bundle, and a destination

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.690
for the result.
Let's break it down.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.330
First off, apps should
just return an empty list

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.980
if they can't support
the query, OK?

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.490
If the thing is
like an empty query,

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.550
just return an empty list.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.380
Normally, queries
actually require

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.324
a network call or
a database fetch.

00:21:49.324 --> 00:21:50.740
And so if that's
the case, and you

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.350
want to do work on an extra--
on a different thread,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.160
detach the results, do the
work on that other thread,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.200
and then, when you're
ready, send the results

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.295
back to Android Auto.

00:22:02.295 --> 00:22:04.420
I want to mention that
these code snippets actually

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.840
come from the Universal Music
Player, an open-source media

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.270
app published by
Google on GitHub.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.910
It can easily be
cloned, compiled,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.790
and it's a great reference
for creating a media

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.715
app across Android Auto
and other surfaces.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.590
So now, we've got
our search results--

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.710
our Ski Trip 2018,
2017, and Ski Jams.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.400
Notice that it returned
two playlists, as well

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.830
as some albums.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.626
It would be really nice if
Android Auto could group those.

00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:36.000
We have a way to
do that, though.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.000
In this function, we're
creating media items

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.920
for sending back
to Android Auto.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.980
And it's very easy to
annotate immediate item

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.510
with a group heading.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.210
Android Auto will look at
successive media items,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.800
and if they're in
the same category,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.820
will group them together.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.420
So if we annotate our
Ski Jams with playlist,

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.960
and our albums with albums,
Android Auto groups them

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.400
and shows that for
you, regardless

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.290
of screen size and surface.

00:23:07.127 --> 00:23:08.960
We're also adding a
couple more annotations,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.030
as Lauren mentioned.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.490
Here, I'm showing the
explicit annotation.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.000
It's great.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.720
I'm in the car.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.990
I got my family.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.310
I don't want that
explicit song to come up.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.520
Also, we're adding a
support for downloaded.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.890
That way, I'm in the mountains,
I don't have good cell

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.914
coverage, or I don't want to
burn my data plan on music,

00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:29.705
I have a chance to pick
the right playlist.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:37.050
Android Auto shows them
right with the content.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.570
Looks like Ski Trip 2018 is
the right playlist for my trip.

00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:44.360
There's one more
function that needs

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.240
updating to take advantage
of these new features.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.280
When the
MediaBrowserService starts,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.300
it provides Android Auto with
a media route and extras.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.730
In order for search and
bringing content out of a drawer

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.635
to be enabled, you'll need
to add a couple of extras

00:23:58.635 --> 00:24:01.010
to let Android Auto know that
you support these features.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.900
Now, Lauren
introduced the concept

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.330
of bringing content out and
being able to show things

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.080
as grids or lists.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.170
And by default,
Android Auto will

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.450
show browsable
items, the folders,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.690
as lists, because they
generally have an icon.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.780
And they'll show content,
or playable items,

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.780
as grids, because they're
usually much richer

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.910
and have a much more
detailed artwork.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.210
But there are times when it's
better to switch that around.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.470
So for instance, let's
say you have a podcast up.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.370
In that case, the podcasts,
which are browsable items,

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.870
have a much richer
artwork, right?

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.770
But all the episodes, which
share the same artwork,

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.700
you want to see more about
their detail in a list format.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.340
We're giving you the
ability to choose that

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.450
by adding an extra hint in
your on route so that you

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.756
can switch the order around and
choose grids or lists depending

00:24:57.756 --> 00:24:59.130
on the content in
your media app.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.760
So to sum up, I've
shown code samples

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.000
for MessagingStyle,
MediaBrowserService, onSearch,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.760
specifying additional
item metadata,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.210
adding content browsing,
and search hints.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.010
I'm excited to see
developers access

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.420
these features in the future.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.720
And look for our documentation
later in the summer.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.830
Now, please welcome Dean
up to talk about tools

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.194
for Android Auto development.

00:25:26.194 --> 00:25:29.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:34.912 --> 00:25:36.120
DEAN HARDING: Thanks, Rasekh.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.522
Hi, everyone.

00:25:37.522 --> 00:25:39.480
So as Rasekh mentioned,
I'm here to talk to you

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.760
about the tools we provide
for developing and testing

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.659
your media and
messaging apps, and also

00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:45.450
to give you some hints
and tips to help you

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.520
make the most of the platform.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.270
The first thing I want to talk
about is the Desktop Head Unit.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.850
This tool is ideal for testing
both your messaging and media

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.520
apps, as it will render
your apps exactly the same

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.440
as you'd see them in production.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.880
And just as
importantly, it allows

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.338
you to interact
with the Assistant,

00:26:01.338 --> 00:26:03.540
just like in a real car.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.060
You get the Desktop Head Unit
as part of the Android SDK.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.557
Just select it from
the Download Manager.

00:26:09.557 --> 00:26:11.640
The instructions for running
the Desktop Head Unit

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.529
are on the developer site,
but it's fairly easy.

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:17.070
Just start the Head Unit Server
from Android Auto's developer

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.530
menu on the phone.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.180
You get that by going to
About, then tapping 10 times

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.480
on the About Android Auto
header to enable developer mode.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.150
Then, choose Start Head Unit
Server from the overflow menu

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.220
that you can see here.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.650
Plug your phone into a
USB port on the computer

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.996
and launch the
Desktop Head Unit.

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:36.870
From there, you can see
how Android Auto will

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.790
respond to your
app's notifications,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:43.159
and also, how your media app
will appear in an actual car.

00:26:43.159 --> 00:26:44.700
But if you're
developing a media app,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.670
I encourage you to check out the
Android Media Controller, which

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.661
is an open-source app that
we have hosted on GitHub.

00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:53.160
It will connect to your app's
media session and media browse

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.326
service and shows
the information

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:56.700
your app is
presenting to Android

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.090
Auto in a nice semantic format.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.820
If you're whitelisting to block
apps other than Android Auto

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.279
from accessing your
browse tree, it

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:06.486
would probably be a good
idea to either add the media

00:27:06.486 --> 00:27:08.940
controller to the whitelist
or disable the whitelist while

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.980
testing.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.165
Rasekh also briefly touched
on the Universal Media Player.

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.540
But I wanted to
reiterate that we

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.670
have this great,
comprehensive sample media

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.610
app available on GitHub.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.440
It gives you a
canonical implementation

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.660
of a media app, not
only on Android Auto,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.300
but also on all our other
services, such as Wear and TV.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.467
Let's get into some code now.

00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:33.300
The first bit of code
I wanted to talk about

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.280
was the standard actions
that your app returns

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.246
as part of the playback state.

00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:39.120
You should try to make
sure your app supports

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.060
the standard actions defined
in PlaybackStateCompact,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.330
such as ACTION_SKIP_TO_NEXT
and ACTION_REWIND.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.490
By using the standard
actions, you not only

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.710
have a great integration
with Android Auto,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.300
but you also get
Assistant integration

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.830
with those actions for free--

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.250
actions like, OK,
Google, skip tracks.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.200
And as we bring Android
Auto to more surfaces,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.570
it may not be the case that
those custom actions appear

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.600
in the same place they do today.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.100
But you can be sure the standard
actions are kept in a place

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.350
where it makes the most sense.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.850
You can use the
media controller app

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.980
to see what standard
actions you've implemented,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.252
and also to see
what's available.

00:28:16.252 --> 00:28:17.960
You can see here that
we have an app that

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.750
does not implement a standard
forwards, backwards action,

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.940
but has instead chosen to
implement those actions

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.725
as custom actions.

00:28:26.057 --> 00:28:28.640
Now, if you were to look at this
app in the Desktop Head Unit,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.680
you might not necessarily know
that there's anything wrong.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.680
Because of the way we
render the custom actions,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.420
everything looks OK.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.330
But by implementing those
actions as standard actions,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.880
like this, we can leave
the custom actions

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.847
for truly custom functionality.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.560
We've done a lot of
research with users

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.226
and found that users
do not want to have

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:53.800
to browse while driving.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.650
Here are a few quotes from
some of our research sessions,

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.930
where users talk about
some of the issues

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.400
that they have with
custom search and browse.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.956
Users typically want to get
in and go without much fuss,

00:29:04.956 --> 00:29:06.580
and this is a great
opportunity for you

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.190
to provide some additional
value to your users

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.550
by giving them easy access
to the playlists they like

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.660
or to recommend new
content that they may not

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.297
have known about otherwise.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:18.880
So I would suggest
that you prioritize

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.970
surfacing things in the browse
tree with items most relevant

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.907
to driving at the top.

00:29:23.907 --> 00:29:25.740
Rasekh showed you earlier
some of the things

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.400
we're doing to bring
content out of the drawer

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.600
and put it front and center.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.820
And you'll definitely want
that first page of content

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.294
to be the most useful.

00:29:33.294 --> 00:29:34.960
Now, that's not to
say you can't include

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.741
all the user's playlists, or
whatever, in the browse tree.

00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.240
Just keep in mind that the first
few items on your home page

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.510
should be the most relevant
to the task of driving.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.002
A corollary to that would
be to keep your browse tree

00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:50.280
shallow, no more than
two or three levels deep.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.990
In fact, to make the most of
the new design we've shown you,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.317
a two-level-deep
browse tree is ideal,

00:29:55.317 --> 00:29:57.150
because then, your users
will be able to get

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.410
to their favorite music or
podcasts with a single tap.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.050
You can use the onSearch method
that Rasekh described earlier

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.330
to allow users to search
for specific things,

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.475
like a particular song
or a particular artist.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.500
One of the challenges
we have in Android Auto

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.870
is that it is used on devices
with many different screen

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.000
sizes and resolutions.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.830
Your app isn't
necessarily going to know,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.350
until the moment it's
plugged into a car, what

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.190
the resolution of the
screen it's displayed on is,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.940
which means that it's
difficult to predict

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.640
what resolution your icons
need to be to look right

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.120
on any particular screen.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.000
You can see here, this star
icon is too low resolution

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.755
for this display, and
it really looks out

00:30:37.755 --> 00:30:39.255
of place with the
rest of the icons.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.440
So package your icons in
the vector graphics format,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.590
rather than a bitmap format.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.240
Vector drawables have been
supported natively in Android

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.049
since API level 21,
which, coincidentally,

00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:55.340
is the version of Android
that Android Auto support was

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.490
introduced.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.140
So there's no reason not to
use the native vector format.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.090
You can see here an
example of the star icon

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.070
from before as a vector graphic.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.960
And no matter how
big I make the icon,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.200
it still has nice, smooth edges.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.240
As an added bonus, the
file size of this icon

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.890
is really small,
especially compared

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.719
to having multiple bitmaps
at different resolutions.

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:19.010
Don't forget, you can use
Android Studio's Vector Asset

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.900
tool to convert your SVGs to
the native Android format.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.000
While we're on the
topic of icons,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.490
you should prefer using
the URI-based methods

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.350
for passing us your
media, rather than

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.162
the drawable-based methods.

00:31:33.162 --> 00:31:35.620
This example shows returning
one of your built-in resources

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.360
as a URI rather than a drawable.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.150
Using URIs allows us
to case your resources

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.980
and to only allocate
memory for the items

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.307
that we are actually
physically displaying.

00:31:46.307 --> 00:31:48.390
If the user never scrolls
down to the fourth page,

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.220
there's no need to allocate
memory for the items

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:50.719
down there.

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:54.600
I also wanted to
briefly touch on

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.291
something we've seen
with ad-supported apps.

00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.040
Typically, the adds
will include some call

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.920
to action that may not make
sense when running in the car.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.400
For instance, they might say,
tap the screen to learn more,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.997
or click here, or something
along those lines.

00:32:06.997 --> 00:32:08.580
If you're running
inside Android Auto,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.560
I recommend adjusting
your messaging

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.990
so that it's not confusing
for people not actually using

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.830
your main app's UI.

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:19.100
And lastly, the process of
actually getting your app

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.226
onto the Play Store--

00:32:21.226 --> 00:32:23.600
once you've added this metadata
snippet to your manifest,

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.654
and you've uploaded your
app to the Play Store,

00:32:25.654 --> 00:32:28.070
it will need to be reviewed
against our Driver Distraction

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.360
Guidelines.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.130
This is a fairly
complicated process,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.380
but the guidelines for
ensuring a smooth review

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.620
are documented in the
developer center at this link.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.760
If our reviewers find issues,
you'll be notified by email

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.780
and will be able to
resubmit an updated

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.541
application for re-review.

00:32:45.541 --> 00:32:47.040
So I've gone over
a few things we've

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.040
learned over the years
developing for Android Auto.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.310
We've got a great resource
in the Media Controller

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.589
for testing media apps.

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:55.630
And don't forget to check
out the Universal Media

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.970
Player for a comprehensive
example implementation.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.920
Use the standard actions
where it makes sense,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.378
and leave custom
actions for things

00:33:03.378 --> 00:33:05.910
that are actually custom.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.550
Surface the important
actions at the top in browse.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.770
And use search for
finding specific content,

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.760
like a particular song
or a particular album.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.100
Keep the browse tree
shallow, no more than two

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.540
or three levels deep.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.480
Use vector graphics for icons.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.310
And use the URI-based
methods rather

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.079
than sending raw bitmaps.

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:27.870
And finally, be aware
of the surface you're

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.247
playing on for ads.

00:33:30.247 --> 00:33:31.830
And now, I'd like
to hand it back over

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.455
to Patrick for our wrap-up.

00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:37.425
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:37.425 --> 00:33:40.396
PATRICK BRADY: Yeah, thanks.

00:33:40.396 --> 00:33:42.300
Thanks, Dean.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.920
So today, we showed
you how we're

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.220
working to make Android
the platform for developers

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.410
in automotive and
how you can develop

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.380
your apps on that platform.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.920
We also showcased a new design
for Android Auto in your apps

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:03.630
across surfaces, from old
cars to new, and new developer

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.510
APIs that enable your
apps to take advantage

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.530
of these new designs
and features,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.130
including MessagingStyle for
group messaging and custom

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.350
actions, media
browse enhancements

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.320
to bring your content forward
and annotate it with rich media

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.280
metadata, and media in-app
search to help your users

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.735
find the content they're
looking for across your catalog.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.679
Of course, that's
just a sneak preview

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.480
of all the developer resources.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.120
If you'd like more information
to help you update your apps,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.219
please visit the Android
Auto Developer site

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.068
at developer.android.com/auto.

00:34:37.068 --> 00:34:39.484
And I'd also encourage you to
take a look at the Universal

00:34:39.484 --> 00:34:43.489
Media Player and Android
Media Controller examples

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.380
that Rasekh and Dean
mentioned, which

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.840
are freely available as
open-source software on GitHub.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.949
And while you're
here, you can also

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.560
stop by the Android
Team office hours, which

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.830
are happening again on
Thursday at 2:30 PM,

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.140
to chat with the Android
engineers and business

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.780
development teams and ask
them questions directly.

00:35:06.092 --> 00:35:08.300
But if you really want to
see these things in action,

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.010
please come and check out
the Android Auto Sandbox,

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.450
which is just around the
corner, where you can see

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.280
the new Android Auto design.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.160
And I promise you,
it's not as janky.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.180
It seems like we were
having some AV issues

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.170
with the animations earlier.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.280
But you can see the new
design operating fluidly

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.430
in a new Range Rover Velar,
on a beautiful, wide screen,

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.102
showing simultaneous
maps and media on the UI

00:35:32.102 --> 00:35:32.810
at the same time.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.150
It's really, we think,
a fantastic experience.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.580
You can also find the
Google In-Car Concept

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.630
that Lauren talked about,
which is showing the default

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.460
experience in Android
that we're making

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.560
available as open-source
software in Android

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.750
P, and of course, the
latest in-car experience

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.640
from our collaboration
with Volvo

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.430
in the new Android-powered
Sensus Connect system,

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.280
running the Google Assistant,
Google Maps, and the Google

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.038
Play Store.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.330
Last but not least, as
with every session at I/O,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:06.930
we want to--

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.670
we value your
feedback, and we want

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.850
to hear from you so we can make
our sessions better every year.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.860
So please grab a browser and
swing by google.com/io/schedule

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.710
to fill out a short survey
when you have time and leave

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.630
your feedback.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.783
Thanks very much,
and have a great I/O.

00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:28.811
