[SIZZLING]

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.540
MICHAEL BRENNER: OK, so this
week, the topic is elasticity,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.760
texture and mouth-feel elasticity.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.150
And someone was asking elasticity is.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.410
And elasticity is the fact that your
hand is squishy and the floor is not.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.372
That's elasticity.

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.330
And you can't eat the
floor, because it's hard,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.660
but your hand-- well,
at least, I don't know.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.390
Pasta, though, you can eat pasta.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.240
Last week in the Harvard College
class, we had our first lab.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.420
And the lab actually, it
turns out, was about pasta.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.910
The students made
pasta puttanesca, which

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.810
is a wonderful recipe
that was introduced

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.590
in this wonderful book, The
Series of Unfortunate Events.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.290
And the students cooked pasta
in various different ways.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.360
So for example, one way to
cook pasta is to boil the water

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.140
and pour the pasta in.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.110
Another way to cook pasta is to not
boil the water and put the pasta in.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.870
And there are lots of questions
you could ask like, for example,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.922
does it matter if you boil the water
first before you put the pasta in?

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:19.130
Actually, one thing that I
think Mark will talk about

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.270
is suppose you try to cook
your pasta in the microwave.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.500
Will that work?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.960
How many of you cook
pasta in the microwave?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.160
None of you, see?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.240
So why is that?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.970
Is it because none of us know about
this wonderful secret of microwaves

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.640
or is that you actually can't
cook pasta in the microwave?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.900
So you see, there are lots of questions
that you can ask about these recipes.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.540
Now, our lab was inspired
by a wonderful article

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.820
that Harold McGee wrote in The New
York Times about five years ago,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.570
in which he asks, how much water
does it really take to make pasta?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.829
Because these pasta boxes-- for
example, I'll just-- this one.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.370
Look at this.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.260
This says, for four-- where's
the box-- it says use six quarts

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.660
of water per one pound of pasta.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.460
That's a lot of water.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.070
Have you noticed?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.960
Do you really need that much water?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.000
He says, no.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.890
Then why did the box tell you
to put that much water in?

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.930
So anyway, that's what
Harold talks about

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.370
and he actually estimates
the energy savings

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.610
that we take in the
United States if you were

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.380
to just use the right amount
of water, for crying out loud,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.830
which is an interesting thing.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.140
Anyway, last year in the HarvardX class,
we did a little experiment actually,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.572
because Herald also talks in this
article about how you don't even

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:34.530
need to boil the water.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.051
How many of you boil the
water before you make pasta?

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:37.550
Yeah.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.170
Does anyone not?

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.030
So the question is, why do you do that?

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.490
Just because the box said?

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.145
So we did this little
experiment and I'm going to just

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:46.240
show you a little bit of the data.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.030
This is data that was
taken off early on.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210
And right after we put it
up in the HarvardX class,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.470
we asked people to please make pasta
both ways and judge whether or not

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.900
they thought it tasted
the same, just to judge.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.520
And we had a poll.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.270
And so by that point,
we had 395 responses.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.010
And basically 50% of
the people said that it

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.624
didn't matter which way you cook it.

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.790
That is if you boiled the
water first or you didn't.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.800
So you should all go home
and try to make pasta

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.330
without boiling the water first.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.640
And also, stop taking
the recipe so seriously.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.990
Is that a bad thing to say?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.089
MARK LADNER: Yes.

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.640
No, that's right.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.360
MICHAEL BRENNER: Is that bad?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.740
That's OK?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.300
I'm always embarrassed
when I say things like this

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.258
in front of people who
know what they're doing,

00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:25.181
because maybe you should
take them seriously.

00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:27.680
So now, elasticity-- I just
have a couple more things to say

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.138
and then I'll turn it over to Mark.

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:31.500
Now, elasticity is of central
importance to cooking.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.256
And we were really
very excited when Mark

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.130
agreed to come and be
the chef for this week,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.710
both because the food truck
is the coolest thing ever

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.500
and because gluten-free pasta, that is,
making pasta or actually any baked good

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.880
without gluten really gets at
the core of the issue in thinking

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.162
about elasticity and cooking.

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:50.870
And that's because as we will tell
you and as Mark will tell you,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.810
gluten is a protein
or really two proteins

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.070
which are the core elastic element
in making baked goods and pasta.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.640
And when you ask yourself, how do
I recreate a dish without using it,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.890
then you've basically thrown
it all out of the window.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.098
And you have to really figure out what
you're doing when you put it together,

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:12.154
which is the intellectual issue that
I think underlies this lecture, yes?

00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:12.820
Well, we'll see.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.380
MARK LADNER: Yes.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.870
MICHAEL BRENNER: I
haven't heard the lecture.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.286
MARK LADNER: Partially, partially.

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:17.410
MICHAEL BRENNER: Partially.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.390
But the thing is that
controlling elasticity

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.110
is central to all of cooking.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.290
And just to throw up some more
examples for you to think about,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.860
you all know that some of you like
steak very well-done and some of you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.310
like it not so well-done.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.720
And what many of you
might know is what people

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.230
call the thumb test, which is
that if you're cooking a steak

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.930
and you want to find out how
well-done it is, what you do

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.990
is you just push on it.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.346
And If it's really squishy,
then it's not very well-done

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.470
and if it's not very squishy,
then it is well-done.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.344
Well, that's a measurement
that you're making

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:49.760
with your hand of the elasticity
of the steak, which you're

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.110
doing which changes as a function of
the temperature inside of the steak,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.900
because there are transitions in
the proteins in the steak that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.750
cause it to firm up.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.337
So the same issue occurs with cheeses.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:04.170
And so the question is
how to quantify that.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.080
And this, as you know, for better or
for worst-- well, I'm a scientist.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.900
Pia is a scientist.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.290
We're scientists and so we
basically ruin everything.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.150
Well, you don't ruin everything
but I ruin everything.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.340
And so instead of this beautiful cheese
and you should squish on the cheese

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.220
or you can squish on the
steak, we think about springs.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.100
And the thing is if you squish on
the spring, it's the same thing.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.670
You have to push on
it and it reacts back.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.614
How many of you have
taken a physics class?

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:33.530
And remember, they told
you about these things

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.530
and you thought it was the worst
thing that ever happened to you.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.560
But the thing is that really,
if you think about cooking tofu,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560
it's just like a spring.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.410
If you squish on soft tofu, then it's
squishy and firm tofu isn't so squishy.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.700
So you're just measuring the
spring constant of a spring.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.250
And in fact, the way I think of
a steak-- this is sort of a joke

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.740
but it's not totally wrong--
is that a steak basically

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.820
is just a network of springs.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.950
And if you imagine it
as a network of springs,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.980
the most important parameter
in the network of springs

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.429
is the bond length, the
length between the springs,

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.720
because they're little springs.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.511
You can't see them.

00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:05.660
This is a cartoons thing.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.950
And so anyway, in honor of that,
the equation of the week this week

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.200
is the following.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.190
It's this number e, which scientists
call the elastic modulus, which

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.120
measures how squishy something is.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.200
And it's equal to some energy over
l cubed, where l is the bond length.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.506
So you all have to clap--

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.920
--because that's the
equation of the week.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.970
And the amazing thing
about this equation

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.290
is that it can be used to think
about the elasticity in foods

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.350
as diverse as steak, tofu,
pasta, pretty much anything,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.760
cake, whatever you'd like.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.220
And the reason that things
are more or less elastic

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.860
is there are really only two options.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.990
You either increase u, which
is how strong the bonds are,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.040
or you decrease l, which is
how small the springs are.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.860
And those are the two
options you've got.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.069
And so at least when I listen
to Mark-- actually when

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.860
I'm about to listen to
Mark, what I'm going

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.922
to be thinking to myself among other
things is, how is he controlling u?

00:06:57.922 --> 00:06:59.630
How is he controlling
the bond strengths?

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.540
How is he controlling the
distance between the bonds?

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.970
And that's really the issue.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.990
Now, this is a picture
of the food truck.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.510
This is Pasta Flyer.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.190
And of course, this story
is going to be about gluten.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.523
I'm not going to say anything about this
other than to say that gluten basically

00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:16.480
makes a network, which
basically gives pasta and bread

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.800
and things like that its elasticity.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.250
And the l basically that
happens there is essentially

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.890
the distance between the
cross-links of the gluten molecules.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.800
And Mark, I think today, at
least among other things,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.910
is going to tell us how
one can make baked goods

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.150
or in this case pasta which
feel the same way in your mouth

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.840
but have no gluten, which
is really an amazing thing.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.420
So I think with that, I'll stop.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.222
And let's clap, because you're done with
me and now you get to listen to Mark.

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:41.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.520
MARK LADNER: Hello, good evening.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.445
How are you?

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:45.020
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.040
MARK LADNER: Very excited to be here.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.036
I'd like to think David and
Pia for their warm hospitality.

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:56.700
They let me mess around in the
food science labs yesterday

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.090
and I didn't cause too much trouble.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:05.340
So I'm here to discuss certainly
elasticity, but more specifically

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:12.660
how it relates to
plasticity and how we are

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:19.450
able produce this elusive texture
referred to as "al dente," which

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.380
is somewhere in the middle.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.176
First, I'd like to introduce my
distinguished colleague, Carlos

00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:26.675
Rodriguez.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.289
Carlos is the pasta master at Del Posto.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:42.289
And he was kind enough to come
here and lend his gentle touch.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.290
So we're going to do a
couple of experiments.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.890
So I just wanted to
clarify a couple things.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:57.600
Al dente is a toothsome firmness
that gives way to a rewarding chew.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.410
It's firm but it's also chewy.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.160
So it's plastic and it's also elastic.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.680
The kind of stuff we're
going to talk about today

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:18.480
is my favorite, which is dry pasta,
which, contrary to popular belief,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.630
for the most part is the
pasta we refer to when

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.060
we throw around terms like al dente.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.922
I'm not sure if it's possible
to make fresh pasta al dente.

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.880
You can make it all sorts
of different textures

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.750
but al dente I don't believe is one
of them, unless you dry it partially.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.150
So plastic is basically the state
that this pasta is in right now.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.120
So it's a fragile snap
produced in the pasta

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.400
from the drying technique, which we're
going to get into a little later.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.420
And then, the elastic,
the elasticity, is

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:02.810
the stretchy pull produced by the
re-hydration of the dried product.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.700
So this is my mom.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.500
I believe she's with Ric Ocasek, a
very popular Bostonian from the '80s.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.380
I actually grew up in the town next to
Belmont, Massachusetts, and I spent--

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:17.880
[CLAPPING]

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.080
Thank you very much.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.245
I spent many of my formative years
running around causing trouble

00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:24.870
in Harvard Square, as a matter of fact.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:30.400
So my first employment was
in fact in Harvard Square.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.900
I worked at a pizzeria
right on Church Street,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:39.000
which is that way in the Atrium
building, which in the '80s

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.050
was quite popular.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.250
It was a sort of California-style
wood-burning oven.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:52.870
But there was also a quick-service pasta
concept that was commissary driven,

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.760
which is very similar to what I'm
trying to do with Pasta Flyer.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.200
I guess my first
introduction to the texture,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.760
the very rewarding
texture of al dente, was

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.070
introduced to me through the salad bar.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.570
There was a restaurant on 33 Dunster
Street, which is in the basement.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.740
And they had a very famous salad bar.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.805
It was called 33 Dunster.

00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.530
And I was a big fan, big fan.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.100
so the thing about the
chickpea, which sort of led me

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.310
to this quick-service pasta,
is that no matter where you go,

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:35.770
no matter where you buy it, a
chickpea in a can is always perfect.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.530
I don't know why.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.580
It's the most elusive thing.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.250
How they managed to do
that all around the world,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.065
no matter the brand, no
matter the deli or whatever--

00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:46.190
and no matter the chickpea.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.270
You open one can and every one
seems to be about the same.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:55.280
So it has a distinct plasticity
that than sort of gives way

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.550
to this really satisfying chewiness
that's not quite al dente in the pasta

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.770
context, but people do often refer to
the texture of a properly-cooked legume

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.490
also as al dente.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.680
So that was sort of my first
frame of reference there.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.280
At Del Posto, which is the restaurant
where I'm the chef in Manhattan,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.100
I've been working for the last
10 years, almost 10 years.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.000
And it's a fine dining
Italian restaurant

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.940
that focuses not only but very much on
pasta, which is my first love and joy.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.170
And Carlos and I work
very closely together

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.300
trying to come up with
interesting textures for pasta.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.860
Pasta, for the most part,
until very recently,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.330
was exclusively made from wheat.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.090
And wheat is something that's
certainly been around forever,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.060
Mesopotamia and the Cradle
of Life, and all that.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.280
So wheat is essentially
just a wild grass.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.900
And throughout time, it's always been
an important staple of civilization.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.880
At many points, it was also
considered to be currency.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.530
From what I understand, the
Roman legions at a point

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.430
were actually paid with
farrow or emmer, which was

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.870
the second type of cultivated wheat.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.250
So at this point, wheat has
been cultivated and produced

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:32.120
into everything from
food to booze to fuel.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.490
In the world today, rice would be the
number-one produced grain followed

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.190
by corn, primarily
because of animal feed,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.650
and then wheat being the third
most-produced grain in the world.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.260
The thing that's interesting
about wheat and the way

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.480
that we've manipulated it
over time or several millennia

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.930
is that the wheat kernel
has three parts to it.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:02.450
It has the endosperm, which
is the majority of its size,

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:08.710
and then the bran and the germ, which
has all the vitamins, all the minerals,

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.040
and all the protein.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.520
So the endosperm is
primarily only starches.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:22.210
So in our culture today, most
refined white wheat or anything

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.860
short of semolina-- so baking
flour, cake flour, double zero

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.290
flour, all-purpose flour--
is all just endosperm.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.550
So it doesn't really have any
nutritional component at all, which

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.170
is unfortunate and kind of strange.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:47.470
There's been a lot of talk recently
about gluten-free and celiac disease,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.760
which is actually not an allergy.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.580
It's an immune deficiency
disease that causes people to be

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.720
unable to digest the gliadin in gluten.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.330
So we're going to talk about flour
and the magic of combining it

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:10.850
with water, which seems so
strange that these two completely

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:18.000
different and dissimilar and in
no way related products produce

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.080
this magical bond that can be
formed and manipulated into so

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.620
many different shapes and figures.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:34.350
Going back thousands of years,
people were baking water and flour

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.810
of some sort on a hot rock.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.450
It was probably closer to something
like clay or papier mache, not something

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.230
you would really want to eat.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:50.970
Also, it had very little pliability
and certainly not very appetizing.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.500
The other interesting
thing about wheat is

00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:01.350
that primarily, we are cultivating
only six types of wheat.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.690
And the majority are a
red or amber-colored wheat

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.370
that is quite high in protein.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:19.170
But then again, we strip away most
of that protein from the kernel.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:27.830
So high-protein flour, being
semolina or durum wheat--

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:34.160
so it's a durum wheat kernel that
we're cultivating-- is high in protein

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.240
because it has the bran and the germ,
but it's very, very low in gluten,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.720
so it doesn't bond well.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:48.610
That's often used in pasta for these
dry shapes and also for fresh shapes,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.820
like an orecchiette
or a cavatelli, things

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.600
like that that have a very nice
texture, although I wouldn't necessarily

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.290
call it al dente.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.690
A soft wheat, which is double
zero flour, which is again

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.560
just the endosperm, is
often used for fresh pasta

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.150
to lend more of a
pliability, more silkiness.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.970
It also allows it to stretch, so that
for example, with a stuffed pasta,

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.170
you can pull it over the
stuffing, which is quite helpful.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.490
We also sometimes use
eggs, which is really

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:29.040
just another way of introducing
water to the recipe.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.740
So this is really interesting.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.720
In the 17th century in Naples,
that was the first time

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:41.760
when the working class
finally had access to pasta

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.520
as a main part of their diet.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.120
They could actually afford to eat it.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.800
Distribution channels had
become sophisticated enough

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.920
where they could actually get
it from places like Sicily

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.330
to places like Naples.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.830
I have actually taken that
ferry and it is scary.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.370
Invention of the
mechanized press is what

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:10.150
allowed people to finally be able to
enjoy fresh dried pasta as a staple.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.270
At that point, most of the
aristocracy that was enjoying pasta,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.050
even further north in
Germany and Austria,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.100
was often consuming it
as more of a side dish,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.280
certainly with a much
larger portion of protein,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:30.840
whereas in the south, particularly south
of Rome around the time when Garibaldi

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:37.940
started to unify the peninsula
of Italy, people from the north

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.870
were often referring to the people
from the south as "pasta eaters."

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.070
So it was a derogatory term at the time.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.730
But the thing that's really
interesting is at that point,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.810
we started to see this really,
really interesting process, which

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.520
was sort of the first part
of the industrialization

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.510
of this sort of pasta, where there
was a pre-drying and a post-drying.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.290
When it's extruded here--
so this is a hopper.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.910
So we're going to put the dry
ingredients and water in here.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.980
You spin it around a bit.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:21.430
You heat up this extrusion chamber,
ideally to less than 125 degrees,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.840
but not much less.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.160
And you'll see that
it starts to coalesce

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.260
and the process of extruding it
through torque and pressure and heat

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.360
will push out a shape like this.

00:19:40.232 --> 00:19:44.690
And then, what they do is they
will start-- at that point,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:52.920
it's extruded out about-- so
this is a semolina fusilli.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.630
And then, this-- sorry.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.270
This is what we're using on
the truck, so this is a brand

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.800
that I am quite fond of right now.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.590
It's called Bionaturae.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.770
It's from Lucca.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:15.430
And this is produced from rice, which
is the most common gluten-free pasta

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.290
grain.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:22.070
Also potato and soy, which
is somewhat unfortunate,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.280
because when you deal with
allergens, soy has become something

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.380
that people are intolerant to.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.160
And also, potato is a nightshade,
so certain individuals

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.610
prefer not to consume that.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.460
So it's coming out of
here at about 31% water.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.950
And you want to dry it to be
shelf-stable like this to about 12.5%.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:53.620
Percent So what they do is
they do it in two stages.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.040
In the first stage, they bring it from
31% to somewhere between 18% and 22%.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.040
And this is called the
pre-drying and they do it

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.320
at a much higher temperature,
often over 150 degrees.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.800
And the main purpose of that
is simply to create a barrier

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.800
on just the very
exterior of the extrusion

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.040
so that the shapes don't stick together.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.430
So especially in industrial
production, they're producing so many

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.600
of these little guys.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.200
And I do it on such a small level.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.490
In fact, in the lab yesterday, I
spent a good portion of the morning

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.420
today trying to separate
them from one another.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.140
So you can understand the
advantage of this technique.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:40.030
After that, they'll dry it
for a much longer period

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:45.820
of time at a much lower temperature
until it gets to the 12.5%.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.450
And now, this is shelf-stable
for an infinite amount of time,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:57.250
providing that it's not too humid or
it gets wet or something like that.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:02.090
You very rarely see pasta
that's dry like this with egg,

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.390
although sometimes I'm sure
you've seen-- sometimes

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:10.460
there's fettuccine, for example, that
comes in these little nests and is

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.130
dried.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.810
It's often used in other parts of
Europe for beef stroganoff, for example.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.600
So they're more like buttered noodles.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.220
Those often have egg and I rediscovered
them recently and they are very nice.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.240
I've become a fan recently.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.920
They cook really fast.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.840
They rarely stick together,
which is a huge advantage

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.160
and one of my pet peeves.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.810
Often, if you buy a string pasta
that's wider, like a fettuccine,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.490
for example, in a box, it's pretty
much guaranteed to stick to each other.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.050
And that is very frustrating,
because then it won't cook evenly.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.120
That's one of the reasons
why they create pasta

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.670
like this with these
shapes and ridges, or what

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.240
they refer to as "rigate,"
which is ridges on the outside.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.880
They'll often sell it with
the advantage that sauce

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.430
sticks to it better because of the
grooves, which may or may not be true.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.210
But the truth of the
matter is that they're

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.960
less likely to stick to each other.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.890
So again, the advantage
of egg is that you

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.980
can create something that's much
more pliable, much more elastic.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:25.320
And what you're essentially doing is
using the egg, the protein and the fat

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.450
but also the water in the
egg as an alternative source

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.800
to help make the dough or the batter.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:42.770
Two things that Carlos is
going to demonstrate here

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:48.000
is that we have a couple
different types of flour.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.850
So Carlos really like to use
warmer water, not hot but generally

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.200
around 85 degrees.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.240
We learn this also from pizza-making,
because you want to bloom the yeast,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.140
if you use especially
dry-active yeast, which

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.680
is another excellent
example of elasticity.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:13.430
But you don't want to kill the yeast,
so 85 is a pretty normal temperature.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:19.352
With fresh pasta, you want
the strength and the bite

00:24:19.352 --> 00:24:26.590
from the durum and semolina, but
you need the double zero flour

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:31.530
for higher protein but
also for better elasticity.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.860
So he's going to make a mixture of
three flours in this particular case.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:44.200
The other flour that we like to
use is this amazing invention

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.510
invented by Thomas Keller and
his food scientist, Lena Kwak,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.220
and it's called Cup 4 Cup.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.820
And the advantage to
this specific flour--

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.830
although there are others
maybe similar to it, like it

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.840
on the market, this one-- the main
advantage, particularly for home cooks,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.540
is that it really suggests that
you can substitute one cup of this

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:15.760
for one cup of any other flour that you
would use in your normal baking or home

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.130
recipes, which is amazing
because who of us has time

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:25.450
to re-imagine recipes at home?

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.040
Although there's three separate
flours here that Carlos is using,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.260
they're all essentially the same thing.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.010
Some of them have more endosperm.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.420
Some of them have more
bran and germ, but they're

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:43.280
all from red winter
durum wheat, whereas this

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:54.540
is white rice, brown rice, tapioca,
potato, milk powder, xantham that's

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.150
derived from both corn and soy.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:02.410
So there's a lot of other
ingredients in this.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:08.430
The main point that I'm trying to
suggest is that wheat flour is magic,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:16.780
because this one thing-- this is still
just a facsimile trying to mimic that

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:22.290
and there needs to be eight or
nine ingredients to get it done.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:27.540
This is an experiment that
we made yesterday in the lab.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.470
So this is-- you can start.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.329
You want to get some water?

00:26:34.329 --> 00:26:35.620
We have some water in the back.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.328
He's bringing it?

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:36.920
OK, great.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.605
So the thing that's interesting
about these two doughs

00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:48.330
is that Carlos is-- do
you want some more space?

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.820
Carlos is actually going to
make the gluten dough first,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:01.820
which actually comes together as a
ball, whereas the gluten-free dough is

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.550
the Cup 4 Cup plus water.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.180
It's much more granular
and it doesn't actually

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:11.205
become cohesive until it starts to
go through the extrusion chamber.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.289
Feel free to go.

00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:17.080
So this is the experiment
we did yesterday.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.180
So this is Cup 4 Cup and water.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.180
And the thing that's interesting is
that although they look completely

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.330
different, they're exactly the same.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:30.550
And the only difference between
these two is that this was air-dried

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.330
and this was cooked and then air-dried.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:41.020
This-- and we'll pass these cups
around for you-- is exactly the same.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.770
The thing that's
interesting about this is

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:50.310
that this is completely shelf-stable,
but it's not very strong

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:59.310
and it's not very good for transport,
whereas this is shelf-stable.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:05.420
But also, what we're suggesting here
today is that this can be made al dente

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.190
and it's gluten-free and this cannot.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.740
This remains plastic and
we haven't figured out

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:21.022
how to cross over to more of that
elastic texture that produces the al

00:28:21.022 --> 00:28:22.230
dente that we're looking for.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.420
AUDIENCE: What was that made from?

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.570
MARK LADNER: This is made
from the Cup 4 Cup flour.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.340
They both are.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.440
The other thing that's
interesting is I looked

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.050
into buying one of these
pasta dryers, which allegedly

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.630
are quite different from a dehydrator.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.250
This machine costs
$20,000 minimum and you

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.080
have to dry a minimum of a
couple hundred pound of pasta

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.090
at a time, which I just
don't have any use for.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.520
I would like to one day.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.260
If you keep going to
Pasta Flyer truck, I

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.499
might actually need to do that one
day, but probably not for a while.

00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:02.040
So there's these two types of drying.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.980
One is that it pulls the moisture
from the product, which then

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.320
circulates the product as moist air.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.160
And then, a dehydrator just pulls
the moisture from the product

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.200
and then it dissipates into the air.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.290
So it doesn't produce as
consistently dry a product.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.570
If you look at this really
closely when we pass it around,

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:33.410
you'll see there's a lot of stress
on the surface of the pasta.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.990
Although it's perfectly
safe, it's not like this,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.370
which was done by a professional.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.729
Some say-- and Professor
Brenner, I think

00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:46.770
you'll appreciate this-- I read some
stuff yesterday as a matter of fact,

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.610
for the first time, that some claim that
the salt is the trick that pushes it

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:59.230
from plastic to elastic and it can't be
done without salt, which I don't know.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.610
Whenever I cook pasta, I salt
it saltier than seawater.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:13.960
The sort of prescribed ratio of
salting water is one liter of water

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.950
equals 100 grams of pasta, which is
the international sophisticated serving

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.750
size, if you're eating
something other than just pasta,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.410
equal to 10 grams of salt.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.130
So 10 grams of salt
to one liter of water

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:34.049
produces enough salinity that
you can flavor your pasta.

00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:36.340
MICHAEL BRENNER: So this is
in the pasta that's cooked.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.749
It's not in the dough.

00:30:37.749 --> 00:30:39.040
MARK LADNER: It's in the water.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.800
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's in the water.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.750
MARK LADNER: Yeah.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:46.910
So I salt much, much higher
than that, as much as 15%

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:52.100
of the water, which is saltier
than seawater, the danger

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.620
being that you can then not drag any of
that cooking liquid into your saucepan,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:02.220
especially if it's in combination
with, for example, rendered cured pork

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.300
product or really salty aged
cheeses, specifically sheep's milk,

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.740
which tends to be a
lot saltier and leaner

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.900
than Parmigiano-Reggiano, which
is fatter because it's cow's milk.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:24.210
But it lends a really nice
emulsifying characteristic to sauces.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.019
So that was sort of unusual.

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:26.810
I didn't know that.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.310
Oh, wow.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.980
So check this out.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.650
So we often rest this.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.520
The main advantage I would
say to resting this right

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.270
now is that because
it's really tight, it's

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:48.620
going to heat the stem
past 125 too soon.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.720
So I think we should rest this
and you can go on the Cup 4 Cup,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.560
and then we'll try to
extrude that first.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:02.000
So when you see Carlos mix this
recipe, it's-- I'll grab that.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:17.857
It requires a certain touch and
Carlos is incredibly nimble.

00:32:17.857 --> 00:32:19.940
You wouldn't know necessarily
from looking at him,

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:27.370
but he has a touch like
I very rarely find,

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:33.170
where he can be both forceful
and gentle simultaneously,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.620
which is a crucial skill.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.774
It's a crucial skill.

00:32:38.774 --> 00:32:39.640
[WHISTLES]

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.530
Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.913
You've got to go through me.

00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:46.332
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.190
He's got a full card.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:52.420
Oh, that's the truck.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.580
Those are some of my
very kind sponsors that

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:02.530
helped us get to Harvard, Breville,
which makes this lovely microwave,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:08.000
and Bionaturae, which is this incredible
pasta that you should really try.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.940
You can buy it even at Whole Foods.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.740
And it's incredibly resilient, which is
one of the reasons I like it so much.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.390
You can cook it and then you can
hold it and it doesn't carry over.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.090
So you can actually suspend
al dente, which has always

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.620
been a really difficult thing to do.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.540
Well, that sort of elusive toothsomeness
that's halfway between or somewhere

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.720
between plasticity and elasticity
is where the pasta is fully cooked.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.160
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.080
If there is a pearl or if there is a
spirit of that white part in the center

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.370
of the pasta, that is not al dente.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:55.150
That is crunchy and
that's something else.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.680
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.290
Some people, particularly Sicilians
that I've known, really like that.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.650
They refer to it as
"il paco" or something,

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.690
like right out of the package.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.760
So they only cook it
for a couple of minutes.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.520
It's pretty cool.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.920
I happen to like really,
really firm pasta,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:21.010
but it does need to be cooked
all the way through, just

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.190
through but all the way.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:31.639
If you can suspend that texture
for more than a few minutes,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.037
you're onto something.

00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:35.870
You're onto something,
because I've actually

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.639
had pasta-- like these are
bronze die, for example,

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.510
that Carlos is extruding through.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.760
But more mass-produced pastas,
this is sort of middle of the road,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.440
although it's my favorite.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.630
Something like maybe Prince or
Ronzoni, some of the American ones

00:34:52.630 --> 00:35:01.070
that don't have the same sort of
appreciation for Italian authenticity,

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:09.460
will use either nylon or Teflon
die, which produce a smoother edge

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.690
but they last much longer.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.970
So you don't need to
replace the die, which

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.450
can become quite expensive
when you're dealing

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.020
with really large pieces of equipment.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:25.900
So we've got this really
strange-- so there's

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.716
a big difference between this and this.

00:35:28.716 --> 00:35:37.030
This is kind of like ricotta cheese
And this is really nice, too.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.400
So we're not going to--
this will definitely heat up

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.100
the stem really quickly, though.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:49.670
Often in more
industrially-produced extruders,

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:58.130
they'll water-cool these chambers so
that they're not able to get very hot.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.835
They'll run them for days.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:14.850
Yes?

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:15.723
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I ask a question?

00:36:15.723 --> 00:36:16.473
MARK LADNER: Sure.

00:36:16.473 --> 00:36:18.200
MICHAEL BRENNER: So
I think it's amazing.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.390
The dough is crumbly, but the
pasta doesn't look crumbly.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.620
MARK LADNER: It is, though,
because it's been forced together,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.135
but it's pure will.

00:36:31.595 --> 00:36:32.720
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I see?

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.630
Can I see?

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.505
MARK LADNER: Feel it.

00:36:36.125 --> 00:36:37.000
MICHAEL BRENNER: Wow.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.269
But it's really--

00:36:38.269 --> 00:36:39.810
MARK LADNER: But it just comes apart.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.020
It doesn't have any--

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.270
MICHAEL BRENNER: Look at this.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.550
MARK LADNER: It doesn't
have any stretch.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.870
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's terrible.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.787
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.620
MARK LADNER: But if you
cook it immediately,

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.720
it gelatinizes and then it has pull.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.999
MICHAEL BRENNER: Huh.

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:55.040
MARK LADNER: But you have
to cook it immediately.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.998
MICHAEL BRENNER: Right.

00:36:55.998 --> 00:36:57.922
MARK LADNER: Yeah.

00:36:57.922 --> 00:36:59.880
MICHAEL BRENNER: This is
why gluten is amazing.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.070
MARK LADNER: I know, exactly.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:07.080
So the thing I wanted to talk
about in reference to Pasta Flyer,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.310
but more importantly, Del
Posto-- for quite some time,

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:14.630
one of our primary challenges
has been dietary restriction,

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.480
which is a very subjective thing.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.000
Some people clearly
are allergic to things.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.620
And other people are intolerant to
things, which can also be dangerous.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:32.100
And it's absolutely their prerogative
to choose to put safe food in their body

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.910
or what's safe for themselves.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:39.900
So it's made our jobs as chefs in the
service and hospitality industry much,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.610
much more challenging.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:47.070
And this is something that's
maybe happened in the last

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.780
probably five years.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.930
So with dietary restrictions--
so celiac disease is a disease.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.390
It's not an allergy.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.640
A dietary restriction
is something that's

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.790
an intolerance, that people prefer
not to put things in their body

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:11.450
that they don't respond well to, which
is perfectly rational and logical.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.320
And then, there's the fad, which
is a dietary preference which

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.010
is very subjective.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:27.090
But to me as a food service
provider, it doesn't matter.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.870
I really don't care.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:35.040
We take all intolerances
and all dietary restrictions

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.590
with the same level of seriousness.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:42.050
So that's how we started to
develop our gluten-free pasta.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.440
So currently at Del Posto, every
single pasta on our pasta menu--

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.560
I believe there's maybe
12 or 13-- we also

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.520
have an identical gluten-free version
that's available to anyone at any time.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.650
So one of the challenges we
ran into is that because we're

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:02.300
such a large restaurant, we often do
large tables, so eight and 10-tops.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.350
Just by the law of averages,
it's more likely there's

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.070
going to be people at this table that
are unable to eat certain things.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:15.960
So we've designed it
into the menu where we

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.980
are able to offer them a
gluten-free pasta that's

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:24.310
exactly the same at the exact
same time in a seamless way that

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.240
allows them to enjoy the same
level of service and hospitality

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.267
as everyone else.

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:29.766
Yes?

00:39:29.766 --> 00:39:33.870
AUDIENCE: How do you deal with the
challenge of cross-contamination?

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.880
MARK LADNER: We use all
different equipment,

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.910
everything-- different water,
different utensils, all the equipment.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:48.310
We're not a medical facility and
we're not gluten-free certified.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:54.760
But a lot of people suffering from
celiac disease have eaten at Del Posto

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.954
and haven't gotten sick yet.

00:39:57.954 --> 00:39:58.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.900
But today could be the day.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.720
Who knows?

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.910
So that brought us to Pasta Flyer.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.240
My partner Nastassia
suggested-- and she's

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.110
brilliant in her
deductive reasoning-- when

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.170
you're trying to do something in
a really, really small footprint

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.290
and you're trying to make
safe food for people,

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.310
it's impossible to have
a 100-square-foot kitchen

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.860
and produce gluten and
gluten-free food and expect it not

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.140
to be cross-contaminated.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.470
So we chose to put all of our effort
into trying to create the absolute best

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:43.030
gluten-free pasta to the point
where hopefully no one would notice.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:49.180
We haven't quite achieved that yet,
but we're getting there, right, Carlos?

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.200
So that's our goal is
to produce something

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.720
that people won't necessarily notice.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.740
Fortunately, most of our
competition is really bad,

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.850
so we feel like we
have a good opportunity

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.740
to get a little bit of the market share.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.320
Places like Olive Garden
or Sbarro or Familia,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.270
they don't really
approach food production

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:24.390
with the same level of
standards that maybe I would.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.520
Ask any of my former cooks
and sous-chefs over here.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.130
They'll tell you.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.335
I'm a dick.

00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:33.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.780
OK, so we're going to
go over this process

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.490
really quickly before we finish.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:48.560
So do you have more of the water?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:03.980
So we combine the flour with the
water and put it into the hopper.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.640
We extrude it.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.470
We cook it immediately
in heavily salted water.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:20.260
We then shock it in
heavily salted ice water,

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.515
so that we don't lose any of
salinity that we just put in it.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:32.360
And then, we dry it in a
dehydrator at around 140 degrees.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.990
It's just a home version.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.880
It's very crude but it's
effective, at least when

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.906
you're making quantities like this.

00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:42.240
All right, here we go.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:48.700
So this is the one that
has not been pre-cooked.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:54.390
So we're going to put it on just to
be safe so you can see the process.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.950
We're going to put it
on for two minutes.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:02.820
Sometimes, it can only take a minute,
but because this bowl is pretty large

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.915
and also the water wasn't that hot,
it will take a little bit longer.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.050
If it's boiling, it
will take one minute.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:18.390
If it's room temperature or tap
water, it can sometimes take over two.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:23.260
Also, if you put more
than one vessel in,

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.340
you have to add around 30 seconds
for each additional vessel.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.280
So the microwave oven is a very
misunderstood piece of equipment.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.860
I'm suggesting that it can make
gluten-free pasta al dente,

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:40.860
but that you can't make gluten
pasta taste very good at all.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.120
And I don't know why that is, but that's
one of the other advantages to Pasta

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120
Flyer being gluten-free.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.360
So see, it's starting to go here.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.615
Put it on the thing.

00:43:55.615 --> 00:43:56.990
But there's some action in there.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.220
It almost looks like a sponge.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.360
It looks like yeast.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.220
However, this pasta is not changing.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.005
It's still only plastic.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:21.340
So that means when you bite it,
it will have a fragile, sort

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.880
of crumbly, pasty texture.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.200
So I usually let it sit
for about two minutes

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.110
and it's actually soaking
up some of this water,

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:38.750
so that's improving the
yield and re-hydrating it.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.257
MICHAEL BRENNER: Is it done, Mark?

00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:41.340
MARK LADNER: I don't know.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.320
You can be the judge.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.470
MICHAEL BRENNER: So I don't
know if any of you believe this.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.070
Why should cooking pasta in
the microwave be different?

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.361
MARK LADNER: See, look at that.

00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:52.460
Look at how gluey that is.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.710
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I see it?

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.970
MARK LADNER: See how
much goo is on this?

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.180
It looks like tapioca.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.550
So it's cooked.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.524
It kind of tastes like oatmeal.

00:45:06.524 --> 00:45:09.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:15.228
So now, we're going to try this
one, see if it's any better.

00:45:15.228 --> 00:45:17.136
Oh god, I hope this works.

00:45:17.136 --> 00:45:18.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.400
Is this hot?

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.930
CARLOS RODRIGUEZ: Yes, Chef.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.180
MARK LADNER: So one thing
for sure is I'm going

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:27.960
to try to make this seal stronger.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.280
Also, it's strange.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.930
Plastic wrap-- Saran wrap that
you buy in a grocery store

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.930
is completely different from the
stuff that we use in restaurants

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.290
and I'm not sure why that is.

00:45:54.654 --> 00:45:56.070
We're never going to get this off.

00:46:06.718 --> 00:46:07.220
All right.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.303
So now, we're in business.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.320
So this is going to
create a nice seal here,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.650
because we made sure to
use a lot of plastic wrap.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:25.030
Right.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.280
Now, we have something
that looks like pasta.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.410
Maybe one more minute,
but yeah, there's bubbles.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.220
It's doing stuff.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.070
But it's just flour and water.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:42.240
MICHAEL BRENNER: If you don't cover
it with plastic wrap, it doesn't work?

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.570
MARK LADNER: I have these silicone
mats that do the same thing.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.160
MICHAEL BRENNER: But if you
don't cover it, it doesn't work?

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.550
MARK LADNER: Not as well.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.072
This will be chewy.

00:46:52.072 --> 00:46:53.030
MICHAEL BRENNER: Right.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.300
MARK LADNER: This is just a mess.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.990
I don't know what this is.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.550
When we first started this--
I've been working on this project

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.450
for a little more than three years.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.430
So in the beginning, we thought
it was going to be so great.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:14.970
We thought we were going to freeze-dry
it and make it like a packing peanut

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:17.950
and then just rehydrate it
in tap water or something,

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.430
like space astronaut food.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:26.140
So we took a pasta like this and we
went to the store in the Berkshires.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.890
It was in Great Barrington.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.860
And they specialized
in organic pet food.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.360
And it was this huge facility,
maybe 5,000 square feet,

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.410
and they had this big
giant freeze dryer,

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:44.680
one of the very, very few in
the Northeast and certainly the

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.620
only one that would let
a knucklehead like me in.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.760
And so we cooked it.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.740
We overcooked it.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.990
We froze-dried it.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:56.180
We came by a week later.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:03.910
We took a 10-minute pasta drop,
turned it into a 15-minute pasta drop,

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:09.840
because freeze-dry goes all
the way to zero water, zero.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.670
So back to the drawing board, right?

00:48:15.756 --> 00:48:16.631
What else did we try?

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.860
All right.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.450
So now, we have something
that really looks like pasta.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.532
Want to try?

00:48:30.532 --> 00:48:31.448
MICHAEL BRENNER: Sure.

00:48:31.448 --> 00:48:32.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.684
MARK LADNER: Seriously.

00:48:33.684 --> 00:48:34.850
It doesn't have enough salt.

00:48:37.162 --> 00:48:38.120
MICHAEL BRENNER: Pasta.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.319
MARK LADNER: It's not al dente, though.

00:48:40.319 --> 00:48:41.610
MICHAEL BRENNER: For me, it is.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:42.776
I'm not a sophisticated guy.

00:48:42.776 --> 00:48:43.908
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.721
It's good.

00:48:45.721 --> 00:48:46.470
There's no gluten.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.550
MARK LADNER: No gluten.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.860
MICHAEL BRENNER: Wow.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.222
That's pretty amazing.

00:48:51.222 --> 00:48:52.180
MARK LADNER: So I got--

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.221
MICHAEL BRENNER: Serious.

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:56.849
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:56.849 --> 00:48:58.820
Seriously, this is amazing.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.660
And that's with that flour over there.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.993
MARK LADNER: These are the same.

00:49:01.993 --> 00:49:03.860
This is exactly the same pasta.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.510
MICHAEL BRENNER: Huh.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.180
That looks terrible.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.140
MARK LADNER: Well, the thing is
that also, once this was cooked,

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:17.030
so you basically rinsed
off half of that goo.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.780
So this has a really nice
texture, but it's not al dente.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.180
But I think a lot of people
would still find it appetizing.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.390
MICHAEL BRENNER: No,
I think that's good.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.890
MARK LADNER: So try it at home.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.180
It's safe.

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.130
It's not expensive.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.880
[APPLAUSE]
