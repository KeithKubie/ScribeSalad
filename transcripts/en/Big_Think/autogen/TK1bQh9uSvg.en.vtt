hi Dean Green here bill I wanted to ask

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020
hi Dean Green here bill I wanted to ask
 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.320
hi Dean Green here bill I wanted to ask
you a hypothetical if the moon was

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
you a hypothetical if the moon was
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.660
you a hypothetical if the moon was
really made out of green cheese how much

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
really made out of green cheese how much
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.910
really made out of green cheese how much
mass would it have what would its

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920
mass would it have what would its
 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.370
mass would it have what would its
gravity be like how would it affect our

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
gravity be like how would it affect our
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.470
gravity be like how would it affect our
ties differently than the real moon does

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
ties differently than the real moon does
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.519
ties differently than the real moon does
and just for fun how much milk would it

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
and just for fun how much milk would it
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.730
and just for fun how much milk would it
take to make that much green cheese

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740
take to make that much green cheese
 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.720
take to make that much green cheese
thanks for your answer

Dan a great question about the moon

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
Dan a great question about the moon
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.939
Dan a great question about the moon
being made of cheese specifically I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
being made of cheese specifically I
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.790
being made of cheese specifically I
understand a green cheese if it were

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
understand a green cheese if it were
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370
understand a green cheese if it were
green cheese like really green I would

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
green cheese like really green I would
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.709
green cheese like really green I would
expect it to reflect a little more green

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
expect it to reflect a little more green
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.650
expect it to reflect a little more green
light than it does I mean it would

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
light than it does I mean it would
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.220
light than it does I mean it would
depend it doesn't have a rind does it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
depend it doesn't have a rind does it
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139
depend it doesn't have a rind does it
have that wax that they put on in the

you from experience that in general

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020
you from experience that in general
 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.900

cheese floats in general so with
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729
cheese floats in general so with
floating cheese you got to figure its

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
floating cheese you got to figure its
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010
floating cheese you got to figure its
specific gravity that is to say how much

as water they're not 50 times as dense
 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.850
as water they're not 50 times as dense
twice as dense Rock sink but they don't

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
twice as dense Rock sink but they don't
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.710

sink like a bullet so it a moon that was

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720
sink like a bullet so it a moon that was
 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.539
sink like a bullet so it a moon that was
80 percent the mass of the current moon

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
80 percent the mass of the current moon
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.300
80 percent the mass of the current moon
would have 80 percent of the effect on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
would have 80 percent of the effect on
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.149
would have 80 percent of the effect on
the tides but if it were 80 percent of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
the tides but if it were 80 percent of
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.179
the tides but if it were 80 percent of
the fat of the mass its orbital distance

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
the fat of the mass its orbital distance
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910
the fat of the mass its orbital distance
would probably be different would it be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
would probably be different would it be
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100
would probably be different would it be
set up to lie bait in the same way that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
set up to lie bait in the same way that
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560
set up to lie bait in the same way that
is to say the moon currently keeps the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
is to say the moon currently keeps the
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.539
is to say the moon currently keeps the
same face to us with every orbit and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
same face to us with every orbit and
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399
same face to us with every orbit and
that has to do that's because it spins

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
that has to do that's because it spins
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.160
that has to do that's because it spins
almost exactly one time as the Gores

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
almost exactly one time as the Gores
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109
almost exactly one time as the Gores
goes around the Earth it spins has a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
goes around the Earth it spins has a
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880
goes around the Earth it spins has a
little wobble to it we actually see

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
little wobble to it we actually see
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590
little wobble to it we actually see
somewhat more than just half of the moon

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
somewhat more than just half of the moon
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660
somewhat more than just half of the moon
if you're really diligent with the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
if you're really diligent with the
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459
if you're really diligent with the
telescope paying close attention and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
telescope paying close attention and
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350
telescope paying close attention and
then the other thing I would wonder

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
then the other thing I would wonder
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.080
then the other thing I would wonder
about a cheese moon you know rocks rocks

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
about a cheese moon you know rocks rocks
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.109
about a cheese moon you know rocks rocks
are pretty solid but cheese often is not

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
are pretty solid but cheese often is not
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.850
are pretty solid but cheese often is not
I wonder if it wouldn't have

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
I wonder if it wouldn't have
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.520
I wonder if it wouldn't have
loads or vibrational oscillations within

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
loads or vibrational oscillations within
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.120
loads or vibrational oscillations within
its own shape that are noticeable I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
its own shape that are noticeable I
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.030
its own shape that are noticeable I
wonder if it's spin wouldn't spending

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
wonder if it's spin wouldn't spending
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.440
wonder if it's spin wouldn't spending
once with each orbit I wonder if it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450
once with each orbit I wonder if it
 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.900
once with each orbit I wonder if it
wouldn't have an equatorial bulge I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
wouldn't have an equatorial bulge I
 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.060
wouldn't have an equatorial bulge I
wonder if what would happen to when

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070
wonder if what would happen to when
 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.920
wonder if what would happen to when
other cheesy objects hit it you know

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
other cheesy objects hit it you know
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.230
other cheesy objects hit it you know
meteorites of cheese cheese your rights

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
meteorites of cheese cheese your rights
 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.490
meteorites of cheese cheese your rights
whatever they're called and I wonder if

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500
whatever they're called and I wonder if
 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.190
whatever they're called and I wonder if
it wouldn't out gas or evaporate in the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
it wouldn't out gas or evaporate in the
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.840
it wouldn't out gas or evaporate in the
blackness of space also cheese freezes

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
blackness of space also cheese freezes
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.980
blackness of space also cheese freezes
so on the the far side of the moon or

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990
so on the the far side of the moon or
 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.449
so on the the far side of the moon or
the near side depending on the time of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
the near side depending on the time of
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.100
the near side depending on the time of
month you might have some lunar freezing

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
month you might have some lunar freezing
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.600
month you might have some lunar freezing
which then would have could potentially

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
which then would have could potentially
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.000
which then would have could potentially
affect the shape because it would affect

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
affect the shape because it would affect
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.570
affect the shape because it would affect
its its gravity with one side saw

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
its its gravity with one side saw
 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.790
its its gravity with one side saw
changing density and the relative to the

changing density and the relative to the
 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.699

other side the geode as it's called the
 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.400
other side the geode as it's called the
shape would change with its own gravity

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
shape would change with its own gravity
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.500
shape would change with its own gravity
so there'd be some issues you'd notice

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
so there'd be some issues you'd notice
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.250
so there'd be some issues you'd notice
it right away

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260
it right away
 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.410
it right away
and I think another issue to keep in

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420
and I think another issue to keep in
 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.340
and I think another issue to keep in
mind if the moon turns out to be made of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
mind if the moon turns out to be made of
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.520
mind if the moon turns out to be made of
cheese it just really expands our

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
cheese it just really expands our
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.580
cheese it just really expands our
possibilities for a lunar base and it's

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
possibilities for a lunar base and it's
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.110
possibilities for a lunar base and it's
all the RINO because there be sort of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
all the RINO because there be sort of
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.620
all the RINO because there be sort of
limitless food it does for those of you

may not want to be an astronaut on a
lunar mission now if it turns out that

lunar mission now if it turns out that
 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.209
lunar mission now if it turns out that
it's made of green cheese
