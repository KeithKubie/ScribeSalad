Sorry.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.480
Oh.

All right.

Uh, hello...

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.178
Garol.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.813
I'm not sure if I'm in
the right place--

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.783
You are.
Okay.

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.484
I'll just hand that--
All right.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.524
Oh, Jesus.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.558
Thank you so much.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.261
It took me so long--
ID.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.996
Jeremy Santos.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.899
No, I'm not a man.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.136
Jeremy's actually my--
he's my husband.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:44.104
So.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.205
We both work so much.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.340
You know how it is.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.275
But when we're home,
we're home and we--

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:52.446
I need his ID or he can
come down here

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:56.183
with two pieces of
mail with his name on it.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:02:00.654
Gar... ol, you seem like,
so great.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.223
I can just tell
from this interaction.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.726
Can you just like, look
the other way this time?

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.061
I'm sorry, I can't.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.497
My supervisor's watching.
