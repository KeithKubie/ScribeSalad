00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.810
This course is also really built
around the idea of mentorship.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.160
We have a team of TAs, but
more than teaching assistants and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.875
more than graders,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.460
they're really meant to be mentors for
you as you go through this course.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.060
Every mentor will have a small group of
students that they'll interact with on

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.940
a weekly basis.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.420
You'll have the same mentor
review all your assignments,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.960
review your project proposal.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.090
Review all your status
reports on that project and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.040
review the final deliverable.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.000
They're really meant to get
a familiarity with your interests,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.430
your project idea, and your progress.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.790
In fact,
when we reach the end of the semester,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.380
if you decide to keep your project going
as a research agenda or a startup,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.420
I wouldn't be surprised if your
mentor even became a partner for you.
