00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.750
PAIGE BAILEY: I'm Paige
Bailey, a TensorFlow developer

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.250
advocate.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.230
And I'm here today with
Carla Bromberg, who's

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.890
going to tell us all about
our AI for social good efforts

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.780
at Google.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.940
So tell us a little bit
more about it, Carla.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.190
CARLA BROMBERG: Thanks, Paige.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.650
So for AI for social
good, we have--

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.260
we aim to accelerate the
application of machine learning

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.718
to the world's
biggest humanitarian

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:21.202
and environmental issues.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:22.910
So today I'm going to
tell you about some

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.320
of the core research
and engineering work

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.240
we're doing at Google,
more specifically,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920
the flood forecasting
initiative.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920
PAIGE BAILEY: Excellent.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.347
So is this the flood
forecasting initiative here?

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:32.180
CARLA BROMBERG: Yes.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.310
So this is our demo.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.140
And so what this shows you
is how we're using machine

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.090
learning to help
forecast and predict,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.460
with better accuracy,
where floods are.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.100
So that way, we
can tell users when

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.480
they're affected by floods.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.090
So earlier today
in the keynote, we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.860
announced that we're
rolling this out

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.470
across a big portion of India.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.270
And I'm going to
actually show you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.950
the simulation that we have
for the demo here today.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.060
So this simulation is over
the course of 48 hours.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.420
So if you look, you can
see the water filling in.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.710
So this is without
using machine learning.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.490
You can see that the
accuracy is not very high.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340
And you can see,
also, that there's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.480
a lot of regions that are
predicted to have floods.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.050
Now with Google's flood
forecasting effort,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.112
you can see, as you both use
the elevation maps that we've

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:27.320
been working on that involve
machine learning as well

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.470
as the models that we've made,
how much more accurate it is.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030
So if you're a person who lives
in this region, like earlier,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.720
it would have said
it was flooding.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.455
And then you would
have to evacuate--

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.580
or you would think that
you would need to evacuate.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.020
But actually, when you look
at the more precise models,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.170
you'll actually be safe.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.237
So what we're hoping is--

00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:49.070
through this work, you
can see that accuracy

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.140
has gone up to 79%.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.210
And then when people
get the alerts,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.030
they can have the
information that they need.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.960
So as you can see on
the phone, what they'll

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.090
see moving into
this monsoon season

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.842
is, when you search
on Google, or when

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:05.300
you go into Google
Maps, and you're

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.342
in an affected region, it
will give you some more

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:09.500
information so that you
know how to keep yourself

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.333
and your family safe,
and whether or not you

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.880
should evacuate, and
when you get an alert

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.127
from Google public alerts.

00:02:15.127 --> 00:02:16.460
PAIGE BAILEY: This is fantastic.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.470
My academic background
is very focused

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.890
on quantitative hydrogeology
and geospatial reasoning.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.040
And it's amazing to be able to
see the kind of accuracy uptick

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.080
that you get just by
using machine learning

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.640
with your elevation maps.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.867
This is really, really cool.

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:30.950
CARLA BROMBERG: Thank you.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.825
We're really excited.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.630
And we hope we can save a lot
of lives ahead of this monsoon

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.130
season.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.380
And we're hoping to also
expand this work across more

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.880
countries.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.422
And for this, we're
partnering really

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:41.473
closely with the
Indian government,

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:43.640
and many others on the
ground, and first responders.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.348
So hopefully we can
help get the word out

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:46.931
so that people can
evacuate to safety.

00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:49.556
PAIGE BAILEY: Thank you so much
for telling me about this work.

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:51.740
And let's go and take a
look at the other demo

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.390
that we have from
AI for social good

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.890
that's very focused
on whale detection.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.610
CARLA BROMBERG:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.620
EMILY FORTUNA: Hi, I'm
here with Julie Cattiau.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.530
And she's here to tell me about
this really cool whale demo.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.200
JULIE CATTIAU: Yeah,
nice to meet you.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.150
So this is a demo that's related
to the bioacoustics project

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.360
at Google.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.140
So we're a small team, part of
the AI for social good effort.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.180
And so we've been
training machine

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.530
learning model to detect
the presence of animals

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.930
just by listening
to the audio sound.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.050
EMILY FORTUNA: Very cool.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.140
JULIE CATTIAU: And so
this project in particular

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.740
is a partnership with
NOAA, the National Oceanic

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.840
and Atmospheric
Administration, which is part

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.610
of the American government.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.540
NOAA, in particular, has
a network of microphones.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.340
These microphones have
been set up in 2005.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.700
And they're in different
spots in the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.170
And so in the end, it
adds up to a lot of data.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.350
And so NOAA-- the data set
that NOAA, in particular, was

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.900
interested in getting
our help to analyze

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.480
is close to 200,000
hours of audio.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.040
So as you can imagine, nobody
can listen to the whole thing.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.700
It's just way too long.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.110
And that's where machine
learning can be very helpful.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.380
Because with enough
examples of sounds,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.830
machine learning can be
applied to recognizing

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.589
a particular species of animals
just by listening to the sound.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.300
And actually, if you think about
animals that live in the ocean,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.770
almost all of them produce
some sort of sounds, even fish,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.480
which can be surprising.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.520
Boats definitely
make a lot of noise.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.890
They're not animals,
but they make noise.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.510
Whales make sounds,
dolphins do too.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.010
And so the question
for us was, can we

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.940
identify which species are
present in a audio data set

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.290
and classify them using
artificial intelligence?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.310
So this demo here that you
can see represents three

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.030
months' worth of data from
that data set I was telling you

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.170
about.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.290
And what you can
do is, if you slide

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.980
this tablet along the data, you
can see that this is actually

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.300
a spectrogram.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.540
So it's a visual
representation of a sound.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.410
This is frequency over time
for a particular sound.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.080
And so NOAA provided some
examples of humpback whale

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.770
sounds.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.690
And then we trained a model
to recognize those sounds

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.950
automatically.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.940
And we used it on the
whole pile of data

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.210
that they had to tell
them where the whales were

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.980
and at which point in time.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.880
When the color is light blue,
it means that our classifier

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.130
has detected a whale.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.050
Would you like to listen
to the whale songs?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.700
EMILY FORTUNA: Absolutely.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.450
JULIE CATTIAU: OK.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.640
[WHALE CALL]

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.520
EMILY FORTUNA: So I'm getting
lots of ocean sounds right now.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.720
Oh, I hear the whale.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.950
JULIE CATTIAU: You do?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.620
Awesome.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.920
EMILY FORTUNA: That's wonderful.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.150
Well, thank you so much.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.985
This is lovely.

00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:54.600
JULIE CATTIAU: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.642
EMILY FORTUNA: And It's--

00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:58.160
I am-- it's great that you're
able to track whale migration

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.440
patterns.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.482
JULIE CATTIAU: Yeah, thank
you for your interest.

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:03.460
