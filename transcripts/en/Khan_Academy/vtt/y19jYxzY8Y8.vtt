00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.590
Welcome to part two of
the presentation on

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.660
quadratic equations.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.470
Well, I think I thoroughly
confused you the last time

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.170
around, so let me see if I
can fix that a bit by doing

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.770
several more examples.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.430
So let's just start with
a review of what the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.380
quadratic equation is.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.650
The quadratic equation says, if
I'm trying to solve the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:31.590
equation Ax squared plus Bx
plus C equals 0, then the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.440
solution or the solutions
because there's usually two

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.970
times that it intersects the
x-axis, or two solutions for

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:47.610
this equation is x equals minus
B plus or minus the square root

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.390
of B squared minus
4 times A times C.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.270
And all of that over 2A.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.040
So let's do a problem and
hopefully this should make

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.690
a little more sense.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.620
That's a 2 on the bottom.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:13.890
So let's say I had the equation
minus 9x squared minus

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.950
9x plus 6 equals 0.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.230
So in this example what's A?

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.410
Well, A is the coefficient
on the x squared term.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820
The x squared term is here,
the coefficient is minus 9.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.620
So let's write that.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.120
A equals minus 9.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.400
What does B equal?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
B is the coefficient on the x
term, so that's this term here.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.220
So B is also equal to minus 9.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.140
And C is the constant term,
which in this example is 6.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.550
So C is equal to 6.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.070
Now we just substitute these
values into the actual

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.260
quadratic equation.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.600
So negative B, so it's
negative times negative 9.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.780
That's B.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.110
Plus or minus the square root
of B squared, so that's 81.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.390
Right?

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.030
Negative 9 squared.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.720
Minus 4 times negative 9.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.140
That's A.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.480
Times C, which is 6.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.950
And all of that over 2
times negative 9, which

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.630
is minus 18, right?

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.720
2 times negative 9-- 2A.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.760
Let's try to simplify
this up here.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.930
Well, negative negative
9, that's positive 9.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.480
Plus or minus the
square root of 81.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.900
Let's see.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.270
This is negative 4
times negative 9.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.470
Negative 4 times negative
9 is positive 36.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.310
And then positive 36
times 6 is-- let's see.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.330
30 times 6 is 180.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.890
And then 180 plus
another 36 is 216.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.980
Plus 216, is that right?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.490
180 plus 36 is 216.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.840
All of that over 2A.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.570
2A we already said is minus 19.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.740
So we simplify that more.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.090
That's 9 plus or minus the
square root 81 plus 216.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.400
That's 80 plus 217.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.040
That's 297.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.900
And all of that over minus 18.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.020
Now, this is actually-- the
hardest part with the quadratic

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.720
equation is oftentimes just
simplifying this expression.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.860
We have to figure out if we
can simplify this radical.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.090
Well, let's see.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.490
One way to figure out if a
number is divisible by 9 is to

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.320
actually add up the digits
and see if the digits

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.260
are divisible by 9.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.950
In this case, it is.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.510
2 plus 9 plus 7 is equal to 18.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.600
So let's see how many
times 9 goes into that.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.150
I'll do it on the side here; I
don't want to be too messy.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.450
9 goes into 2 97.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.190
3 times 27.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.040
27-- it goes 33 times, right?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.290
So this is the same thing as 9
plus or minus the square root

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.110
of 9 times 33 over minus 18.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.470
And 9 is a perfect square.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.650
That's why I actually wanted to
see if 9 would work because

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.390
that's the only way I could get
it out of the radical, if

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.390
it's a perfect square.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.410
As you learned in that exponent
rules number one module.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.140
So this is equal to 9 plus
or minus 3 times the square

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.230
root of 33, and all of
that over minus 18.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.570
We're almost done.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.840
We can actually simplify it
because 9, 3, and minus 18

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.650
are all divisible by 3.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.270
Let's divide everything by 3.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:14.370
3 plus or minus the square
root of 33 over minus 6.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.610
And we are done.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.010
So as you see, the hardest
thing with the quadratic

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.110
equation is often just
simplifying the expression.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.750
But what we've said, I know you
might have lost track-- we did

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.120
all this math-- is we said,
this equation: minus 9x

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.550
squared minus 9x plus 6.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.200
Now we found two x values that
would satisfy this equation

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.970
and make it equal to 0.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.830
One x value is x equals
3 plus the square root

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.100
of 33 over minus 6.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.860
And the second value is
3 minus the square root

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.160
of 33 over minus 6.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250
And you might want to
think about why we have

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.370
that plus or minus.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.490
We have that plus or minus
because a square root could

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.550
actually be a positive
or a negative number.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.180
Let's do another problem.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.890
Hopefully this one will
be a little bit simpler.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.780
Let's say I wanted to
solve minus 8x squared

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.000
plus 5x plus 9.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.150
Now I'm going to assume that
you've memorized the quadratic

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.310
equation because that's
something you should do.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.630
Or you should write it
down on a piece of paper.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.630
But the quadratic equation is
negative B-- So b is 5, right?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.160
We're trying to solve that
equal to 0, so negative B.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.790
So negative 5, plus or minus
the square root of B squared-

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.030
that's 5 squared, 25.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.470
Minus 4 times A,
which is minus 8.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.820
Times C, which is 9.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.400
And all of that over 2 times A.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.320
Well, A is minus 8, so all
of that is over minus 16.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.090
So let's simplify this
expression up here.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.440
Well, that's equal to
minus 5 plus or minus

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.630
the square root of 25.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.620
Let's see.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.220
4 times 8 is 32 and the
negatives cancel out, so

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.520
that's positive 32 times 9.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.480
Positive 32 times 9, let's see.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.720
30 times 9 is 270.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.110
It's 288.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.570
I think.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.800
Right?

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.490
288.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.590
We have all of that
over minus 16.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.560
Now simplify it more.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.760
Minus 5 plus or minus the
square root-- 25 plus

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.340
288 is 313 I believe.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.230
And all of that over minus 16.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.430
And I think, I'm not 100% sure,
although I'm pretty sure.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.570
I haven't checked it.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:10.370
That 313 can't be factored
into a product of a perfect

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.690
square and another number.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.670
In fact, it actually
might be a prime number.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.600
That's something that you
might want to check out.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.200
So if that is the case and
we've got it in completely

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.840
simplified form, and we say
there are two solutions, two

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.940
x values that will make
this equation true.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:30.750
One of them is x is equal
to minus 5 plus the square

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.830
root of 313 over minus 16.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:44.110
And the other one is x is equal
to minus 5 minus the square

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.660
root of 313 over minus 16.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.760
Hopefully those two examples
will give you a good

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.940
sense of how to use the
quadratic equation.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.860
I might add some more modules.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.230
And then, once you master this,
I'll actually teach you how to

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.370
solve quadratic equations when
you actually get a negative

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.910
number under the radical.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.140
Very interesting.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.760
Anyway, I hope you can do the
module now and maybe I'll add a

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.370
few more presentations because
this isn't the easiest module.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.840
But I hope you have fun.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.140
Bye.
