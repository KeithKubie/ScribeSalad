Role models are definitely important for the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.480
Middle East probably particularly with I think
women role models, successful , professional

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.270
women at a time when there are movements across
the region that believe the proper role for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.759
woman is to be at home, in fact sometimes
only at home. I think it's important that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:38.830
aspiring young woman who is seeking education
and career as well as family have professional

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:51.770
women to look up to and mentor them, encourage
them. I think also there needs to be people

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:02.320
who are willing to encourage critical thinking
within education, within business, within

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.308
government. The region is going to progress.
We have to have people in power to express

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:14.060
ideas that may not conform to the norm in
any of the institutions. But I think for the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.130
progress of the entire region this is important.
