00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.200
The Joe Rogan experience.
How are you?
It's fine.
I'm good.

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm pouring coffee in the first seconds.
Perfect chat.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.250
That's the good way to do it.
With a Gif of tea.
Can we?
Yeah,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.510
I think it is named in a fringe way.
A French Press.
That's what they're called.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.260
Is it called?
Well it's called,
I think it's called cafeteria,

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.550
but it's probably got a pot of coffee.
But that makes sense.
But you know,

7
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:23.290
there's a French word for it that we just ignore him.
They did a,

8
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:28.060
meant a lot of the food,
you know,
cause you have,
um,
herbs,
you know,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.810
herbs.
And I used to do this bit of a too,
which I really enjoyed seeing.
You know,

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.060
the difference between British and American.
You say this,

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.070
you say and you say herbs and we say Herb's because there's a fucking h in it.

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.900
And I used to cause a fucking age,
but,
and I thought,

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.630
well why is the h dropped off for America?
I think it's because,

14
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.420
but a lot of French guys would come over to immigration and they would have done

15
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:52.930
a lot of cooking,
you know,

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.160
so these fish guys know about cooking and they do the elves and they,

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.520
they cut the h off.
Totally.
So I think that was an influence from that.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.350
Probably Julia Child,
Julia,
Joe,
she French I think,
wasn't she?
She is now.

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.870
I mean,
usually the French cooking.
All right.
Okay,

20
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.640
well then maybe that way you sit next to Washington and say,

21
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:13.560
we will use our herbs with the staff here and then we could do the revolutionary

22
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.540
war and then a,

23
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.210
and then you'd guys a win and then they will hate each other forever.
Well,

24
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.940
you ask,
you guys also do a lot of weird stuff where you put like a,

25
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.360
you in color and you have a why and tires.

26
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.190
What are you putting in ties open I res.
Yeah,
I think we had,

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.280
we had first dibs on the laggers.
Yeah.
I don't understand what we did.

28
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.630
Do they know what you got on the,
uh,

29
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.030
your guys got on the Mayflower and they said,
okay,

30
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:38.550
we're going to talk like this for was gonna say,
whew.

31
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.330
A lot and we're going to get put,
get rid of the Y in tires.

32
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.930
If we're going to invent the tires,
get rid of the one.
Yeah.

33
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:49.350
I just think theU and color and honor is a you and honor as well.

34
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.280
And we've got it and you've got it out and I think yours is more logical on

35
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.190
honor.
Yeah.
But not for Herb's now herbs is more French influence.

36
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.600
I agree.
Yeah.

37
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.230
I always wondered because I grew up in Boston and I always wondered like those

38
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.600
were the first people to leave England and Europe.

39
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.870
Like what the fuck happened to their language because they developed the most

40
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:14.480
disgusting brand of it.
Well,
you've got your A's,
you're busted days,

41
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.100
which I kind of had a strong Boston coming out of you.
Yeah,
I got rid of it.

42
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.100
All right.
I heard myself on television once when I was like 19 years old.

43
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.810
I was like,
Holy Shit.
What is that?

44
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.600
Well you guys had or why we used to have uh,
their mother,
father,
brother said,

45
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.460
yeah,
Fan cat.
Yeah.
And we say mother,
but the father,

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.400
sister,
we don't have an r at the end of our mother,
brother,
father,

47
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:38.700
sister and you know that yeah.

48
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.760
We say mother instead of mother and the rest of America has,

49
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:48.570
it has a much stronger and island has that.
That's a very Irish influenced thing.

50
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:53.010
And for us the eye when we playing,
when I'm playing American,
when I was in,

51
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.520
you know,
doing roles like that,
the are was the hardest thing to get hard,

52
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.410
hard tar.
I remember friends saying,
Hey,

53
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.130
I was cranking this thing and it came out like hard,

54
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.300
hard tar and I thought that is the one that practice because that is just hard,

55
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:08.290
hard tar.
We'd call it hot hot tower,
which is just doesn't sound the same.

56
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.150
You spend a lot of time over you.
I've only,
the only,

57
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.460
the only time I've ever spent in uh,
England is working,
uh,

58
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.060
like a little bit of downtime doing stand up and hang out over there.

59
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.840
But most of it,
it's just been working either working for the UFC here,

60
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.840
I'd never been really get a chance to really spend time in England.
I'd like to,

61
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.590
I'd like to do that just to kind of understand you folks.
Well,

62
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.270
I are different breed when the,

63
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.790
I think at the base having played 45 countries now,

64
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.820
I think everyone is actually the same when you get down below a level,

65
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.110
but you know if you're going to reach for you,

66
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.640
there's gotta be a number of things which would make it seem different in brand

67
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.710
names will be different than the sport stars.
You know,

68
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.590
everyone's sports does everyone's policies if you have that kind of thing,

69
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.950
but underneath it all,
it's going to be,
there's going to be more mainstream.

70
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.570
People are going to be alternative people.
There's going to be,

71
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.040
and the whole spectrum now,

72
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.700
like in the old days it used to be everything was mainstream then a bit of

73
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.760
alternative.
Now we,
I think your country market,

74
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.470
we have a whole spectrum of what's interest.

75
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:10.000
People is much more open in that way.
Yeah,
no,
I certainly agree.

76
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.990
We,
yeah,
it's the collection of people is very similar.

77
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.100
It's just they're operating in a different environment in different theater.

78
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.710
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,
you know,

79
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.510
we are tightly smashed together.

80
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.980
Would it be 65 million and your 300 million and you're such a large,

81
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.310
your country is so large compared to us.
Yeah.
Um,

82
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.020
cause there was this thing of 10,
only 10% of Americans have possibles.

83
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.590
But if you look at the through,
something like that,

84
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:39.370
but then if you look at where the 10% can go in America,
it's just so huge.

85
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.970
So it's slightly more understandable why a lot of Americans say,

86
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.520
I don't need a possible cause.
I can just going to go to that place,

87
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.540
which is miles away.
