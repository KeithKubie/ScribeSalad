00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.820
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Show of hands,
who wants to make more money?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.840
Me, too.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.160
Thank you.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.380
What do you think
your financial advisor

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.870
would say if you ask him
this question and how?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.260
Nobel Prize winning
economist Harry Markowitz

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.320
once said that he would
never be 100% invested

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.040
in stocks or bonds or cash.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.369
If you think about it,
games are not so different.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970
Would you bet your
entire revenue stream

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.260
on one source of income?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
A more sustainable revenue
model calls for a mindset shift.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.000
Our industry seems
to operate in the way

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
that your monetization model
is determined by your genre.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.620
Ads for hyper casual,
IAP for rest of mobile,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
and subscriptions
for PC and console.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.700
This has worked so far.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.510
But in this talk, I'd
like to invite all of you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.900
to challenge these
assumptions together with me.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.870
Our economists friend Harry
said that we shouldn't put all

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.420
of our eggs in the same basket.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.180
Can we take learning
from other genre

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.700
and rethink our
current strategy?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.370
No rule saying that you
have to do something

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.860
just because you're
born this way, right?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.950
In 15 minutes, you'll hear
from one of your peers' about

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.360
their innovation.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.030
But first, let me set
the stage and talk

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.700
about monetization
diversification, the why,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.590
the what, and the how.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.110
Why diversify?

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.020
Our economist friend
Harry said that we

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
should balance our income
sources because it decreases

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.690
risk and increases revenue.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.410
True or not true?

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.600
If you disagree, come
find me after this talk.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.030
What you may not know is
that we also have big data

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.980
to back up this claim.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.380
We plotted the top grossing
games on this graph

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.550
to your right.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.500
Each dot is a game.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
On the x-axis is the percentage
of the game's revenue driven

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.910
by its top 5% of buyers.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.290
On the y-axis is the game's
turn buyer's reactivation rate.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.780
This means that the more to the
right, the more concentrated

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.040
is your game's revenue.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
This negative correlation
shows that if a game squeezes

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.570
its buyers, then they're
also less likely to come back

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.400
if they ever leave.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.440
Therefore, we call this
philosophy $1 out of everyone

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.690
is more sustainable than
$100 out of one player.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.610
Now, if I got you thinking about
the diversification, let's talk

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.210
about some of the
trends we've observed.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.480
Subscriptions,
rewarded ads, and IAP--

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.910
raise your hand if you have at
least one of these implemented.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.400
What about two of these?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.160
All three?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.740
Good for you.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.190
So here's the deal.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.660
I would not claim
that everything

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.660
I'll be sharing with you
today will be groundbreaking.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.180
But my hope for you is
that, after this talk,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.000
you will have learned something
new and, more importantly,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.720
find the inspiration
from your peers' stories

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.870
to try something new and add
to your current strategy.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.590
Now, raise your hand if you have
subscriptions in your games.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.852
Are you thinking about it?

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:31.560
Raise your hand if
you thinking about it.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.210
Awesome.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.510
Subscriptions is not a
foreign concept in gaming.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.200
From PC to console, many
have use subscriptions

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.340
as a content path.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.580
However, today I
would like to talk

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.490
to you about a different
kind of subscription.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.950
Instead of bundles,
how are mobile games

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.680
layering subscriptions
on top of IAP

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.620
to create different tiers
of premium experiences?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.120
The momentum around
subscription has accelerated

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.050
in mobile in recent years.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.280
On Play, we've seen a global
mobile gaming subscriptions

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.760
growth at 70% year over year.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.540
In fact, those who
implement subscriptions

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.660
reported a boost in both
retention and revenue.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.140
[INAUDIBLE] saw 20% more play.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.120
And Scopely reported higher LTV
when they have subscriptions.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.215
If those are not
enough reasons for you,

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:29.110
at Google I/O earlier
this year and also

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.800
this morning, we talk
about digital wellbeing.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.920
Many top developers like
IBM are prioritizing

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.320
sustainable growth.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.220
So I challenge you, leaders
in the mobile game industry,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.500
to think about what
does digital wellbeing

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.290
look like as a mobile game.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.860
With subscriptions, can we
restructure short term impulse

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.880
buys into a long term
sustainable benefits?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.430
Maybe instead of eating all
of your Halloween candies

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.590
in one go and possibly
regret it next morning,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.410
can't we instead have
something sweet every day

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.630
for the next few months?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.140
Designing subscriptions requires
a mindset shift from IAP.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.600
You may be tempted to repackage
IAP SKUs into subscription

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.920
bundles.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.070
It works.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.460
But there's so much
more you can do.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.800
The keyword here is access.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.560
The main difference between
IAP and subscription

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.950
is that, while IAP is about
ownership where the users get

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.650
to keep what they
buy, subscription's

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.440
about access, access
of different tiers

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.540
or premium
experiences and access

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.770
that you can gain and lose.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.620
There are two new use
cases of subscriptions.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.220
The first is aimed at
converting your buyers.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.380
These buyers are often motivated
by a good financial deal.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.600
Scopely subscriptions
offer exclusive rewards

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.380
that a early buyer would
want on top of IAP deal.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.510
[INAUDIBLE] with loss protection
and higher daily caps.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.840
This observation aims to
increase these early buyer's

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.710
time spending game to form
a habit of playing still

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.390
early in their lifecycle.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.090
The second use case of
in-game subscriptions

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.170
is to create a loyalty program
for your high value buyers.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.380
Much like the mileage
program by airlines,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.770
these players are often
motivated by prestige,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.430
rewards for the commitment
in your game, or just

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.920
to live a more
premium experience.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.320
Ludia offers their
VIP subscribers

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.740
extra currency,
exclusive tournaments,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.650
early access to new
content, and access--

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.420
again, the key word is access--

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.850
to a special durable that may
even strengthen with time.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.450
Designing access is key to
meet your in-game subscription

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.260
additive to your
existing IAP economy.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.500
If you're thinking, OK,
what about cannibalization?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.360
Hold that thought,
and wait for Fay.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.200
Now, raise your hand
if you have rewarded

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.840
ads implemented in your games.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.500
Awesome.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.068
Those with your hands raised,
you can take a nap now.

00:07:17.068 --> 00:07:19.110
Although you may want to
stay awake for something

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.380
that may be a surprise to you.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.130
Earlier this year, the Google
AdMob conducted the research

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.430
and uncovered a growing
segment of developers,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.280
who were previously
IAP only, are now

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.380
rethinking their overall
monetization strategy

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.723
and, as a result, are
implementing rewarded ads.

00:07:39.723 --> 00:07:41.640
There are three main
reasons of why you should

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.860
think about rewarded ads.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.850
The first, [INAUDIBLE] will
entice non-payers, especially

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.600
in developing countries,
emerging markets.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.300
These players, while they might
be more reluctant to take out

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.910
their wallet and
make purchases, they

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.270
might be more willing to
trade with their time instead.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.400
The second benefit
is that it also

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.450
increases overall engagement
across buyers and non-buyers.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.930
Many game developers
use rewarded ads

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:16.020
as a way to extend gameplay or
gift a minimal amount of IAP.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.330
This increases time
spent for everyone,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.350
which, in turn, increases
social liquidity, which

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.410
then enhances the experience
of everybody playing.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.670
Now, the third reason, which
may be a surprise to you,

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.530
is that it also
predicts IAP conversion.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.500
Kongregate found that,
across six of their games,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.190
players who watched an ad
in their very first session

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.800
are 2.5 to 5 times more likely
to make subsequent purchases.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.660
Of course, we can't
say that watching an ad

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.670
will cause you to spend.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.840
But there is a clear correlation
between the group of people

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.350
who watch ads and the group of
people who are likely to make

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.370
in-app purchases.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.810
Now, AdMob also shared
with us a framework

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.020
to help you optimize
your rewarded ads design.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.560
Let's see what Kongregate
has to say for each of these.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.670
For placement, rewarded ads
should be core to your gameplay

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.070
as part of the in-game economy.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.610
The reward itself should
be useful, meaningful,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.540
while not competing
directly with IAP.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.100
For targeting, everybody should
have access to rewarded ads.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.160
But the user should
initiate the experience

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.330
as to ensure to not
interrupt their gameplay.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.960
For cadence, more isn't
necessarily better.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.200
Kongregate found that six to
eight ads views per viewer

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.440
per day maximizes
return with the option

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.560
to watch at least
one per sessions.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.620
For measurement, remember
to segment your core health

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.060
metrics by app
viewership and frequency.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.440
And if you notice a
certain cohort of users

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.190
are spending less time or
money, test and iterate.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.410
Use this framework.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.980
Now, if you're itching to
test out rewarded ads quickly,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.290
this morning we announced
rewarded products

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.090
that's coming soon.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:23.580
Directly in your console, this
uses the same API calls as IAP.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.980
If you're interested, talk
to your Play BD manager.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.820
Lastly, IAP-- I will not ask for
hands as I assume most of you

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.950
have IAP implemented.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.790
But for now, [INAUDIBLE]
why game developer who found

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.700
success previously with ads
are now also pushing for IAP.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.500
Similar to the trend
with rewarded ads--

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.410
while IAP itself
isn't new, what is new

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.650
is the growing number of
developers, who were previously

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.120
ads only, are now adding
IAP to their existing titles

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.670
or developing new
IAP based titles

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.080
to increase their
portfolio diversity.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.070
For example, Tapps games,
a Brazilian developer,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.470
is known for their
hyper casual games

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.640
but decided to focus on IAP
in their Bid Wars titles.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.300
After growing the IAP
revenue by 200% and more,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.280
IAP is now an integral
part of the strategy.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.510
Let's remind ourselves
the advantages of IAP.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.540
First, it can be run and
developed by a simple team,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.310
by a nimble team with
simple infrastructure.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.580
We've seen teams as
small as 10 people

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.300
managing multi-million
dollar titles.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.550
Second, instead
relying on a huge user

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.570
base or massive
installs, IAP pushes

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.930
us to think about long term,
sustainable business metrics.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.290
And last, IAP gives you
control and flexibility

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.820
over your game and your revenue.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.450
Now, for those of you who
are thinking about IAP,

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.210
let's quickly touch on
the design framework.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.460
Yodo1 is the Chinese
publisher of Rodeo Stampede.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.690
They managed to shift their
ads to IAP ratio from 30% IAP

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.860
to 60% IAP.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.290
Let's see what they recommend.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.890
For design, keep it
simple and flexible.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.220
While try to monetize as many
users as possible, [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.920
even the user their choice of
currency such as IAP or ads.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.970
For conversion, understand what
uniquely motivates each segment

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.290
of users will help you
create targeted offers.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.720
And for retention,
content is king

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.170
and build a customizable
LiveOps system early, which

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.670
will save you time later on.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.140
Now, without further
ado, I'd like

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.860
to introduce Fay, who leads
Operations from N3TWORK,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.210
to talk to you more about
in-game subscriptions.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.346
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.570
FAY GRIFFIN: Thank you, Moonlit.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.270
Hi everyone.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.040
I'm Fay Griffin.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.580
I'm VP of Operations at N3TWORK.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.270
Who are we?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.370
We are 90 people, headquartered
in San Francisco with offices

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.820
in LA and Santiago, Chile.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.130
We believe there are
five features that

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.780
make up a great game.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.280
Gacha, we still have Gacha
card packs every week.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.860
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.280
aren't familiar with Gacha card
pack sync, Pokemon or baseball

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.270
cards.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.680
We introduce rarity in our game.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.100
We have weekly events we run.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.920
We have social component
in our game, guilds.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.218
And we also have store.

00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:43.760
Our first game out
in the market that

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.620
combines all of these features
is Legendary Game of Heroes.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.720
An overview of legendary--
it's two years old.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.390
We have guilds in the game.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.070
We run weekly events.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.680
It's primarily IAP driven.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.560
And we have VIP subscriptions.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.810
So today, I'm going to talk
to you about subscriptions

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.900
and why you should care.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.400
But before I do
that, I'm just going

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.180
to give you 30 seconds
on our business model.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.730
Most of our players don't pay.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.380
But we have a very
small percentage

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.270
of players who do pay.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.980
Now, we care about
all of our players

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.910
coming back every day, month
over month, year after year.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.020
But we especially care about
that small percent who do pay.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.060
So when we thought
about subscriptions,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.120
we saw an opportunity
to be generous.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.800
We'd happily give away
$100 in value every month

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.260
if we knew you were going
to show up every day,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.610
month after month,
year after year.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.170
And it's working.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.750
Since we introduced
subscriptions last April,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.260
our subscription based has
grown month over month.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.610
So we're doing something right.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.100
Few top lines about
our subscriptions--

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.370
in Legendary, we brand
our subscriptions as VIP.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.980
And during this talk,
I'm going to use

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.400
those terms interchangeably,
subscriptions and VIP.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.840
It's $29.99 a month.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.540
Our VIP are a small but
growing portion of our revenue.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.240
We have 30,000
active subscribers.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.690
We have a day 425 retention
of 20% with our VIP actives.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.410
We have a 95% log
in rate of VIPs.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.370
And so far, cannibalization
is not a factor.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.185
And our cost per player
is coverable by our VIPs.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.540
Some key considerations
we thought about when

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.360
introducing web subscriptions--

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.290
we thought of subscriptions
as a loyalty program

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.830
that provide premium access.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.520
Another thing to think about is
monthly versus yearly access.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.320
Right now, we just have monthly.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.810
And I'm going to tell you
a little story about why.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.510
So one of the unique things
about our culture at N3TWORK

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.320
is that we believe great
ideas can come from anywhere.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.540
And our subscriptions
actually came

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.300
from one of our client engineers
on legendary, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.220
he came to us and
said, hey, Google's

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.580
now offering the ability
to do subscriptions.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.470
I think we should
put that in our game,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:21.360
should be like the Amazon Prime
of subscriptions for Legendary.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.440
So we got a great feature
from our client engineer.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.110
But the downside was we
didn't have a 20 person design

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.730
team thinking about it.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.970
So we didn't think of all the
ins and outs of subscriptions

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.780
when we first implemented it.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.970
So we' got a really great
system but some constraints

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.810
in that it's not as extensible
as we would like it to be.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.860
But we're fixing that now.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.200
Another thing to think
about is how much

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.310
you can discount IAP for the
promise of future revenue.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.590
The bet we made was
that subscriptions

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.450
would be highly retentive.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.950
So we bet long term future
revenue would benefit us.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.480
The other thing
to think about is

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.710
that subscriptions must provide
convenience to the player.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.220
You should make it a no brainer.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.349
A subscription player, after
having experienced playing

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.940
the game with subscriptions,
cannot imagine playing the game

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.730
ever again without
a subscription.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.230
The other thing you
need to consider

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.160
is rewarding and celebrating
your loyal subscribers.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:29.100
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
through VIP events, VIP offers.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.590
Our VIPs can actually
reach us anytime

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.720
of the day to give us feedback.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.630
Subscriber players
must feel like they

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.470
belong to a community that's
appreciated by the game devs.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.845
And tie subscriptions to loyalty
programs whenever possible.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.230
So some challenges--
I'm going to talk

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.830
about intuitive messaging
and stand out UX together

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.230
because they kind
of go hand-in-hand.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.170
One thing we asked ourselves
was, how do we communicate

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.430
VIP benefits in as
clear way as possible

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.380
with as few words as possible?

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.840
One of the ways
you can do that is

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.530
by differentiating what the game
looks like for non-subscribers

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.210
versus subscribers.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.400
One way we did this
was through color.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.060
Our non-subscribers, a steady
state of the game is blue.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.170
For our subscribers, it's
purple, the color of royalty.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.480
Everywhere you
get a VIP benefit,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.610
we theme it purple as
you can see from the mock

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.080
up on the screen.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.820
If you turn off
the IAP, the game

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.680
looks very different for you.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.150
It's pretty obvious.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.220
We built it into the core loop.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.420
If you play as a VIP, you can't
help but see the benefits.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.400
If you turn it
off, it's obvious.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.030
Everywhere you lost
something is super clear.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.680
We also think of
our VIPs as they're

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.530
not only VIPs in the game
but also outside of the game.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.740
We actually have a Slack
channel where our VIPs

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.590
can communicate with us.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.820
Their customer service
tickets get flagged,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.010
and they're handled separately.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.220
Every interaction
a subscriber player

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.520
has must be a moment of
delight and reinforce

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.280
that they are a VIP.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.270
Another thing to think about
is when to sell subscriptions.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.860
We run weekly events.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.340
So we might put a
pop-up in the game a day

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.320
before an event
starts to advertise

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.450
how what you get out
of a web subscription

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.520
can help you in the events.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.210
This one I put in
here for the devs--

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.150
shared account prevention.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.340
We needed to build
into a system a way

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.430
to prevent multiple players
who share a single Google

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.670
account from exploiting and
getting unfair advantages.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.290
And lastly, you need to ensure
that you have high caliber

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.690
customer support and that
your customer support

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:50.160
team is properly equipped
to benefit your subscribers.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.360
So IAP versus subscriptions--
many people think

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.300
of subscriptions are
just auto-renewal of IAP.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.670
But we think of them
very differently.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.190
To echo what Moonlit
said earlier,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.530
subscriptions are access.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.520
They're highly retentive
long term access to content.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.780
IAP is content.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.350
It's a one time situational
purchase of content.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.620
Conceptually, we think
of them very differently.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.260
Subscriptions help
underwrite our revenue

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.720
and improve our
pay or retention.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.020
It also gives us a way to
personalize IAP offers based

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.330
on a player's subscription
tier rather than having

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.970
one store front for everyone.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.310
Subscriptions can
boost IAP economy

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.430
through increased value of
products for subscribers.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.025
And this is at no cost
to other IAP products.

00:20:37.025 --> 00:20:40.910
So in other words, we have
seen no cannibalization.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.100
Some things we wish
we considered--

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.320
Google's subscription
service has some really great

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.490
features--

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.240
free trials, auto-renewal
of trials and deals

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.090
so, for instance, three
months at a discounted price,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.940
time cards, providing
an alternative IAP

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.270
to gain temporary access to
subscribing so, for example,

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.980
like a three month
Xbox Live card.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.680
Those are all things that
are currently on our roadmap.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.780
Now, if I'm going to leave
you with three key learnings,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.200
one would be, given
its high retention,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.460
VIP subscription should be the
number one thing people buy.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.380
It should be a no
brainer to them.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.260
The value they get out
of it is a no brainer.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.170
Two, framing is everything.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.800
Celebrate, celebrate,
celebrate your VIP subscribers

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.710
both inside and
outside the game.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.490
And lastly, build fast
but maintain the ability

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.540
to iterate.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.212
This is where we are now.

00:21:38.212 --> 00:21:39.420
Thanks so much for your time.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.387
And with that, I'll
give it back to Moonlit.

00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:43.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:44.370
Thank you.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.160
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Thank you, Fay.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.220
Now let's conclude our session.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.770
As you think about the
takeaways for this session,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.330
I have three hopes for you.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.180
First, I hope you
found the inspiration

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.000
to go back and reinvent
your monetization strategy.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.540
Second, I hope that
you believe now

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.410
your past doesn't necessarily
dictate your future.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.990
And third, I hope you
will go back to your teams

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.740
and ask them, why shouldn't
we diversify more?

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.550
With this, I'll end the session
with one question for you.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.420
When was the last time you had a
sit down meeting with your team

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.860
to actively decide the current
status quo is also the best

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.360
strategy going forward?

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:28.860
Thank you.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.710
[APPLAUSE]
