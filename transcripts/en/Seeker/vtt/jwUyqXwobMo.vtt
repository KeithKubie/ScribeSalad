00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.991
Hunters say that killing rhinos, lions, elephants,
hippos and other vulnerable and endangered

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:14.519
animals will actually help protect these species,
that it's helping conservation... but IS it?

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.870
Howdy humans, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.020
In 2011, GoDaddy CEO Bob Parsons was the target,
last year it was newscaster Melissa Bachman,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.190
this year it's Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones
-- hunters killing big game are attacked every

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.900
year... and with good reason, it's difficult
to wrap our collective heads around the killing

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.660
of endangered animals.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.650
Over 61,000 people as of Tuesday have signed
a petition to remove Ms Jones' Facebook page,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.650
claiming it's encouraging animal abuse; but
in the end, hunters and conservationists aren't

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.090
at odds.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.530
They're frenemies.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.540
Modern conservation is an expensive business,
reserves must be maintained, policed and the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.560
animals protected.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.530
Governments have to be lobbied to create discouragingly
high penalties for poaching, and then enforce

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.530
those laws.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.320
We're not even TALKING about the millions
spent on conservation educational campaigns.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.860
When pictures like this hit the internet,
people freak out, but hunters claim by taking

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.200
a few trophies they're helping to keep conservation
alive!

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.950
Price tags for legal hunting range from 350,000
dollars for a black rhino trophy permit, auctioned

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.420
to the highest bidder -- it was the Dallas
Hunting Club -- to as low as 10,000 to hunt

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.689
a lion that was bred in captivity specifically
for the hunters.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.450
In 2007, 23 African nations allowed sport
hunting -- and over 18 thousands tourists

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.220
paid 200 million to those countries to hunt
lions, leopards, elephants, warthogs, water

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.909
buffalo, impala, rhinos and so on.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.450
Conservationists are trying to balance the
cost of operations with the protection of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.380
animals, and aren't having a good time of
it.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.399
According to National Geographic, there is
22 percent more area protected in those 23

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.079
African nations for hunting, than there are
for National Parks.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.159
More money on the conservation side COULD
change that.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.279
To try to raise money, conservationists turn
to deep-pocketed hunters.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.010
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species allows South Africa and Namibia, for

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.099
example, to sell five permits per year for
the hunting of adult male black rhinos.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.099
They're not the only ones.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.069
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say the
sale of hunting licenses, tags, and stamps

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.220
is the primary source of funding for most
state wildlife conservation efforts.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.769
In 2005, the profit from duck permits alone
was enough to purchase five million acres

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.890
for use as a wildlife refuge.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.459
Scientists also cite a paper in the Journal
of International Wildlife Law and Policy which

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.081
found South African white rhino populations
increased from less than 100 in 1900 to more

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:50.709
than 11,000 today, in small part due to legal
hunting practices which created a financial

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.840
incentive for people to allow the animal on
their land.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.370
A black rhino which could no longer breed
was dominating a reserve in South Africa.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.560
It was killing breeding-capable males and
chasing away others and was hurting conservation

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
efforts.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.170
They found a hunter to buy one of the five
black rhino permits and thanks to his efforts

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.810
made money to help the reserve while removing
a conservation problem.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.170
However, financial incentives aren't always
used for good.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.069
Wild lion populations are down 80 percent
in the last 20 years -- and both captive populations,

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.269
and exported lion carcasses have skyrocketed.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.260
According to a 2009 study in Conservation
Biology, 92 percent of the decimation of the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.720
lion population in Tanzania was due to poorly
managed sport hunting.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.030
Hunting itself isn't bad.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.499
It's how many in the world eat and support
their families.

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.450
Back in my home state of Michigan, opening
day of deer season was basically a sate holiday

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.459
-- and though I never agreed with killing
for fun and profit, the populations WILL get

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.530
out of control if humans don't do something.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.409
While it's sometimes not comfortable to look
at, and it's not always the BEST way to manage

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.430
a wild animal population, it can be useful
to conservationists -- when done right.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.959
