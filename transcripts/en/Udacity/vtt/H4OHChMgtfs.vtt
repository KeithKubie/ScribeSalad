00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.910
The specific objectives of this lesson are for

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.980
you to learn about how we can detect features in an image.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.840
We will specifically be looking at edges in a image and why are edges

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.810
important and how they represent the information that's available in an image.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.510
We would look at those within the context of how we can compute image

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.290
gradients and how we can actually use the computation of image gradients to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.850
support computation of edges.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.280
I will also give you a little bit of an, a background on how we

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.280
can actually compute those image gradients, in a mathematical form for

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.960
both doing continuous functions and also discreet forms of images
