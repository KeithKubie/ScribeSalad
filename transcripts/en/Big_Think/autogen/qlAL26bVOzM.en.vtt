00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.590
Well, first of all I don't think it's conspiratorial.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.250
I think it's a basic principle of journalism
to follow the money.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.050
And we have conflict of interest rules precisely
because people are human.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.900
And when you can benefit personally, economically
from policies that you are advancing, then

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.380
those policies are called into question and
the questions are raised.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.050
So that's why we have this legal architecture
to prevent obvious conflicts of interest.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.839
And the Bush administration . . . Key figures
in the Bush administration have just shown

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.729
enormous defiance in the face of those rules,
and twisted the White House lawyers in knots

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.750
trying to rationalize them holding onto these
stocks.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.660
But to me it's a broader question about the
economy . . . what I call the "disaster capitalism

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.690
complex".

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.670
And the fact that I don't believe . . . Well
I think that there's a particular way of thinking

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.980
that comes with being in the business of disaster;
being . . . You know and I'm not talking about

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.530
just any old economic holdings, right?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.550
I'm talking about those particular economic
holdings that increase, or whose fortunes

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.050
increase when things go bad, right?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.880
So oil and gas.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.320
You know bad things happen, the price of oil
goes up.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.250
This we know, right, whether it's a hurricane.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.360
Whether it's a war.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.790
Whether it's a fear of a war.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.370
Whether it's Chavez and Ahmadinejad hugging.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.140
Whatever it is bad, the price of oil goes
up, right?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.610
And the same is true for defense stocks.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.690
The same is true of Homeland Security stocks.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.950
The same is true of drug companies that are
in the business of pandemics.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.000
So this is how I'm defining broadly the disaster
capitalism complex, which is bigger than the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.470
military industrial complex.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.950
The reason why Eisenhower warned . . . gave
that famous warning in his last presidential

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.310
address about the danger of the military industrial
complex is precisely because this is an industry

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.490
that has an economic incentive for war and
instability.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.010
So I think that there is something really
significant that we need to talk about in

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.030
that the Bush administration -- the people
who have been running the government in Washington,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.790
but also the occupation of Iraq -- are card
carrying members of the disaster capitalism

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.790
complex.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.980
You know I realize . . . I don't think it
sounds conspiratorial.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.000
I think it sound obvious, right?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.890
I'm in fact embarrassed to be pointing this
out because it's such an obvious point.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.020
But it amazes me that people don't talk about
it all the time; that Dick Cheney was in the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.660
business of privatizing the U.S. military
before he went into office; that Donald Rumsfeld

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.130
was in the business of profiting from pandemics
before he went into office; that Bush was

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.080
in the oil and gas business before he went
. . . came into office; that his father was

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.790
connected to the Carlyle Group, which is a
major weapons dealer; that Paul Bremer, the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.690
chief envoy in Iraq who laid the economic
framework for the occupation, that one month

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.990
after September 11th he launched a Homeland
Security company to advise other corporations

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.180
on how they could protect themselves in this
new era; that Rudy Giuliani did the same thing

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.300
three months later.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.190
So these are all people who see profit directly
from terrorism, natural disasters, and pandemics.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.710
What is their economic incentive to get us
off this disastrous course?

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.500
I mean we need political leaders who think
disasters are bad.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.620
You know, I mean that to me is a good starting
premise.
