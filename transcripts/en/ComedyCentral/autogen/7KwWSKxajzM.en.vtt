00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.752
Good news, bad news.

00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:04.880
The bad news is that
there actually is no good news,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.132
and the other bad news
is BoJack's gone.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:09.259
Where did he go?
The shoot is at his house.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.053
I don't even know
why he'd leave.

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:13.138
This charcoal mellow bourbon
is so smooth,

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.391
every time I take a sip,
pure happiness.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.144
That was amazing.
Can I get you to say that
in a tuxedo?

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.230
Hey, I got to go.
I think this is my big break.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.941
Don't worry. I won't let it get
to my head or anything.

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.319
Hey, who told that asshole
he could sit in my chair?

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.030
Don't forget I'm your agent,
too, I want ten percent.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.156
Hello, beautiful.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.991
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.785
You're supposed to be
shooting a commercial.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.453
I know, but I was sitting
there drinking bourbon and--

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.121
They didn't give you
fake bourbon on set?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.290
Oh, they did, and then
I just mixed it with bourbon.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.917
And it hit me.

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:43.460
Why was I so upset
about Diane getting engaged?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.129
You're the one who's always
been there for me,

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.339
so I drank a lot more bourbon

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.341
and drove over to tell you
how I feel.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.260
Oh, I see what this is.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.804
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.347
Clearly, we're in love
with each other.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.058
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.768
And you're not even
really in love with her.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.144
You just think you are
because you pay her

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.355
to listen to you
talk about yourself.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.274
Diane getting engaged
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:08.235
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.405
Ha! You say that every time
something bad happens.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.323
Not getting nominated
for a People's Choice Award

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.200
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.952
It made me realize--

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.287
Getting caught
with that pound of cocaine

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:20.872
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.958
That hooker getting pregnant
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.002
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei
was the best--

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.170
Every time
something bad happens,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.214
you come running to me
for comfort.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.174
Well, it's not gonna happen
this time.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.385
I can't be your agent
and your girlfriend.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.345
-It just doesn't work.
-(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.180
I have Lenny Turteltaub for you.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.515
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.184
But remember,
I'm coming for you,

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.478
and I'm gonna make you love me.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.480
Please don't. Hey.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.359
Bad news, P.C.
Braff used your merger
as an opportunity to jump ship.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.279
Without a director, Eva Braun
is as dead as Eva Braun.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.282
As I once said
to a young Lionel Barr--

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.241
Hello? Hello?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.327
Lady, you work too hard.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:01:59.911
That was
an important phone call.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.205
Important phone call
beep boop blorp.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.540
Don't you robot-voice me.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.293
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.420
Well, I'm working,
and you are leaving.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.298
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.841
to remember me by.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.843
Since we can't be together
every second,

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.095
I give you cardboard BoJack.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.264
It's got
a light-sensitive sound chip,
so every time you walk by it,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.184
it quotes a line
from Jerry Maguire ,
your favorite movie.

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:25.562
 -You complete me.
-I don't have time for you
or cardboard you.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.230
I need to find a new director.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.858
Or you could find
my nude erector--

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:30.984
She's gone.
