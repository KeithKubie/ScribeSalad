(electronic instrumental music)

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920
- Welcome to A Conversation
With History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.240
Our guest today is Stanley Cavell,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.710
who is Professor Emeritus

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.210
of philosophy at Harvard University.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.550
He has taught at Harvard since 1963

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.070
where he was the Walter M.
Cabot Professor of Aesthetics

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.220
and the general theory of value.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.500
He's the author of numerous books,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.580
including several on film.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.260
He's visiting Berkeley

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.500
as the Howison lecturer in philosophy.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.030
Professor Cavell, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.550
- Thank you, it's good to be here.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.450
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.110
- In Atlanta, Georgia of all places,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.860
until the depression hit

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.320
and my father lost his
business and there we moved

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.330
to where he could find
a job with his brother

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.540
in Sacramento, California
and that didn't work

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.900
and we moved back to
Atlanta and that didn't work

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.040
and we moved back to
Sacramento and that didn't work

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.040
and so on, but when it came
time for me to go to college

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.300
we were in Sacramento, so I
moved 90 miles down the road

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.133
and came to Berkeley.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.900
- Uh-huh, so you come back as an alumnus?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.940
- Indeed I do.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.550
- Looking back how do
you think your parents

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.680
shaped your character?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.437
- How my parents, entirely.

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:47.810
(laughing)

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.987
- [Harry] Give me an example,

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:51.960
about both your father and your mother.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.793
- Yes.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.730
Starting with my father, the
pervasive air of the house

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.310
was that of an immigrant

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.580
who was trying to find his
way in American culture.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.150
He was brought to this
country when he was between 15

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.640
plus or minus one let's say.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.683
He was not exactly sure of his age.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.760
He had been trained as
a watchmaker very young

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.400
and he kept finding jobs, work.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890
It was a jewelry store that he had

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.363
that went bankrupt in the depression.

00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:35.363
A completely unlettered man,
but in love with learning,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.323
always spoke with an
accent which he hated,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.810
loved eloquence, which he didn't possess

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.340
except in the form of being
able to tell yiddish jokes.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.440
He was famous in our small
circle of acquaintances

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.630
for being able to spellbind any crowd,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.330
especially at the dinner table,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.700
with stories sometimes
as brief as a few seconds

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.560
with a saying sometimes
that would last 20 minutes.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.350
Now, to tell a joke and
keep people spellbound

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.410
for 20 minutes is an important matter,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.800
that's important talent.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.870
I mentioned that about him

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.780
because my most influential
teacher on my life

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.410
was J.L. Austin, whose
philosophy consisted utterly

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.030
essentially in an ability
to imagine stories

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.050
that could describe and make concrete

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.600
various philosophical concepts.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.410
So, though Austin was
completely fastidious

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.690
and an impeccable speaker of English

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960
and my father was anything but that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.930
they had in common this ability
to tell pertinent stories.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.390
My mother was the artist of the family

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.390
and I think it's fair to say
great, accomplished pianist,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.370
the best pianist in town
in that part of the states

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.400
or I didn't see any rival to her

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.660
and one of the burdens I carry

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.983
is that she gave up her career
as a concert pianist for me,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.750
so just exactly what I was to do

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.580
with that piece of knowledge?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.410
It's something I'm still thinking about.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.970
- She made this known to you?

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.780
- Well yes, I would say roughly,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.070
though she was extremely
loving, very fine,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.410
wonderful, interesting mother,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.620
it was clear that there was
something undone in her life.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.300
But she was well-known,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.480
the most prominent commercial
musician in Atlanta

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.690
since she played Vaudeville on the piano,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.233
she was played on the radio every day.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.420
- And she also played at silent movies?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.700
- And silent movies, certainly.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.010
That's a little before my time,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.260
but I heard many stories about that.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.800
- And what sorts of things
did you do as a family?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.983
I get the sense from the
introduction to one of your books

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.433
that you went to movies a lot--

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.760
- We went to the films quite
religiously, twice a week.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.100
I think probably lots of middle class,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.750
lower middle class anyway, families did.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.750
And in those days something
like half of the population

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
or more, well more, 70,
80% of the population

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.770
went to films every week and unlike now

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.910
when something like 10%
or less of the population

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.190
go to film every week.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.947
We saw the same films, so
the web of film culture

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.020
pervaded American society in
the great Hollywood years.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.290
- As a family did you talk about movies--

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.540
- As a family I have to say as a family

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.843
we didn't talk about movies.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.179
The level of conversation about film

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.350
was about the same as the
level of conversation now,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.270
which is good or bad,
thumbs up, thumbs down.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.270
Now a lot more is known
professionally about films,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.940
but it's still one of my sorrows

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.640
about American intellectual
life that film is treated,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.523
though of course, at a much higher level,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.940
and the daily journalists about film

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.690
know great deal more films
than they would have known,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.220
they know the history of film,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.470
but still the idea is that
what there is to say about film

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.090
you can say in a column or too.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.963
And I wish that the advent
of film studies in the 70s

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.310
had changed that to a greater degree

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.200
than as far as I can see it has.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.290
- Now, as a young person,
were there any books

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.970
that you read that really
affected you in a profound way

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.383
that you can recall now?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.550
- As a young person, not particularly,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.610
except when I read The
Count of Monte Cristo.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.830
I assured my mother that
it was the greatest novel

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.630
that was ever written.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.380
And then when I read Lady In Arms

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.250
I told her I had changed my mind

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.880
and that was the greatest
novel that was ever written.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.810
Otherwise, I just read
the books around the house

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.840
and it was an unlettered
household, so it was not until

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.010
fortunately, it was not until
I went to college really

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.970
and the fortunate part was
that I went rather early

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.410
because I was somewhat precocious.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.310
So in those days they used to
skip you, so called, grades,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.668
an absolutely destructive custom I think.

00:07:27.668 --> 00:07:31.810
It destroys your social life,

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.853
if not your psychological
life, both the same time,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.440
but it meant that by the time I was 16

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.060
and showed up at Berkeley,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.730
I was so dazzled by the
conversations that I found

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.110
going on in Berkeley, that it seems to me

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.170
that I didn't sleep for about four months.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.170
- Now, as an undergraduate
you were torn I gather

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.720
between being a writer
and being a musician

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.547
is that a fair description of your state--

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.610
- It's a fair description,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.100
especially of the latter
two years of my life.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.030
In the first two years I
was completely absorbed

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.240
in the life of music,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.040
particularly as it related
to theater at Berkeley.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.830
Berkeley in those days had no theatre,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.300
but it had extremely energetic

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.960
and wonderful actors and directors.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.960
And for one reason or another
it was I who showed up

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.030
most often and was awarded the rights

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.440
to write instantal music for the theater.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.830
So much of my first two, even three years,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.890
as an undergraduate was
spent composing music

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.600
either for our annual reviews,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.943
as skits and songs, or for productions.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.840
No smaller for example,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.593
than writing the incidental
music to King Lear.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.050
(laughing)

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.270
- Quite ambitious--

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.513
- Reasonably ambitious.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.440
- What years are we talking about

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.340
that you were at Berkeley by the way?

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.793
- I entered Berkeley and in '43.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.560
Yes, and I had enough credits to graduate.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.290
I didn't keep track of these things.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.440
I would take six music courses

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.880
and two other courses and so on

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.140
and I just felt this was life.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.780
I don't have any plans to
graduate or do anything else,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.870
but by 1947 I had acquired enough credits

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.010
and distribution requirements
so that in the summer

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.350
that year I was told that I had graduated.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.570
- Forced out (laughing)

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.910
- [Stanley] Roughly

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.020
- But you keep returning to Berkeley,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.673
so then you must have
really liked that first--

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.310
- I have over the years, yes.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.450
Berkeley's the place of
magic for me, still is.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.870
- As are the movies,
we'll talk about that,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.840
but then you went to New
York to a conservatory--

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.450
- I went to New York to...

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.858
To complete a portfolio of compositions

00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:06.053
to apply as a composition
major at Juilliard.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.570
I was already past the age of
the normal Juilliard student

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:18.570
so in the extension
division they accepted me

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.640
as a composition major
and within three months,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.940
two months, six weeks,
I started playing hooky

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.890
from my composition lessons,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.890
realizing that music
was not over in my life,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.530
but the idea of spending my
life as a composer was over.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.110
I no longer believed in what I was doing.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.280
It isn't that I thought
it was bad particularly.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.280
It's just it wasn't me and I
had acquired the beginnings

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.700
of an education at Berkeley
that went so far beyond music

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.170
that I was catching up
and catching my breath

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.890
and being bewildered and not
knowing what I wanted to do

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.820
and the theatre was part of that,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.910
but taking courses in literature
was another part of it.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.350
- And we should note that one
of the ways you played hooky

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.963
was you did what?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.480
- Yes, you've sneaked a look at this text

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.350
where I mention that.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.610
Right you are.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.960
Yes, well, I went while
I was playing hooky

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.930
to at least two films a day

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.163
and often to the theater in the evening.

00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:28.560
In those days 42nd Street in New York

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.850
was a place where you could see

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.690
the history of the last 10 years.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.480
It was before the porno street

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.750
and before the
reconstitution of the street,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.080
it was in the late 40s.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.350
A place where, reruns doesn't put it,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.090
it was slightly older than reruns,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.800
but if you went twice a day for months

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.420
you saw an extraordinary number
of awfully interesting films

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.040
with a terrific audience too

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.440
that really appreciated these films.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.440
And then I saw the complete
theater season of 1947

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.910
which means I would still
could see Laurette Taylor

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.660
in The Glass Menagerie,
which was still running

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.300
and I saw Marlon Brando in
A Streetcar still running

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.000
and so forth.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.810
So I had my fill of a New York experience

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.340
as well as my sense of
playing hooky from Juilliard.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.250
I had enough of the Juilliard experience

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.540
to know what it would have been like,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.520
but I had wanted all my life
to go and that's what I did,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.510
but my father being an immigrant

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.340
said first to graduate from college

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.915
then you go to conservatory.

00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:39.160
But he wanted to see the piece of paper

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.030
that saw that I had credentials
as an educated human being.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.310
But by then the chance
of starting all over

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.780
or starting a conservatory
career was for me

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.613
out of the question.

00:12:50.613 --> 00:12:53.760
- So what led you to philosophy?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.760
- Yeah, well, I could give
you a cocktail answer to that

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.793
or I could say I'm still
asking myself the question.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.199
One way, serious way
to answer the question

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:12.510
is to say that leaving music

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.570
was the first enormous basic
radical crisis in my life.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.700
I was bewildered by who I might be

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.960
if I wasn't a musician and
philosophy is after all

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.760
subject you might come
to in a state of crisis.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.720
That's one thing that happened
to me in finding philosophy,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.720
that I found in philosophy
something that not just answered

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.420
the sense of crisis, but
that in some way seemed to me

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.870
a continuation of what I wanted from music

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.870
in it's precision and in it's
profundity, was an accident,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.130
I asked myself whether it was an accident.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.130
But a third a way to answer
that is that if it's a crisis

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.680
you still have to find
representatives of philosophy

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.630
who could provide the
basis for these discoveries

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.370
and that I found at UCLA.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.130
I went there on the promise of being hired

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.610
to write some music for films maybe,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.950
but first you had to establish
residency requirements

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.430
of the musician's union, that took a year.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.900
In that year I went to UCLA and I fell,

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.040
I was hooked by philosophy,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.600
it had a wonderful philosophy department,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.600
awfully interesting people,
and that turned out to be it.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.780
There are more bumps in the road,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.850
but by and large that's what happened.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.610
- This is a silly question,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.903
but I'll ask, what does a philosopher do?

00:15:00.186 --> 00:15:03.660
- Of course the serious answer to that is

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.230
they ask themselves that
and almost everybody

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.010
has his or her own answer to that.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.240
All the great philosophers
have their answer to it.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.700
It winds up in their texts
that what they're looking for

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.860
is a definition of why their
lives have been flattened

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.430
or floored and how it came to pass

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.370
that to question themselves

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.473
was how they wanted to spend their lives.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.610
And they question themselves
and answer themselves

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.800
in as different ways as there have been

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.300
the great names in the
history of philosophy

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.770
and I regard myself
and I regard my friends

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.390
as trying to find their
way among those names.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.390
- And is it, you're
suggesting that in a way

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.060
that not knowing the
answers is part of the game

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.710
of philosophy, but in
fact developing a rigor

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.710
and a precision that allows you
to do the pursuit of answers

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.620
in a professional way.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.170
- Yeah, now the issue
of professionalization

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.393
strikes another note.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.720
So, I don't mean you didn't
deliberately strike this note,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
but if you say from there
for the past 200 years

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.603
let's say philosophers have
been professors of philosophy.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.140
Kant is the philosopher
that showed us that you can

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.730
be a professor and
produce great philosophy.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.920
It wasn't clear before,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.010
Descartes wasn't professor of philosophy

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.843
Locke wasn't, Hume wasn't,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.763
Schopenhauer wasn't, Spinoza wasn't,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.947
but you could say of them

00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:07.380
and of their successors, either
that they attempt to produce

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.623
a system that answers the
basic questions of existence.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.780
That system everyone will
say or something of the sort

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.110
has since the 17th century
converged on questions

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.020
of knowledge rather than
on questions of beauty

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.630
or of goodness, though every
philosopher has some view

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.033
of all of these things.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.030
Or, philosophers can undertake
to question all efforts

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.720
to create a system of philosophy.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.720
But in my book. the
compulsion to systematization

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.580
and the compulsion to
question systematization

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.580
are equal human drives and
so I question both of them.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.780
- And what does it take
to be a philosopher?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.860
If a student were watching this

00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:00.190
what are the prerequisites
for doing this kind of work?

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.253
- Yeah, another question one
asks oneself all the time.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.540
One sort of empirical
answer to the question

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.130
is that if you have a taste for it

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.550
and taste for it is required.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.980
I could put that as a mood for it.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.500
You get to a mood where
you can only be found

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.910
by making assertions and
finding yourself dissatisfied

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.090
with everything you've said.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.520
If you like that state
of being dissatisfied

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.930
with everything you've
said or that's said to you,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.380
you're probably hooked already

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.983
and so philosophy has chosen you.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.867
But I was going to give you
an empirical answer to it

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:52.250
and that is when you go
to college for some people

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.133
philosophy can happen early.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.900
It inevitably happens early,
but you don't recognize it.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.780
That is questions of the sort of

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.460
what was the first thing in existence,

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.270
or what is God, or is there a best thing,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.460
a best life for me to lead,
or what is love, and so on.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.690
You may stay up all night
asking yourself these questions

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.600
and you may not call it philosophy.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.430
Then when you get to college you learn

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.020
that there's a name for this.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.650
Then if you seek out the
people who know this name

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.030
and who are talking these
things it turns out,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.290
empirically, I say there's
not a theoretical answer,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.180
that those are the people
whose conversations

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.530
you want most to participate in.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.950
That is a way to discover this,

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.500
which means you need to be exposed

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.793
to these things one way or another.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.040
That's a way to test it.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.450
Another way to test it is

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.180
'cause we've all asked ourselves that.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.990
When I asked my philosophy teachers

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.090
I found I ask myself
doing this day and night.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.420
I said how do I know if
I'm really doing this

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.830
if I'm really responding in a way

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.610
that means anything to these texts

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.263
or that means anything
to anybody else but me?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.160
And the awful and the wonderful thing is

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.760
there really is no
answer to this question.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.300
A famous story for some
of us is that Lichtenstein

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.620
whom many of us do not
doubt was an original

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.190
and important philosopher,
asked this question of Russell:

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.543
Am I a philosopher or
am I a complete fool?

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.693
And Russell told him he
wasn't a complete fool,

00:20:34.227 --> 00:20:37.330
but there's still a
prior question which is

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.370
why Lichtenstein asked it of this person

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.630
and why this person was
credible to him as an answer,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.323
so you pick your shots.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.410
- You have a large body
of work in philosophy

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.760
and in our discussion I
thought it would be useful

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.680
to talk about your work on
film, which interests me

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.560
and I think will help us sort
of talk about doing philosophy

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.480
in this particular context,
but could you tell us

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.530
what the relation of your
other work in philosophy

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.610
is to your work in film or is there one?

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.663
- Oh, I hope there are lots.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.003
I think for sure there's not just one.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.790
You asked me the right
question in suggesting

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.860
that if I write about film
it's for reasons that anyway,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.073
struck me as philosophical reasons.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.533
But the question is odd,

00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:39.090
it's another one of these questions

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.990
that has different levels of answers

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.903
and on a different day I
might answer differently.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.770
But my first writing about film was

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.940
well, there are various
ways to answer this.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.360
I don't mean to stumble,
but I don't want to answer

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.410
more superficially than
I absolutely have to.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.950
In a short time

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.120
I found myself going
to films less and less

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.850
and I wondered why that was the case.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.740
It's true I could answer by
saying well, I didn't have time,

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.410
at Berkeley I was teaching
three courses every term

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.810
and I was trying to finish a
PhD thesis at the same time,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.390
so of course I couldn't go.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.130
That is not much of an
answer because for one thing

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.980
Berkeley was the best on Earth

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.430
as far as I knew to see films.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.660
Pauline Kael had in those
days started her two,

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.530
then three venues,

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.530
small rooms in which you could see film.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.870
It was an education.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.420
It was another one of those
moments eventually in my life

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.520
when I finished my PhD thesis

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.920
when I went every night
again and saw two films.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.002
Odd education, but to be
drowning in the material

00:22:56.002 --> 00:22:59.050
is really the only way
not to care too much

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.000
what you're seeing,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.350
to care a lot about what you
think about what you're seeing,

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.333
but to see everything you
can that's indispensable.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.280
And I want to know why.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.530
More basically I wasn't going
to films and I started then

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.530
out of this sense of something
missing to write about

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.470
what is this thing that I'm missing?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.960
What did it satisfy that
nothing else satisfied?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.214
So my first question is when
I ask myself what's film?

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:39.780
Philosophical question came in the form

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.400
of what's are it's differences?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.780
And from painting, from
theatre, from any of the arts

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.780
from literature, how is a
script different from libretto,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.000
all these questions.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.380
And that produced this book
that I see on the table here,

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.380
The World Viewed, but when I
said I wanted to be careful

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.123
there was a moment before that,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.850
which I believe I don't talk
about in any of these texts

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.130
that I've written that had
already given me the sense

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.490
that film meant something to me

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.280
that I wasn't able to write about

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
and that was while I was
working on my PhD dissertation.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.780
After months and months of
writing day and night on that

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.800
and teaching classes, I
decided to let myself,

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.933
because I was stuck, go to a film.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.720
And it turned out that the film

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.050
was Smiles of a Summer Night,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.693
an Ingmar Bergman film.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.920
But it probably was playing in
a real theater, real theater,

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.920
in a commercial theater,
and it may have been

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:04.950
my first my first good, not
good, my first Bergman film.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.370
I'm not sure, I had just become
aware of the Gadar films,

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.020
the Fellini films, that
were beginning to emerge

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.073
and I was fascinated.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.290
They started putting a perspective

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.340
on the films that I'd seen.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.830
Everything seemed to me
undergoing change by them.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.750
But the effect in particular
that Smiles of a Summer Night

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:35.750
had on me was that I went
back to my pathetic digs

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.320
and wrote about Smiles for a
Summer Night all night long

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.710
when I should have been
writing about my trying to add

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.653
a couple of pages to my dissertation,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.793
but it wouldn't leave me alone.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.590
And after a night of
that I had, I don't know,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.053
some thousands of words, none
of which I ever published,

00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:08.377
but they were the moment
at which I recognized

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.360
something that seems to me I've known

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.360
about the other arts
since before I could talk.

00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:18.570
I could read music it
seems to me before I could

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.190
as I recall it, before I could read words

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.280
and I'd known since then

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.300
that in the arts everything matters.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.370
This was the first time that
I had had the experience

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.470
of a film in which I had
the absolute knowledge

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.890
that everything that went
on in that film mattered.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.260
So that what writing about it meant

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.040
was to discover why each
frame was the way it was,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.417
why each gesture, why each
posture was the same as it was,

00:26:48.417 --> 00:26:52.240
and why each word was
said, not just as it was,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.900
but where it was, by whom
it was said in that light

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.180
and with that background.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.910
And so true or false, illusion or not,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.637
that was my experience of
what knowing a film was.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:11.630
And by the time some eight
years later in another country,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.930
I had by then moved back to Cambridge,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.510
this sense that I wasn't going to films,

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.310
even newer films, came over me.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.810
It was with that sense

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.273
that this is what I needed
to discover for myself.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.340
- In one of your essays you're
talking about Buster Keaton

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.880
and you're talking about how
movies give us a capacity see

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.970
and then you say "every
motion in particular,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.590
every human posture and
gesture however glancing

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.770
has it's poetry or you
may say it's lucidity."

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.100
And I guess that's what you're
suggesting happened to you

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.953
when you went to--

00:27:54.953 --> 00:27:56.440
- Good, good for you, yes.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.180
That is the sort of
experience that I was having

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.410
and what I would have
meant by saying has its own

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.020
well, the quotation, I'm not
going to say anything better

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.090
than has its own poetry...

00:28:13.448 --> 00:28:14.613
And where to characterize that poetry

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.773
means to say something lucid.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.803
This is an old Emersonian moment of mine.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.050
Emerson has a crack that when
I read it I thought yeah,

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:40.453
that's something I want
from writing philosophy.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.493
He says you need always to
look for the gleam of light,

00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:51.600
the spark, the...

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.250
What else does he call it before?

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.690
Not instinct, sometimes he calls it,

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.410
but the main thing is intuition.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.570
And the reason he says intuition

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.700
is that he wants to go on to say

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.683
for which you then go on
to provide the tuition.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.230
So providing the tuition
for intuition I could say

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.670
that's what I would like
both philosophy to be about

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.670
and to do and it's certainly what I wanted

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.180
writing about film to do.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.440
- You also write somewhere else,

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440
and I didn't write the source,

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.780
but you said "I understand
philosophy is a willingness

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.850
to think not about something other than

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.550
what ordinary human beings think about,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.750
but rather to think
undistractedly about things

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.407
that ordinary human beings
can not help thinking about."

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.773
Yes, I accept that also as philosophy.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.900
The difference in all of
these characterizations

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.700
is that they're all to specific doubts

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.160
and specific questions about philosophy.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.670
In a certain mood if you
ask me what philosophy is

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.920
I could answer it's to
think undistractedly

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.700
about what we can't help thinking about.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.483
That's an answer, but it's
not an answer I would give to,

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.063
for example, why'd you write about film?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.090
Or why'd you write
philosophically about film?

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.070
Or what's the relation of
your experience to philosophy?

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.660
How faithful do you have
to be to your experience?

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.470
Do you want to preserve your experience,

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.160
transcend your experience?

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.460
So I'm glad for these things.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.770
I've been noticing in one of
my favorite texts in the world,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.020
Lichtenstein's Philosophical
Investigations,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.790
he has an endless set of remarks
about what philosophy is.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.780
They're not endless, my old teacher Austin

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.640
would hate saying endless.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.840
He has 47 different, I don't
know how many there are,

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.960
but there are a number
of characterization for,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.510
each should be traced back
to some particular contratall

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.040
that he has had for
which he's asking himself

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.513
what's he doing, what's he looking for?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.537
- Was it a matter of some
controversy that you--

00:31:20.537 --> 00:31:24.410
- Excuse this hacking,
this has been going on

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.410
for some days, I hope you--

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.770
- No problem, but Berkeley is known for

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.090
not only it's movies and the
power of it's intellects,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.430
but also it's allergies.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.143
- It's allergies is it, I see.

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.500
Well, it's helping.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.513
I'm better off than I was
three days ago, but we'll see.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.250
- Was it a matter of
some controversy when you

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.910
a professor of philosophy at Harvard

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.783
started writing about films?

00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:56.285
(laughing)

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:04.400
- It's caused me a certain
amount of grief, that's true.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.110
But the grief, Harvard's
rather a proud place

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.620
as Berkeley is, so as Berkeley might

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.150
they figure if you're there

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.823
you probably know what you're doing.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:23.160
But there was quite a
lot of curiosity about it

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.920
and I like that.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.340
On the one hand I think
that I have wanted film

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.660
and I think it may have been a motive

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.070
that got me continuing.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.840
I've written much more about
film that I'd ever expected to.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.280
You point to three books of mine

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.920
I'm amazed by that,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.920
that's probably a quarter
of what I've written.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.860
I hadn't expected that,
but what's kept me going

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.940
was the sense that it was not a question

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.370
of why I was interested in film,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:04.370
but a question of why since
everyone is interested in film,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.350
one supposes throughout the world,

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.780
why don't philosophers write about it?

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.630
That was the question that
perhaps more than anything

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.703
puzzled, bothered, even provoked me.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.900
And one of the things I
hoped for is that I invite

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.190
I don't say there aren't any
others, but really terribly few

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.990
in all traditions, in both
traditions of philosophy

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.620
either on the continent
of Europe or by us,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.943
terribly few who take it really seriously.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.050
There are in the Frankfurt
School of Philosophy

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.620
exceptions to this, but
even Walter Benjamin

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.360
always mentions, almost
obligatory to mention

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.090
in the study of film, never
wrote a critical account

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.680
of a film and he regarded
himself as having an aspiration

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.240
to become well, one of his aspirations,

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.590
the greatest critic of German literature.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.120
but he didn't have any
aspiration to become

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.780
the greatest critic of film.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.050
He wrote some remarkable things about it,

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.840
but not that, why not that?

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.630
And it has not become, so
I have wanted to become

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.290
a normal part of what
philosophers did in their work

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.340
in aesthetics for example,
that hasn't happened.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.190
There are exceptions, it's happened more.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.970
I've also wanted to become
something that was more

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.390
a part of a university curriculum
than it has managed to be.

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.190
Of course there are now departments,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.130
but I didn't want it to
be a department exactly

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.569
any more than I want there
to be a department of books.

00:34:45.569 --> 00:34:47.620
(laughing)

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.370
Department of film, of
course, it's not the same

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.760
and film is it's own gorgeous subject

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.710
and the making of film is
it's own gorgeous craft

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.330
and having grown up as a musician

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.750
I'm not unaware of what it
takes to really become a master

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.000
or a good apprentice or a follower

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.340
or of a devotee of these crafts.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.520
Still, there is such a
thing as thinking about film

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.000
and it hasn't become as common a practice

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.850
and as ordinary, which I
would have liked to see,

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.850
and that maybe not something to deplore,

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.230
maybe something further to think about

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.850
if I could realize that
that's the way things are.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.080
It's not going to happen, then it may be

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.230
that what one should ask oneself is

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:37.230
what is it about film that
seems inherently illicit,

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.390
not really something you do
quite in the light of day,

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.370
but something you
sneaked in to the theater

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.480
before anybody quite sees
you, or when you're too young,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.170
or that secrets are being revealed

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.150
which you're afraid to reveal.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.960
There is something of that shock in film.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.330
Film is shocking.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:02.330
We know it shocking in
it's aspects of horror

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.720
but maybe it's just as shocking
in it's aspects of comedy

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.370
and we don't see it.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.370
- And you suggest in your
writings that what movies do

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:20.750
through the camera is to
focus on things we don't see

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.950
in the ordinary and to do
that watching in silence.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.250
That's very important
to your theory isn't it?

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.770
- It is, the relation of what
films construct for you to see

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:37.770
and what we see is simply
endless and I expect there to be

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.210
further and further instruction about that

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.810
as writing about film goes on.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.200
You can't help thinking about that.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.740
- I wanna get a handle on why
you went through this door

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.000
and in one of your introductory essays

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.480
you say that your father always said

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.140
that you could learn
something from everybody

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.350
on the one hand.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.350
So that that points us to
an understanding of why

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.140
you could find significance

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.480
in what appeared to be very ordinary.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.480
But you also talk about this
American cultural tradition

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.720
which is one is which
there isn't a high culture

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.860
established in the way it is in Europe

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.970
and there is a movement
between high and low culture.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.050
Both of these suggests to me reasons

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.403
why you went through this
door of film, is that fair?

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.343
- Yes, sure it's fair, it's fair.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.220
I'm an American kid

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.220
and so I went to the
Saturday afternoon movies

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.330
as American kids in my day did.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.830
And it's...

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.913
I want to answer it various
levels about this again.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:15.000
That it is a feature of American culture,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
that it is produced two of
the most admired and treasured

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.420
forms of art that can be called
something less than high art

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.620
but which really have served
to question the distinction

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.620
between high and low art, are,
after all, movies and jazz.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.340
And American film has
made it's contribution

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:51.470
to the world art of cinema
and it has been a puzzle to me

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:57.470
that American intellectuals
and academics, I include among,

00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:02.650
have not wanted to understand
and appreciate that fact.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.023
That's one level of answer.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.510
I don't want to say that America

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.510
has established it's
position in world cinema

00:39:18.236 --> 00:39:23.236
more than its rights in
the high arts of the world.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.520
Though American intellectuals in some way

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.590
don't on the whole,
treasure these matters.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.260
Why should I say that
they don't on the whole,

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:39.740
some do and maybe enough
do, but it has bothered me

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.210
that it doesn't play a
role in American thinking

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.550
and not in American philosophy in the way

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.473
that I want it to or
had hoped that it would.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.910
Speaking about that
however, is that I want it

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:05.853
to be matters of ordinary
conversation and illusion.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.060
For example, in professional discourse

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.130
in a way that it really
hasn't been able to be.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:18.560
If I want to refer to a
film in a lecture of mine

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.850
I have to think how likely is it

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.960
that this film has been seen

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.020
and if it's not likely, how
much of it shall I describe

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.870
in order to try to make this point.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.870
Whereas if I want to refer
to any novel however obscure

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.930
well, not however obscure,
but to one of the great novels

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.060
of James, or Proust, or
any of hundreds of novels

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.740
and one knows we haven't all
read all of these novels,

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.950
but there's no hesitation in referring

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.240
to what happens in this novel

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.200
not because one would
be embarrassed to say

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.860
necessarily if they haven't read it.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.090
I mean there are jokes about
who's not willing to say

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.660
they haven't finished reading Proust,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.130
but that's not what I'm talking about.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.550
I'm talking about whether
you're really communicating

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.640
something or not.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.860
What's the feeling?

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.350
You say it, if you want to go look it up

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.610
and have a chance or
think about it then do.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.910
You don't just say I
like to teach that way

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.660
as well as give public lectures that way.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.660
I like to say something
beyond what students are apt

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.750
to have at their command,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.790
partly to say there's a large world

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.880
go find out, partly to
say you may not have heard

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.510
of this yet, but you will and
here you can work your way

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.820
back and find something to do with it.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.980
Film has not become easy in that way.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.570
It isn't as though people
will feel grateful if you say

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:53.140
oh, you should see this and
relate it to these other things,

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.490
treat it in this way.

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:56.310
I'm still asking myself why not?

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:01.310
That is why I think again as with films,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.580
as with music, as with
the arts, the arts differ.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.870
You should try to see everything
as well as hear everything.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.310
But I also think as I've
said, you should discriminate

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.773
and find out which gets to
you and then ponder why.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.780
And I don't on the whole
find as many occasions

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.000
for that as I would like,
so I write books about it.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.350
- And let's talk about the two major books

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.813
that you've written on film.

00:42:30.813 --> 00:42:35.170
One is called Contesting Tears:

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.700
The Melodrama of the Unknown Woman

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.000
and the other: Pursuits of Happiness:

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.680
The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.680
Now both of these suggest
that, the two sets of movies

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.900
that you're studying and we'll
talk about that in a second,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.740
really are a kind of important moment

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.340
in the evolving consciousness
of women about their,

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.990
on the one hand, relationship
to men, and on the other hand

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.425
about their determination
of their own lives

00:43:10.425 --> 00:43:13.000
and the realization that
they don't need men,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.740
that they want to go it alone.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.740
Talk a little about why you
chose these two sets of movies.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.720
- We are having the same problem.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.293
It's a question of where I dig into this.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.900
I think I'll take it in stages

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.000
about the the more important of the text.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.980
The more fundamental is the
book on remarriage comedy

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.080
because the melodramas I
say are derived from them.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.750
I care about the melodramas
and it's very important

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:55.750
what you've just said that
there are these two to the day,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.450
one light, one dark.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:04.240
In the comedies a certain
agreement to marriage

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.520
is arrived at, it's very ambiguous.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.780
In the melodramas, marriage
as a possible state

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.453
for these women is rejected,

00:44:15.003 --> 00:44:17.920
but the fact that one is
derived from the other

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.960
means that these women are
connected to one another,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.690
I call them sisters of one another,

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.500
and why one takes one path

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.120
and why another set takes
another is the subject of both,

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.090
well, especially the second book

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.530
about the comedies.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.170
It happened to me as happened
to so many people in the 60s

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.990
that we rethought our
existence as professionals,

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.093
as teachers, as members of
universities, as Americans,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.993
during the Vietnam War.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:57.110
As a part of my incessant
conversations with students

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.930
in those days about everything,
the world opened up.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.700
We talked about things you
would never dream having,

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.510
I wouldn't have dreamed that
I would be talking to students

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.140
about whether they should
enlist for the army,

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.400
whether they should get married,

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.853
whether they should stay
in school, endless topics.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.680
We were going to movies again together

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.853
and I tried giving a course about films.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.440
I wondered in my relation to the young

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.520
how the movies that I
treasured when I was young

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.773
would hold up now.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.840
This is after I had started
thinking about the earlier book

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.840
on the ontology of film on the world view

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.850
and I had some things that I
could already say about film

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.690
but now I wondered how about
really choosing the films

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.200
that I recall as mattering to me.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.990
So I gave a course in
which from memory I ordered

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:59.893
but then I thought the
test case will be comedies.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.150
If you can share a sense of humor

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.810
then you know that the generations have,

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.570
everyone was talking about generation gap

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.630
and so on in those days,

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.150
I thought well, suppose we
could share senses of humor

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:16.150
that would matter to me,
so I ordered some films

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:20.790
that I remembered and it
turned out that the seven films

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.650
I maybe miss remember, but the bulk,

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:26.280
at least five of the
seven films that survived

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.380
and form the basis of
Pursuits of Happiness,

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.910
The Comedies of Remarriage,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.100
were among those I
remembered as being the best

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.086
and most memorable of
the comedies that I saw

00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.553
growing up in the 30s and in the 40s.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.160
- And these are movies
like It Happened One Night,

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.410
Adam's Rib...

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.033
- Exactly, Bringing Up Baby,
The Philadelphia Story,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.373
His Girl Friday, The Awful Truth.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:00.430
And when we screened them, they held up.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.050
The students were
absolutely involved in them,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:09.110
absolutely ready to go through
and talk until we dropped

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:10.610
about what was going on in them.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.400
This was exhilarating for me
and the more we got into them

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.630
the more fascinated I came by them

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:22.740
and then I had one of
those clicks in the head

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.573
in which I saw what they seemed to have,

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.940
some process they seemed to share

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:34.740
each in a different way
and that is the feature of

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:40.870
not as in classical comedy, a
young pair getting together,

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.520
fighting, obstacles to their romance

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.763
usually in the form of the woman's father,

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.640
but winning out in the end

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.940
and the comedy closing in some festival

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.940
generally called marriage,
but on the contrary

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.300
beginning with trouble,
beginning with threat of divorce

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.850
on the part of an older
pair where the narrative

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:08.510
is to find it's way to
getting the pair back together

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.370
or in the title of, not great,

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.710
but still a member of the genre,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.000
getting the pair together again.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.700
And it turns out that that one difference

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.400
turns out to have an indefinite sequence

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.823
of features that differ.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.440
- You make the point in the book

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.290
that this is actually a coming together

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.000
or the number of factors
both in Hollywood,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.010
the generation of actresses
that were appearing

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:42.010
in these movies, all leading
to a kind of rethinking

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:48.230
of a woman, her role in society,
in her relationship to men

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.830
which would have also been
very relevant to the times

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.390
you're talking about, the 60s,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.040
when you were doing this writing.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.450
- It would have been or
especially just a little bit later

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:03.853
when these issues more and more
occupy the center of stage.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:10.210
Yes, I don't know that it was for,

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:15.490
it couldn't have been
exactly explicitly for me

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:18.053
because it was on the social agenda yet,

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.210
but there I retreat to the more personal.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:25.850
I grew up with a professional
woman as a mother

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.640
and I knew then that
she was not really like

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.060
the other mothers of the friends of mine

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.830
who were at home and when I would read

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.936
that the Hollywood tearjerker were made

00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:44.936
for isolated wet afternoons
in darkened movie theaters

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.320
I thought my mother
didn't go to the movies

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.750
in the afternoon, she was working,

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:53.870
so when you're talking about?

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:57.250
They can't have been made just for women,

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.433
so for whom were they made
and what are these films?

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:07.830
And it turned out that the films

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.300
that I thought were the best

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.300
were themselves preoccupied
with women of this character

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:21.140
who demanded equality with the men.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.560
They demanded something
that they called marriage.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.960
The difference between the
women who accept marriages

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.560
they find it, when in the melodramas

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.420
the women don't find it and
they won't accept anything else.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.650
There might be other reasons

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.610
why they don't want to
be married to a man,

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.940
but one reason is they
haven't found any man

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.410
for whom it's worth it.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.960
So what they do is resist
society's compulsion to marry.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.040
How they find the strength to resist that

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.020
in those days is something else.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:57.020
So of course it occurred to
me to ask why are the films

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.950
that I find best in the
Hollywood productions

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.010
and I'm not the only
one who finds them best,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.540
those films, those Hollywood
comedies are beloved worldwide

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.790
and they were seen by
the directors of films

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.510
all over the world, Indian directors,

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.150
Japanese directors, Russian directors,

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.480
Chinese directors, all knew
these films, admire them,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.333
learned from them, treasured them.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.740
The best collection
I'm told of these films

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.690
now exists in the Soviet Union.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:29.910
I don't know whether the archive

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.613
has been opened up yet or not.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:37.110
I'm glad to know that there
are perfect prints available.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:38.403
I hope, they need to be,

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.080
but the question why they
should be about such women

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.700
is a standing question.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.070
They saw something in them.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.930
Now does it have to be...

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:55.470
Can they only be made by
actually casting women

00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:01.020
born between 1904 and 1911 as Irene Dunne,

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.020
Barbara Stanwyck, Katharine Hepburn,

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.010
all were or are there equivalents?

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.960
Now you know they're not
the only women of this kind,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.610
so that's one something I take
it that you're referring to

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.810
and saying things came together then

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.080
in order to make these
films, that's right.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.620
So a question that comes after that is

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.870
do these films continue to be made?

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.580
Well, evidently they don't
continue to be made in that form

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.580
so what does one expect of them now,

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.050
what's come together now?

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:37.420
I don't really know how
to answer that question.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.350
For one thing, film doesn't
play the same cultural role

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:42.183
in the states.

00:52:42.183 --> 00:52:47.183
Now, if only 10% as opposed
to 90% of the population

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.040
now goes to films every week
and they see different films

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.400
it stands to reason that
what's called a star

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.790
is a much more evanescent thing

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.083
than what a great star was
in the 30s or 40s and so on.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.360
Not at all to say there
aren't absolutely first-rate

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.520
and wonderful fascinating films made,

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.960
but they're not made so to
speak out of the same mold

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.253
and reliably and a
certain number every year.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.530
- So now we've come to understand
why you went to the movies

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:24.160
why you became a philosopher
and began going to the movies

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.740
as a philosopher and thinking
about them in that way.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.580
But movies are a mass media,
so what I would like to ask you

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:36.070
is how would you distinguish
the way you respond to movies

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:39.810
versus the way a mass audience,
what do movies do to us

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:42.820
and what is the distinction to be made

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.793
about how a philosopher responses to them?

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.080
- Yeah, well, I hope to heaven
that I respond to movies

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.760
the way everybody else responds to movies,

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.223
otherwise I wouldn't trust
what I said about them.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.200
It may be that I trust
them to be saying something

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.220
more than most people do.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.750
It maybe then when a tune
gets stuck in my head

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.880
or an image gets stuck in my head

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.440
I figure there's a reason why
and I'm on the lookout for it

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:23.010
maybe more than others
do, but the impact I hope

00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:29.132
is just a plain down and
dirty being overwhelmed impact

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.913
to talk about what that is.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:40.350
Why they are overwhelming
is a part of an ongoing

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.463
aesthetic inquiry into what films are.

00:54:43.463 --> 00:54:46.080
What it is about them that allows,

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.680
The World Viewed as I think
is much about that question

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.280
as about anything else.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.500
It used to be that you could
say it's one of the things

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.650
about film is that the
gigantism of the images

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.770
which dwarf you, which infantilize you,

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.490
which make you speechless.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:08.580
But maybe one can see smaller images now

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.763
and still have an experience of film,

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.100
but now there are so many
intricacies and technologies

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.590
involved that somebody's
going to have to rewrite

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.106
all of this for each
of these technologies.

00:55:22.106 --> 00:55:24.330
I think there's nothing a priori

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.940
about how they transfer to one another

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.690
so when I talk about film
I'm still talking about

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:32.680
the screening on a big screen,

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:37.550
and now even what an
audience is is different

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:40.270
from what an audience is anywhere else.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.853
That is I distinguish
roughly just to begin with,

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:49.060
one difference between
the audience of a film

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.500
and the audience in a
theater is that the theater

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.190
still feels like the assembly of a city

00:55:55.190 --> 00:56:00.190
and in a movie you can
be simultaneously two,

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.200
you can be alone, that's
one important experience,

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.340
but you could be two

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.100
and that could be an
extremely important audience,

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.563
the two of you there,

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.820
and it can be worldwide at the same time.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.100
So all this just has to be unraveled.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:25.050
Just takes patience to figure
out what these things are

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.610
and to take individual moments.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:33.430
For example, film can be,
I think it was Thomas Mann

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.200
who was convinced that
film was not an art,

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.030
various people have
been convinced that film

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.000
is not an art for
different kinds of reasons.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.840
One is I'm repressing
his name for a moment,

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.320
very well-known writer,
mostly about silent film

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:55.180
an esthetician, whose idea
was it couldn't be art

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.210
because it was photography

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.760
and photography just copied the world

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.830
so that can't be on, well
that's not a very heavy reason

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:04.690
any longer since one doesn't
feel that photography

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:06.842
copies the world and so on.

00:57:06.842 --> 00:57:09.270
But what he was responding
to may have been something

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.990
that Thomas Vaughn was
responding to that I alluded to

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:15.120
namely that the experience
is too overwhelming

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.300
for it to be art, it's something else.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:21.900
It hits you like circus does

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.260
or like an overwhelming sports event

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.020
or an automobile accident

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.560
which Gadar almost says
in one of his films.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.930
So that's not a response that
you could really attribute

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.280
to something that's artful or is it?

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.380
Can you make of that
something that's ponderable

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.600
something that has a sublimation

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.220
into intelligible shareable responses,

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.180
not simply isolating
responses of this kind,

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.603
but to be continued.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.910
- On that note Professor Cavell,

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:58.250
I want to thank you very much--

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.330
- Well, is our time up, thank you.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.267
- Yes, our time is up

00:58:01.267 --> 00:58:04.040
and this has been a fascinating Odyssey

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:09.040
that took us both through
your work in philosophy,

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.740
but also we went to the movies.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.020
- We did a bit go to the movies.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.330
Well, I appreciate it,
I enjoyed it very much

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.350
and I apologize again for the sniffles.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.440
- No, thank you, but
thank you for coming back

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.973
to Berkeley and come back again.

00:58:19.973 --> 00:58:20.840
- [Stanley] It's a pleasure.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.880
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.598
for this conversation with history.

00:58:25.598 --> 00:58:29.598
