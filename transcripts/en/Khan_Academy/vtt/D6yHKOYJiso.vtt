00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.020
What is the least common
multiple, abbreviated as LCM,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.850
of 15, 6, and 10?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.949
So the least common
multiple is exactly what

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:10.740
the word is saying.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.054
It's the least common
multiple of these numbers.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:15.970
And I know that probably
didn't help you much.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.620
But let's actually work
through this problem.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.161
So to do that, let's just think
about the different multiples

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.880
of the 15, 6, and 10 and
then find at the smallest

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.160
multiple, the least multiple,
they have in common.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.170
So let's find the
multiples of 15.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.580
So you have 1 times 15 is 15.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.280
2 times 15 is 30.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.740
Then if you add 15
again, you get 45.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.880
You add 15 again, you get 60.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.100
You add 15 again, you get 75.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.370
You add 15 again, you get 90.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.560
You add 15 again, you get 105.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.745
And if still none of
these are common multiples

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.245
with these guys over here, then
we might have to go further.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:56.640
But I'll stop there for now.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.310
So that's the multiples
of 15 up through 105.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.060
Obviously, we can
keep going from there.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.335
Now, let's do the
multiples of 6.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.160
1 times 6 is 6.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.700
2 times 6 is 12.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200
3 times 6 is 18.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.250
4 times 6 is 24.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.486
5 times 6 is 30.

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:23.640
6 times 6 is 36.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.680
7 times 6 is 42.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.120
8 times 6 is 48.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.030
9 times 6 is 54.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.490
10 times 6 is 60.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.800
60 already looks
interesting, because it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.985
is a common multiple
of both 15 and 60,

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:39.610
although we have two
of them over here.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.150
We have a 30, and we have a 30.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.170
We have a 60 and a 60.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.760
So the smallest common
multiple, so if we only

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.710
cared about the least
common multiple of 15 and 6,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.320
we would say it's 30.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440
So let me write this
down as an intermediate.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.700
The LCM of 15 and 6, so
the least common multiple,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.870
the smallest multiple
that they have in common,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.710
we see over here.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.090
15 times 2 is 30.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140
And 6 times 5 is 30.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.960
So this is definitely
a common multiple.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.251
And it's the smallest of all
of their common multiples.

00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:11.624
60 is also a common multiple.

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:12.540
But it's a bigger one.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.160
This is the least
common multiple.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.660
So this is 30.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600
Well, we haven't thought
about the 10 yet.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.010
So let's bring the 10 in there.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.660
And I think you already
see where this is going.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.470
Let's do the multiples of 10.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.730
They are 10, 20, 30, 40.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.350
Well, we already
went far enough,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.130
because we already got to 30.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.040
And 30 is a common
multiple of 15 and 6.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.250
And it's the smallest common
multiple of all of them.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.270
So it's actually the fact
that the LCM of 15, 6, and 10

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.789
is equal to 30.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.080
Now, this is one way to find
the least common multiple.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.920
Literally just look at the
multiples of each of the number

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.510
and then see what the
smallest multiple they have

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.350
is in common.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.820
Another way to do
that is to look

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.670
at the prime factorization
of each of these numbers.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.450
And the least common
multiple is the number

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.550
that has all of the elements
of the prime factorizations

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.140
of these and nothing else.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.450
So let me show you
what I mean by that.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.960
So you could do it this way.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440
Or you could say 15 is the
same thing as 3 times 5.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.149
And that's it.

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:19.440
That's its prime factorization.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.790
15 is 3 times 5.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.800
Both 3 and 5 are prime.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.346
We can say that 6 is the
same thing as 2 times 3.

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:27.846
That's it.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:29.440
That's its prime factorization.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.830
Both 2 and 3 are prime.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.610
And then we can say that 10 is
the same thing as 2 times 5.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.220
Both 2 and 5 are prime.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.210
So we're done factoring it.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:49.510
And so the least common
multiple of 15, 6, and 10 just

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.410
needs to have all of
these prime factors.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.880
And what I mean, to be clear, is
in order to be divisible by 15,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.180
it has to have at
least one 3 and one 5

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.760
in its prime factorization.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.970
So it has to have at least
one 3 and at least one 5.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.520
By having a 3 times 5 in
its prime factorization,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.780
that ensures that this
number is divisible by 15.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.890
To be divisible by 6, it has to
have at least one 2 and one 3.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.870
So it has to have
at least one 2.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.500
And we already
have a 3 over here.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.529
So that's all we want.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.709
We just need one 3.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.310
So one 2 and one
3, this 2 times 3,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.319
ensures that we
are divisible by 6.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.360
And let me make it clear.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.760
This right here is the 15.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.090
And then to make sure that
we're divisible by 10,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.550
we have to have at
least one 2 and one 5.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.600
These two over here make sure
that we are divisible by 10.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.190
And so we have all of them.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.990
This 2 times 3 times 5 has
all of the prime factors

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.990
of either 10, 6, or 15.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.060
So it is the least
common multiple.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.430
And so if you multiply this out,
you will get 2 times 3 is 6.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.370
6 times 5 is 30.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.740
So either way, hopefully, both
of these resonate with you.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.680
And you see why they make sense.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.960
This second way is
a little bit better

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.920
if you're trying to do it for
really complex numbers, numbers

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.940
where you might have to be
multiplying it for a long time.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.140
Either way, both of
these are valid ways

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.604
of finding the least
common multiple.
