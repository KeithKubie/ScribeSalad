00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:03.570
All right, so we got some practice
in how to use a bunch of different

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.510
user interface controls,
like how toggle buttons work in Android.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's keep building on that.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.220
This section is all about menus.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800
We will practice how to
make an options menu.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.940
You've probably accessed it previously
on your Android phone by tapping

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.100
the three dots on the top bar.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.860
We will also learn how to make
a pop-up menu and a few other things.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.670
So here's the drill.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.560
We've found the best tutorials on the
Internet on how to use menus in Android.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.590
What we want you to do is to read
the tutorials, follow the instructions

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.870
therein, and then create new apps to
learn more about how to use these menus.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.370
Here we go.
