00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:04.990
MALE SPEAKER: I think developers
have a common language, even

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.029
though we come from different
cultures and backgrounds.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.250
MALE SPEAKER: We're able
to speak in terms of code.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.080
MALE SPEAKER: Everywhere in the
world, if there are hackers,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.247
they can become
like best friends.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:20.830
MALE SPEAKER: You can throw five
of us from all over together,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.621

and build something.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.040
MALE SPEAKER: We're all
striving towards the same goal,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.280

the developers!

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.600
And meet them, and form or
join a community with them.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.850
MALE SPEAKER: Learning from
others and teaching others

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.030
is more important to
us than anything else.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:49.480

MALE SPEAKER: Google
I/O happens once a year,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.520
and it shouldn't be all
about just San Francisco.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.290
Google I/O Extended isn't
just a satellite event,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.690
it's an event in itself.
