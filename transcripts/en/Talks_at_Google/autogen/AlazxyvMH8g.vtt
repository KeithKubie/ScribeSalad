00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.700
SPEAKER: Now I would
love to welcome

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.256
to the stage, both
Alfredo and Angelita.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.630
Please join me in
welcoming them.

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:20.356
Could you both just tell us a
little bit about yourselves?

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:21.970
Angelita, let's start with you.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.970
ANGELITA BAEYENS: Thank
you for having us today.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.136
My name is Angelita Baeyens.

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:29.590
And I am the firm director of
program at Robert F. Kennedy

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.689
Human Rights.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.439
ALFREDO ROMERO: My
name is Alfredo Romero.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.810
I'm the executive director
of Foro Penal Venezolano,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.940
which is a human rights NGO
that works in Venezuela.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.300
And we assist,
pro-bono, the victims

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.540
of repression in Venezuela.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.560
SPEAKER: Great, thank you.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.930
Alfredo, through your work--

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.900
through your human rights
organization, Foro Penal,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.260
you've helped over
10,000 people.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.910
I had outdated data.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.215
I thought it was 4,000.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.720
It's actually 10,000,
which is incredible.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.296
So you've helped
over 10,000 people.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.170
Can you tell us a little
bit about your work,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.110
as it pertains to the
restrictions on freedom

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.367
of expression?

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.450
ALFREDO ROMERO: Well, yes.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.880
We have assisted more
than 10,000 people

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.340
because we've been
working since 2002.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.830
Actually, we started--
or I started, myself,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.470
assisting the family of one guy.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.770
His name is Jesus actually-- or
was Jesus-- and 18 years old--

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.020
a boy who was killed.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.730
He was shot in his head.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.830
So at that time I thought that
was going to be my only case.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.640
I though who cares?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.910
I'm going to assist this guy,
because the family actually

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.510
came to me.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.280
I can tell you the whole
story is longer than that.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.690
But then after that,
a second family

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.030
came to me, and the third
one, and the fourth one,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.540
or whatever.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.998
And I actually
thought it was going

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:55.670
to end in 2002,
because I mean, I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.310
wasn't used to assist victims
of a stage repression.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.310
This guy was actually
killed in a mass protest

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.150
that happened in 2002.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.320
And well, actually,
repression increased a lot.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.270
And so, at this moment,
we have assisted

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.450
more than 10,000 people.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.870
We're talking about the
victims of a [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.010
including people that has
been [INAUDIBLE] detained.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.610
They are also forced--
disappeared basically.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.050
People have been killed.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.600
People have been tortured.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.000
And the number has
increased a lot.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.990
How we help them?

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.440
Well, we assist them
legally, but legalese,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250
meaning you could talk about
the legality in Venezuela

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.880
of the judicial system.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.990
It's something that is not--

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.800
I mean, it is very
important for the world.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.050
It's very important for us, but
for a government that actually

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.570
control absolutely everything--

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.610
to work as a lawyer is minimum--

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.650
a percentage of the
work that you do.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.940
So actually, we do campaigns.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.520
We do a lot of different
things in order

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.130
to increase the
cost of repression.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.880
That's actually what we do
more than assisting legally all

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.420
these victims of repression.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.620
So we hug, I would
say, the families,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.530
and we help everyone--

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.890
the families, or the
friends, or whatever--

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.870
even looking for people
that are being disappeared,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.120
so that's actually what we do.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.510
But there is a very
important thing that we do,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.030
and I realized that that was
extremely important recently.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.400
We registered all the detainees
and victims of repression.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.460
You can imagine and then
realize that if you haven't--

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.560
if you were in there,
registered and everything,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.990
nobody would know how many
people have been detained.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.180
And this is very
important-- where they are.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.700
And that's a very
important thing

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.920
that we are doing right
now besides things

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.700
that we do with victims.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.510
SPEAKER: And can you talk a
little bit about basically

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.310
how the organization has
reacted in the assembly

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.050
and creating awareness
due to technology?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.010
How has your organization,
in the context of association

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.960
and assembly, reacted in
terms of restrictions on that

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.850
as well?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.890
ALFREDO ROMERO: Well,
we live in a country

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.780
that everything is
being controlled--

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.920
freedom of expression.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.550
I mean, it doesn't exist as you
know here in the United States

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
and in free countries.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.550
So we don't have an
opportunity to go to the media

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.660
and talk about what we do.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.930
Actually, that's something
that happened until 2007--

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.910
there was a very important
thing to happened--

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.590
that they closed--
the government closed

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.250
a very important TV channel.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.880
The name was RCTV.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.720
And I'm telling you about it,
because that channel, at least

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.410
I was able to go in and
denounce what was going on

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.327
and all the situation
that was going on.

00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:32.660
At this moment, it's impossible.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.020
You don't have a media
that you go and talk

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.350
about what is going on.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.380
And the media actually
doesn't show what is going on.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.060
They don't show when
somebody is detained,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.730
or when somebody is killed,
or when somebody's tortured--

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.124
something that we do--

00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:49.040
we do it by ourselves.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.256
So what we do in order to
continue working, and showing

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:56.630
people what is going on, and
to increase political cause,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.790
we use social media.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.560
For us, social media
is extremely important.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.710
That's something
that, actually, I

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.130
didn't know too much about it.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.930
I started using
social media in 2009.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.350
That was the first
student I actually helped.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.686
He was just the first
student that was actually

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:15.560
[INAUDIBLE] detained.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.600
His name is Julio.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.140
I remember-- just to tell
you an anecdote about it--

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.370
he was taken to the court.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.960
And this guy was 21 years
old at that time-- maybe 20.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.270
He was very thin--

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.700
very naive.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.180
And he was at the
doors of the court,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.610
and I took a picture of him.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.320
And it was in Twitter actually,
so I published it in Twitter.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.020
I didn't know too much
about Twitter at that time,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.830
but I used it.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.730
And I took that picture.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.290
I mean, all Venezuelans
saw the picture,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.230
and they were all reacting
about this student that

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.620
was taken to prison.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.520
And it was extremely important,
because after that, a hunger

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.850
strike started of
students claiming

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.380
for the release of this guy.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.710
And actually, he was
released in 22 days.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.810
And so, that was very important.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.550
After that, I've been using
social media as most--

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.240
I would say it's the most
important tool for increasing

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.180
the cost of repression, because
it's not that you can tell it

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.530
to the world like easier,
because it's not that you

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.810
have the media there to--

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.490
I mean, the media
story Even they,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.177
they're controlling
by themselves

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:53.260
because the government's
actually putting pressure

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.830
on them, or their government
just control the whole media

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.660
because they have all state.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.340
You know, the public,
the channels, the media

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.640
is being controlled by
the government and state.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.270
But so, that's the
way that we actually

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.920
show people what is
going on the world,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.050
so this is extremely
important, the way

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:20.750
how we can work without
having freedom of expression--

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.830
the way of this
as you know how--

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.837
you know how it works.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.420
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.320
And you briefly touched
on, a little bit ago,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.016
your work with detainees
and alerting the families.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:30.640
Could you talk a
little bit about that,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.559
what that looked like
before your work,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.039
and what it looks like now?

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.080
ALFREDO ROMERO: We work--

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.980
I always say that we work in
the darkness and solitude,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.280
because when there is a mass
protest and a lot of people

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.760
are out on the streets
and protesting, at least

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.330
you are with your family,
your friends, and all of that.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.890
When we start working--

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:57.180
when people are arbitrary the
thing after the protest ends,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.080
it ends because of repression.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.230
What we do, actually--

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.390
people in Venezuela
know Foro Penal,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.090
and they know that we help
people that are being betrayed.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.750
But more than that, they
know that the only way

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.400
to know where their son,
or daughter, or mother,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.920
or father was taken
is to call Foro Penal.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.770
So what we do-- we were
more than 4,000 volunteers

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.370
right now.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.050
It's incredible.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.670
I mean, it's a very
big organization.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.640
What these volunteers
do is not just lawyers.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.240
We are right now formed by
more than 160 lawyers all

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.860
around the country.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.560
But what the volunteers do--
the volunteers are the ones.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.450
I'm talking about the volunteers
are a student, a mother,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.020
or whatever.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.810
I mean, even
volunteers were already

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.490
victims of repression
at some point,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.990
so they help Foro Penal--

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.480
helping other victims.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.200
So they go-- because when
you're detained, technically,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.720
in Venezuela, your
force disappeared.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.510
I mean, there are
forced disappearances,

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.510
because you don't know
where you're being taken.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.040
It's not that you call
800-government for Venezuela,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.062
and then you find out where
your son is being detained--

00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:14.770
or your daughter.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.110
So that's what we do actually.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.440
We work at night
until the morning

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.880
in order to know where these

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.400
SPEAKER: --the
family members are.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.790
ALFREDO ROMERO: No,
where the people--

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.540
the detainees are.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.360
So the families call us,
and we tell the family,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.851
go to that place,
because we have found out

00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:33.100
that this guy's in that place.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.270
So whenever we found
out, for example,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.090
Pedro is in whatever place--

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.140
and how we find it out?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.640
Well, because we talked to the
custodians there, and you know,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.980
it's not like an official thing.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.359
So we do it like underground.

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:50.150
So we talk to them.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.130
Is this guy here?

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.520
So then when you find out
that this guy is there,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.730
because somebody tells
you that this guy's there,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.170
sometimes you find out
that there are 10 others.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.630
So we start helping
these people.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.810
So we tell the families.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.210
We use Twitter basically
or social media to tell,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.140
this guy has been
detained in this place.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.170
So the families call us,
and come to the place,

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.120
and they know where they are.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.200
And then the whole
process started.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.475
So some of them are
taken to the court.

00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:21.960
Some of them are not.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.280
But it's more important
that, because you

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.161
have to provide food
to these people.

00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:28.660
Because these people-- it's not
that you are being detained,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.430
and you have food and water.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.230
I mean, you don't have
even food and water

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.280
if you are not detained.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.210
So you can imagine in Venezuela.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.954
So you can imagine how
if you are detained.

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:39.370
I mean, you have
to provide water.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.600
So you have to bring water.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.650
You have to bring food.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.860
You have to bring everything
to these people that

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.570
are being detained.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.840
But it's actually
important, because as I

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.450
said before, you imagine
if we were in there,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.680
nobody would know where
the detainees are.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.340
So I've been talking
just since 2014.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.840
January 2014, there
have been exactly--

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.240
till today-- 11,903
people that have been

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.840
detained for political reasons.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.360
And we have it registered.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.914
Now, we have a very
sophisticated database.

00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:19.330
So we have registered
everything--

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.720
the place where
they were detained,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.430
the age, the profession.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.510
I mean, we know everything-- how
many women have been detained.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.390
This is very
confidential information,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.090
but we have
absolutely everything.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.110
So it's not that we-- when I
said that there had been more

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.890
than 10,000 detainees--

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.210
11,903-- it's not because
the media tells me.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.110
Well, the media gets information
from what we tell them--

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.440
or what we have.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.170
So these are some of
the things that we do--

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.708
some of the things that we do.

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:55.890
Actually, we have a
kind of mathematical way

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.430
of analyzing the actions
that we have to do in order

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.010
to increase the political cost.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.290
It's a kind of
interesting thing,

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.080
because we use a tactical plan.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.360
I mean, it's not
something that we do it

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.310
right now as an informal way.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.930
We do it in a very tactical
way of doing a specific thing,

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.760
so we analyze it
and all of that.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.670
And I'm telling
you this, because I

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:29.340
was telling you about the
legal assistance actually.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.190
The number of actions that
we have in order to release

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.620
a person is 40 actions.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.820
So the legal assistance is
just one of the 40 actions,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.500
so there are many.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.600
And social media accounts--

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.489
the value for social media
is five of the 40 actions.

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:53.280
It's that kind of--

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.750
I mean, this is the very
methodology of that.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.980
It's longer too--

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.580
I mean, there's a
long explanation,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.370
but that's how we--

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.140
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.140
And why have you chosen
to become a human rights

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.330
defender when it comes
at such a great risk

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.860
to your life and your safety?

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.193
ALFREDO ROMERO: I didn't
choose to become a human rights

00:14:10.193 --> 00:14:11.900
defender.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.739
The truth is, it will sound--

00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:16.030
I don't know how it will sound.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:21.760
But at the beginning, I
was graduated from Catholic

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.610
university-- a good
university in Venezuela--

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:32.290
Jesuit university and
owned by the Jesuits.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.920
And then I came to
Georgetown University,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.170
and I got my master's degree
in Latin American studies

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.628
from the School of
Foreign Service.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:42.870
And then I went to London
School of Economics,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.860
and I got my master's
degree in banking law.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.880
So I didn't care
about human rights.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.120
It's not that I didn't care.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.036
I didn't know anything
about the human rights.

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:53.890
I didn't study human rights.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.740
What I was telling before-- that
in 2004, one guy was killed.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.040
He was shot in his head--

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.530
18-years-old boy.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.910
His name was Jesus.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.540
His mother name was Maria.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.300
And I was, at that
time, an advisor

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.295
to the Supreme
Court of Justice--

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.420
to the constitutional
chamber to the Supreme Court.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.900
And I was working as
a corporate lawyer--

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.400
still work as a corporate
lawyer with all the restrictions

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.620
and all that.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.254
So as I said, I decided
to help this guy.

00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:34.760
That's it.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.150
I thought that if I helped
this guy, then it will finish,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.700
and I will continue
with my work.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.830
But then I realized--

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:51.160
and for example, right now my
friend and member of my NGO

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.830
and also part of the board
of directors, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.960
who is also my compadre.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.550
And we started
helping these people,

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:08.080
and actually we realized
there were no NGOs doing legal

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.640
assistance pro-bono to these
people, because they realized--

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.284
I thought that there were a lot
of NGOs helping these people.

00:16:15.284 --> 00:16:16.700
So I thought I
will help this guy,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.410
and then an NGO will come
to us on and continue

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.080
with the assistance
of these people.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.790
But actually, there was Jesus,
then there was another--

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.552
Jesus, [INAUDIBLE]
Carlos, and you know.

00:16:30.552 --> 00:16:32.260
And now we have
Geraldine, we have Maria,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.540
we have all these
people that actually

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.850
were victims of repression,
and they came to us

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.670
and asked for help.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.200
And I became a human
rights defender.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.880
And actually, in 2002, I
thought it was the end.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.270
And then in 2003, I
thought it was the end.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.470
And 2004, it was the end.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.820
And now we're in
2017, and we are still

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.160
helping all these
people that are

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.089
being tortured with
electric shocks,

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:09.265
or sexually abused,
or were killed.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.089
I can tell you many names.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:18.430
There are already-- the families
of these people already are not

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.380
just my friends.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.230
They are part of the Foro
Penal family of my NGO family,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.150
because they have become
part of Foro Penal.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.060
And they are not
just my friends.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.960
They're my family.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.640
And a very interesting thing--

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.370
when you start helping
people, you never know.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.860
I mean, you didn't
want to do it.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.060
OK.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.530
But then you feel like a
need of helping another one.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.770
And when you listen to them,
and they tell you of their story

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.070
about what is
happening to them--

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.990
and most of these people
are very poor people,

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.690
so they don't have money
to pay for a lawyer.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.850
If they would have
money, of course

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:06.070
they didn't call us
to pay for a lawyer.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.420
So you getting to-- you get
involved with all these people.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.170
And when a mother
of, for example,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.370
[INAUDIBLE] an
18-year-old boy student,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.990
who's right now in
jail, and he has to be--

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.650
you know, he's sick and all of
that, and he's there in jail.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.580
And his mother talked
to you, and crying,

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.110
and then you get
involved with it.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:37.390
So you come to be a human rights
defender and to help people,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.880
it had become an
addiction to me.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.640
It's true.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.430
I mean, it's like an addiction.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.350
So I always--
sometimes I wake up,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.450
and I say, OK, I have to finish
with it because I'm very tired.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.990
Because, as I said, I
work in the mornings

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.030
and very late at night.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.570
And I came to my house
sometimes at 4:00 AM,

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.060
for example, because
somebody called me

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.290
that he was being detained.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.640
And so, I go to
the prison center

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.290
or to the military place,
where they are being detained--

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.060
or the police
station or whatever.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.540
And then the next day,
I said, I'm very tired,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.470
so I have to continue
with my work--

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.800
with my regular work,
or I have to you know,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.170
I'm a musician also, so I
need to play music or things

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.440
like that.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.380
And I realized after I sleep
a little bit, I wake up,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.270
and again, I said
you have to continue,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.900
because these people
are asking for help.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:44.470
So in the end, it's not
that is a real sacrifice,

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.030
because if it were
a sacrifice, I'm

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.630
totally sure that I
will stop doing it.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:55.900
It's actually a great benefit.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.890
And maybe I'm talking too
much, but I will tell you

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.030
another little thing.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.900
We have four principals
in the migrant section,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.210
or what call the four C's.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.570
The four C's because the words
start with a C in Spanish--

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.680
constancia, which
means perseverance.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.100
The second one is compromiso,
which means commitment.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.260
The third one is conviction,
which means conviction.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.010
And the fourth one and
the most important one

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.760
is corazon, which means heart.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.970
This is a very important
one, because it's not just

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.260
beautiful words.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.510
It has a meaning--

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.410
every one.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.614
And I explain to everyone
what is the meaning,

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:40.030
but the last one
is very important

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.540
because I explained it.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.550
And I said what means
corazon or heart?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.327
It's not just love
or a romantic word.

00:20:46.327 --> 00:20:47.160
It's more than that.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.810
It means that when you
do good things to people,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.590
you will receive
good things to you.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.840
And actually, I'm very
happy doing what I'm doing.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:02.380
And I have a great family, a
lovely family, and nice songs.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.710
And they appreciate what I do.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.760
And this is just--

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.520
the family's very
important for me,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.920
but well, this award
that I'm receiving--

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.070
it's not usual that you
receive awards like that.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.980
But more than that, it's that
you feel very nice helping

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.500
people, and it's something
that, really, everyone

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.690
has to feel it.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:28.780
Because as I said, it's a
very great indemnification

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.997
to your life and to you.

00:21:32.997 --> 00:21:33.830
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.641
So it sounds like one
thing that you thought--

00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:38.140
or one incident you
thought was just

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.850
going to be the one
time thing, turned

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.990
into this whole series of
events that basically found you.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.390
ALFREDO ROMERO: Yeah, I
get out of my comfort zone,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.390
and I felt that
I will come back.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.220
And yeah, now I'm comfortable
with what I'm doing.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.790
So this is like-- right
now, it's my comfort zone

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.140
to be a human rights defender.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.680
I don't see myself doing
something different

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.990
even though that I can.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.610
I mean, I have to, because
to be a human rights defender

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.890
is not something that actually--

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.960
you have at least an
economic indemnification,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.440
so you have to continue working.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.970
And this is something
that I always

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.530
say to human rights defenders.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.830
If we are to become
human rights defenders,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.980
think about doing it, because
it's not that you will

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.900
receive a payment for that.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.390
So you have to continue
working in what you do

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.080
and try to finance yourself.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.350
And as I said, I always say
that whenever I help people,

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:45.340
I will always receive
something better from life.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.390
SPEAKER: That's a perfect
segue to Angelita.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.730
Angelita, can you tell us
a little bit about Partners

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.790
for Human Rights, and how
your partnership with Alfredo

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.952
came to be?

00:22:55.952 --> 00:22:57.910
ANGELITA BAEYENS: So my
organization, Robert F.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.910
Kennedy Human Rights has been
giving every year for-- this is

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:06.910
the 34th year that we gave this
annual human rights award that

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.600
was created to recognize
people like Alfredo--

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.440
the most courageous
human rights defenders

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.160
from around the world.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.440
And the program that
I direct is precisely

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.150
a support program
within an organization

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.670
for those that win the award.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.120
The award is not
only a recognition.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.270
It's also-- we are offering,
as an organization,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.990
to Alfredo and his
organization to really provide

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.590
all the support we can,
all the tools we use,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.790
or expertise, or human
resources, or contacts,

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:46.790
or ideas to help amplify the
voice of Alfredo for Foro Penal

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.220
as well as the network of
[INAUDIBLE] that we have.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.680
And that's what we
hope to be able to,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.390
from now on, continue working
very much hand in hand

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.270
with Alfredo and Foro Penal,
knowing that Venezuela right

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.790
now really needs international
attention and the support

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:10.210
from people all around the world
to put an end to this situation

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:10.990
and this crisis.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.640
And one of the areas
that, as an organization,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.220
we've been focusing
more and more

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.450
is the protection of
civic space and including,

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.300
of course, the
basic freedoms that

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.380
make civic space possible--

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.560
freedom of expression, freedom
of association and assembly.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.490
And by partnering with
courageous human rights

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.560
defenders like Alfredo, we try
to protect those basic rights.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.250
Because in helping
those that are

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.360
on the front line like Alfredo,
putting their lives at risk,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.850
their reputation, you know--

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.340
Alfredo, he didn't say so,
but he's attacked constantly

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.820
by government and by
sectors of society

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.300
that don't like him
being supportive of those

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.530
that are being--

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.480
whose rights are being violated.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.490
And by partnering with Alfredo
and Foro Penal Venezolano,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.550
we're trying to lend our
support and extend our hand

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:09.270
to organizations that
really are, day to day,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.830
trying to protect the most
important and basic freedoms

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.980
that we all need to really
be able to participate

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:24.720
and to express ourselves-- and
have given to the people that

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.730
have been detained,
sometimes they are just

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.500
protesting for the basic right
of having food under table,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.110
being able to work, or
being able to disagree

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.390
with the government.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.500
And those rights are being
completely curtailed.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.360
So again, we aim at
supporting organizations

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.990
that are doing incredible
work just like Foro Penal

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.250
Venezolano, and protect that
space that is so important,

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:55.740
and those basic freedoms--
such as expression [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.400
SPEAKER: So we are in a
very interesting time right

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.580
now, where there are a lot of
causes that could use support.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.120
And so, what was
it specifically?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.240
Because I know that there
were thousands of applicants.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.510
What was it about Alfredo and
his specific organization that

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.860
led to the selection of the 2017
Robert F. Kennedy Foundation

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.780
Human Rights Award?

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.550
ANGELITA BAEYENS: Many reasons--

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:25.470
Alfredo was definitely the very
clear and unanimous decision

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.410
by the jury.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.560
We have an external
jury that chooses,

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.300
each year, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.260
And with Alfredo, we saw
somebody that is courageous--

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.360
that has been able to
choose a different path--

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.210
and having had a different
carrier has made--

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.700
has received the calling of a
being human rights defender--

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:51.310
and has really fell
through with it.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:59.580
And we also saw and see
that ability and to take--

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.610
the methodology that is used
by Alfredo and the Foro Penal

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:10.290
Venezolano, this idea of
really creating a network,

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.960
lending support that goes
beyond just the legal assistance

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.070
but also tends to
all the other aspects

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.360
and needs of victims of
human rights violations.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.330
So it's a very
integral approach,

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.380
and it involves people
and your victims,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.085
and families of victims,
and society at large.

00:27:29.085 --> 00:27:33.090
So that was one of the many
special things that Alfredo

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.010
has-- and his leadership.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:42.730
Also, even though there is no
independence of the judiciary,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:48.270
and the government has absolute
control over everything,

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.460
Foro Penal and Alfredo
have not entirely

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.130
given up on the rule
of law and on the need

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:59.940
to use the law to defend the
basic human rights of people,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.160
but at the same time, also use
all these other creative ways,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.490
including social media, to
try to get the message out.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.520
So that's another reason why we
thought Alfredo really embodied

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.640
the courage, and the
creativity, and the perseverance

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.260
that we look to recognize
with the Human Rights Award.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.900
SPEAKER: So we've touched on
technology a few times today,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.900
and the use of social
media to create awareness

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.900
on what's going on to
notify family members,

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.880
and to even just
get the word out.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.200
So last week there
was a law passed

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.380
that gives prison sentences
up to 20 years if a post,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.580
or if something on broadcast
television, or on the radio

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.270
is deemed as hateful.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:52.200
In the wake of that recent law,
how can technology still be

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.100
used as something that can
help your organization--

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.010
and as a human rights
defender in general--

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.180
and I guess also the
impact [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.820
ALFREDO ROMERO: We have
always to, I would say, fight,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.910
but we have all these
obstacles since we started.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.910
This is a law that actually
restricts, severely,

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.900
these kind of expressions,
which are just expressions--

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.814
I will say expressions,
or messages, or whatever--

00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:27.730
against the government,
because the government

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.640
is the one who
violates human rights.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.070
They abuse people.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.320
The problem with this law--

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.960
I mean, they call it
a law against hate.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.820
But what the problem
is that they don't even

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.160
explain what does it mean.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:57.130
I mean, what is a
message that actually

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.130
is included in this
law, and it will

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.330
be sanctioned or criminalized.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.020
You don't know.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.510
So it's under
government discretion

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.630
when it's a message
against the law or not.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.750
That's a big problem.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:19.430
But this is our
law-- our new law,

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.150
but they already
have been detaining

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.070
people for Twitter messages.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.380
Right now, for example,
there's a guy called--

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.880
his name is Victor
[INAUDIBLE],, for example.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.630
This guy's been in jail for more
than three years just because

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.130
of a Twitter message.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.810
There is another guy
called Leonel Sanchez.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.420
He's still in jail
because of that.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.961
There have been more
than nine people

00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:43.800
because of using social media.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.630
They come to your
house, and they take you

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:54.120
out of your house, because
they can find out where

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.840
you have sent the message.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:02.620
So the important thing is that
the whole world knows about it,

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.650
and they understand that they're
using these laws in order

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:13.900
to officialize or
legalize in some way--

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.190
to formalize, I would say,
political persecution.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.270
But this is something
that we are used to it.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:26.280
And we have to
continue doing our job.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.141
They are very
objective in the way

00:31:30.141 --> 00:31:32.390
that we're doing-- that we
are just telling the truth.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.280
And of course, for
the government, that's

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.980
why they restrict all media--

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.140
all freedom of
expression, because they

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.860
don't want the truth to be
known all around the world.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.440
So that's why it is extremely
important to be here,

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.480
for example.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.420
I will say this
companies like Google

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:59.590
or international companies that
have access to, I would say,

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.650
people, and they
can tell the truth.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.940
I hope that they can help
countries like Venezuela.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.470
We are always more
and more restricted.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.930
And sometimes it is
important, because I'm

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.070
totally sure that if you live
here in the United States

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.760
or in a free country, you
will say, oh, come on.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.790
Why these are people are stupid?

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.090
Why these people
can be controlled

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:29.590
by a guy or two guys?

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.760
Why they don't protest?

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.515
Why they don't do
things like that?

00:32:32.515 --> 00:32:34.850
Why they don't just
go out in the street?

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.020
Oh, people have gone out
on the street many times,

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.490
but have been killed--

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.910
have been tortured.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.990
And when your son
is being killed--

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.710
16 years old-- 15 years old, for
example-- this [INAUDIBLE] guy,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.220
15-year-old boy that
was killed, then you

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.050
think twice before going
out out of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.290
So this is important to
understand, because--

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.110
and this is also a very
important thing to understand.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:07.000
You cannot take freedom for
granted if you live in a free

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.610
country, because you never know
when you're going to lose it.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.140
I used to live in
a free country.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.990
I didn't know.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.580
I didn't even
imagine that I would

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.340
be involved in these issues.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.180
I didn't even imagine that I
would become a human rights

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:22.680
defender.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.680
I didn't imagine I will be
here at some point in my life.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.280
It's not something
I was looking for.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.110
But that happened,
and that's why

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:40.160
it's important for the
whole world to know,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.880
and for the people
to be some kind

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:51.780
of interested in human rights
and in human rights abuses.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.220
SPEAKER: And in thinking about
your partnership together

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.340
with the Robert F
Kennedy Foundation--

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.770
in thinking in the
year ahead, what's

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.810
your vision between this
partnership and even

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.100
the organization?

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.510
ALFREDO ROMERO: My vision?

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.170
SPEAKER: Well, for both of you?

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:16.860
ALFREDO ROMERO: We have been
growing, Foro Penal, very much.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.730
We're, as I said, more
than 4,000 volunteers

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:24.199
at this moment, but
we are in Venezuela.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:28.780
It is important to
internationalize

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.139
Foro Penal and the message--

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.239
not just the
message, the method--

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.349
the methodology that
we used in order

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:38.630
to increase the
cost of political--

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.630
of state repression.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.429
And I think this
partnership, I have

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.656
to find out how we
will work together,

00:34:48.656 --> 00:34:53.020
but I know that it is
extremely important

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.520
to have an NGO in an
organization-- dependent one

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:05.140
that can actually
help in putting

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:14.320
the message in the place where
it needs to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.840
And this is the way
that we need everyone

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.930
to know what is going
on and make people

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.880
interested in what is going on.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:27.490
And actually, even for
our safety in some way,

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:32.600
because as I said, we work
there, like in the darkness.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.560
And if you talk about
Venezuela, maybe you

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.040
will think, well, first of
all, where is Venezuela?

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.000
In South America, OK.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.270
Let me see.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.030
What is happening there?

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.895
So well, there is
a guy whose name

00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:47.140
is Alfredo Romero with
an organization that's

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.460
working a system--

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.107
victims of the state repression,
so people have been killed.

00:35:52.107 --> 00:35:53.190
People are being tortured.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.120
Well, there's an organization
here in the United States

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:02.920
that actually can, in
some way, speak louder

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.870
and say that this is going on.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.870
I mean, in case
something happened to us,

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:13.760
then we have someone here that
is at least putting attention

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.026
of what is going on there.

00:36:16.026 --> 00:36:18.400
ANGELITA BAEYENS: Yeah, I
mean, for us, it's a privilege,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.810
and it's an honor, and
we're really truthfully

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:28.900
very, very eager to help as much
as we can, including-- there's

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.710
many tools.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.650
One of them, of course, it's
what-- all the advocacy work,

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.310
international work, I see,
that we can do around the work

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.250
and what is going on in
Venezuela and in the work

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.470
that Foro Penal is doing.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.410
We also do international
mediation with cases--

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.920
emblematic cases that, before
international tribunals,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.220
were cases that
are representative

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.320
of a wider, larger problem.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.940
And for example, the law-- the
recent law that just passed

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:01.700
in Venezuela, it's interesting,
because it's just an example

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.960
of one of the tactics that more
and more countries are using--

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.720
repressive countries,
where social media

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.730
was like another
frontier that was not--

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.490
that was completely
out of control

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.400
for repressive governments.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.880
SPEAKER: And it's so new also.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.820
ANGELITA BAEYENS:
And it's so new.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.944
So they're really-- by
adopting these type of laws,

00:37:18.944 --> 00:37:22.540
they're trying to
also control that.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.990
And so, there's a lot of
things to do there even

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.540
to try to combat these
laws, but there's

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:34.520
many aspects of the work and the
tools that we can use together,

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.470
including international
mechanisms

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.770
and targeted advocacy that
we really look forward

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.920
to work together on--

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.610
and just put the message
out, and continue

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.920
calling the attention
of the world

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.231
and what's going
on in Venezuela.

00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:51.730
SPEAKER: So I have
one more question

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.770
before I open it up to Q&amp;A.
So for the people here,

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.990
for the people that
will watch this,

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.720
for anybody that's interested,
how can people help?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.660
How can people get involved?

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.790
Being in the United
States, what can you do?

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:10.690
What can you do to help?

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:15.140
ALFREDO ROMERO: We incorporate
everyone to our network,

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.840
so everyone can be a
member of Foro Penal.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.100
So they can register
at foropenal.com.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.320
And actually, this
is very important

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.080
because it's what I say.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.390
Even if you work
one minute a month

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:39.070
as a volunteer saying something
about what is going on--

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:45.370
even if you just work
two hours, I don't know,

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:51.610
participating in an assembly
or in a forum that we do,

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:52.910
it is extremely important.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:58.330
So as I said, everyone
is important here.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.420
And we train people to become
part of our organization.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.720
So that's a very
important thing,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.570
because if you are registered
in our organization,

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.890
then we know where you are,
and we can, in some way,

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.030
send information.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.566
I mean, it's extremely important
to understand what is going on.

00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:21.940
This is the most
important thing.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.580
How you, I will say,
not translate it

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.690
in general-- not
just the language.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.480
It's how to make
people understand

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.900
what does it mean
to live in a country

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.620
that the freedom has been lost.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:44.830
Even the children-- I mean, we
incorporate 14-year-old boys

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.160
or girls, and I listen to them.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.120
This is the truth.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.190
Well, I always say that
in order for anyone

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.690
to understand what
you say, you have

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.930
to talk to a 13-year-old boy.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.120
That's the only way
that you have to--

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.230
that people can understand
what you're saying.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.210
It's difficult, but
it is important.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:09.520
So that's the best way
to support what we do.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:17.620
And for example, I'm not
talking about lawyers of course,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.110
not just students,
or intellectuals.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:25.170
I'm talking about
singers, about artists--

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.462
SPEAKER: --using your platform.

00:40:26.462 --> 00:40:27.878
ALFREDO ROMERO:
No, but everything

00:40:27.878 --> 00:40:29.280
is extremely important.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.460
I use, for example, music.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.160
I'm a musician, so
I use music in order

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.090
to sing and sometimes to explain
where I'm doing with a song.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.830
And whenever I, for
example, publish a song

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.860
either in YouTube or
whatever, singing,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:49.660
I will get more views than
just talking about a state

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.050
repression and, you know, all
the technicalities of this,

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.240
of people being
tortured, or whatever.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.530
So everyone can help.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:02.290
I always ask people
to register to become

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.940
part of our organization.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:08.620
And I'm sure that they
will do something very good

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.480
for people in Venezuela and
also all around the world,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.550
where governments and
dictators actually

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.090
have the control
of people and needs

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.970
to control people with
repression in order

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.699
to keep in power.

00:41:25.699 --> 00:41:28.240
ANGELITA BAEYENS: And if I may
I add, since we are in Google,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.810
and Google is known for having
some of the most talented

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.030
people on the technical field--

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.760
communications field, I think
that putting that talent also

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.730
in coming up with
ideas-- particularly when

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.760
it comes to getting
the message out,

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.280
security is also a big
thing, not only for Alfredo

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.816
but all the people
in the network.

00:41:47.816 --> 00:41:49.690
What they're doing--
what Foro Penal is doing

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.370
is documenting
human rights abuses.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.120
That comes at a high risk.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.370
So anything that can help
do that work in a safer way,

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.620
in a more secure way, in a more
mainstream way, it's always

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.280
going to be welcome in
Venezuela and in other places

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.910
in the world.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.180
But in this specific
case of Venezuela,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.220
especially now with the
additional challenges

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.680
that are being created
by the government

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.530
to really disseminate
information, that's also

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:21.100
something where the
brains that we have here,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.380
I'm sure it can be
very, very useful.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.720
ALFREDO ROMERO: You
know, just very quick,

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.820
there was also another story--

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.470
very interesting-- in order to
understand how, for example,

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.890
people in the world can help.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.080
And again, telling
what is going on

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.470
and increasing the political
cost of repression.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:48.880
Just once about
one year ago there

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.720
was a woman that was detained.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:59.440
She was protesting or whatever,
and her name was [? Joselin. ?]

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.500
So she was detained
actually, and she

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:07.660
was taken to a military base.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.690
And this guy from
what she has told me--

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:17.635
this military officer
starting touching her,

00:43:17.635 --> 00:43:23.470
and she was like in an
office-- in his office.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.380
And somebody started
knocking the other door.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.800
There was a soldier or
whatever, and this guy

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.280
stands up very quick and
stopped touching her.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.000
And then the guy came
back to the office,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.400
and started yelling,
took her, and threw her

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.330
to whatever place.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.810
I don't know.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.521
And she said who are you?

00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:47.020
Why?

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.831
Well, because the
social media is

00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:51.080
with your picture, and with
your name, and everything.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.030
And we were the ones
who were actually

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.620
publishing pictures
of her and her name,

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.290
so this is extremely important.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:00.460
So this is the only way.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.190
Sometimes you can--
and I'm totally sure.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.370
And she says that we helped her.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:10.390
I mean, if we weren't there
publishing the pictures,

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.670
I'm sure she will be raped.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.060
So it's extremely important.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.930
I mean, just if you mention
something in a social media

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:27.110
network or whatever,
it could save a life.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.830
So that's how good you can help.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.690
For example, I will
give you another idea--

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.010
something that I don't
care, because whoever

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:38.530
can do it on Google is a place.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.360
For example, I
always have thought

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.060
on a map of victims of
repression in the world.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.610
So there is no map.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.010
So how many political
prisoners are in the world?

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:49.750
Nobody knows it.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.240
I know it in my country,
because we have a register.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.350
So it's important to know where
are the victims of repression

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.050
all around there, so people
can actually put their names,

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.227
so the whole world knows.

00:45:01.227 --> 00:45:03.310
There is like a map of
something's happening here,

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:07.600
something's happening there,
and Google is a great platform

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.310
to do that.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.630
SPEAKER: So now I want to
open it up for questions.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.100
Does anyone have any questions?

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.030
Can line up on either side.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.980
We can start with
you on the left.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.210
AUDIENCE: Sure, hi.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.380
Well, thank you for everything.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.110
So at Google, we're also
a data-driven company.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.810
And I see you're looking
a lot at your data.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.950
I'm just curious,
have you seen trends?

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.155
I mean, with number of
cases, number of repressions,

00:45:35.155 --> 00:45:36.980
and things like
that-- has it changed,

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.447
or is it only going up, or
has there been any change?

00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:42.530
I'm interested about that.

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:46.260
ALFREDO ROMERO: Yeah, this
a very important question.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.450
Again, how we work, or
how I analyze everything,

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.180
I analyze it as a cost--

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.100
as a political cost
benefit analysis.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.140
That's it for repression.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.670
So we are the
organization that actually

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.950
shows the list of
political prisoners

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.850
in Venezuela, just
to give you an idea.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:12.590
So they use, what I have called,
the revolving door effect.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.860
So when they incarcerate
someone, they release others.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.180
And they incarcerating, and
they're releasing others.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.640
I always said that there
have been more than 11,900,

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.840
whatever, political detainees,
so they are being affected.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.480
I mean, the intimidation
effect is really important.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.180
So everyone is
being intimidated,

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.260
so everyone is a victim.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.310
So she told me that
one of her families

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.740
was a victim, so they called us.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.000
And you can see all
Venezuelans around the world,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.500
even, telling me the same thing.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.380
So in order to increase
the political cost,

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.620
we have showed how many
political prisoners there are.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:02.760
So for example, before April
2017, before the last protest--

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:09.880
mass protest has started, they
were 117 political prisoners.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.290
Monthly, if you
see our statistics,

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.360
there were 100 every month.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.530
They were not the same.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:21.690
They were 100 with a
revolving door effect

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.850
that I'm talking about.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.270
In July, because of
protests, the number

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.920
of political prisoners
increased to 676,

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.480
and we started saying
that there were 676.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:42.660
Right now, after
that, we started

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.920
sending the list of political
prisoners to the OAS--

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.260
to the Organization of American
States in order for them

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.167
to certify the list and
to verify the list, not

00:47:52.167 --> 00:47:53.750
for the government
to say, well, where

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:54.990
are the political prisoners?

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:56.160
Well, they're here.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.810
So the OAS has the list,
so we have it here,

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.960
so we have the names
and everything.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:07.090
Well, right now, the
government called us--

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:12.740
actually sent me a letter
asking for the list of people

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:19.010
that had been detained
in a violent action.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.860
This is a list of
political prisoners,

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.590
so I answered the letter.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:28.230
I sent another letter
saying, OK, here is

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.197
a list of political prisoners.

00:48:30.197 --> 00:48:31.780
Actually, they used
the list, and they

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.880
went to all prison centers--

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.040
some of the prison centers.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.749
Actually, the number
of political prisoners

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.540
have decreased to--

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.890
342 is the last one.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.390
So every week they have
decreased the number

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:51.410
to about 11, 20, or whatever.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:58.110
So they have to go
again to the 100 number.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.920
And this is important
because this

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.470
is how you increase
the political cost.

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.270
This is how you do--

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.860
because the
government, they don't

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.231
want to have 1,000
political prisoners.

00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:11.230
They don't want to have
600 political prisoners.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.270
Well, they don't want--

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:13.990
it's not that they
don't want to have it.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.840
They want to have it, because
it's an intimidation effect.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.790
So they want people to protest.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.930
They want people to say,
OK, if I go to protest,

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.740
then I go to jail, so I
prefer not to protest--

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.570
or I'm being killed or whatever.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.220
So they don't care about
incarcerating people,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.410
but they don't want
the world to know

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:32.690
they have political prisoners.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.560
So they are the ones
who are showing that.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.680
So that's why I was
telling you about this map.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.710
Because if a
country in the world

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.550
knows that the map
shows that they

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.240
have 100 political
prisoners, they will like--

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.900
better not to have
anyone if nobody knows.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.100
For example, in Egypt, I was
talking once to a human rights

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:03.350
defender there, and I asked her,
how many political prisoners

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.300
do you have in Egypt?

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.490
I'm talking about Egypt,
because Egypt is not

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:09.020
a socialist country.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.270
It doesn't matter if you are
socialist, or capitalist,

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.840
or whatever.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.310
It doesn't matter.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.810
Political prisoners
or repression

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:17.390
can happen in a
socialist country

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.030
or in a capitalist country.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.819
And she told me, I don't know.

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:23.360
I don't know.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.050
10,000.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:25.400
20,000.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.750
And she asked me, and I said we
have dot dot dot the number--

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.820
a specific number.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:36.380
And then I realized,
OK, this is how you--

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.010
this is the methodology to
release political prisoners,

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:45.290
or to stop repression, or to
decrease state repression.

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.060
Well, that's why I think.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.310
I don't know if I answered
your question specifically,

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.930
but I think that's the
most important thing

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.263
that, actually, we do.

00:50:55.263 --> 00:50:56.096
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:56.096 --> 00:50:57.940
SPEAKER: Well, thanks
for your question.

00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.960
So I just want to
end on, actually,

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.900
a quote from Robert F. Kennedy.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.690
It reads, "it's from the
numberless diverse acts

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.080
of courage and belief that
human history is shaped."

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.712
So thank you both
for your courage,

00:51:10.712 --> 00:51:12.420
and thank you for
everything that you do,

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.820
and thank you for
being here today.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.060
ALFREDO ROMERO:
Thank you so much.

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.970
SPEAKER: Thank you
all for coming.
