00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Ostensibly we all want love,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.200
But Oddly, one of the hardest things to do is not hold it against people

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.820
When they do actually turn around and reciprocate our feelings.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.600
It can be immensely hard not to think that those who offer us love

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.000
Are in some ways weak, mistaken, needy, craven or just defective

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.100
It can feel a lot easier when love was unrequited

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.920
when our primary preoccupation was a thrilling dread

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.420
that the admired person hadn't even noticed us

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.760
But now there's finally no doubt anymore

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.720
It's really clear they do like us and something troubling has arisen

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.320
We're feeling a bit sick

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000
We're tempted to say we got them wrong.  They can't be the admirable people we thought they were

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.480
But the issue isn't really to do with them at all

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.100
it lies somewhere else entirely...

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.900
in our relationship with ourselves.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.180
Their affection seem suspicious, incomprehensible and a touch repulsive

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.260
because at some level this isn't what we're used to. it doesn't tally with our view of ourselves.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.760
Love can be hard to receive when we're not fundamentally convinced of our own lovability.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.980
We spend our time seeking out those who can make us suffer in ways that feel familiar.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.920
And it becomes natural to assume that a kind lover has missed something

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.500
And perhaps then, to try to behave in disgusting ways just to make sure they understand

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.360
We're really not who they thought we were.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.900
And that they would therefore leave us in painful but somehow psychologically gratifying ways

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.500
in short, how could anyone be so great if they have the bad taste to think well of someone like us?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.860
but we have to allow ourselves to entertain another option

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.040
perhaps this affection we're receiving is not a sign that our kind lover is weak or wrong or has no other options

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.220
perhaps it's a sign that they've seen something in us

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.040
which pointedly and tragically we don't yet quite see in ourselves

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.680
and have never been alowed to believe in by figures in our past

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.780
that we are deserving of love.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.900
there is hope in all this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.340
Hope that we can come to trust our lovers more that we trust our own first nervous, self-destructive impulses

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.800
We can interpret their love, not as a sign of their delusion or weakness,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.760
but as evidence of an inherent lovability in ourselves

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.460
to which our past histories have blinded us

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.900
yet to which their love and tenderness can now awaken us

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.100
we don't invariably have to hold it against others when they see some point in us.
