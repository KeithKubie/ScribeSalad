Enough talk about pizza.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's talk about cookies.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.670
Imagine you have a cookie
recipe that makes 48 cookies.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600
The recipe calls for
half a cup of sugar.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.790
If you instead want to make 24 cookies,
how much sugar do you need?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.360
Enter your answer here,
with the numerator on the top and

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.600
the denominator on the bottom.
