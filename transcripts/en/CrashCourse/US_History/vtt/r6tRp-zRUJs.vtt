Episode 23: The Rise of the Industrial Economy

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.490
Hi I’m John Green this is Crash Course U.S.
History and today we’re going to discuss

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.510
economics and how a generation of-
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, is this going to be

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.490
one of those boring ones no wars or generals
who had cool last words or anything?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.490
Alright, Me From The Past, I will give you
a smidge of Great Man history.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.490
But only a smidge.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.001
So today we’re gonna discuss American industrialization
in the decades after the Civil War, during

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.851
which time the U.S. went from having per capita
about a third of Great Britain’s industrial

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:27.250
output to becoming the richest and most industrialized
nation on earth.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.740
Libertage
Meh, you might want to hold off on that Libertage,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.470
Stan because this happened mostly thanks to
the Not Particularly Awesome Civil War, which

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.200
improved the finance system by forcing the
introduction of a national currency and spurred

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.160
industrialization by giving massive contracts
to arms and clothing manufacturers.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.070
The Civil War also boosted the telegraph,
which improved communication, and gave birth

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.390
to the transcontinental railway via the Pacific
Railway Act of 1862, all of which increased

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.010
efficiency and productivity.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.510
So thanks, Civil War!

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.350
Intro
If you want to explain America’s economic

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.610
growth in a nutshell chalk it up to G, D,
and L: Gerard, Depardieu, and Lohan.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.790
No, Geography, Demography and Law.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.740
However, while we’re on the topic, when
will Gerard, Depardieu, and Lindsay Lohan

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.740
have a baby?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.960
Stan, can I see it?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.960
Yes.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
Yes.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.130
Geographically, the U.S. was a huge country
with all the resources necessary for an industrial

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.130
boom.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.110
Like, we had coal, and iron and, later, oil.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.909
Initially we had water to power our factories,
later replaced by coal.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.000
And we had amber waves of grain to feed our
growing population which leads to the Demography.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.049
America’s population grew from 40 million
in 1870 to 76 million in 1900 and 1/3 of that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.659
growth was due to immigration.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.799
Which is good for economies.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.380
Many of these immigrants flooded the burgeoning
cities, as America shifted from being an agrarian

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.060
rural nation to being an industrial, urban
one.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.090
Like, New York City became the center of commerce
and finance and by 1898 it had a population

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.229
of 3.4 million people.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.700
And the industrial heartland was in the Great
Lakes region.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.880
Chicago became the second largest city by
1900, Cleveland became a leader in oil refining,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.729
and Pittsburgh was a center of iron and steel
production.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.400
And even today, the great city of Pittsburgh
still employs 53 Steelers.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.060
Last but not least was the Law.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.069
The Constitution and its commerce clause made
the U.S. a single area of commerce – like

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.830
a giant customs union.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.200
And, as we’ll see in a bit the Supreme Court
interpreted the laws in a very business friendly

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
way.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.880
Also, the American constitution protects patents,
which encourag4B-es invention and innovation,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880
or at least it used to.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.090
And despite what Ayn Rand would tell you,
the American government played a role in American

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.120
economic growth by putting up high tariffs,
especially on steel, giving massive land grants

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.160
to railroads and by putting Native Americans
on reservations.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.080
Also, foreigners played an important role.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.910
They invested their capital and involved Americans
in their economic scandals like the one that

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.790
led to a depression in 1893.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.050
The U.S. was at the time was seen by Europeans
as a developing economy; and investments in

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.240
America offered much higher returns than those
available in Europe.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.239
And the changes we’re talking about here
were massive.

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.690
In 1880, for the first time, a majority of
the workforce worked in non-farming jobs.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.880
By 1890 2/3 of Americans worked for wages,
rather than farming or owning their own businesses.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.010
And, by 1913 the United States produced 1/3
of the world’s total industrial output.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.640
NOW bring out the Libertage, Stan.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.390
Libertage
Awesome.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.800
And even better, we now get to talk about
the perennially underrated railroads.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.930
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.019
Although we tend to forget about them here
in the U.S., because our passenger rail system

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.590
sucks, railroads were one of the keys to America’s
19th century industrial success.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.950
Railroads increased commerce and integrated
the American market, which allowed national

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.980
brands to emerge, like Ivory Soap and A&amp;P
Grocery Stores.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.731
But railroads changed and improved our economy
in less obvious ways, too: For instance, they

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:50.480
gave us time zones, which were created by
the major railroad companies to make shipping

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.580
and passenger transport more standard.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.120
Also because he recognized the importance
of telling time, a railroad agent named Richard

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.650
Warren Sears turned a $50 dollar investment
in watches into an enormous mail order empire,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.569
and railroads made it possible for him--and
his eventual partner Roebuck--to ship watches,

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.629
and then jewelry, and then pretty much everything,
including unconstructed freaking houses throughout

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.629
the country.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.879
Railroads were also the first modern corporations.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.449
These companies were large, they had many
employees, they spanned the country.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.510
And that meant they needed to invent organizational
methods, including the middle manager--supervisors

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.190
to supervise supervisors.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.820
And for the first time, the owners of a company
were not always day-to-day managers, because

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.160
railroads were among the first publicly traded
corporations.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.540
They needed a lot of capital to build tracks
and stations, so they sold shares in

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.220
the company in order to raise that money,
which shares could then be bought and sold

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.220
by the public.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
And that is how railroads created the first
captains of industry, like Cornelius “They

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.640
Named a University after Me” Vanderbilt
and Andrew “Me Too” Carnegie (Mellon)

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.790
and Leland “I Named a University After My
Son” Stanford.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.600
The Railroad business was also emblematic
of the partnership between the national government

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
and industry.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.800
The Transcontinental Railroad, after all,
wouldn’t have existed without Congressional

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.260
legislation, federal land grants, and government
sponsored bond issues.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.430
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.180
Apparently it’s time for the Mystery Document.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.660
The rules here are simple.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.910
I guess the author of the Mystery Document
and if I’m wrong, which I usually am, I

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.910
get shocked.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.910
Alright.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.090
“The belief is common in America that the
day is at hand when corporations far greater

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.680
than the Erie – swaying such power as has
never in the world’s history been trusted

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.090
in the hands of mere private citizens, controlled
by single men like Vanderbilt...– will ultimately

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.440
succeed in directing government itself.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.110
Under the American form of society, there
is now no authority capable of effective resistance.”

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.470
Corporations directing government?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.470
That’s ridiculous.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.260
So grateful for federal ethanol subsidies
brought to you by delicious Diet Dr. Pepper.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.509
Mmm I can taste all 23 of the chemicals.

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.590
Anyway, Stan, I’m pretty sure that is noted
muckraker Ida Tarbell.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.169
No!

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.169
Henry Adams?

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.600
HOW ARE THERE STILL ADAMSES IN AMERICAN HISTORY?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.370
That makes me worry we’ll never escape the
Clintons.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.069
Anyway, it should’ve been Ida Tarbell.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.270
She has a great name.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.259
She was a great opponent of capitalism.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.259
Whatever.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.259
AH!

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.240
Indeed industrial capitalists are considered
both the greatest heroes and the greatest

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.430
villains of the era, which is why they are
known both as “captains of industry” and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.040
as “robber barons,” depending on whether
we are mad at them.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.331
While they often came from humble origins,
took risks and became very wealthy, their

00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:18.039
methods were frequently unscrupulous.

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.330
I mean, they often drove competitors out of
business, and generally cared very little

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.330
for their workers.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.910
The first of the great robber barons and/or
captains of industry was the aforementioned

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.100
Cornelius Vanderbilt who rose from humble
beginnings in Staten Island to make a fortune

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.461
in transportation, through ferries and shipping,
and then eventually through railroads, although

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.740
he once referred to trains as “them things
that go on land.”

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.860
But the poster boy of the era was John D.
Rockefeller who started out as a clerk for

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.050
a Cleveland merchant and eventually became
the richest man in the world.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.050
Ever.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.190
Yes, including Bill Gates.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.910
The key to Rockefeller’s success was ruthlessly
buying up so many rivals that by the late

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.700
1880s Standard Oil controlled 90% of the U.S.
oil industry.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.460
Which lack of competition drove the price
of gasoline up to like 12 cents a gallon,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.780
so if you had one of the 20 cars in the world
then, you were mad.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.460
The period also saw innovation in terms of
the way industries were organized.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.710
Many of the robber barons formed pools and
trusts to control prices and limit the negative

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.750
effects of competition.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.090
The problem with competition is that over
time it reduces both prices and profit margins,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.099
which makes it difficult to become super rich.

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:23.340
Vertical integration was another innovation
– firms bought up all aspects of the production

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.380
process – from raw materials to production
to transport and distribution.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.950
Like, Philip Armour’s meat company bought
its own rail cars to ship meat, for instance.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.919
It also bought things like conveyor belts
and when he found out that animal parts could

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.660
be used to make glue, he got into the glue-making
business.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.190
It was Armour who once proclaimed to use “everything
but the squeal.”

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.370
Horizontal integration was when big firms
bought up small ones.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.949
The best example of this was Rockefeller’s
Standard Oil, which eventually became so big

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:51.419
incidentally that the Supreme Court forced
Standard Oil to be broken up into more than

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:53.400
a dozen smaller oil companies.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.139
Which, by the way, overtime have slowly reunited
to become the company known as Exxon-Mobil,

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:58.720
so that worked out.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.820
U.S. Steel was put together by the era’s
giant of finance, J.P. Morgan, who at his

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.480
death left a fortune of only $68 million – not
counting the art that became the backbone

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.740
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art – leading
Andrew Carnegie to remark in surprise, “And

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.020
to think he was not a rich man.”[1]
Speaking of people who weren’t rich, let

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.900
us now praise the unsung heroes of industrialization:
workers.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.070
Well, I guess you can’t really call them
unsung because Woody Guthrie.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.070
Oh!

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.070
Your guitar!

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.070
And my computer!

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.070
I never made that connection before.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.349
Anyway, then as now, the benefits of economic
growth were shared...mmm shall we say...a

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:33.720
smidge unevenly.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.900
Prices did drop due to industrial competition,
which raised the standard of living for the

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.919
average American worker.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.050
In fact, it was among the highest in the world.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.570
But due to a growing population, particularly
of immigrant workers, there was job insecurity.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.610
And also booms and busts meant depressions
in the 1870s and 1890s, which hit the working

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.670
poor the hardest.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.560
Also, laborers commonly worked 60 hours per
week with no pensions or injury compensation,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.320
and the U.S. had the highest rate of industrial
injuries in the world: an average of over

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.730
35,000 people per year died on the job.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.690
These conditions and the uncertainty of labor
markets led to unions, which were mostly local

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.180
but occasionally national.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.360
The first national union was the Knights of
Labor, headed by Terence V. Powderly which

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.410
grew from 9 members in 1870 to 728,000 by
1884.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:22.010
The Knights of Labor admitted unskilled workers,
black workers, and women, but it was irreparably

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.661
damaged by the Haymarket riot in 1886.

00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:28.410
During a strike against McCormick Harvesting
Company, a policeman killed one of the strikers

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.080
and in response there was a rally in Chicago’s
Haymarket Square at which a bomb killed seven

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.080
police officers.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.260
Then, firing upon the crowd, the police killed
four people.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.980
Seven anarchists were eventually convicted
of the bombing, and although Powderly denounced

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.730
anarchism, the public still associated the
Knights of Labor with violence.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.910
And by 1902, its membership had shrunk considerably--to
0.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.451
The banner of organized labor however was
picked up by the American Federation of Labor

00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:54.360
under Samuel L. Gompers.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.050
Do all of these guys have great last names?

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.350
They were more moderate than the anarchists
and the socialist International Workers of

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.779
the World, and focused on bread and butter
issues like pay, hours, and safety.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.830
Founded in 1886, the same year as the Haymarket
Riot, the AFL had about 250,000 members by

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.600
1892, almost 10% of whom were iron and steel
workers.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.690
And now we have to pause to briefly mention
one of the most pernicious innovations of

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.420
the era: Social Darwinism: a perversion of
Darwin’s theory that would have made him

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.420
throw up.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.390
Although to be fair, almost everything made
him throw up.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.070
Social Darwinists argued that the theory of
survival of the fittest should be applied

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.580
to people and also that corporations were
people.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.200
Ergo, big companies were big because they
were fitter and we had nothing to fear from

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200
monopolies.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.140
This pseudoscience was used to argue that
government shouldn’t regulate business or

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.980
pass laws to help poor people.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.610
It assured the rich that the poor were poor
because of some inherent evolutionary flaw,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.149
thus enabling tycoons to sleep at night.

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:46.860
You know, on a big pile of money, surrounded
by beautiful women.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.560
But, despite the apparent inborn unfitness
of workers, unions continued to grow and fight

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.620
for better conditions, sometimes violently.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.500
There was violence at the Homestead Steel
Strike of 1892 and the Pullman Rail strike

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.610
of 1894 when strikers were killed and a great
deal of property was destroyed.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.810
To quote the historian Michael Lind: “In
the late 1870s and early 1880s, the United

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.430
States had five times as many unionized workers
as Germany, at a time when the two nations

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.750
had similar populations.”[2]
Unions wanted the United States and its citizens

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.551
to imagine freedom more broadly, arguing that
without a more equal economic system, America

00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:22.370
was becoming less, not more, free, even as
it became more prosperous.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.850
If you’re thinking that this free-wheeling
age of fast growth, uneven gains in prosperity,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.260
and corporate heroes/villains resembles the
early 21st century, you aren’t alone.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.140
And it’s worth remembering that it was only
150 years ago that modern corporations began

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.980
to form and that American industry became
the leading driver in the global economy.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.029
That’s a blink of an eye in world history
terms, and the ideas and technologies of post

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:48.680
Civil War America gave us the ideas that still
define how we--all of us, not just Americans--think

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.060
about opposites like success and failure,
or wealth and poverty.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.310
It’s also when we people began to discuss
the ways in which inequality could be the

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.100
opposite of freedom.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.100
Thanks for watching.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.100
I’ll see you next week.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.220
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Halse Rojas,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.980
and myself.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.980
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.830

You can suggest captions in comments where
you can also ask questions about today’s

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:17.880
video that will be answered by our team of
historians.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880
Thanks for watching Crash Course.
