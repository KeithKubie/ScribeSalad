00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And here is my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First, I define an XOR function to XOR two-byte arrays together

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because that's not included in the library.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Next, we'll loop through the plaintext array.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And here we break it into block-sized pieces,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which then gets XORed and then fed into the encoder.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The encoder output is then saved as the XOR for the input on the next round.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The encoder output is then saved as the XOR

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for the next loop and also added to the cipher output.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And finally, the cipher is returned.
