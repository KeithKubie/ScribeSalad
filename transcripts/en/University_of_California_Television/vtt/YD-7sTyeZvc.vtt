00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.084
(bright synthesizer music)

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.210
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.690
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.940
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.280
Our guest today is Abdullahi An-Na'im

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.690
who is the Charles Howard
Candler Professor of Law

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.460
at Emory University.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.210
He is renowned for his scholarship

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.090
on human rights and Islam

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.090
and on human rights in
cross-cultural settings.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.850
His most recent book

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.830
is Islam and the Secular State

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.240
negotiating the future of Shari'a.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.120
He is on the Berkeley campus this semester

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120
as the 2010 Tanner Professor.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.810
Professor, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.850
- Thank you.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.830
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.130
- I was born in a village
north of Khartoum, Sudan

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.170
on the Nile in 1946 and I
was raised in the village

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.790
and then followed my
father around various towns

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.940
in Northern Sudan going to school

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.220
and then University of
Khartoum, but I graduated 1970.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.230
- And looking back, how do
you think your parents shaped

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.040
your thinking about the world?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.270
- I think my mother did more
but my father also was--

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.820
both of them are very
committed to education.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.380
But also, they were very open

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.723
in their lifestyle and their minds.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.450
My mother never learned to read and write,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.020
but she's one of the most
educated people I have known

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.100
in my life and my father also struggled,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.100
was a self-educated man, so
I grew up valuing education

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.600
but also valuing the
need to be open to life

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.540
and possibilities and to other people.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.901
I think that is how they raised us.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.901
- And speaking of your
mother was she a product of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.980
an oral tradition that made
her educated although not,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.480
you know, with degrees so-to-speak.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.150
- Yes, oral tradition
but also extremely smart.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.660
I mean, she was a very intelligent woman.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.020
She just grew up in Sudan
where women and girls

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.930
were not really allowed
to go to school much.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.130
But now her daughters, she puts us

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.597
all through education and higher education

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:04.200
and her daughters also
now are all educated,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.630
and I think, for me,
it is remarkable to see

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.210
in one generation how the possibilities

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.380
that were not very open to
my mum are now available

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.350
to my sisters and my children.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.437
- Mm-hmm, and what...

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.650
Because your education was
into the ways of modernity.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.520
You have PhD's and law degrees

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.773
in legal and philosophical studies,

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:37.077
what helps us understand their push

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.130
for you to be educated in a way

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.590
that went beyond the
traditional education.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.260
- I think they helped me and my siblings

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to be open and to be
willing to engage new ideas

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.950
and to be critical in our thinking.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.740
I think their greatest
gift to me personally

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.130
is really to make me
able to take advantage

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.672
of the possibilities that I came to have.

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:11.270
Then I have to credit my other teachers,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.254
my other father, my moral father,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.800
Ustadh Mahmoud Mohamed Taha,
whom I got to know while I was

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.500
at the University of Khartoum as a student

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.200
and he also opened
tremendous possibilities.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.890
I think, so I was fortunate.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.300
And now I look back at
my sort of contemporaries

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.980
in the village throughout
education in Sudan

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.570
and I wonder where they are
and what they are thinking.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.370
But I'm fortunate to be where I am

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.200
because of that gift I had.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.400
- Mm-hmm, and what was,
we'll talk about your mentor

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.150
in a moment, but I am very curious as to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.240
what are the elements
that made you comfortable

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.067
in pursuing, you know, an education

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.400
in the latter of modernity so-to-speak.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.100
I mean, why did you
choose to become a lawyer?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.243
- Of course.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.420
So as far as I remember as a child

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.749
that's always what I wanted to be.

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.470
I never wanted to be a
doctor or an engineer.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.720
To me, it was about justice
and being young and thinking

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.720
that you can bring justice to
people's lives through law.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So, a belief of the
fusion of law and justice

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.030
goes to my very early childhood
and also to the tradition

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.530
I grew up in where learning,
and learning the law,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.520
is a means to achieve justice.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.010
One of the gifts of my parents'
insights is about substance

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.190
in things, not the form.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.940
So, they were religious and
they raised us to be religious

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.270
but to them being religious
is about the values

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.270
of being religious, not the
conformity with external piety

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.850
and ostentatious piety.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.120
So, I think, that came
through with me about law,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.390
about ideas as I came to always look for

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.710
what's the point here,
not what the form is.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.710
- And is this a gift of being a Muslim

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.020
and the religious thinking

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.150
about issues in the tradition of Islam.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.000
- It is that but also it's
about responsibility, I think.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.070
Again, one of the aspect of
the gift is to be a Muslim

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.150
or to be a Christian or a Jew
or any religious affiliation

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.060
can be a blessing or a curse.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.140
For me, my religion is what I make of it.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
So, I'm not saved because I'm a Muslim,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.510
it is what sort of Muslim
I am and what that means

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.520
in my life that makes a difference.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.350
So, I think it is the ability
to work with the value

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.270
of religion without getting
sort of too bogged down

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.040
into the ritualistic formality of it.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.470
- And in your writings which
we'll talk about in a minute,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.470
I have the sense that part
of your self-realization

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.400
involving elements in your faith

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.150
that point in the direction
of self-development

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.800
even though they may be obscured

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.990
because of certain traditions

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.800
that developed in that religion.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.860
- Yes, I think all
religions start that way.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.990
I think in our personal life stories

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.950
or in the life of the tradition at large,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.750
religions start about self-realization,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.490
about self-liberation,
about responsibility,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.400
about rejection of dogma.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.520
But as they get attached to power

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.100
and as it becomes institutionalized

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.450
then I think the essence
of the religion is lost.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.090
That's why we need to renew
religious traditions now

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.600
and again because they
get sort of too entangled

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.460
in threads of power relations
and privilege and so on.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.770
So, I think the ability to discover

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.890
what the religion was about to begin with.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.590
To me, the tradition,
it cannot be stagnate.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.150
It has to be about
dynamism and self-renewal,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.320
the tradition itself or else
it ceases to be a tradition.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.800
It becomes a dead tradition.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.950
If it's a living
tradition then the essence

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.560
of following the tradition
is to follow the innovative,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.650
the creative, the sort of, what I call,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.203
every religion needs its heretics.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.630
For me, heresy is
critical to the viability

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.690
of religious experience
and the authenticity

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.230
of religious experience.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.270
So, to keep the door open for heretics

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.470
is really a blessing for every religion.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.560
- And was this an insight that
you learnt from your parents,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.173
that is the way they saw the world?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.510
- They wouldn't have
articulated it in so many words,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.370
but the way they saw the world was a way

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.680
in which you seek the substance

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.680
and you don't get, sort of,
enslaved to the formality of it,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.687
and therefore you are always
questioning whether this

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:21.300
is the right thing to do, not whether it

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.750
is the right thing that other people think

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.810
but what you think and
what you are responsible

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.270
for and so on.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.760
- And let me understand as you...

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.360
Your education ends up in legal studies

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.270
but in your earlier education,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.101
what were pieces of wisdom,

00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:44.959
books, subjects that you pursued

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:49.959
that provided steps toward
your ultimate insights?

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.110
- To me, I think, in the Muslim tradition

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.530
the Sufi tradition is the best.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.990
I mean, it is the most humane.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.910
I call it the humane face of Islam.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.050
It is the most profound.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.050
So being exposed to Sufi
poetry, Sufi insights,

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:11.280
'cause they are really
about what the essence

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.860
of the spirituality is
rather than the formality

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.510
of religious dogma is.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.360
So I think, for me, the Sufi tradition

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.970
in the Muslim experience
is very foundational.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.940
But also I got exposed
to western philosophy.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.300
I remember as a student
in, what you call then,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.023
intermediate school which like,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.423
sort of, high school level.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.910
I loved to argue and I
remembered my teacher calling me

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.580
Socrates, I mean like,
he was sort of joking,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.010
because I always-- especially

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.170
in the religious instruction class.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:54.040
I was questioning and pushing
and so he called me that

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.290
in disapproval, like you are
argumentative, you are...

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.930
But I really...

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.880
Then I went to look and
see what is this man,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.070
why am I called this and
so that was, I think,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.910
all of that came together
for me and one thing

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.700
that I came to understand is that

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.180
as a human being I should remain open

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.560
to all human experience
and I should benefit

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.493
from all human experience, good and bad.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.140
- A formative influence as you mentioned

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.060
was Mohammed Mohammed Taha.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.630
- [Abdullahi] Mm-hmm.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.234
- Tell us a little about who he was

00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:40.410
and your first encounter, if not with him,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.333
then what he was offering
in the way of a path.

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:48.930
- So, Mohammed Mohammed Taha
was actually a civil engineer

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.450
by training and by profession.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.550
But he was a Sufi in orientation

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.190
and he self-embodied very much
the values I had been talking

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.660
about in terms of how
he's transformed himself

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.590
and realized from the mental
insights about what it means

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.650
to be human and to be Muslim and to submit

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.660
to the will of God and to live by that.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.860
So, I had heard about
him long before I met him

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.940
the first time, and I remember
as a young man growing up

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.120
we were told beware, don't listen to him

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.890
because he's a spellbinder,
he will catch you

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.393
and you'll never escape.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.570
But, by chance I happened to attend one

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.360
of his lectures when I was still

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.860
at the University of Khartoum,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.988
a student in my second to third year--

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.390
- [Harry] You would've been about how old?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.487
- Been about 18, 19.

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:41.020
19, I think, yes.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.740
And I could never walk away.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.080
I mean, I just heard that first lecture.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.050
It was about the Islamic
constitution, yes and no.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.880
So his argument was that
we need the constitution

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.600
to be about the substance of being Muslim

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.510
but never to be called
an Islamic constitution,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.180
and again, order in Islamic state

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.240
as I came to argue in this book.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.100
So, I listened.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.750
I felt not only that he was talking to me,

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.810
but he was talking for me.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.840
That everything he said
sounded to me like something

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.840
that I would have thought
or felt and wanted to say,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.370
so I could never walk away.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.010
So I started following
him around and going

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.140
to his other lectures.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.150
He was an engineer but
also conducting sort

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.970
of this personal mission of propagating.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.030
Very ingenious, I think.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.447
Reformulation and
reinterpretation of Shari'a.

00:13:37.447 --> 00:13:40.700
So I followed him and it was
a struggle because he was seen

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.600
to be a heretics, to be
an outsider and to me,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.840
he was the best Muslim that can ever be

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.950
so I couldn't understand that.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.030
So, I was lucky enough to
stick around long enough

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.530
to become one of his
students and to follow him

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.180
and to be a part of his movement.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.660
- And what he was offering
for a young person such

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.470
as yourself is a path between

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.933
what was modern and what
was secular in a way,

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.650
but at the same time trying
to grapple with its relation

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.650
to the tradition and not
rejecting the tradition,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.769
is that right?

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:21.602
- Yes. Yes.
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:14:21.602 --> 00:14:26.560
- I think he helped me come
to peace with myself, I think.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.040
Like, when I heard him and I read his work

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.380
I felt like being washed in
a sense of inner tranquility

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.440
and peace because as a young
man growing up I was committed

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.670
to values of human rights,
of constitutional governance,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.510
of democratic governance,
but the tradition

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.760
of which I was part as a
Muslim growing up in Sudan

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.810
was antithetical to all of
that, and I couldn't understand

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.000
how Islam could be so negative

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.590
about women, about religious minorities,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.270
freedom of religion.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.790
By showing me that what
I rejected in Islam

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.250
was not really the essence of Islam,

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.210
but it was a human interpretation

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.810
that was contextually
historically conditioned.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.470
And so, his basic message was

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.140
that we can only understand

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.790
and experience being religious
through our experience

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.750
in life, through our context, our history

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.390
and that we couldn't possibly repeat

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.180
or re-enact earlier
understandings of Islam

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.930
which Muslim accept as
Shari'a in the modern context

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.870
because that is not what the message

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.860
of Islam is for us today.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.921
So, I think in that sense, yes.

00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:45.893
He gave me sort of an inner sense,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.560
sort of reconciliation,
two parts of myself.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.150
The longing for the authenticity and depth

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.010
and emotional attachment of
tradition and the commitment

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.290
to contemporary values of human rights

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.292
and democratization and so on.

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:08.292
- And you actually
translated his scholarship

00:16:10.494 --> 00:16:13.904
once you came to the west and so on.

00:16:13.904 --> 00:16:16.610
I'm curious because you were a follower

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.053
and he was a charismatic
leader with substance.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.473
How do you account for his insights?

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.360
Was it because he was a learned man,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.750
because he was an engineer,
because he was a religious man,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.840
all of the above?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.400
I mean, what led him to this path

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.750
that helped you understand your path?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.960
- I think very much the very fact that

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.100
as I have come to know in my life

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.460
that any of those gifts
can be an impediment.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.550
I mean, the question is being
religious or being an engineer

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.493
or being a professional
man, being a educated man,

00:16:56.605 --> 00:16:58.440
all of that could become a barrier

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.203
rather than a bridge to insight.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.820
But I think his anchor, and the anchor

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.900
that I hope he had passed onto me

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.980
and other of his students
is that true spirituality

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.643
is not about power.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.970
It's about renouncing power

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.330
and that is where you
gain a more sustainable

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.090
and more sort of self-renewing
power when you renounce it,

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.140
not when you invest in it.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.190
So, his lifestyle that...

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.800
For me, what was most striking
about his ability to live

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.670
what he preached, and to
me that remains a test

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.700
for myself and anybody else.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.800
So what extent do our actions reflect

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.960
the values we proclaim.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.210
If they don't, then there's no value

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.120
in the values you proclaim.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.780
So, it is the living flesh and blood

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.610
of being pious, not of
appearing to be pious

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.610
or putting on the semblance
of pious and so on.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.980
- In your lecture you emphasize
the importance of changing

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.240
yourself so you can
change the world following

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.590
on the examples of Gandhi
and Martin Luther King

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.490
and others that you talked about

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.290
and I have the sense now

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.720
as I listen to you that
important in the struggle

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.720
is not an out rejection of any

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.130
of the traditions that
you're grappling with,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.159
whether it's modernity and tradition,

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:44.790
so part of this self-development

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.790
is doing the hard work of
navigating between them

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:55.040
as opposed to rejecting that
one or another or embracing

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.950
one or another totally, is that fair?

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.333
- Yes, I think that's true.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.690
To me, I call it mediation because it

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.420
is not a categorical resolution.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.230
I'm not rejecting religion,
I'm not rejecting modernity,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.193
I'm not accepting the sort of
perceived truth of religion

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.310
or modernity on face value.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.630
So, to mediate is to sort
of travel between the two

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.190
and to bring a synthesis
within my own self,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.590
my own consciousness and
experience and commitment

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:34.130
and practice by that synthesis,
and I think each of us have

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.750
to find her own or his own
sort of synthesis of tradition

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.900
or modernity of whatever
competing paradigms

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.180
that we live by.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.560
And I think people like
Gandhi and Martin Luther King

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.420
have really done tremendously

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.663
in transforming the nature of power.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.950
Power is part of life and
power struggles are part of--

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.160
we shouldn't be naive to
think we can have a powerless

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.770
or a conflict-free experience.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.330
But the question is transform
the terms of the conflict

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.620
to make it non-violent and the notion

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.940
of force, not violence.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.920
They are not naive, they were not naive,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.910
they thought to affirm

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.863
but to transform the nature of power.

00:20:24.914 --> 00:20:29.304
These ideas, I find them in my
own personal life day-by-day

00:20:29.304 --> 00:20:33.250
and for me, I'm not
responsible for outcomes.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.250
I'm responsible for what I do and say,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.060
so to the extent that I live
what I preach to the best

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.250
of my ability and do my best

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.720
to transform my environment social

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720
as well as material.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.960
Then I have done my part.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.760
I'm not responsible for the outcome.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.740
- What happened to your
mentor, did he enter politics

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.530
and then what were the consequences?

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.493
- He was never in politics in
the sense of seeking power.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.290
He started in the 1930s
when the Sudanese sort

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.570
of independence struggle
started establishing

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.840
a political party called
The Republican Party

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.090
because he was seeking to
establish a republic in Sudan,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.963
a democratic republic in Sudan.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.490
But, when in the 1960s,
the party was never going

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.200
to contest election, it was a vehicle

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.013
for promoting ideas about Islamic reform.

00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:36.730
And in the 1960s when
political parties were banned

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.978
he transformed it into just
simply a social movement

00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:45.970
or a religious intellectual
reformation movement,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.047
and he continued to work
from the 50s into the 80s.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.070
But he was political but not a politician,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.190
so he engaged political issues of the day.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.410
He had an opinion, a position

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.170
on every single issue that came along.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.490
Eventually, of course, and he
was tolerated by various types

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.210
of so-called civilian and
military jibs in Sudan

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.980
until eventually it came to
head in the early 80s, 1980s,

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.110
when Numeiri who was the
dictator of the time,

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.650
he started as a military dictator,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.900
transferred that into
a single party instead,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.580
suddenly shifted to Islamic
fundamentalist ideology

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.430
and decided to impose
Shari'a as a state law

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.720
and Taha came out open
again as that charging it

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.210
as a distortion of Islam and a destruction

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.723
of the unity of the country.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.890
For that single sheet of
paper, manifest or statement

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.600
he was put on trial for
political crimes of treason,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.320
undermining the constitution,
nothing that really he did

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.580
was anything of that and he
was convicted and sentenced

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.083
to death and was executed in January 1985,

00:23:09.004 --> 00:23:11.145
and I left Sudan in April

00:23:11.145 --> 00:23:13.669
about three months after he was executed.

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:18.669
- And then you actually--
what was your next path?

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.100
In other words, you left your country

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.103
with a commitment to
advocacy so you wanted

00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:30.490
to work at implementing

00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:34.700
this heritage that you had?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.690
- Yes, I thought it
was my personal charge.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.110
I was fortunate because
I had an American friend

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.940
who was a professor at UCLA law school.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.800
He invited me to come and to
teach at UCLA for two years

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.830
and at that time I
finished the translation

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.720
of The Second Message of Islam,
Ustazh Mohammed's main book,

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.453
had it published by Syracuse in 1987.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.260
Ustazh Mohammed himself, in the early 80s,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.937
before I left Sudan, one day
he just handed me that book

00:24:08.937 --> 00:24:12.580
and he said, "Translate
this" and of course,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.520
because of my training;
I had English, Arabic

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.050
and so I took it as a
personal charge to do that.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.260
But then, for me, it
became, once he was executed

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.070
and the movement was
suppressed in Sudan I had

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.790
to leave, but thinking that my mission

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.600
is to bring his ideas to the world.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.810
That, to make it that you cannot kill

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.003
an idea by killing its author.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.180
So that was my mission and I kept watching

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.680
to see if things changing
Sudan so I could go back,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.230
and for several years I
took short term appointments

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.560
in various places until the
early 90s when it looks like it

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.060
was not likely to be that
I can go back home soon,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.400
I took a position as the
director of Africa Watch

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.260
based in Washington D.C.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.607
- So, this is Human Rights Watch--

00:25:02.607 --> 00:25:03.655
- Yes.
- Yes, it was a division

00:25:03.655 --> 00:25:04.840
of Human Rights Watch.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.540
It's called Africa Watch
at the time and then became

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.050
a division of Human Rights
Watch as a united organization,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.960
and then in 1995 I went
to Emory to go back

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.310
to teaching in law school.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.340
So, I have been teaching at
Emory law school since '95.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.340
- Help us understand the skillset

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.300
that is necessary
because you're navigating

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.030
this world between tradition and modernity

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.560
but you're also becoming a lawyer,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.053
and you are both a lawyer
and a legal philosopher,

00:25:42.995 --> 00:25:47.003
and a philosopher about politics in Islam.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.350
If students were watching
this, what are the elements

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.450
in managing all of these portfolios.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.480
It sounds like there's both
an intellectual dimension,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.760
a professional dimension but
also a psychological dimension.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.520
- I hope there's all
that, but what I know is

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.150
that it's a personal quest.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.530
I'm not really in this for achieving any

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.490
of those distinctions
or claims to expertise.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.730
I'm just personally seeking
what I believe to be right

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.250
and to do what I think
is the right thing to do.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.970
And I'm blessed and I'm
really privileged to be

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.510
an American citizen at this
point where I can pursue this

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.880
with vigor and with vitality
and to be able to reach.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.250
You know, it is amazing
that having published

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.730
Ustazh Mohammed's book in
English and my own first book

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.590
in 1990 which is called
Toward the Islamic Reformation

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.890
in which I applied his ideas.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.970
Those ideas were read more in English

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.720
than they could ever be read in Arabic.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.710
So, although he wrote in
Arabic and my own native

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.890
language is Arabic, but English is spoken

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.630
by more Muslim's around
the world than Arabic is

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.180
and publishing in English
you reach more young people

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.190
and students and professionals
than you reach them

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.410
with writing Arabic which is
restricted also in Arab region

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.880
for censorship reasons.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.220
Taha's books are not
available in the Arab world,

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.710
even in Sudan they are still banned.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.700
But being able to translate
I could reach Muslim's

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.620
in Indonesia, Muslim's in Central Asia,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.170
in Sub-Saharan, Africa and so what I see

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:40.160
is I'm just pursuing a way
of fulfilling what I believe

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.160
is my personal charge for which
I'm personally responsible.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.170
Everything else is really
truly incidental to that.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:55.050
- And in this mission there is

00:27:55.050 --> 00:28:00.050
an important element of
both education and advocacy.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.223
That is, to paraphrase what you just said,

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.516
in changing yourself you
wanna byproduct of that to be

00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:13.980
in a position to help change
the world, is that fair?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.690
- Yes, I think it's
fair but also to realize

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.870
that the most we can do
is to do the best we can.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.240
As I said I'm not responsible for outcomes

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.630
but I am responsible for
trying to improve my way

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.340
of doing what I do.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.803
To make it as persuasive and
as accessible as I can make it.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.223
On my homepage I have this notion.

00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:40.940
I think we have a website
about Islam and human rights

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.120
and we call it scholarship
for social change.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.030
That is really the motto
I work with which is,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.950
it has to be scholarship
for it to be useful.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.540
So bad scholarship doesn't help any cause.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.420
But, for me, scholar should
not be neutral in the sense

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.160
of being non-committal
about taking moral positions

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.840
and political positions.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.870
I should invest in
investigating the issues

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.000
and vigorous scholarship.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.510
But, ultimately, I have to take a position

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.540
and I have to defend that position

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.860
until I'm persuaded to change it.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.860
So, for me, it is that pursuit of,

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.900
yes, I do believe in human
agency and I do believe

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.660
that all that is good
and bad happens through

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.380
the agency of human beings.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.800
To me, God does not act in the world

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.020
except through human agency.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.100
It is agency of human beings.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.543
That is where our moral responsibility is.

00:29:39.354 --> 00:29:42.360
- A critic of your work might say,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.140
let me be the devil's advocate here,

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.050
that you are naive

00:29:49.912 --> 00:29:53.010
in your work about power

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.280
and about interest groups.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.560
If we look at the case of
your mentor, in other words

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.560
the end result was power said no,

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.710
and took his life.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.420
So, help me understand the lever

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:17.420
by which you move beyond

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.480
just rejecting power and
make your ideas influential.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.560
This obviously is a perennial problem,

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.460
namely theory and practice.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.293
- [Abdullahi] Sure.

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.770
- And so, as we develop the best ideas,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.890
and you are really doing
an important contribution

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.210
in that regard.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.390
In the end, what is
involved in implementation?

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.493
- Mm-hmm, I call myself
a pragmatic optimist.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.070
So, I'm optimistic in that
looking at the longer span

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.540
of history, and I see how great ideas came

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.410
to evolve and triumph over time.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.890
I'm confident that human
rights, democratization,

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.370
Islamic reform will triumph over time.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.000
It is the short term that
people have a hard time with,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.080
and for me, that conviction of optimism

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.590
is really what is driving me.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.540
But it is a pragmatic optimism,
it is not a naive optimism.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.340
It's understanding the nature of power

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.347
but seeking to co-opt it,

00:31:21.347 --> 00:31:25.110
and as I said about Gandhi,
seeking to transform it.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:30.110
So, it is not a power-free
world but it is who has power

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.660
to what ends and, for
me, the fusion of power.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.480
And education is key to the fusion

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.983
of the power of knowledge.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.150
Religious education and
religious experience

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.710
is the fusion of religious authority

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.580
and so, to me, I say
that power and authority

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.153
is in the eyes of the beholder.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.033
You have power over me to the
extent that I conceded to you.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.453
But if I deny it there is
no way that you can get it,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.900
so enhancing people's ability to hold on

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.470
to their own self-empowerment
and to refuse

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.370
to concede power to
others whether kinetics

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.430
or intellectual leads of whoever,

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:21.430
this is my most cherished
resource, my self-empowerment.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.820
I refuse to concede it, end of story.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.800
But it's not that easy, yes.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.180
And therefore, I work
with political action,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.540
I work with human rights advocacy.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.330
I work with ideas to create conditions

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.310
where older people like myself don't have

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.700
to be exceptional like
Gandhi or Martin Luther King.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.863
So I'm not a hero.

00:32:47.068 --> 00:32:50.670
I don't want to be put
in prison or tortured.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.993
That's why I invest in human rights.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.980
So, I think honestly, I would say

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.150
that I am more pragmatic
than those who think

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.870
that they can impose the so-called notion

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.670
of imperialism.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.660
Those who think they can
impose their values on others,

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.760
they are the naive ones.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.783
I am the pragmatic one who
knows that it cannot be done.

00:33:15.394 --> 00:33:18.610
- Let's talk a little about
Islam and the Secular State

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.160
and show your book, and some
very important ideas here

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.660
because what you are trying to do

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.530
is bring a perspective to Islam

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.380
and its dilemmas that it's not

00:33:35.786 --> 00:33:38.060
that you're coming up with something new,

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.810
you're trying to articulate
a different tradition

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.170
within the tradition in order

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:50.170
to help Muslims deal with this dilemma

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.630
of modernity versus tradition

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:59.630
and so you have an important
point about the separation

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.330
of the state and Islam.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.680
Explain that to us, because you believe

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.860
your faith is important in the context

00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.890
of a separation but not a
separation of Islam from politics.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.443
- [Abdullahi] Yes.

00:34:19.443 --> 00:34:21.120
- Please, disentangle that for us.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.120
- If I may actually, I would
like to read the first sentence

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:30.510
in the first chapter
because that is really key

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.823
to my whole approach.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.253
In chapter one, the first sentence I say,

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.460
in order to be a Muslim by conviction

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.460
and free choice which is the
only way one can be a Muslim,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.743
I need a seculary state.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.930
So my claim is that a state that

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:52.180
is neutral regarding religious doctrine,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.700
it does not take a position or religion,

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.560
is absolutely essential
for the possibility

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.490
of being religious because once a state

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:05.460
takes a doctrinal position in any religion

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.220
no matter how popular and
widely held that position is,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.960
it is bound to be
oppressive of some believers

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.400
or others who do not agree with that.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.210
So, I am opposed to totalitarian states

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.343
whether ideological or religious.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.360
Second point, is that what
I am articulating, I think,

00:35:27.427 --> 00:35:30.370
and I try to demonstrate in chapter two,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.430
is in fact Muslim history.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.913
That the notion of our
Islamic state is the heresy.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.340
It is the new idea, it is
a postcolonial discourse

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.920
that throughout 1400
years of Muslim history

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.900
the state has never been Islamic.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.610
It is in the postcolonial
context using a European idea

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.920
of the state and a European
idea of positive law

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.860
that Islamic's like
Maududi, for the first time

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.920
in the mid 20th century
articulated the notion

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.450
of an Islamic state to enforce
Shari'a as a state law.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:14.700
So I am more with the tradition

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.150
in naming what we have lived with

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:23.050
as seculary states, not
religious states and they are,

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.880
I mean the Islamic's, are
the ones who are departing

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.800
from tradition by injecting,
mixing a European idea

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.010
of the state and as a
hierarchical centralized

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.930
political power with a
notion of positive law

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.920
to bring Shari'a into
enactment as a state law

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.500
is a negation of the
religious quality of Shari'a.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.800
It ceases to be Shari'a by the very act

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.110
of enacting it as a state law.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.380
But, then also I have to acknowledge

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.040
that Muslims have this
longing for their values

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.520
to be reflected in their politics

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.060
and by all means all societies do so.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.070
The point for me is that the state

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:11.070
as an institution must be
separated from religion,

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:16.140
but politics is how people
behave and the choices they make,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.740
so long as we can change our mind

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.570
about the politics we choose.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.290
So, I emphasize
constitutionalism, human rights

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.850
and citizenship as the bulwark for,

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.680
what I call civic reason, which
is similar to Rawls notion

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.600
of public reason but different.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.970
My notion is more inclusive than his

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:41.970
and I find it more broadly
acceptable to Muslims

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:47.310
because I'm saying you
can justify state policies

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.410
with reference to reasons
that all citizens can share

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.930
or debate without reference
to religious belief,

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.140
because if you say we have to
do this because God said so,

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.760
end of conversation.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.740
But if you say I have to do this,

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.740
we should do this democratically
because of 1-2-3-4-5,

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.200
I can argue with you about
1-2-3-4-5, so that combination

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.980
of saying that in your
politics you can reflect

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.320
your religious values but
it has to be contested

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.590
and the constitutional
protection for everybody.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:30.400
But institutionally, keep
the state out of religion

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.150
and keep religion out of the state.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.870
- Let's go over this briefly

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.260
'cause I want our audience to be clear

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.093
about what you're saying.

00:38:41.093 --> 00:38:44.060
So, in a way, the state is about power.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.996
- [Abdullahi] Yeah.

00:38:44.996 --> 00:38:49.060
- And about forcing people,
coercing people to do things

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.630
but it performs a function

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.620
which is to create a society

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.010
that is regulated so different religions

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.170
and different conversations
and dialogues can occur,

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.820
and in that world of society and politics

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:13.760
a person can be religious
and bring their faith

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.120
and their moral convictions
to the discussion.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.120
But these two things in our
time have been conflated,

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.870
namely the notion that to
bring Islam to politics

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.986
and society you have to control the state.

00:39:29.986 --> 00:39:30.819
- Yes.

00:39:30.819 --> 00:39:31.822
- And you were rejecting that.

00:39:31.822 --> 00:39:32.655
- Yeah.

00:39:32.655 --> 00:39:36.220
- Now, what I'm curious
about is that has happened

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:40.410
in our time because of power.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:45.410
You know, the power of
imperialism has brought changes

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.820
to the Muslim world
especially the Arab world

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.420
that has been rejected by
extremists within Islam.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.620
So, I guess what I find intriguing

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.360
is there's a power game
here both, you know, coming

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.180
from the west in the form of
imperialism and the reaction,

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.301
you know, among Islamic extremists.

00:40:08.301 --> 00:40:12.420
So, how does one win the dialogue?

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.720
How does one empower ideas such as yours

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.720
and Taba to have a voice in this struggle.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.510
- I think it is already happening,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.670
but it is just to be careful
and about how to do it

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.370
and how to do it more effectively.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.880
The Islamic's, I call
them the fundamentalist,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.453
really they are disingenuous in that they,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.110
sort of, directorate is opposing the west

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:49.790
and imperial recent history
and new colonial history,

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.790
but their practice is
in fact co-opted a more,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.420
taken by western institutions.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.190
I mean, they do not
reject everything western.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.170
They are very selective,
they keep the state which

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.300
is a western institution
so in the Muslim world,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.440
in Africa and Asia,
the state was imperial.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.510
It had very little to do...

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.520
So, in the precolonial
time there were states

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.130
but they were not centralized
institutional sort

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.640
of bureaucracies like the
European state has come to be.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.030
So when the European
colonial administration,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.170
British and French
brought this European idea

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.583
of the state and European
colonialism ended,

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.720
Muslim societies kept the
European idea of the state

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.780
as a totalitarian bound
centralized hierarchical

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.003
coercive political authority.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.510
The most characteristically
European and colonial

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.800
of all political institutions, they kept.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.150
But they want to inject into
it so they kept the shell

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.537
of a state and they
want to bring the values

00:41:57.537 --> 00:42:02.537
and the institutions of a
previous era into that new shell

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:06.280
with which I mean, there
is incompatibility here.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.840
So that is what I'm challenging.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.940
I'm challenging to say
that since we have to live

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.560
with the postcolonial state
as that is the most viable

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.650
for the time being until we change it

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:20.180
through its own institutions over time,

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.210
if we decide to do that.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.230
But since we have to live
with it we have to bring

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.810
in the safeguards that are more consistent

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:29.970
with the nature of the state.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.630
So constitutional governance,
human rights protection

00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:37.240
and the experiences of the same societies

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.020
that evolved these states had been found

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.760
to be extremely useful.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.250
So, to go back to your
remarks, I agree completely.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.640
I should have clarified
the state has limited

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.340
but very important
functions, but it is by far

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.000
from being the totality of
the public life of societies.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.640
So the state should be kept
neutral for the purposes

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.970
of keeping the peace, of
adjudicating disputes,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.260
of allocating resources and
mediating political conflicts.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.280
That is what the state is for,

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.150
and defending the realm
against aggression,

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.520
that is the functions of the state.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.450
But the rest of life in civil society,

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:23.863
in religious institutions,
in the universities, culture,

00:43:25.052 --> 00:43:29.320
all of that is where
religion can be part of life

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.650
as it should be, I believe, as a Muslim,

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.950
but not to be in any way sort of co-opted

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.950
by the state or co-opting the state.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.450
- You make a important distinction

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:48.450
in trying to reinforce
intellectually the separation

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.280
that the authority in
religion and in a state

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.280
are very different as is the
function of religious authority

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.970
and political authority and the state.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.133
Talk a little about that
'cause it's very important.

00:44:03.133 --> 00:44:05.720
They are two different kinds of authority

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.950
and when religious leaders
takeover the state,

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.910
which you are saying they shouldn't do,

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.830
then there is a corruption
of both kinds of authority.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.830
- Yes, actually Iran today
is a very instructive example

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.130
of that confusion because the nature

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:27.660
of religious authority must be
spontaneous in the community.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.300
That is, because it is premised

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.890
on a notion of piety
and religious knowledge,

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.973
that is very difficult
to quantify or to verify.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.740
So, whom I trust to be my
religious spiritual leader

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.150
is someone that has to be my choice based

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.683
on my understanding of,
or knowledge of the person

00:44:50.683 --> 00:44:55.683
and how his piety and honesty
and consistency and so on.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.870
That sort of authority
is drastically different

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.620
from the nature of
political authority which

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.360
is inherently coercive and
which has to be something

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.330
that is the object of
a verifiable authority,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:13.250
the ability of someone
to exercise authority

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.040
in a coercive fashion.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.280
So confusing the two...

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.490
So what I'm saying is that the
nature of religious authority

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.780
and the nature of political authority

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.610
are fundamentally different.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:30.500
So someone may have the charisma
and that person may endow

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.520
11 of this and the other,
but still they are different,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.450
they are separate.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.940
And this is not to say
that there's no politics

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.370
in religious institutions,
the Catholic church

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:46.370
or local community of Muslims
or a Jewish community.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:51.490
There is politics everywhere
but the question is

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.970
that the nature of
religious authority must

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:58.970
be kept spontaneous, sort of voluntary

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.080
because to coerce someone,

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.150
to accept someone else's authority

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.200
is a negation of the
possibility of being religious.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.950
So, Iran today, gives us a
very clear example of how,

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:15.950
when you think of the
supreme ruler or guardian

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.420
who is above the constitution,
but how does he get

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.840
to be there other than in politics.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.270
So the very idea of a council of clerics

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.750
who politically get to
be at sort of the peak

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:36.670
of religious authority
is really a negation

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.050
of the nature of true religious piety.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:44.050
- In your work you identify
traditions within Islam

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.970
that pose a problem for someone

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.950
who's western and modern.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:56.015
The treatment of women, for
example, the relationship

00:46:56.015 --> 00:47:00.950
of Muslims to non-Muslims
in other religious groups

00:47:03.165 --> 00:47:06.897
and then the whole question of
jihad whether one implements

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.913
a jihad against the other.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.480
Obviously, these three problematic areas

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.743
will arise in a realm of politics.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.840
What is the key here because you say also

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.570
that the focus of your
life's work is really

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.500
to mediate universalism
in particular settings,

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.690
so particular settings,
cultures have to be respected

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:44.690
but the agenda is to bring citizenship,

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:49.070
human rights, constitutionalism
to these settings

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:53.410
and in the politics and
society you're gonna run up

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.670
against these problematic
areas, the treatment of women.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.563
Talk a little about that,
what is the way out there?

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.860
- If I can put it this way.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.780
To me, the notion of universal
human rights is a concept,

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.200
and a content, and a context.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.940
So the concept is a concept of rights

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.073
of humans as humans everywhere.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.500
The content, that is, what
are the specific rights

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.130
and sort of a list of
rights that we acknowledge

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.300
as human rights is a content
that is produced through

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:37.300
a consultation, consultative
consensus building process.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.130
So, for me, the universality
of the content of,

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.770
say equality for women,
to me it is a human right.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:50.360
But it is not a human right
because western society says so,

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.963
but because I believe Islam says so too.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.350
And my charge is to articulate
that Islamic rationale

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:02.020
not only for myself but
also for other Muslims

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.460
who are more likely to be
persuaded if they see it

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.840
as an Islamic value than
if it is presented to them

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.560
as a western value they had to concede.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:16.010
So, I say that universality
is not proclaimed.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:19.040
It is constructed through dialogue,

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.810
and I use Rawls idea of
overlapping consensus to say

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:27.460
that we can agree on a set
of human rights norms despite

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.580
our disagreement as to why
we came to that conviction.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.100
So as a Muslim I choose to
come to it from an Islamic

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.743
discourse, not denying
anybody else the right to come

00:49:38.743 --> 00:49:41.730
to that conviction through
any other discourse

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.600
but claiming my right
to do so in my discourse

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.560
because as a matter of
principle that is a fulfillment

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.560
of my self-determination
as a person, as a community

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.620
but also practically it is more likely

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.500
to be persuasive to Muslim.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.470
So the values that you mention
are the problematic aspects

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.820
which is about freedom of religion,

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.480
treatment of religious minorities, women,

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.080
equality for women.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.450
To me, these are human
values, not western values,

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:15.810
and I do not accept that all
western societies subscribe

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.690
to these values.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:21.060
After all, the holocaust
is a western phenomena.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.110
Fascism is a western phenomena.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:27.260
So, it is not as if the west
is enlightened, democratic,

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.700
humane and the rest of the
world is-- which was really

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.910
the logic of imperialism.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:37.170
To say, that we are out to the
so-called white man's burden,

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.690
to civilize Africans by colonizing them.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:42.990
That is the same logic, so I reject that.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:46.480
I do not believe that human
rights can be advanced

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.210
by discourse that says they are western,

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.130
and in my charge is to make
them acceptable to Muslims.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.990
My charge is to bring Muslim voices,

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:01.980
my own and others, into
debating what human rights

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.180
as a content mean.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.080
And, yes, the context eventually
will come in to say even

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.960
if we subscribe to these
values, the way we translate

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.890
how they apply in practice
will also be a matter

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.700
of context and priorities and
Americans should understand

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.950
this because they refuse to
accept international supervision

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.780
of their human rights practice at home.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.980
They say our constitution is
our ultimate sort of arbiter

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.760
of what rights are due to Americans

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.410
and by the same token other
people will have the same claim.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.800
I think that many other
societies are willing to be part

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.540
of a global venture of human
rights universal standards

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.380
than Americans are.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:53.360
So, come back to say the United
States is more relativist

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.550
just like China is
relativist, just like Iran

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.490
is relativist more than
many of the African

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.770
and other Asian countries
where Muslims are the majority.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:09.770
- So, the agenda then for
scholarship, and your scholarship,

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:14.480
is to bring clarity and lucidity both

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.260
to what human rights are on the one hand

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.980
and what Islam is for Muslims

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.350
so it's a dual education process

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:31.540
which must be brought to mare not only

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.750
for Muslim communities
but also to the powerful

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:39.730
such as the United
States who basically say,

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.457
well, we're for universal rights,

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.050
we just don't abide by
them when we chose not to,

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:51.420
and you're saying the role of advocacy

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.970
is to be lucid for both settings.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:56.450
- [Abdullahi] Yes, yeah.
- Basically.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:57.930
Yes, I think you are right.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.700
What I say is this, that the process

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:04.040
of building consensus
around humans rights norms

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.060
and their institutions is dual.

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.480
It is what I call internal discourse

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.640
to transform cultural understandings,

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.210
a religious understanding
within Muslim communities.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.310
That's an internal discourse.

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.503
Then I call cross-cultural dialogue,

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:26.600
but my approach is premise on
the ability and willingness

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.160
of other human rights
advocates in other societies

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.570
to do their internal discourse so that,

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.260
if you see, for example,
the United States,

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.410
and let's compare it to
another country rather

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.990
than a religion or religious Islam.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:45.663
Say, United States and Egypt
or United States and Turkey.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.060
American human rights
advocates should be grappling

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.760
with human rights issues
that are problematic

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:57.420
to Americans, not to others,
and equality for women

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.180
is still is a problem for many Americans.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.580
The question of the death
penalty maybe, the question of,

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.220
whatever the issue,
economic and social rights,

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.620
a right to healthcare,
a right to education.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.710
Other societies take this as human rights.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.330
Americans are not willing to do that.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:16.310
So I would say that charge
American human rights advocates

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.640
to struggle just to get a
feel of how difficult it is

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.560
to transform attitudes
within your own society.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.450
The death penalty is a good example.

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:29.410
See those who have struggled
to abolish the death penalty

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.930
and how hard it has been to
understand how difficult it is

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.610
for others to do the
same in their societies.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.810
But assuming that both
sides of us are doing this

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:43.240
then we can engage in what I
call cross-cultural dialogue

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.150
to promote consensus.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.500
So it is not that I'm
assuming that Muslim societies

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:52.570
will come to the table just fully closed

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.660
with their own convictions and no change.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.440
But know that there are
human rights activists,

00:55:00.051 --> 00:55:03.350
there are freedom of religion
activists who are struggling

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:04.620
in those societies.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.000
Now, about imperialism, if
I may close with this point

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.280
is that imperialism
makes it very difficult

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:16.590
for human rights advocates
to struggle for the rule

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.783
of law in international
relations and they struggle

00:55:18.783 --> 00:55:21.633
for human rights in their societies.

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.880
That, for me, as a Muslim I would say

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.220
the United States behavior should not

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:32.370
be my standard so that
I should be committed

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.840
to these values regardless
of what the west does

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.450
or does not do.

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.670
But the reality is that many
people in my communities

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.590
will say why should we
abide by these standards

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.350
if the United States is not
willing to abide by them.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:48.800
So that double standard issue, sort of,

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.430
therefore when I say that
imperial impulse of United States

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:57.230
like invading Iraq or engaging in sort

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:01.320
of imperial ventures, that undermines

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.473
the very possibility of international law.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.660
I want to challenge jihad,
Muslim sort of understanding

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.310
of aggressive jihad, as
contrary to the rule of law

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.620
and contrary to civilized behavior,

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.970
but it's very difficult to do that

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:20.750
when people feel under
attack by a super power

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:24.630
that appropriate the
right to act unilaterally,

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:28.370
arbitrarily outside
international institutions

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:31.550
and expect others to abide
by those institutions.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.490
- The short term problem seems

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.030
to be power and the abuse of power.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.630
The long term solution is
people changing themselves

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.623
and changing their world.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.900
Briefly, one last question,
time is just about up,

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.010
for a brief answer.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.510
How would you advise students

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.873
to prepare for navigating this?

00:56:55.750 --> 00:57:00.450
In our discussion you have
described what chasing the flame

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.130
and keeping the flame
alive was for you because

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:07.138
of your parents and also
because of your mentor, Taba.

00:57:07.138 --> 00:57:10.020
What advice for students?

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.053
- Keep it personal.

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:15.570
I think so long as when we
think that we are solving

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:18.770
the world's problems but not our own,

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:20.420
I think we are missing the point.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.100
Only for me, as far as what
message I would like to bring

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:28.280
is keep it personal, keep it immediate

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:33.710
because I tend to avoid
responsibility if I can,

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.630
I tend to evade questions if I can.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:38.723
So keep my feet to the fire,

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.390
understand that I have a
very limited span of life

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:48.390
in which I am supposed to heal
my inner self into one being

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:53.743
so that when I depart, I
depart whole and not divided.

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.590
I don't have time to waste
and I would say for everybody,

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:04.070
find your cause, find your
issue but keep it personal

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.500
and give it the best you can.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.670
- Abdullahi, thank you.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.870
That was a great discussion.

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:16.030
Let me show your book one more
time and I wanna thank you

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:20.496
for coming to the Berkeley
campus and being on our program.

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.850
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:24.560
- Thank you, and thank you
very much for joining us

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.493
for this conversation with history.

00:58:27.386 --> 00:58:30.969
(bright synthesizer music)
