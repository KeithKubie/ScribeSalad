CHRIS SADEN: Do you have
the next great idea,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.670
but don't know how to build it?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.350
Check out the
Product Design course

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.500
developed by Google
and Udacity to learn

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.110
the basics of developing your
idea into a marketable product.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.870
Design your first
product faster than you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.040
might think without fancy
tools and thousands of dollars.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.570
In this course, you'll design,
prototype, and test your ideas.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.199
You will also design mock-ups
to communicate your idea

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990
and capture metrics to
support your growth.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.690
This course uses the
methodology that Google Venture

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.410
uses with their start-ups to get
them moving quickly and easily.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.040
Start creating today.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.830
