&gt;&gt; Jennifer Manning: Good
morning, can everyone hear me?

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.790
Good. I'm Jennifer Manning.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.430
I'm a librarian with the
Congressional Research Service here

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.870
at the library.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.100 position:56%
On behalf of Native American
employees and friends at the library

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.730 position:56%
of congress, I'd like to welcome you

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.500
to this Native American
heritage month event.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.830 position:56%
Thank you for coming and celebrating
with us on this rather gloomy day.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.820
We have a full day ahead of
us, so without further ado,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.110
it's my pleasure to
introduce the library's Chief

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.510
of Staff, Mr. Robert Newlen.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.510

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Well
thank you and good morning.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.420 position:56%
I have been Chief of Staff here at
the library for just about one year.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.720
In fact, I've been celebrating
several anniversaries

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.190
in the past week.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.950
I have been Chief of
Staff for a year

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.460
and I celebrated my 40th
Anniversary of employment

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.560
with the Library of Congress.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.450
And I could-- [applause]--
thank you.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.080
Yes, I know it's amazing
that I'm still standing.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.270 position:56%
But it's a wonderful institution and
a wonderful place to have a career

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.400
and I'm really looking
forward to you learning more

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120
about our many resources today.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.660 position:56%
One thing I should note too is, this
is my maiden voyage using an iPad

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.120
for my remarks but, the acting
Librarian of Congress, David Mao,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.260
uses one all the time and
he's very facile with it.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.170
So I've seen him speak enough and I
kind of got jealous and I thought,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.890
well he's making me look like a
troglodyte so I'm going to do it.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.710
But I just want you to know that
I'm also carrying the paper copy

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.100
in my back pocket because
you never know.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.800
But it is my pleasure to welcome
you to the Library of Congress

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.440 position:56%
and today's program showcasing three
LC programs and your opportunity

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.050
to connect with our collections
that showcase the great heritage

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.490
of American Indians who
have lived on this land

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.810
for thousands and thousands
of years.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.520
The library as you probably know
has over-- there I just did it--

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.410
has over fifteen million
items in all formats.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.200 position:56%
We acquire them, we prepare them, we
organize them, and we preserve them.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.470 position:56%
Today's theme is Connecting American
Indian and Federal Libraries

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.620
and our goal for you
in the audience,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.590
whether you are listening online
or viewing this through a webcast,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.690
is to learn about Native
American Research and Resources

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.300 position:56%
But I hope you will also get to know
one of our greatest treasures here

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.620
at the library, and that is
the Library of Congress staff.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.800
They have incredible knowledge
of our collections and are here

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.960
to help you navigate this
marvelous institution.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.270 position:56%
You will find lots of people like me
that have been here 35, 40, 45 years

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.140
and sometimes at this stage I think
it takes that long to really get

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.190
to know the Library of Congress
collections and when I look

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.070
around this room I see
so many talented people.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.690

Yolanda, Blaine, Jennifer, Eric.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340 position:56%
All people who have incredible
knowledge of this great institution,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.410
so today please take
advantage of them,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.450
and I know they will all
share their e-mails with you.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.530
Today we are going to have
presentations from 3 major programs

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.930
that further our work
with American Indians.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.220
In just a few moments
we'll learn about the work

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.650
of the FEDLINK American
Library Initiative.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.890
At noon, a former Kluge
scholar and a panel

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.130 position:56%
of cultural experts will talk about
federal and regional Native history.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.820
And at 2 p.m. the Law Library will
present the indigenous tribal law

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.990
portal which is available online.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.800
And in between, you'll be seeing
presentations from our curators,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.700 position:56%
from the geography and map division,
from prints and photographs,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.340
from manuscripts, and
from rare books.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.540
What we're hoping is, is that what
you find here today will wet your

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.910
appetite to keep coming
back again and again.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.520
We also hope that it will help
you find a place to expand

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.280
and deepen your understanding of
Native American, American Indian

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.180
and indigenous peoples
of the world who link us

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.750
to a great past and
to a great future.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.690
We invite you to continue learning

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.120
about our cooperative web portal
nativeamericanhertiagemonth.com I

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.420
think I got that right.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.670
So with that said, it is my
pleasure to welcome you here

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.480
and anything we can do to make
your visit more enjoyable,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.120
please let us know.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.490
I'm hoping to come in and
out of the program today.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.520
I feel like I'm on
the lecture circuit.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.020
I'm going directly from here
to talk to a management group

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.050
about our strategic plan.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.630
Trust me, I'd rather be here.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.510
So with that, thank you so much.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.510
[ Applause ]

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:32.050
[ Background Sounds ]

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.100
&gt;&gt; George Franchois:
Okay, let's see here.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.710
All right.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.820
Unfortunately, I don't
have an iPad yet.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.200
I am keeping my fingers
crossed for Christmas,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.370
but we shall see what happens.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.470
So I'm doing this the
old fashion way.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.280
My name is George Franchois.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.430
I'm the Director of the Department
of the Interior Library here

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.230
in Washington DC and I'm going
to talk to you a little bit

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.690 position:56%
about the Department of the Interior
Library and the Tribal College

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.010 position:56%
and University Library Initiative
that we are very much involved with.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.610
So first I want to
tell you a little bit

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.780
about the Department of
the Interior Library.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.070
We are located again
here in Washington DC

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.670 position:56%
in the Stewart Lee Udall
Department of the Interior Building,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.560
1849 C Street Northwest, Room 2262.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.520
We are open to the public.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.950
We're open from 7:45
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.340
through Friday except
for federal holidays.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.420
We will be closed tomorrow
for Veteran's Day.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.280
We do provide inner
library loan services.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.620
We both lend things out to other
libraries around the country,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.550
and it doesn't matter,
public libraries,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.830
university libraries,
corporate libraries.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.760
We will loan things out to you
that are circulating materials,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.190
and we of course process
in our library loan request

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.340
for our own staff as well.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.190
Our website is www.doi.gov/library.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.360
We've got a lot of great resources
on our website including a lot

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.680
of great Native American resources
on our website, so we invite you

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.670
to take a look at that site for
information about the Department

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.040
of the Interior, our library,
and Native American Resources.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.330
Now currently our library
is in the midst

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.290 position:56%
of a 2-year modernization/renovation
project.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.890
So we are actually operating

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.460
out of a much smaller
temporary library right now.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.750
Most of our popular
legal legislative

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.370
and reference materials are
located in our temporary library,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:47.010
but about 90 to 95 percent of
our material right now is located

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.010
in an offsite warehouse
in Sterling, Virginia.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.980
We do have a courier service that
goes back and forth twice a week

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.620
so if that we need materials

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.670
from the warehouse we
can get them pulled.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.660
And we are like I said scheduled

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.270
to reopen probably
late 2016, early 2017.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.470
Some of our facilities people are
telling me, it could be as early

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.900
as next October, but I'm
not holding my breath

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.280
on that one knowing our
facilities people at DOI.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.280
So we shall see what
happens there as well.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.530
We've got about a one million
volume collection all together.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.390
Things that we collect
include materials published

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.170
by all the DOI bureaus,
offices, and agencies as well

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.990
as commercial publications that
have subject areas that deal

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.920
with Department of
the Interior issues.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.840
So we collect things
from all of our bureaus.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.130
Like I said, the Bureau of
Indian Affairs we collect a lot

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.100
of materials from, National Park
Service, Bureau of Land Management,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.080
Bureau of Reclamation, Fish
and Wildlife Service, USGS,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.780
several others as well and it's not
just BIA that produces materials

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.090
that deal with Native
American issues.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.030
All of the agencies within
the Department of the Interior

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.230
to one extent to another have
materials that they published

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.080
that deal with Native American
heritage, history, current events

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.590
that Native Americans were involved
with, etc. So almost everything

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.890
in our collection in one way

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.100
or another touches the
Native American community.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.720
We also have a legal and
administrative collection

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.020
that includes bureau and
agency directives and orders,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.150
secretarial orders, and executive
orders and proclamations.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.970
And again many of these items
also contain materials related

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.600
to Native American affairs.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:48.010
So how did this whole
movement to try

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.550
to help Native American libraries,
and specifically Tribal College

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.710
and university libraries
get started?

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.590
It basically had its
genesis back in 2002,

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.350
with Executive Order
number 13270, July 3rd 2002,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.490
entitled Tribal College
and Universities

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.380
and this said each participating
executive department and agency is

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.370
to develop plans that would
address how the agency intends

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.750
to increase the capacity of tribal
colleges to compete effectively

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.260
for any available grants,
contracts, cooperative agreements,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.340
and any other federal resources,
and to encourage tribal colleges

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.680
to participate in federal programs.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.070
The plans also may emphasize access

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.380
to high quality educational
opportunities

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.630
for economically disadvantaged
Indian students,

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:44.640
consistent with requirements of
No child Left Behind Act of 2001.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.820
So at this point what happened was
organizations such as the Institute

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.320
for Museum and Library Services
placed an increased emphasis

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.700
on providing grants and other
opportunities for tribal colleges

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.780
and university libraries.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.270
The Bureau of Indian
Education within the Department

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.390
of the Interior began to
work a little more closely

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.600
with tribal college and
university libraries,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.710
and the American Indian Higher
Education Contortion also started

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:18.130
to work a little more closely with
tribal colleges and universities

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.570
on mutually beneficial projects.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.960
The one thing though
that was going on at

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.380
that time was a case called the
Cobell case, and I think many

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.010
of you might be familiar
with that case

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.600 position:56%
where Native American tribes were
suing the Department of the Interior

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.390
for mishandling Indian trust funds.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.700
So there was a high degree
at that point of mistrust

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.250
between Native American tribes
and the Department of the Interior

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.470
and not as much really got done
on this front as we would've hoped

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.900
to have gotten done at that point.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.620
So because of the suspicions that
existed between the Department

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.220
of the Interior and a lot
of Native American tribes,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.850
a lot of these initiatives
unfortunately were put off a little

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.250
bit at that time.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:21.440
So we fast forward to February
14th, 2011, Valentine's Day

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.740
which is a great day
for a [inaudible]

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.430
of understanding, of course.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.780
So MOU was signed between the
Bureau of Indian Education

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.500
and the American Indian
Higher Education Consortium.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.430
By February 14th, 2011 the
Cobell case had been settled,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.320
and the suspicions were
still there a little bit,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.000
a lot of those suspicions and a
lot of those mistrusts had kind

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.540
of evaporated as a result of
the settlement being reached.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:59.560 position:56%
So the memorandum of understanding
stated that DOI and AIHEC will focus

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.350
on strengthening the
capacities of TCU's

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.370
and supporting their
full integration

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.530
into DOI's programs and services.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.970
This MOU will also promote
enriching outdoor experiences

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.460
and law enforcement and natural
resources and other science

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.640
and technology career pathways.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.530
Amongst students attending TCU's
and their feeder K-12 schools.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:28.480 position:56%
Part of the initiative, part of this
memorandum of understanding also was

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.610
to fully integrate TCU's into DOI
mission areas and bureau programs,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.540
services and resource
opportunities and provide linkage

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.070
and develop partnerships
between TCU's

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:45.090
and DOI and bureaus and offices.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.330
Part of what happened as a
result-- let me go back here--

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.870
as a result of this as well,
it is that the Department

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.970
of the Interior Library was
brought into the process

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.700
and asked how can the Department
of the Interior Library participate

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:06.580 position:56%
and contribute to this initiative,
to this MOU that was signed in 2011?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.260
And this is when we first
heard about getting started

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.410
with this particular initiative.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.480
Soon thereafter, December 2nd,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.200
2011 an executive order was
signed improving American Indian

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.810
and Alaskan Native
educational opportunities

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.100
and strengthening tribal
colleges and universities.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.630
And what this did was established
a formal White House Initiative

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.430
on American Indian and
Alaska Native Education.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.780
The Secretary of Education
and the Secretary

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.930
of the Interior are
co-chairs of the initiative.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.350
Missions of the initiative,
service liaison

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.790
with other executive branch
agencies on American Indian

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.220
and Alaskan Native issues
and advise those agencies

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.730
on how they might help
promote American Indian

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.140
and Alaskan Native
educational opportunities.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.810
Further tribal sovereignty
by supporting efforts,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.800
consistent with applicable
law, to build the capacity

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.130
of tribal educational
agencies and TCU's

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.960
to provide high quality education
services to American Indian

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.910
and Alaska Native children
and increase college access

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:23.290
and completion for American
Indian and Alaska Native students

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.850
through strategies to
strengthen the capacity of TCU's.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:35.570
So in early 2002, the Bureau of
Indian Education with NDOI met

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.240
with representatives of other
DOI bureaus and agencies

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.710
to discuss how we can
best go about doing this.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.730
The office of the secretary
again asked DOI's library

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.550
to help participate in this and
asked if we can expand our services

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.470
and outreach to TCU's
through their libraries.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.660
Now of course, our
budget is not as such

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.120
that we could expand our budget too
dramatically to help with this sort

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.040
of effort, so it had be
something that we could do

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.730
that wouldn't necessarily cost
a lot of money to the library

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.330 position:56%
or to the Department of the Interior
a lot of ideas were presented

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.780
to TCU presidents and
there was a lot of interest

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.060
within the TCU community and
the library services assistance

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.400
to their own libraries and
their own library communities.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.960
So at that point we
got together with AIHEC

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.240
and discussed what the best way
to start this project would be.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:45.420
So we received a list of
libraries and library leaders

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:51.520
at 37 AIHEC member libraries
and sent out a survey to all

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.960
of them asking them a number
of different questions.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.230
They included questions about
high-speed internet access

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.850
in their library and on
campus, electronic databases

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.210
and e-book subscriptions in
their library, and whether

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.510
or not they had inner
library loan services, whether

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.570
or not they received
government documents

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.550
through the GPO's Federal
Depository Library Program.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.640
And we asked them about other
items, services and resources

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.100
that they felt they needed
to provide quality services

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.200
to their students and staff.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.050
We received responses from
19 AIHEC member libraries

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.640
as a result of that survey.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.990
And some of the things
that they told us were

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.380
that they needed additional
staffing,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.990
they needed additional funding
to purchase to more resources,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.020
they need additional funding
to offset the increasing prices

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.970
of databases and print materials.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.830
They would like consortium pricing

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.610
for databases integrated
library systems.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.540
They were interested in inner
library loan reciprocal lending

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.660
agreements and a possible TCU
inner library loan consortium.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.640
They wanted more computers
in their libraries.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.940
They wanted the means to be able

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.730
to remote library services
and resources.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.690
They needed better
transportation to TCU libraries

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.060
that weren't centrally
located within the communities.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.130
They needed additional training
for library staff and students

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.370
and online databases, and
many of them need additional

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.980
or even adequate space for their
libraries with new furniture.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.720
Some of the things
that the Department

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.080
of the Interior Library
took out of that as far

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.610
as things we would be able
to provide the TCU libraries

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.210
as a result of their
survey included:

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.770
Reciprocal Interlibrary
Loan Services

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.730
where we'd encourage TCU libraries
to borrow circulating materials

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.020
from our collection;
reference services

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.730
where we would encourage
TCU students and faculty

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.460
to contact our library for any
reference assistance and instances

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.920
where they couldn't
necessarily have the resources

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.980
to answer those questions
themselves;

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.430
government document assistance
encouraging TCU libraries

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.680
to contact the DOI library
for assistance in locating

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.130
and obtaining federal government
documents, especially documents

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.150
that were originated from the
Department of the Interior;

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.860
and remote online access
to library classes.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.590
The DOI library promotes and
hosts a lot of training classes

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.730
and other types of programs and we
wanted to encourage them to be able

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.990
to attend our classes via webinar
or some other remote means.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.550
So what we did was
presented all of these ideas

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.480
at a FEDLINK meeting soon
thereafter and we found

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.090
that FEDLINK was also very
much interested in helping

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.900
with this project and
promoting this project

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.550
to other FEDLINK member libraries.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.660
We were very pleased to hear that
and very pleased at the response

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.960
from many FEDLINK libraries as
they also expressed their interest

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.940
in joining with us on this project

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.280
and soon thereafter the American
Indian library Initiative working

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:25.670
group here at Fed link was indeed
formed and continues to this day.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:32.330
So with that, I will turn
things over to Gary McCone ,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.910
Gary is with the American Indian
Higher Education Consortium

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.530
and he will tell you
a little bit more

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.240
about AIHECs involvement
in this project.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.040
Thank you very much.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.510
[ Applause ]

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:53.660
[ Background Sounds ]

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.340
&gt;&gt; Gary McCone: Well this
is going to be really short

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.240
because George just gave my speech

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.210
and so it's more dramatic
with paper.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.320
I don't know where Robert is but
if try doing this with an iPad,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.810
it cost you a lot of
money so don't do that.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.510
I am Gary McCone.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.020
I'm with AIHEC.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.430
Maybe I should mention,
I'm a volunteer.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:22.040
They don't pay me, but it's
so much fun so I do it anyway.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.250
American Indian-- I don't have
to explain what AIHEC is, no,

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.520
because you already know this.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.880
Thank you, George.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.490
All this detail, I can
skip about 20 slides now,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.920
and go right into in case you
don't know, I think George said

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.720
with there were 37 at the time.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.150
I think there's 38 now.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.620
The Pawnee Nation College
has just come on board.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.530
Basically they're out in the West
as you might know, maybe suspect

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.350
or maybe not suspect,
but they are scattered

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.450
around essentially the mountain
states, a couple in the Southwest.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:05.710
The oldest one is Denay College
down in Arizona was formed in 1968.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.960
The newest one I think was last
week, Pawnee Nation College

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.340
and there's a couple of others
out there that are in the process

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.090
of getting together, getting
facilities, getting accreditation

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.640
and then once they get
accreditation, then they can apply

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.330
and be part of AIHEC
if they want to.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.630
And most of them want to.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:33.140
There seems to be a genuine benefit
to them for being in AIHEC so,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:38.250
I think, okay I like this.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.680
It depends on what version

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.850
of PowerPoint you use
whether your pictures are

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.850
in the right places or not.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:50.220
So we do have curriculum suppor
[phonetic] which is a good thing.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:55.900
And Native studies call so those
are two really important issues.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.200
Underfunded.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.070
I just put that in because
everybody's underfunded.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.000
Travel colleges and universities
are really underfunded.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.590
The size of the collection,
I mean I've heard from people

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.780
who are just starting out who
have, well we have a bookcase

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.320
but we don't have any books on it.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.170
So that's one level and
you have other one's

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.740
that have maybe 50,000 item
collection, something like that,

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.790
so I'm not counting microphage and
all these things that librarians

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:32.230
like to count to get their
statistics up but real books.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.590
They do get funding, the
colleges I should say,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.920
get funding from the
federal government based

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.710
on enrollment, FDE enrollment.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.830
And so there's some fudging
of statistics I think

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.650
on everybody's side, when
they start counting this.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.670 position:56%
If they have to pay for something,
then they want their enrollment low.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.010
Like if you have 2,000 users on a
database, that gets you once price.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.430
If you have 5,000,
that's a different price.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.540
But it also effects the
amount of money you receive

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.340
from the federal government.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:12.790
A lot of people think that the
tribal colleges because all

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.170
but 3 of them are on
reservation land,

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:21.140
and everyone knows reservations all
have casino's and so there's lots

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.010
of money, and there's
probably a lot of money

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.460
but you'd be surprised
how little of it,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.330
goes to the education
system on the reservations.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.080
Curriculum suppor [phonetic].

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.050
I think there's a T
hiding back there.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:41.860
Many of the libraries don't have a
materials budget that allows them

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.800 position:56%
to buy them anything other than
strict curriculum-related materials.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.050
They can't branch out
and buy other things.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.580
They can't get supportive
materials, they can't,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.900
they just can't do much other

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.280
than this very specifically
support the curriculum

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.520
which really limits the size of
the collection and the use of it.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.610
Almost all of them
claim to have or try

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.970 position:56%
to have a Native Studies Collection.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.120
Some of them have, I think, really
good Native Studies Collections.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.340
Denay has a really good one.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.240
I think, Little Big Horn has
a really good Native Studies

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.920
Collection, but for
the most part they try.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.210
Most of them also serve
as a public library,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.460
so when you can't buy books
except for curriculum,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.950
that really limits the
public library aspect of it.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:44.780
They serve preschool to elders,
not just people who are enrolled

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.530
in the college so that's an issue.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.970
Digital resources, I think George
mentioned the number of different,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:57.890
I guess on the survey that
they, well he didn't specifics

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:03.130
on who had what but a lot of
them do have digital resources.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.310
And it's sort of interesting
because I've tried

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:10.080
to get different consortium
pricing on different collections

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.210 position:56%
of electronic journals or databases,
and it's interesting because,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.500
of course all of the vendors
are willing to give me a price,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.000
but the problem is a
lot of these colleges,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.150
depending on what state there in,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.250
they already get a good
deal within the state.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.280
Minnesota or Wyoming or somebody
like that, the state pays for it.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.400
They don't have to pay anything
to get into this consortium.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.910
Other one's provide an entryway
into the consortium but they have

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:46.020 position:56%
to pay a really reduced rate, and so
that's great for the ones that have

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.730
that kind of an arrangement,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.200
but it seems that most
states don't do that.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.500
You're on your own.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.750
You are in, either is in the
state consortium or there is one

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.750
but you can't get in unless
you pay a full percentage

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:05.470
or a full ticket, so
that's an issue.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:12.680
And when I get a consortial price
for all 37 or 38, often the ones

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.650
that are getting really good deal,
so it makes no sense for us to get

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.290
into this because we are
already getting it more cheaply

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.590 position:56%
and so almost every one of those has
fallen through just because of that.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.290
When I go back to ProQuest
or whoever and say well,

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.160
okay, how about for this many?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.040
So well then the price
per institution goes

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.340
up as you would expect.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.840 position:56%
I mean, they're in it to make money.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.290
Okay, the great book giveaway.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.240
This is something that's been
going on for a long time now

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.550
and here's pictures from-- this
is something that in conjunction

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.940
with surplus books programs
here at the Library of Congress,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.710
National Museum of American
Indian, and we've gotten books

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.280
from DC chapter of the
Special Libraries Association,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.470 position:56%
from Fannie Mae, from the Department
of Education, and individuals,

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.130
Maryland Chapter of Mensa.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.690
They've all chipped in books
to go out to these colleges.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.070 position:56%
So every year we send out
about-National Agricultural Library,

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:27.630
I should mention since they pay the
shipping bill for all the books.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.600
I send out a list 4
times a year maybe

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.340
and let them pick the
titles they want.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.570
So they don't get one's-it's not
just, here's a bunch of books

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.350
because that doesn't work.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.960
They pick the titles, I send them
out, and they get what they want.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.870
And so that's sort of a fun
thing that they like to do.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:53.060
I think maybe, well you
can see from the pictures,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.180 position:56%
there's really a wide range, I think
of-I guess what I would say is,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.890
look at the pictures, they
just look like libraries.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.700
There not any different from
any other public library mainly.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:11.670
There are certainly some things
that cater to a pre-k crowd

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.290
that you can see, but
they're basically just

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.130
like any other library
that you think about except

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:25.080
for the staffing can run
from one part-time person,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.550
and that's a number of them,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.290
or they can get a student
help maybe sometimes.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.440
I don't know what the-- I'm going
to say that the, if you look at,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.450
some of them have multiple branches

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.980
so if you exclude the
multiple branch libraries,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.070
I say the most staff that any
of them have is probably six.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:53.340
And I may be way off but I
can't be off by more than six.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.150
So that's basically it, and
I thank George for giving

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.410
such a great background
on AIHEC's involvement

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.460 position:56%
in all these things because, frankly
I didn't know any of this stuff.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.290
And so now we'll be able
to look at his slides

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.350
and be able to learn it all.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:13.670
Okay, and now I would like to
introduce my twin for the day,

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.210
Blane Dessey, acting
Executive Director of FEDLINK

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.540
who I have known for
several years now.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.180
[ Applause ]

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.480
&gt;&gt; Blane Dessey: Thank you.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.780
&gt;&gt; Gary McCone: You notice,
we both got the memo?

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.350
&gt;&gt; Blane Dessey: Exactly, exactly.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.050
Twins separated at birth.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.350
&gt;&gt; Gary McCone: Exactly.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.650
There you go.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.030
&gt;&gt;Blane Dessey: Thank you.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.590
Let me just-- okay.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.140
I think I can do this.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.240
Good morning everyone and
welcome to the Library of Congress

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.220
and welcome to this program.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.730
I am Blane Dessey.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:57.480
I'm the acting Executive Director
of FEDLINK for another few days

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.060
when we will be welcoming
a new director to FEDLINK

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.320
and I will ensure that one of her
priorities is to continue work

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.840
on this project, but
let me try and put some

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.960
of these puzzle pieces together,
especially for those of you

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.160
who are not familiar with
the government as such.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.630
So earlier we heard George
talk about the efforts

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.540
of the Department of the Interior.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.950
Great effort.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.510
And we've just heard Gary talk
about the efforts of AIHEC,

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.410
did I pronounce that correctly?

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:31.710
&gt;&gt; AIHEC.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.080
&gt;&gt; Blane Dessey: AIHEC, I'm sorry.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.590
And I'm here to talk a little bit

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:40.310
about FEDLINK and so
what is FEDLINK?

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.350
FEDLINK is the Federal Library
and Information Network.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:50.330
It's an organization of federal
agencies working together

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:54.250
to achieve optimum use of
the resources and facilities

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.500
of federal libraries
and information centers.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.480
I'm not going to read this
slide for you word for word.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.570
But here's what I want to
bring to your attention.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:12.190
I don't think many people
realize the power and the impact

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:18.980
that federal libraries could
have on this particular issue.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.910
When we had tried to do a survey
of all the federal libraries,

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.290
we've determined that
there are probably

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:31.340
at least 1,500 federal
libraries around the world,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.210
if not close to closer to 2,000.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.510
All right.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.530
So if you look at this as some
sort of a government enterprise,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:44.680
this is the largest library
structure in the world,

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.260
in the history of man
for that matter.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.020
I mean that's quite impressive
when you began to think of power

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:58.690
of that many libraries
focusing on a particular issue.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:03.090
It really sort of staggers
the imagination.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:08.480
And so what I keep wanting to
impress upon people is that,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:14.800
taken collectively, federal
libraries can make a huge impact

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.340
in terms of services,
in terms of resources,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.300
and in terms of education
to the American people.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.660
You know, Gary just said that many
of the libraries that he works with

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.690
or like public libraries and
many of the libraries that are

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.750
in the federal government
are like public libraries.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.070
George works in what is
in fact a public library.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.400
The Library of Congress, I
mention this and people always kind

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.760
of shudder when I say this,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.970
the Library of Congress
is a public library just

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.070
like the National Library
of Medicine,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.170
just like National
Agricultural Library

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.640
and if we could really harness
all this library energy,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.600
or all this intellectual energy,
to work with tribal colleges

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:09.930 position:56%
and universities or tribal nations,
I think there could be huge impacts.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.200
So I guess what I'm really saying
is I'm committed to working

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.430
with federal libraries
through FEDLINK,

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.910
and if you're in this room I'm
hoping that you would also sort

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:26.970
of commit to this cause with
us, that the power of all of us

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.720
to work together can be
really quite significant.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.440
So that's my soapbox and now
I'll move on to other things.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.460
So how did FEDLINK, which
is this organization,

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.320
really put tribal colleges and
universities on its radar screen?

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.790
Well it really began back in
2012 when George Franchois,

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:54.270
and let me say George is too modest
to say this but he has been one

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.950
of the driving forces
behind this entire effort.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.200
So George will never tell you that,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.810
but much of this would
not have happened

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.810
without George's direct
involvement, so kudos to George.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:12.300
The Department of the Interior
approached the FEDLINK advisory

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.950
board to talk about
what could be done.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.490
George shared with us
the results of the survey

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.790
and he was particularly
interested in FEDLINK'S ability

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.750
to negotiate consortium
pricing for services,

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:32.790
and we have some legal issues with
that, that we're trying to resolve

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.330
because tribal nations
are not considered part

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.410 position:56%
of the federal government even
though they receive federal funding,

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:43.390
but anyway, but there are other
things that we can be thinking

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:48.210
about too as in education and
collaboration and resource sharing.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.560
And when George brought this
notion to my advisory board,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.390 position:56%
which is comprised of other
federal agencies, everyone was very,

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:59.070
very supportive of the idea.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:04.990
And they felt that, yes, we as a
federal library community do want

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.860
to have a responsibility in
improving the lives of students

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.240
and faculty at those
tribal institutions,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.120
that we can really make
a contribution especially

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.880
since so many of us have
public mission to begin with,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.650
that we have no reason not to make
an effort to extend our services

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.410
and resources to those
tribal members.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:41.340
And so that began in 2012 and then
we also began to work with one

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:46.340
of our favorite external
organizations,

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.850
the Institute for Museum
and Library Services.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:56.090
Now, which is known
as IMLS, IMLS is,

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.690
and Mary Alice might tell you
this, is a federal organization

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:09.250 position:56%
which awards grants to public
schools and other types of libraries

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.660
around the United States,
not federal libraries.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.600
We have a very clear
delineation between the two.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.900
But my contention is that because

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.360
so many federal libraries
have a public library

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.060
or a school library purpose,
there areas of common interest

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.880
between what we're attempting
to do in the federal government

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.690
and what IMLS is trying to
do for the United States.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:43.030
And so we decided to put
together a program in 2014,

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.320 position:56%
American Indian Libraries Making
Connections to highlight the stories

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.410
of five recent IMLS
library grant recipients.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:58.920
This program was a huge success
by all accounts and it was really

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.720
because of the efforts Terry
Devoe who is sitting here

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.480
and also her colleague, Mary Alice
Ball, who's sitting next to her.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.850
But this was really our first
foray into a kind of programing

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:15.530
that shows we can work across
boundaries to illustrate the issue

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.750
and to talk about solutions
to those issues,

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.780
so we were very proud of that.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.920 position:56%
And when we saw the kind of response
that we got, this just fueled us

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.210 position:56%
to continue to discuss what we might
do in the federal library community.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:36.470
So at this point we decided,
well we've done enough talking,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:41.010
we've done enough thinking, we've
experimented with some programs,

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:45.140
let's do something
a little more formal

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.740
as a federal library community.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.030
And think of this as a community,
not just the Library of Congress.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.360
This is a community.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.270
We decided to create what we
normally do, a working group,

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.410
which is how we work within
our community, called AILI,

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.530
which is the American
Indian Library Initiative,

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:12.730
as a way to focus our efforts to
really work with tribal colleges

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.700
and universities and tribal
nations because we also realized

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.770 position:56%
that there is information needs
outside of colleges and universities

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:25.610
but to really work with a
group of federal libraries

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:33.260
to bring improvements-- I hope
that doesn't sound too judgmental--

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.450
to sort of work with
Native communities

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.860
to improve their library
resources and initiatives.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.640
So we have created this standing
working group that meets regularly

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.470
and several people here
are involved in that.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:54.820
And the goals were really quite
straight forward but ambitious

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.650
and that is to build an
information culture from local

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.170
to local and local to national.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:07.590
I think part of our job in FEDLINK
is to always be raising awareness

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.140
and to be advocating for issues.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.480
We need to become better
advocates for the idea that we

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.570
in the federal government
can provide direct support

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.400
to these constituencies.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.120
We need to make that a priority and
we need to keep talking about it.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.960
So that's one thing
that we need to do.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.790
We wanted to create a
clearing house of resources.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.100
What does George have in his
institution that could be

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.120
of benefit to this community?

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.020
What does the Library
of Congress have?

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.060
I used to be at the
Department of Justice.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.460
What do they have that could be
of benefit to these communities?

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.920
And again, when you think that
we have over 1,000 libraries

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.380
that cover every disciplinary
area you can imagine,

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:02.890
that list of resources can be
phenomenal if we could really get

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:07.450
that capture and then make it
available to these communities.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.860 position:56%
We also wanted to work with
American Indian communities in areas

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:15.390
like preservation,
digitization, cataloging.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:20.210
I recently went to the ATALM
conference and there's a great deal

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.860
of interest among the
Native communities

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.930 position:56%
about preserving their own cultures.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.210
I mean, that just makes sense,
preserving their own language,

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.040
their own artifacts,
their own culture,

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:38.610
and so for them preservation,
digitization where possible

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:44.570
or necessary, cataloging comes
extremely important to them

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.540
as they really strive to ensure

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.880
that their culture remains
alive for generations to come.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.460 position:56%
And so that's another area where we
could really help these communities.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.490
Training opportunities.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:00.860
Well, look around you.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.820
We've got a room full of cameras.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.410
We could use the same technology
to work with those communities.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.540
You know, we're already
out broadcasting,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.630
we could certainly tailor
some training efforts.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.300
In fact, like let's work on that.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.600
I like this idea.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.370
It just dawned on me.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:23.290
We should do a series of
webinars targeted primarily

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.790
to the tribal colleges
and universities.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.870
Maybe we could do that together?

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.700
That's UIMLS [laughing].

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.550
In case you're wondering
who I'm pointing at,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.010 position:56%
it's the IMLS people, and Gary, you-

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.310
[ Inaudible Audience Comment ]

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:42.140
Sure. No, no sometimes I just have
an idea and I have to just say it

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.930
to see how it sounds, but
I think we could do that.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.740
We do lots of training anyway,
why couldn't we expand that

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.840
and really think about
how to move this training

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.000
out to the Native communities?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.300
And also promote existing
federal resources and legal

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:05.820
and STEM knowledge collection of
value to America Indian libraries.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.740
STEM is the rage, and of
course, we know the libraries,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.190
as Gary has told us, are
under-funded, under-staffed.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.950
There are weakened resources.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:21.310
So what if we could bring the
power of these 1500 libraries

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.750 position:56%
to those libraries in terms of STEM?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.070
How remarkable would that be?

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.190
And later, you'll be hearing
about the legal resources

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.010
because we have Yolanda Goldberg
here from the Law Library

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.230
who is doing tremendous
work with her colleagues

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.860
to create a law portal
for Native American Law,

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.760 position:56%
so we'll be paying a little bit more
attention to that this afternoon.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.790
And that's really what I
have to say, so let me,

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:54.900
again let me just reiterate, not
to put too fine a point on it,

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:01.730
federal libraries represent
the largest collection

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:06.470
of intellectual resources
the world has ever seen.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.980
When we gathered up bibliographic
records from other libraries

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.940
in the federal government,

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.200
we gathered 30 million
bibliographic records.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.230
There is no library
system in the world

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:24.780
that has 30 million
bibliographic records.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:30.830
How do we take that and how do we
take all the people that support

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:34.430
that and begin to really
make it available to some

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.520
of the people who need it the most?

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.330
And that's the challenge that
FEDLINK has in front of it.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.580
So, thank you very much, and
I will now turn the floor

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.670
over to Mary Alice Ball, our
wonderful colleague from Institute

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.610
for Museum and Library Services.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.510
Mary Alice, welcome.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:56.350
[ Applause ]

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Alice Ball:
Good morning everyone.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.460
I'm really delighted to be
here today to talk to you

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.240
about the Institute of
Museum and Libraries Services

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:09.080 position:56%
and what we are doing to support
tribal libraries, whatever the level

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.660 position:56%
of clienteles that they are serving.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.260 position:56%
I'll start just by saying we are one

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.180
of the three cultural
heritage agencies

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.200
within the federal government.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.390
The National Endowment for
the Arts, National Endowment

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.830
for the Humanities are
better known than IMLS,

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:32.860
and I would like to say we are
the little engine that could.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.110
We really try to make
a difference and I feel

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:39.420
like we are making a
difference on tribal lands.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.200
But before I go there, I wanted to
mention that related to the work

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.460
that we are doing, and this both
on the library side in the Office

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.580
of Library Services and on
the museum side in the Office

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:57.950 position:56%
of Museum Services and in our Policy
Research and Evaluation Department

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:03.080
where we are putting survey
research out all the time.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:07.870
We have, within OLS
Library Services,

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.400
we have 2 strategic
priorities, and when Blaine,

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.490 position:56%
Gary and George were talking, I
thought how I think these are things

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:18.820
that people might want
to know about.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:24.640
We have 2 priorities, 1 being
the National Digital Platform

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.990
and the other being Learning in
Libraries, which includes a STEM,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:34.330
but particularly National Digital
Platform, what we are doing

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:39.420
from our grant making
is funding initiatives

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.470
that will provide the
broadest range of resources,

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:52.160
whatever format those are in,
and do it in a way that is free

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.510
or really open, open access.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.910
And so we've funded projects
with the Digital Public Library

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.610
of America, with Internet Archive,
with Hotte [phonetic] Trust,

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.530
with many academic institutions,

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.020
and I'll talk about them
a little bit at the end.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.850
But I thought those are things I
encourage you to go to our website,

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.520
to imls.gov, and look at
our grant opportunities.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:22.380 position:56%
You can search awarded grants and
sometimes that's a good way to start

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:29.080
if you're not sure of what type of
idea you should come to us with.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.210
It can help to read through
what we have funded already.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.890
I have my email address on here,
so if you do have questions,

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:43.270
I'm thinking about folks that are
out there in cyberspace today,

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.340
please feel free to drop me a line.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.670
So I thought I would
start by talking

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:54.080
about our Native American
Library Services basic grants.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.010
These are non competitive
grants and they're designed

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:04.210
to support existing library
operations and really

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:09.480
to support those core library
services and collections

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:16.950
and there is a broad, we interpret
those core services very broadly,

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:22.970
and so it might be for building
a collection of resources

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:29.070
for young children, you know
pre-k literacy types of things,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:33.850
or it could be elder
resources, working with elders,

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:41.510 position:56%
and we funded things with programs
where teens are working with elders,

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:45.120
so there is a wide range,
but it can also go to things

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.410
like a dehumidifier,
book shelves, tables,

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:56.430
we interpret this very
broadly, it is a small grant,

00:49:56.430 --> 00:50:02.910
so this one year grant is $6,000.00
and you can get an extra $1,000.00

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:08.240
for an educational option, and
that is education or assessment.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.680
So someone can use it to go to
a conference, they can use it

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.200
to hire a consultant
to work with them.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.750
There is no cost share required
for this and it is available

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.950
to any federally recognized tribe,

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:28.330
or Native/Alaskan village
or corporation.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.080
We fund roughly, I think, somewhere

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:38.010
around 220-240 federally
recognized tribes right now

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.190
out of possible 567.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:46.250
We are waiting, I'm looking forward
to talking to the representative

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.110
from the Pulmonkee
Tribe later today,

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.680
because we can start
funding them too.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.530
We also have a Native American
Library Services Enhancement Grant,

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:04.900
and so this is really to push
out, be more initiative in terms

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:09.450
of the services, the programming
that these libraries are doing.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:13.610
It can be about workforce
development, anything people come

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.840
to us with, language revitalization
, digital literacy skills,

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.530
cultural heritage preservation.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:28.230
Again, for tribes that are so
challenged by circumstances

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:32.740
of society around them, this
funding can be really critical.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.270
To help them, we've got a lot of
people right now that are working

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:43.560
on preserving their language, and
they come to us, and you know,

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.750
they've got 5 speakers of the
language, and they're worried

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.690
because they know that they
could disappear quickly,

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.660
so we see the urgency of
this funding for tribes.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:01.980
Again, it's relatively
small compared some

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.560 position:56%
of our other grant programs, because
there's a ceiling of $150,000.00

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.470
and that's up to 2 years,
although it could just be a year.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.570
Again, cost share is not required.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:21.770
&gt;&gt; I request to read the bottom of
that previous slide [inaudible].

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:23.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Alice Ball: It is cut off.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:26.180
Again, this, it talks
about eligibility,

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.520
and if you go to our website, you
can find the full details there

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.980
of eligibility, but any federally
recognized tribe or Alaska village

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.660 position:56%
or corporation is eligible to apply.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.960
Thank you.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:54.010
We have our 2015 fiscal year
budget was just over $3,000,800.00.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:59.190
We have requested $4,000,000.00
in our 2016 budget,

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:01.110
so we'll see how that works out.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:06.470
But if we look at how it's divided
down, there is just one bucket

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:12.650 position:56%
of money, and due to the forethought
of Senator Daniel Inouye,

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:18.600
there is a percentage, and it
comes out to right now roughly just

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:23.890
over $550,000.00 for
Native Hawaiians grants,

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:26.360
and that usually comes
out to be maybe somewhere

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.050
of the range to 3-5 grantees.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:37.100
Our Native American basic
grants, it's noncompetitive

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.950
as I said earlier, everybody
gets a piece, it just depends

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.640
on how many tribes apply.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.800
This last year, it came out
to roughly $1,400,000.00

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:53.620
for 220 grantees, and
then the leftover,

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.980
the remainder of that
funding is what we use

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:01.830
to fund the Native American
Enhancement Awards, and last year,

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.440 position:56%
that turned out to be $1,800,000.00.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.750
It generally, we fund
somewhere in the range of 10

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:15.130
to 15 grants with that funding.

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:21.780 position:56%
We also and I think it's something
that I'm proudest of for the agency,

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:27.250
that we move beyond the
funding that's designated

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:34.020
for tribal libraries,
to fund other sources

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.100
from our National Leadership
Grant program

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.170
and from the Laura Bush 21st
Century Librarian program.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:44.770
The second has to deal with
education and recruitment

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.980
into the profession,
national leadership grant,

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.910
programs of national
scope more innovative.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:58.430 position:56%
So we fund the Association of Tribal
Archives Libraries and Museums.

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:02.610 position:56%
I think many of you went to the
ATALM conference this last September

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:08.090
and we fund the workshops
that we see as really critical

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:11.670
for the continuing education
and professional development

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.390
of tribal librarians, who
as we've heard, ya know,

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.010
it may be a one person shop.

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:22.980
We do allow them to use their
funds to hire substitutes,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.850
so that the library
doesn't have to close

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.380
when they go off to a conference.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:31.330
We fund scholarships.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:34.810
Susan Feller, the CEO of ATALM
is very convincing, so each year,

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.930
she comes back and says, well,
we need a little bit more,

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:41.720
can you give us a supplement
because we need more scholarships?

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:46.370
And this year, I think we
gave an extra $75,000.00.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:51.310
In the world of grant making,
$75,000.00 is chump change,

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:57.700
but for that tribal librarian
who wants to come from, you know,

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.500
upper Montana or something,
it's huge.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:09.330
We also funded and will fund
a neck of subsequent survey,

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:13.460
but a study that ATALM
did of digital inclusion

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:19.390
in Native communities and this
is a report, you can find it

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:25.160
on the ATALM website,
it was huge I would say

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:29.390
in informing the Federal
Communications Commission

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.810
and the Department of Commerce's
National Telecommunications

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:37.850
Information Administration, about
the situation on tribal lands

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:46.350
in terms of broadband access,
adoption, digital literacy skills,

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:50.720
all these issues around
digital inclusion.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.950
We have also funded
a project that came

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:57.240
out of Washington State University
called Mukatu [assumed spelling]

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:03.160
which is an indigenous New Zealand
or Australian indigenous word.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.810
We funded them to the
tune of $1,400.00 dollars,

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:11.690
and we funded the development
of this open source platform,

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:19.230
that there are a lot of, or
certainly we don't see a paucity

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.690
of cultural heritage tools that
are out there, but this is a tool

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:27.780
that was made for ingenious
communities and so it understands

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:33.620
that not everything needs to
be made publically accessible,

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:42.890
that Native nations have the
need and the right to say we want

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:46.770
to restrict these materials,
only a man should see them,

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:50.830
only a woman should see them,
only and elder should see them,

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:56.450
only a tribal member, regardless
where that tribal member may be

00:57:56.450 --> 00:58:00.670
because we know so many tribal
members have to go to other places

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:05.160
to get jobs, but if they are
in LA, they should be able

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:10.200
to access a collection that
is back home in Oklahoma,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.030
and we funded quite a bit
of training around this,

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:18.750
we're continuing, there's a
second cohort of 6 tribes,

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:22.630
2 people from each tribe
that is just being formed,

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:27.810
and these people will
learn how to use the tools,

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:36.890
and some are already coming to us
to get funding for the technology.

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:41.140
And I should also say they're
developing a kit that will be used

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.650
and to help train and
support people in this.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:49.590
This last year, we gave a
grant to Amherst College

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:53.420
and it was a collaborative
planning grant.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:59.000
They have quite a few
partners, but we do know,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.430
and I think they are
coming to terms with maybe

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:05.060
because they do have Native
American faculty members

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:11.650
who are pushing Amherst to think
beyond just having these holdings

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.050
and keeping them within
their own doors.

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:17.860
They want to create a digital atlas

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.150
of Native American
Intellectual Traditions

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.970
and build a national platform

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:29.950
so that all people could see
these important valuable resources

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:34.210
that are held, and they will be
able to see them wherever they are.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:41.570
Okay, I'm moving back up because
I wrote notes, on the bottom,

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:48.110
because I forgot to put on this
slide that IMLS also has done a lot

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:53.910
of work, at the behest of the
administration in different areas,

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:56.720
and I think none that I
feel is compelled to talk

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.210
about as our participation

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:03.270
in the President's
Broadband Opportunity Council.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:10.710
We have highlighted
actions that we will take.

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:16.970 position:56%
We also see that what other agencies
are doing and we've tried to,

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:25.280
how shall I say, like insert
ourselves into their initiatives

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.620
so that we can disseminate
what they are doing

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.920
to libraries around the country.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.860
One of those, some of
my colleagues here know,

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:40.430
my proudest accomplishment as being
one of the IMLS representatives

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:46.020
on that council was the insertion
of a comma in the word libraries

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.000
into a program that General
Services Administration is doing

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:59.960 position:56%
with they've refurbished computers,
they have a program called Computers

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.090
For Learning and so when they had
written up the eligible entities,

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:07.890
it was educational institutions

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:14.480
or other educational-related
organizations and think of those

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.170 position:56%
of us in the Federal Government know

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:20.460
that if it isn't clearly
spelled out, then it's in doubt,

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:24.380
and so now we have
inserted in their libraries

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.750
that libraries will be able and
eligible to get this equipment.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.820
The Broadband Opportunity
Council came

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.580
out with a report a
couple of months ago.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.480
You can find it by Googling White
House Broadband Opportunity Council

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.150
Report and I would
encourage you to read it.

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.740
It has a number of things.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.830
I'm concerned about
time so I won't go on.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.530
Oh, I have time, okay,
then I will go on.

01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:55.900
IMLS has funded 2 things that we're
doing that are already underway,

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:01.090 position:56%
one is a grant to Internet2 and some

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:07.430
of you may know Internet2
is a network, an association

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:11.160
of these largest research
and education networks,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:17.480
and we have funded Internet2 to
pilot a program where research

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.670
and education networks will
work with Tribal and rural,

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:26.840
so rural libraries that are not
necessarily tribal libraries,

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.490
and I think it's going to be in 5
states, working with the Research

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:35.210
and Education Network in
those states and to go out

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:39.270
and develop a network
assessment tool.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:46.290
I mean on tribal lands,
broadband itself is, you know,

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.810
in an abysmal state and we
are trying to improve that,

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:55.020
but we do know that even in
institutions that have broadband,

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.560
quite often their networks aren't
configured properly enough for them

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.120
to get what they're paying for.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.490
And so the development of
this sort of tool we hope will

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:08.920
to enable people to get people
higher speed broadband access

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:14.490
and then be able to access
richer resources online.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:19.110
We are also funding a
grant to the Chief Officers

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:23.720
of State Library Associations
and I should say that both

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.450
of these grants are done
in partnership with ATALM

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.560
and with the American
Library Association,

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.890
as I look at 2 representatives
from it here.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:39.940
But the COSLA proposal and
it is underway, yesterday,

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:45.570
Marijke Visser had a blog post
about the E-rate Clearinghouse

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:49.690
that has been done by COSLA and
the Georgia Public Library Service

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:52.910
and E-rate is something
we are trying

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:55.640 position:56%
to get more tribal libraries to use.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.470
Some our eligible and yet
they may not think they are,

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:05.050
so it's definitely
worth investigating.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:11.040
There is also a training
component and a cross state survey

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.080
that is being done, related to
E-rate and E-rate training needs.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.460
So those were our contributions
to the report

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.340
where we weren't piggybacking
on other agencies like GSA.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.890
Last week, the President held
a tribal leadership summit,

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:30.990
and then on Friday morning,
at the very end of that,

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:35.440
the Broadband Opportunity
Council had a listening session

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.940
where we listened to tribal Leaders
talk about the state broadband

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:44.500
out of Native Nations and what
could be done, what should be done,

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:50.230 position:56%
and challenging us as the Federal
Administration to make a difference.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.280
And I think that's
all I have to say.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.300
Any questions, Gary?

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [inaudible].

01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:00.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Alice Ball: Oh, yes, sorry,
because we do, we fund a lot,

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.110
so we also fund and it's Mary
Ann Hanson if you're listening,

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:09.940 position:56%
I'll give a shout out to you, the
Tribal College Leadership Institute.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.730
That we funded for many,
many years out in Bozeman

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:16.700
and brings tribal librarians
together,

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.020
tribal college librarians
together for leadership training.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.080
Any other things that I forgotten?

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.710
Anybody can think of?

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.010
Another question?

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.890
&gt;&gt; Next session.

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:32.360
&gt;&gt; Mary Alice Ball: Okay,
we're moving right along.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.660
&gt;&gt; George Franchois: I think we're
going to go ahead and get started

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.590
with this afternoon's programming.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:38.900
My name is George Franchois.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.750
I'm the director of the Department
of the Interior Library, and once,

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:47.050
again I want to welcome everyone
here to the Library of Congress

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.520
for our program this afternoon.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.980
Our first program is American
Indians in the federal city

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.380
and regional history
and we are very pleased

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:04.030
to have Joseph Genetin-Pilawe
here with us this afternoon

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:09.720
to talk a little bit about
the about how Washington D.C.,

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.600
about American Indians
in Washington D.C.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.680
and how American Indians
contributed to the development

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.930
of this great nation's capital.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.510
So with that, Joseph.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:32.190
[ Applause ]

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.880
&gt;&gt; Joseph Genetin-Pilawe: Hi
everyone, thanks for being here.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.660
Before I say anything else,
it's important to acknowledge

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.350
that as we think and talk together,
we do so not only in the Library

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:46.240
of Congress but on the homelands
of the Piscataway Nation

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.310
and a broader region that includes
the homelands of the Pamunkey

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:52.520
and Monacan Nations as well.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.620
It's an absolute pleasure
to be here.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:59.720
I'm excited to be on a panel
with Gabby, Tara, Ben, and Karen.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.430
I'm excited to hear them talk
about their work in activism.

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.720
I'm up first today because I
had the honor of being selected

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.290
as a John W. Kluge Center fellow
last year to conduct research

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:15.300
on my current book project which is
a study of the indigenous histories

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.960
of Washington DC that I'm
calling the Indian's captial city.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.730
The Kluge Center supports humanity
scholars from around the world

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:25.450
and brings them together to
stimulate and energize one another,

01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:28.250
to distill wisdom from the
Library of Congress' rich resources

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.850
and to interact with policy
makers and the public.

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:34.090
My time at the center was amazing.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:37.460
I think it's important to point
out as well that over the course

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.180
of its 15-year history, the
Kluge Center has supported dozens

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.500
of scholars working in the fields

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.720
of Native American and
indigenous studies.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.850
The center has been doing important
work in this direction and it,

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:48.790
as well as the librarians,
archivists,

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.220
and collection specialists here,
have been supporting the field

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.080
in really important ways.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.840
So with the time that I have, I
would like to give a brief overview

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.520
of the project that I worked on
as a Kluge fellow and I would

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.180
like to start with a brief
antidote but one more caveat.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.890
My work focuses primarily on native
diplomats who visited the city

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:09.600
from outside this region.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.960
Our next speaker, Gabby Tayac, will
talk more about the long, deep,

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.470
and rich indigenous histories
of the Potomac and Chesapeake.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:18.770
So here we go.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:23.440
On Saturday, September 29th,
1837, a group of Lakota, Iowa Sac

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:26.220
and Fox men and women sat
in the National Theater

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.370
in Washington watching a romantic
opera called The Mountain Sylph.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:31.670
They found themselves, as many

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:33.120
as the other audience
members likely did,

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.710 position:56%
mesmerized watching the prima donna,

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:39.430
a soprano named Annette Nelson
portray the opera's lead character.

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:42.940
So impressed by her agility and
beauty "appearing and vanishing

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.650
with the rapidity that reminded
them of the fleetness of the deer

01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:48.290
in their native hunting
grounds" wrote one newspaper.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.350
The men saluted her right in
the middle of the performance.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.270
In a show of respect,
[inaudible] man through

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:56.250 position:56%
and Eagle-feathered cap at her feet.

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.510
Pokana [assumed spelling],
a Sac Chief offered his cap

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:00.550
as well while Tokaka
[assumed spelling],

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:03.490
another Yankton gave her
his white wolf-skinned robe.

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:06.560
This was completely unplanned
but the actress displaying poise

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.670
and grace thanked the man saying
she would "ever regard them

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.290
as friends and brethren".

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:13.280
Then, she gave each
man an ostrich plume

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.840
from her costume as a return gift.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.910
To a modern audience, this
appears to be quite unexpected,

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:23.570
not just a breach of proper
etiquette but actual presence

01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:27.520 position:56%
of native folks in an 1830's
Washington Theater enjoying an opera

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.900
seems almost unbelievable.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.890
But how unexpected was it though?

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:34.860
Despite what some might think,
across the 19th Century and beyond,

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.650
hundreds and thousands of
native people travel to

01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:39.230
and lived in the capital.

01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:42.910
In reality, seems like this
one happened regularly.

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.410
Well every Indian nation has
its own unique and rich history,

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:48.610
one thing that unites all of these
experiences is a relationship

01:09:48.610 --> 01:09:49.910
to the Federal Government

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:54.750
and Washington D.C. These episodes
appear unexpected to us today

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.750
because of a perceived incongruity
of native people in urban spaces.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:02.070
In other words, the idea that
Indians and cities cannot coexist

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:05.690
and that one must necessarily
be eclipsed by the other.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:09.460
This unexpectedness is especially
rooted in Washington D.C. due

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.490
to the creation of a commemorative
landscape here centered

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:16.060
in the architecture of
federal buildings but dispersed

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:19.570 position:56%
around the city as well and here are
a few images of the art and artwork.

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:21.210
This picture isn't very clear

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:24.070
but you can see there are 2
statue groups that used to stand

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:26.710
on the east front of
the Capital Building.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:32.880
Every president from
the early 19th Century

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.510
until the 1950's was inaugurated
between these 2 statue groups.

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.300
This is actually Lincoln's
second inauguration.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.360
There's a close up of one
of them, the Discovery.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.680 position:56%
Here is the other called the Rescue.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.100
These statues were ultimately
removed in the 1950's

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.570
in large part due to a
campaign lead by a native woman.

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.400 position:56%
She was Omahan named Ledameyer Smart
[assumed spelling] who wrote dozens

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.570
and dozens of letters,
garnered support

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:03.170
of groups across the country.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:06.570
They are ultimately lifted off
the cheap blocks and are now

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:08.630
in a warehouse at Fort Meade.

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:15.580
I'll leave it back on
there for a second, sorry.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:19.800
So the art and architecture

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.910
of the federal building iterated
spatially notions of pacification

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.500
of a conquest completed
and of vanishing Indians.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.900
My project argues that unlike
the subjects of this art

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.650
and architecture though, indigenous
visitors and inhabitants engaged

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:36.350
with non-native individuals and
the symbols of settler society

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:39.980
in Washington carved out their
own spaces within it and claimed

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.250 position:56%
or reclaimed ownership of the place.

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:45.100
In doing so, indigenous people
shaped how the capital came

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.320
to understand itself
ultimately as an imperial center;

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.420
they were it's looking glass.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.840
Washington after all and especially

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.590
in the early 19th century was
a provincial local place first

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.890
and foremost.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.580
It had to learn, it
became a national city,

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.130
and then an imperial capital,
and later a global metropolis.

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:05.520
I'd like to finish my remarks
today with one more anecdote

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.450
that illustrates the layered
histories of indigenous experiences

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.060
as well as representations of
indigenous peoples in the capital,

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.570
and this one requires a
little local knowledge.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:16.480
I'll be talking about the Dumbarton
Bridge or as it's known commonly

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.800
in the city, the Buffalo Bridge.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.780
So in 2010, a fellow historian
and I were in the city.

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.510
One day, I went to the
archives and he went for a run.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.890
When I returned to our
room later that day,

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:30.240
he asked if I knew
anything about a bridge

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.560
that had 4 gigantic buffalos on it.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.300
Well, I'd only just begun
the research for this project

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.540
and I knew nothing
about this bridge.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.870
I went back to the archives
the next day and he took a walk

01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:42.230
around the city with his camera.

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:44.320
When I returned the second
evening, he showed me pictures

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.310
of the 4 buffallos as well

01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:50.850
as 56 Indian head busts
that adorn the bridge.

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:55.090 position:56%
Native people are everywhere in this
city he said, I had to learn more.

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:56.810
Here is an aerial shot
of the bridge.

01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:01.190
Those Indian head busts that I'm
talking about are at the bottom

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:04.750
of each one of the smaller
arches, on the upper level there,

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:08.160
and it's the same person's
head over and over again.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.850
I'll get to that in a second.

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:15.870
Georgetown was formed in 1751, I'll
go back to this map for a second,

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.610
decades before the District of
Columbia or the city of Washington,

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:22.260
and here you can see it on
the left-hand side of the map.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:27.200
But in 1871, it was merged with
Washington, residential sprawl

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.610
over the next few decades
and encouraged city leaders

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:30.950
to provide a connecting artery

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:35.080
between North Georgetown
and Dupont Circle.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.380
There was one problem.

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.290
It's pretty obvious in this
map and that is the rock creek

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.670
and the surrounding heights
that separated the 2 spaces.

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:43.760
The initial plan involved filling
the gorge with like boulders

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.490
and junk and things like that.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:48.800
This was a horrible idea,
but the McMillan Commission

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.150
which was a senate committee
whose report continues

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:56.180 position:56%
to guide capital development to this
day, selected Q Street as a location

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.640
for a new bridge instead
of filling in the gorge,

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.500
despite the fact though,
interestingly,

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.820
that Q Street in Georgetown
is 185 feet South of Q Street

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.180
in Dupont Circle, so the
bridge would need to be curved

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.090
and also it came to a dead end
at the historic Dumbarton Mansion

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.950
which would need to be lifted
up and moved about 100 feet.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:17.560
So there you can see the curved
bridge and the Dumbarton Mansion.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.190
Glen Brown, who was a proponent
of the McMillan Commission

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:24.810
and the City Beautiful Architecture
Movement, designed the bridge

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.450
and the structures features several
City Beautiful design elements.

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:31.750
For example, you see
neoclassical arches, corbel arches,

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.830
piers and pillars that
reminiscent of Roman Acquadox.

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.470
More obviously, its scale
and style were typical

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:39.240
of the City Beautiful aesthetic.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.340
After all, they couldn't
simply built a functional

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.600
and utilitarian bridge.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.410
The use of the Buffalo and
Indian head iconography,

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:49.340 position:56%
the most distinctive elements of
the bridge, also connect it's design

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.040
to the City Beautiful movement.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.340
The movement got its start in 1893
at Chicago's Columbian Exposition.

01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:59.680
Unlike the World's Fair itself, the
bridge reflects a certain nostalgia

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.670
for a vanishing frontier.

01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:04.960
In fact, in an interview,
Glen Brown noted, we quote,

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.630
"naturally determine to give the
carvings of the other portions

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:10.210
of the structure an
American character".

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:13.630
In this formulation, it makes sense
that the designers chose what seems

01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:17.060
to be a generic Plains motif and
I'm sorry that I don't have closer,

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.680
up close pictures of the Reliefs
and Buffaloes, but buffaloes

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.800
and an Indian head with prominent
cheekbones and a war bonnet,

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.880
these images are mobile and
serve as free-floating stand ins

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.730
for a constellation of ideas
that simultaneously express

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:36.000
and excuse settler
anxieties and guilt.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.670
The problem of course is that
these images aren't free floating

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.160 position:56%
and that histories aren't metaphors.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.790 position:56%
There's another way to think of this
bridge and it's iconography though

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:49.550
and the busts that sit below each
pillar, these were actually modeled

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:53.550
from the life mask of a man named
Matho Wanahtake or Kicking Bear.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:56.210
He was a Minneconjou Lakota leader
who played a significant role

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:58.600
in bringing the Ghost Dance
movement to the Plains.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.560 position:56%
In the 1890's, Kicking Bear traveled
to Washington to advocate on behalf

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.340
of the Lakota at the
Office of Indian Affairs.

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.750
This was just following
Wounded Knee.

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:10.780
Simultaneous to Kicking
Bear's visit, archaeologist,

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.220 position:56%
William Henry Holmes, who worked for
the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.760
and then served as head
curator of Anthropology

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.240
at the US National Museum,
conducted significant excavations

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.640
around Washington.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.960
One of the sites his team
investigated thoroughly was the

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.020
Dumbarton Heights,
an area just below

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.710
where the bridge would
ultimately be built.

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:34.970
There, Holmes and his team found
an important stone quarry site

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:36.270
where Piscataway people

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:40.910
for generations excavated
materials and made stone tools.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:44.440
So here it is, all
wrapped up in one site.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.500 position:56%
A bridge built in the nineteen-teens
using cutting-edge architectural

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.630
technology and trendy design
elements that are meant

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.370
to memorialize and
celebrate a generic

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.020 position:56%
and supposedly bygone American past.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.500
But the bust the designer used
actually commemorates a native

01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:01.540 position:56%
leader who challenged US colonialism
spiritually and militarily

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.220
on the Plains as well as
politically and diplomatically

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.810
in the city itself, and
they built it atop land

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:08.810
that has been significant to
indigenous and inhabitants

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:15.070 position:56%
since time and memorial, ancient,
modern, vanishing, and ever present.

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:16.870
Thank you.

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:22.060
[ Applause ]

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.310
Now I'd like to invite Gabby
Tayac from the National Museum

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:28.510
of the American Indian
up to speak next.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:37.110
[ Silence ]

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.160
&gt;&gt; Gabrielle Tayac: Hi.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.480
I'd really like to greet all
of you and a special greeting

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.010
to my relatives who are here
from the other areas of the bay

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.960
and a little bit further
on the mountains.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.300
Our people are also Algonkian
people so greeting to Tara as well,

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:59.800
and to all of you who are in this
place that we know as the capital.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.460 position:56%
Like to take you to another capital.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:11.340
I'd like you to imagine going
down the Potomac River a bit today

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.900 position:56%
to the first capital of these lands.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:22.380
There's a unmarked field and
there lies our holiest place.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.890
It's a placed called Moyaone.

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:26.480
It's a sacred place.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.150
It's right on the Potomac and
it sits facing Mount Vernon.

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:36.050
It just looks like a field
and now it's a National Park.

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:41.110
There are no signs on it.

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:46.080
It's on the National Historic
Register, but there are people

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.980
who are just walking their dogs
there every day, playing Frisbee,

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:54.570
going by, and then
wondering what they're seeing

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:58.240
when they see a sweat
lodge that's there.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.960
They see a red cedar
tree that's there.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.180 position:56%
They see a photograph of a man named
Turkey Tayac who is my grandfather

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:13.140 position:56%
who is there, and they see
offerings, and they see reflections,

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:19.590
and they see memories, and traces
of a place that are recorded back

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:25.110
in time for at least 10,000
years or maybe from the time

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:30.870 position:56%
that Sky Woman came and landed on a
turtle's back or maybe from the time

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.970
that the people sprung
out from the hairs

01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:36.630
of the deer and populated the land.

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:41.440 position:56%
So this is very indicative in this
place Moyaone, which is in Accokeek,

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:50.280
Maryland, of how you are fully and
completely surrounded and enveloped

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.360
by a very long-term
indigenous history

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.930
that is almost entirely
erased from our consciousness.

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:06.950
When you go to the Anacostia,
the Anacostians where part

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:10.170
of our chiefdom, part of
the Piscataway chiefdom,

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:14.500
their name was the Nacotchtank
and it's anglicized and Latinized

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:19.740
to sound like Anacostia, but all
we know is there's the river,

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.670
there's the Potomac or Patawomeck
which is also a group of people.

01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:26.940
There are places like
Madwomen [assumed spelling]

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.320
and Zakia [assumed
spelling] all sorts

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.750
of words that we see on the land.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:36.810
And this landscaping itself is
formed by the Chesapeake Bay

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:42.190
and the Chesapeake meaning great
shellfish bay, which is the mother

01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:49.120
of waters, which has lungs that are
formed by vast amounts historically

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.340
of oysters, and oyster shells,
which filter the water pristinely,

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.730
that have been entirely taken out.

01:20:55.730 --> 01:21:03.140
So in this interconnected beautiful
system that was first mapped

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:10.580
for Europeans by John Smith
in 1608, and he didn't look

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:17.070
like Disney movie guy, okay,
and he didn't marry Pocahontas

01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:23.610 position:56%
and Pocahontas was a lot cooler than
you would ever, ever imagine her

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:26.470
to be actually and I've had
a love-hate relationship

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:29.230
with Pocahontas for my entire life

01:21:29.230 --> 01:21:33.000
and I've come to respect
her greatly.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.090
So our people were organized
here with Point of Rocks,

01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:44.320
the quarries that you speak, about
being kind of on the edges of it,

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.980
going into what we
call the fall line,

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:50.400
all the way down to
Point Lookout which is

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.530
where the Yaocomico people were.

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:57.430
And in the heart of it is at this
place that I'm describing to you,

01:21:57.430 --> 01:22:04.530 position:56%
just about 15 miles south of the DC
line in Pascoti National Park today.

01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:07.790
The way it was organized
was we had a central chief

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:11.850
who was actually called the
Tayac, and my sir name is part

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:17.070
of an acknowledgement and
an honor to my grandfather

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:22.360
who really revitalized that
role and decided to take

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:28.820 position:56%
that sir name legally because of
the activism that was happening here

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:35.620
in the late 1960's and 1970's but
he started using it in the 1930's.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:40.710
And so the Tayac was somebody
who was able to bring in people

01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:47.310
from over a dozen towns, each
with a leader called a werowance

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:50.970
who could also be a woman who
was known as a wereowance qua,

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:57.740
advised by wisos or peace chiefs,
[inaudible] who were considered

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.510
to be, by an Engilsh
system, war chiefs,

01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:05.310
but in fact these were statesman
and that word is linked to the word

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:12.470
that we now think about as caucus,
so in terms of a negotiation.

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:20.110
And that is where we have
this system operating

01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:26.030
in what is often known or thought
about prehistory but its history.

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:33.050
And so about 13 generations before
the arc and the dove came in 1634,

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:37.770
there was a man on the eastern
shore of Maryland named [inaudible]

01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:40.640
and he broke off from the Nanticoke

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.210
and established this governmental
polity here on the Western shore

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:49.110
and started to basically
look at, it's kind of,

01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:52.900
not really a federal system but
not too far out from that in terms

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.090
of centralized area
of power at Moyaone,

01:23:57.090 --> 01:24:03.660
a town that then would
receive tribute and interaction

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.820
and communication from
around the region

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:10.240
and they would bring people
together through ceremony.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:18.170
So there's a really, there's a very
long history and the question is,

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:21.650
why do we not know
anything about this capital?

01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:24.810
Why doesn't anybody here
speak Piscataway anymore?

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.850
And that's wrapped up, you
know if you really want

01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:31.280
to know what the language is and
what the history is and you want

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:37.140
to know well what happened to
people, you just have to kind

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:43.330 position:56%
of see all of these things that have
been built up over the landscape.

01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:47.350
So the history here, I'm just
going to wrap up because 7 minutes

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:53.020
to take you through 400 years is
[laughing] especially because,

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.110
you know, we were chatting a
little bit and I was thinking,

01:24:56.110 --> 01:25:01.820
there's been a lot of silencing and
a lot of times we do like to take

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:08.290
up our time when we need to
speak, but the issue is is that,

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:13.970
that question of what happened and
why you don't know and why you have

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:19.540
to dig so hard in the primary
records and then also look

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:23.650
through oral histories are
extremely essential and so

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:26.640
that is what I would want to
talk about because the, you know,

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.490
we'll talk more but really
this idea of the merging

01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:34.050
of the what has remained
in terms of oral account,

01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:39.650 position:56%
matching it up with what's
available in the documentary account

01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:45.710
because I started my work by
listening around the kitchen table,

01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:50.220
by being involved revitalization
of the people

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.320
and then deciding I wanted
to take an academic track

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.170
to really figure it out and
bring those voices forward.

01:25:57.170 --> 01:26:03.400
So that work, it's long, hard
work and it's a puzzle over time

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.740
and there are very unique
things about this region

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.400
that follow the patterns
that we see for native people

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.300
across the continent
but also get wrapped

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:18.930
up in something particularly
vicious and pervasive

01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:23.600
on the Atlantic Seaboard and
that has to do with race policy.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.540
So there's a lot of intertwining
here and we'll have a chance

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.090
to talk more, but in the
meantime just to kind

01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:36.170 position:56%
of reorient your head space to how
to long this history has been going.

01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:39.870
It's not been since 1800
and it's not been since 1750

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:42.880
and it's not been since 1607.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.030
It's been for a very long time.

01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:46.710
So with that I would
like to introduce Tara

01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:49.080
who will bring is right
up into the present.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.510
Thank you.

who finishes this song and I'm Bear
Clan from Couchiching First Nation.

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:24.200
So like Gabby said, I think I'm
here to represent the present.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.390
My perspective is of one of many
Native Americans who graduate

01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:31.100
and move to Washington D.C.
to go represent our nations.

01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.500
All of Indian law is federal.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.430
It's federal law and tribal
law and so this is kind

01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:37.730
of where everything is decided.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:39.790
This is where all the policies
that affect our people are decided.

01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:43.710
These are the congressional
members that control our fates,

01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:46.380
really, in a lot of ways.

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:51.210
So, it's a really different
experience being in D.C., for sure.

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:55.320
Native Americans are very
community based and I think one

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.530
of the first things you do is
find your fellow Native Americans

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.110
and kind of like, hey
guys, I'm here, you know.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.140
It's kind of changing
group because there's a lot

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.710
of transplants coming in and out.

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:07.970
But that is pretty much the first
thing you do when you get here

01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:13.980 position:56%
and I think it's important to
understand kind of like how it feels

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.090
to be a Native American in
D.C. and to work and live

01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:21.880 position:56%
in these spaces beyond just like not
having, you know, your own community

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.960
and being with your own people
and your land and all of that.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.450
I think one of the very hard
things, at least for me,

01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:31.880
and that's also why I
became connected to Joe,

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.820
was moving here and
seeing the Mascot.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:39.290
That was really kind of a
shocking experience for me.

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.240
In Minnesota where I'm from,

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.300
we actually banned Native
Mascots back in 1992.

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.100
So it just wasn't an issue

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:50.710 position:56%
and something I never really thought
about, and you know, I was standing

01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:53.540
in Subway, I think a
couple weeks into work.

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.030
I work at a Native
American Law Firm.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:29:01.240
We [inaudible] American Law and I
was standing in Subway and the guy

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.650
in front of me was wearing a hat

01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:04.510
and the guy behind me
was wearing a jersey,

01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:06.030
and the employees are
all wearing pins

01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:07.860
because there was some
promotion going on

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.650
and that name was everywhere
and that head was everywhere.

01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:13.760
And I was shocked, kind
of floored at that moment,

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.260 position:56%
thinking about what it would be like
to be a Native American child here,

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:20.570
and to grow up here and to
see that and just, you know,

01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:23.810
know that that's what
people really think of you.

01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:25.110
Today I'm wearing Moccasins.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.780
It's Rock your Mocs day
and I've already on the way

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:30.370
in here got a lot really
strange looks, right,

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:34.610
because I think it's kind of the
issue of the mascot and just kind

01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:37.210
of the overall sense
of Native Americans is

01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:38.770
that we are vanished people.

01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:41.840
And so when they see something
like this, it kind of shocks them,

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.700
like oh my goodness, other
Native Americans that are here

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.720
and they exist and they are
in Washington D.C. working

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.050
and living in these places?

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.350
Yes. Absolutely.

01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:53.700
We're just aren't walking around in
headdresses and painting our faces

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.500
which is what they expect.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:01.280
So that's kind of-- that really
sprung me towards doing a lot

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.790
of social justice work and
becoming heavily involved

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:08.090
with the mascot movement and you
know kind of doing what I can

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:11.940 position:56%
from D.C. to help the representation
of Native Americans across the board

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:16.900
and how we're portrayed in the
media but also here in D.C. I mean,

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:21.450
it is something that, in the work I
do, I go and lobby on Capital Hill,

01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:25.780
and you know we're pushing for
we need money for a hospital,

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:30.730
we need the right the prosecute
individuals on the reservation.

01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:32.030 position:56%
These are things that we don't have.

01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.560 position:56%
They are fundamental things we don't
have, and it's hard when you walk

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.720
in knowing that, you know,
the congressional number,

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.730
depending on how many tribes
they have in their region,

01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:43.370
or maybe they don't have
any, is going to kind

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:46.330
of have this idea already in
their heads before they see you,

01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:51.300
that you are this old static
character and that you know,

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.150
well we don't really want to
give the Indians, you know,

01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:57.340
the right to do these things
because they're not civilized.

01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.170 position:56%
Right. I mean those are real impacts

01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:04.410
that really actually really do
affect us, and it also, you know,

01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:10.440 position:56%
I think the more important thing is
really about children but just today

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.260
or this last week actually,
I had the honor of speaking

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.110
with Bernie Sanders as he
was introducing a bill.

01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:20.580
I do a lot of environmental justice
work as well, and it was funny

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:24.110
because that morning, he
doesn't have any tribes,

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:26.830
any federally recognized
tribes in Vermont,

01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:29.420
and that very morning he had
actually met with the delegation

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.580
of Apache people from Oak Flat.

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.880
Oak Flat is a sacred place
that was actually given

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.480
by the federal government
to [inaudible] operation

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.260
and it's about to be destroyed.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.160
That is our congress.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.530
So he met with them, and you
know, to a guy that has no idea

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:48.340
about tribes, I think it was
kind of really shocking to him

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.450
and really inspired and moved
him, and then when he was walking

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:54.350
out towards me I could just
see his eyebrows go up, like,

01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:55.800
oh my goodness, another Indian.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.520
Like. And I'm like,
we're everywhere,

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:58.850
you know, we're everywhere.

01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:05.220
And so I think that you know
as researchers and, you know,

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.760
I've been to the Library
of Congress several times.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.060
I mean a lot of the work we do

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.920
in federal Indian law is
hundreds of years old, right?

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.510
I mean federal Indian law is a
moving body of law but it's also,

01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:16.810
I mean you're going
to be citing a case

01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:18.190
from 1800 every now
and again at a brief.

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:22.140
It's a really strange area of law,
but you also get to learn a lot

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:23.630
of history along the way.

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:28.790 position:56%
So I think it's very important to be
cognizant that we are modern people

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:34.230
and that we are here, that
representation really does matter,

01:32:34.230 --> 01:32:38.260
that we should be doing everything
we possibly can to educate people

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:42.220
about the tribal nations
that are here and the ones

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:45.880
that have been coming here for, I
mean since the beginning, right?

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.180
The very, very beginning.

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.830
There have been delegations
of tribal leaders

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:51.110
and the National Congress
of American Indians is here

01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:55.840 position:56%
in Washington D.C. I am one of many,
many people that comes out here

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:01.060
as an attorney, as a staffer,
as every kind of possible job

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.840
that you can imagine, that's
what we are doing out here

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:07.150
in Washington D.C. So I think
it's very important for all of you

01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:12.170
to at least try to make
people aware of that.

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:13.770
Everyone that I have worked
here with at the Library

01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:16.500

as far as doing research

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.450
and understanding and I've
gotten to hold treaties

great things, right.

you to do that and thank you,

happened to our people.

I'm a poet, so I started out life

The second one comes out this spring
called, "Weaving the Boundary"

01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:34.950
and it focuses too on American
Indian History because there are

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:39.050
so many gaps in the larger
story beyond Virginia

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:41.890
that many people don't know about.

01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:44.260
What we do know is
that people have been

01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:48.100
in what we call Virginia
for 18,000 years.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.340
When I was in school,
it was presented

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:54.110
as an absolute scientific
fact that native people came

01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:56.850
across the Bering Strait's
land bridge carrying spears

01:34:56.850 --> 01:35:00.140
and hunting Mastodons and wearing
fur coats and that happened ten

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.040
to twelve thousand years ago.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.920
So archeologists have had to now
call into question everything

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.300
that they've told us
about how we got here.

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.710
And I found it very interesting
and comforting to realize

01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:17.340
that there are native stories in
our area that reference giant bears

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.320
and giant beavers and giant
bison and everybody said,

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.240
oh isn't that cute,
those native legends.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.840
And then archeologists
found evidence

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.460
of those creatures in Virginia.

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:32.260
So this is the kind of information
that I get to encounter every day,

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.910
and I didn't' start
out as a researcher.

01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:37.770 position:56%
I started out as a tribal historian.

01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:43.300 position:56%
In order to collect the history
that we didn't have about our story,

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:49.050
I had to become a researcher and so
my friend and I, my tribal friend,

01:35:49.050 --> 01:35:53.430
Diane Shields and I,
for about ten years dug

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:59.940
into all the records we could find
and began to reconstruct that story

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.600 position:56%
so that we could develop a
petition that would go to the Bureau

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.350
of Indian Affairs documenting
our case for federal recognition.

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:13.660 position:56%
What we now have is a historical
chronology that traces the movements

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.700
of our people and the
places in which they appear

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.690
in historical records, and what
I've learned in that process is

01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:25.990
that people who write
history have agendas.

01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:31.050 position:56%
It's not absolute objective facts in
the way that we were told in school.

01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:35.400
And I've also learned that whenever
you tell a story you decide what

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.700
to leave in and what to leave out,

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.000
and in our case an awful
lot has been left out.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.870
Including most of the voices,
I'd like to say maybe 75 percent

01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.610
of the people who participated
in history, all of the women,

01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:51.800
all the people of color,
all the poor white people.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.330 position:56%
Their voices were not present in the
stories that I learned in school.

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:59.860
When we took our elders to
Virginia Tech to for the first time

01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:03.150
to show them what kind of
higher education was possible

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:06.140
for their grandkids,
some of them cried

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.670
because it wasn't even conceivable

01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.910
that they could attend
a university like that.

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:15.830
Most of them went to a one room
school first through seventh grade

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:19.750
up until 1963 in Virginia
and if they wanted to go

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:23.350
to high school they had to go to
a federal Indian boarding school

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:27.400
in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which
meant they left in September

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.220
and didn't see their
families again until June

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.710
because they couldn't
come home for Christmas.

01:37:32.710 --> 01:37:34.920
They didn't know their
brothers and sisters.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.550
They really didn't have the
relationship with their parents

01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:41.180
that most of us have enjoyed
without even thinking about it.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.860
So we have learned these things
about ourselves by studying

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.310
that history and studying the
accounts of people like John Smith.

01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:52.700
I love John Smith's map.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.920
It's remarkably accurate
considering how little

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.420
of that area he actually visited.

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.160
So what that that tells me is
that there were Native people,

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.340
informants anthropologists called
them, [laughing] who were able

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:13.180
to translate for him the
geography of what's now Virginia

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.560
on a flat piece of paper, right.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.310
Well, this is the way
the rivers go and so on.

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:21.960
And what I've also realized
in looking at these records is

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:28.590
that native history is inscribed
on the place by the place names

01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:33.730 position:56%
that we have given certain areas,
and they are many Native place names

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:37.160
in the coastal plain where
the Piscataway people

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.530
and other [inaudible]
speakers lived, or live,

01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:44.660 position:56%
because they did a lot of
interacting with the colonial people

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:47.820
who did the documenting,
not so much with my people.

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.700
We seem to want to avoid
contact, probably for good reason.

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:55.040
Maybe we've heard some
stories about what happened

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.320
when those explorers showed up.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.270
We called them people faces
whose faces grew hair upside

01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:05.160
down [laughing], but there's
not a lot of documentation

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.600
about the Monacan's and what
happened to them in comparison

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.640
to the Powhatan people and they
aren't so many place names,

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.890
so if you look at the
creeks and rivers

01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:20.280
up in our area you don't' see our
language represented in the way

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.680
that you do, you know Piscataway
and Patuxent and Potomac,

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.580
and I mean almost every
river up the [inaudible].

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:31.140
You know, the rivers took the names
from the people who lived there,

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.990
and we don't necessarily know what
the native people called them,

01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:38.620
but I live in my house fifteen
minutes from the headquarters

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:41.640
of the Monacan nation
during colonial times.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:44.440
Where the [inaudible] and
James Rivers come together.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.620
So I'm home and I like it there.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:53.580 position:56%
In any event, putting all of this
story together has just convinced me

01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:57.560
that they are so many ways
to tell about the past

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.360
and history is only
one of those ways.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.580
Native people had broad
and beautiful ways

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:07.240
of understanding the world
and their place in it,

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.690
and enough of those traces
remain to us that we can continue

01:40:11.690 --> 01:40:14.570
to put ourselves in that web

01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:18.360
and understand our
responsibilities as human beings.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.570
Not as care takers, in an Adam
and Eve sense, but as relatives.

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:31.170
I think that is the most important
thing we fail to teach kids is how

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:35.160
to be a good relative, how to
be a good part of a community.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.190
And native people know
how to still do that.

01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:42.400
you know, it's not distinguishing
yourself as an individual.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:46.160 position:56%
And so when I came into the academy
I did it for a very specific reason.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.900
Someone had said, Kareene Wood
is a self-styled historian,

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:56.320
because I didn't have a Ph.D.
that irritated me so I got one.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.460
It took me quite a while.

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:02.680
It was also annoying when
people said I really admire you

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.860
for going back to school
at your age.

01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:09.490
But I did it, not because
I wanted to change my job

01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:12.840
but because I wanted the validation
to be able to say I'm as much

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.320
as an expert of my people's
story is somebody else is.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:22.490
And when I did it, I didn't' come
in as an individual who is supposed

01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:25.700
to come up with some exciting
concept or invent a new term

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.770
or we like to do that
in the academics.

01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:31.320 position:56%
You have to do something new and all
of your college looks at your work

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.980
and go rrrrrr and tear
you up, you know.

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.640
When I came in it was a whole
community of people on my shoulders

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.140
who were happy to tell me
if I was doing it wrong.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:45.550
I had a responsibly to
tell the story in a way

01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:52.150 position:56%
that honors those ancestors and that
collectively it expands the story

01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:53.450
that we know.

01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:57.570
When the elders came to us they
said, you young people have

01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:01.040
to get an education and
change what's in those books,

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.290
because we aren't the
people that they describe.

01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:07.000
We are not savages, you know,
and they didn't see themselves

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.120 position:56%
in those stories, so it is so
important to me to continue the work

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:16.720
that I do and to bring more
people into the mix to help us.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.510
We have a lot of work to do.

01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:21.580
And I'm honored to be part
of it to be able to do that.

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.380
So thank you.

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:35.270
[ Applause ]

01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:39.580
&gt;&gt; Ben Norman: Then yes,
my name is Ben Norman.

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:45.440
I come from Pamunkey Tribe
which is located in Virginia.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.960
If you are familiar, there is the
York River that comes into Virginia

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.890
and it splits into two
rivers which is the Pamunkey

01:42:53.890 --> 01:43:04.430 position:56%
and the Manipeni Rivers, so there
on the left side where were located,

01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:06.900
right around that Peninsula.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:10.930 position:56%
So thanks for having me here for all

01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:16.060
of our co presenters it's
really great hearing from them

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:21.540 position:56%
and also hearing language from them.

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.270
There's a lot of there's
some work being done recently

01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:35.150
with our language and when a person
is participating that is Iancustla

01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:42.080
and through some of his research,
he's actually found is the meaning

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:49.620
of Pamunkey which is crazy that we
don't actually know at this point.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:53.790
But what he's found is that
it actually means place

01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:58.570
where people sweat,
that's what it means.

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:02.840
It's a place where people come
to pray, is what that means,

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.440
it sounds kind of funny
but, yea it's the actual,

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.900
according to his research
that he's done,

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:12.840
and it means place
where peoples sweat.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:21.040
It was a place that was very well
protected so I think that leaders

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:28.430
and individuals that needed to
come for you know maybe down time

01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:33.380
and also a way to come pray.

01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:41.760
So when I first heard of the topic
this discussion American Indians

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:46.730
in Federal City and Regional
History, I thought I kind of fit

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:52.830 position:56%
into both of these ideas from
Pamunkey which is within this region

01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:57.290
and moved here to come work
here, here at Washington D.C.

01:44:57.290 --> 01:45:03.720
at the National Museum
of American Indians.

01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:11.880
So it also made me also think
about people from my own families

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.340
that have come here to
D.C. for different reasons,

01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:20.840
like my father Frank Badbee
I remember him telling me

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:28.740
about coming here 1678 for the
longest walk to help to know

01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:33.670 position:56%
to participate in the longest walk
and bring attention to treaty rights

01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:38.420
and things that were going
on in the Native Communities.

01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:49.730 position:56%
it also made me think of my wife's
grandmother her name is Vilma Peters

01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:55.230
she's from the Opononeo
Tono nations Oklahoma.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.470
So I remember hearing,
always hearing stories

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:06.330
of her coming here she was a member
of the American Indian movement

01:46:06.330 --> 01:46:10.270
and remember hearing
stories of her coming here

01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:13.400
for D.C. for different occasions.

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:22.250
One of these stories
is in 1972 Vilma

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:28.620
and her youngest son traveled here
to D.C. again to bring attention

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:33.940
to standards of living back
at home, treaty rights,

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:39.770
during that trip things escalated
eventually as you may know took

01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:48.910
over the BIA building, they
stayed there for seven days

01:46:48.910 --> 01:47:02.010
and at her funeral a lot of her
things possessions were there

01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:08.330
for people to come photos,
important things to her,

01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:11.040
artwork that her grandchildren
had made,

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:15.860
there's even a really
awesome American Indian Jacket

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:19.620
that is hers, that was there.

01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:25.030 position:56%
Political pens things that she kept,
one that really stuck out to me,

01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:34.460
it just said another
Indian for Decacus.

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:44.320
And also there was a book that
was there it looked like a journal

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.690
that was there on the table, at
first I didn't' want to read it.

01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:54.020 position:56%
I thought it was kind of an invasion
of her privacy, her journal,

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.630
I saw some other family
members reading it

01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:00.000
so I thought I couldn't' resist.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:08.450
I'll take a look at it, and
which I'm really glad I did.

01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:13.650 position:56%
It was a journal and it was
actually a journal of her times here

01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:20.530
in Washington D.C. during that trip
and it was very detailed journal.

01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:30.100
So detailed to where she stayed
all of the Taxi's that she rode in

01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:33.690
and where they were picked up
where they were dropped off

01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:40.790
and even the price of the Taxi,
it was very, very detailed.

01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:49.020
So the end of the journal I thought
it was really interesting the

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.030
government and politicians were
really wanting them to leave

01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:56.750
because they actually bought her
a plane ticket, her and her son,

01:48:56.750 --> 01:49:07.010
to fly back to Oklahoma, and the
last journal entry she said her

01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:13.470 position:56%
and her son, which is name is Thomas
Whiteshirt he was seven years old

01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:19.680
at the time at this trip,
they were actually in the air,

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:25.700
when she was writing the
journal entry, she was thinking

01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:31.710
about the work they had done here,
the attention they have brought

01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:38.070
to the issues here and she was
hopeful in this last entry,

01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:43.350 position:56%
and hopeful for the last generations
of Native children who would be

01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:49.060 position:56%
in a better situation because of
their work, so things like this kind

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:57.050
of every once in a while will
kind of rejuvenate me and the work

01:49:57.050 --> 01:50:03.760
that we are doing at the museum,
trying to educate the public

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:13.220
so as you probably guess, we get
a lot of crazy questions at work.

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:20.030
99% of the time you know
and over feel really good

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:21.330
about what we're doing,

01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:26.050
but sometimes you'll get people
just trying to argue and things

01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:30.720
like that, and sometimes they
are kind of funny questions

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.230
like once we had a question of.

01:50:35.230 --> 01:50:44.170
Why did the Indians follow the
buffalo was it for their milk?

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:53.790
That was real question from
an adult also, not a child.

01:50:55.190 --> 01:51:01.680
Another one some of them are
kind of heartbreaking to read,

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.210
one I actually got from a
chaperone on a school tour was.

01:51:05.210 --> 01:51:10.320
How many breeds are
American Indians are there?

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.150 position:56%
Another one, this was one that I
jsut overheard two ladies were going

01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:22.810
to the restroom and they were
the restroom was closed so one

01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:24.750
of them said I wonder
why it's closed

01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:28.240
and the other one said well you
know Indians really don't know

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.100
about plumbing.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:36.060
So we have questions like
that, they really stick

01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:41.600 position:56%
with you especially early on when I
first started working at the museum,

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.390
stuck with me, came home
with me, thought about it,

01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:50.210
now that I've been there for a
long time it doesn't' affect me

01:51:50.210 --> 01:51:54.050
as much I just try to take these
moments as a learning opportunity

01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:57.800
to work with the public,
and educate them.

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:02.550
And also fit into this because I'm

01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:10.890
from Pumonkey currently may
know some of our situation

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:13.640
at the moment you may think

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:22.070
that we are Federally recognized
567 recognized tribe I think a lot

01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:27.610
of people heard the news originally
that we were federally recognized

01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:33.670
but not as people know that we were
challenged again, which was kind

01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:38.340
of expected because these don't
even want to mention their names

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:42.970
who challenged us but
they are you know they are

01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:45.280
in this for a different reason.

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.620
Some of the things that they
are challenging us on basically

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:57.020
if we are native Americans
and if our if we are a nation,

01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:05.000
that still continues today
there both really ridiculous one

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.600 position:56%
of the many amazing things about our
community because we have been some

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:19.470 position:56%
of the first people to get basically
colonized so we have lost a lot

01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:24.690
of our ways during this,
these hundreds of years

01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:28.370
but our Government has always
continued still to this day,

01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:30.760
you know, and never stopped.

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:35.030
We have minutes recorded
of our meetings going back

01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:43.930 position:56%
over a hundred years so these, these
questions you know of our Indianist

01:53:43.930 --> 01:53:47.250
or our government continuing
are ridiculous

01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:50.030
so through this independent
board that's going

01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:56.690 position:56%
to review this hopefully the process
will go quickly and we'll be able

01:53:56.690 --> 01:54:00.530
to continue this really important
work that needs to be done

01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:04.480
in our community and for
our future generations.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:08.890
I have a son that's two and
one that's on the way right now

01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:11.920
in January, so I'm
really excited for them

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.650
and the future possibilities
for them

01:54:14.650 --> 01:54:17.340
and for the children
from our community.

01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:22.540
So thanks everyone and I'm
sure we'll continue our panel

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.860
of discussion now so.

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.660

of the Office of Opportunity
of Inclusiveness and Compliance

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.690
and we were glad to be a
co-sponsor of the event today.

01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:46.810
At this point, I would like to
ask our courtiers to come forward

01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:51.240
and to give a quick overview of
the materials that they've brought

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.840
from the collections and then
this is also a good break,

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.890
if you are a library
employee and need to step out,

01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:00.950
and then we will continue
the conversation.

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:04.810
So when Mike and others are
coming forward I'll let you know

01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:08.710 position:56%
that if you look in the back and you
get this and you get this book mark

01:55:08.710 --> 01:55:12.620
with this book mark you get five
million pictures in your hands

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:16.250
and this is an amazing
trove comes from the prints

01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:20.520
and photographs online catalog and
this material is readily available

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:26.100
to you 27/7 and we wanted
to let you know the prints

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.190
and photographs has materials
up there if American folkway

01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:34.560 position:56%
and geography and map if you would
come up and tell us a brief synopsis

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.770
of what's in your collection
and then we'll get back

01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:38.570
to discussion with our panelist.

01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:58.300
I'm Judith Gray from the
American Folk Life Center.

01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:01.890
Our archive of folk culture holds
perhaps the largest collection

01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:05.800
of one of a kind of field
recordings of tribal materials,

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:12.680
probably 2,000 hours representing
materials from 160-170 communities,

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:17.160
just within the U.S. and
some slightly boarding some

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:18.520
Canadian areas.

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:21.960
We also have recordings
from indigenous communities

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.720
in other parts of the world.

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.720
What I brought, however,
is not going to be much

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.030
of from this immediate area.

01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:34.970
By the time the audio video
recording devices were around,

01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:39.200
most of the acknowledges and
linguists were headed to parts

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.200
of the country where they
were larger concentrations

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.560 position:56%
of people living in more traditional
ways perhaps at the time so most

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:52.930
of the recordings tend to be
plains, Southwest, California,

01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:59.500
also quite a few New York Iroquoian
communities from the upper Midwest.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:03.730
Yes, we have [inaudible]
from Minnesota, Wisconsin;

01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:09.740
Menominee people and Iowa
people and such, but very,

01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.130
very little from this
particular area.

01:57:13.130 --> 01:57:17.170
So I can't provide you
with recordings like that.

01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:20.900
I do have, however, for example,
the earliest of field recording

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:28.160
that we are aware of made 125
years ago, March 15th, 1890;

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:35.410 position:56%
two Passamaquoddy men sang songs and
spoke narratives to a toy recordist,

01:57:35.410 --> 01:57:38.120
so please stop and
I'll be glad to talk

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:39.920
with you further about
our resources.

I'm the head of Reference Services
with the Geography and Map Division.

01:57:55.130 --> 01:57:57.060
We have the largest map
library in the world.

01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.750
We have about 5.5 million maps.

01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:03.210
Our collections related to Native
Americans are actually kind

01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:04.690
of a hidden collection.

01:58:04.690 --> 01:58:08.060
We've only cataloged less
than half of our collection,

01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:11.730
so if you sit at home in
front of your computer looking

01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:13.950
for historical maps we might have,

01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:15.940
you're going to find a
very small percentage.

01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:19.690
The way to actually get into this
collection is to make contact

01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:23.220
with us or actually best
of all stop by for a visit.

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.530
But I would encourage you to take
a look at our website we have a lot

01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:32.310
of our historical materials up,
at least some of our key items.

01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:37.050
I brought the [inaudible] of the
1606 John Smith map if you want

01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:40.610 position:56%
to take a look at it, but the way to
really look into our collections is

01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:43.370
to actually come visit
us and take a look.

01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:49.740
There's a lot of great projects and
papers hidden in our collections.

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.910

- 5, and you can connect

01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:54.210

I'm Barbra Bair.

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:07.400
I'm a historian in the Manuscript
Division here at the Library

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:13.660
of Congress and I've brought
a selection of items that are

01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.040
from different parts of the
North America, from Canada

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.930
and the United States,
representative

01:59:18.930 --> 01:59:21.450
of different tribal peoples.

01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:26.000 position:56%
In the manuscript division as a
whole, we have over 60 million items

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.770
in more than 11,000
collections and you can find many

01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:34.960
of our materials online and also
in the virtual expedition sites

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:39.440
that are available through the
Library of Congress website.

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:43.870
Today after the discussion is
finished, you can come back

01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:48.370
to see the materials that
I brought and they begin

01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:51.980
with a Micmac Indian prayer book,

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:57.660
which is one of the earliest
known scripts of Native Americans,

01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:04.550
and as Karenne pointed out,
all documents are subjective.

02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:06.810
In other words, no
history its subjective.

02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:10.310
They're created with an agenda,
created by certain authors

02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:13.740
and with certain kinds of
collaborations, and everything

02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:17.060
that we have is subject
is to interpretation

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:20.530
and re-interpretation over time.

02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:25.670
The next item that I
brought was an illustration

02:00:25.670 --> 02:00:32.120
from an 18th century ship captain's
diary of first nations people

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.510
in the [inaudible] sound off of
British Columbia, which is also one

02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:41.430
of the earlier illustrations that
we have and I wanted to say that,

02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:44.310
you know, one of the problems of
course with written sources is

02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:47.330
that they are very new, they
are just tip of the iceberg

02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:52.110
of actual history as has also been
pointed out by today's speakers,

02:00:52.110 --> 02:00:58.160
that there's a very, very long
oral tradition that proceeds this.

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:03.040
The next item that I brought is
about the Red Stick Rebellion

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.680
and it's a list of names
Creek Indians who served

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.840
with the Tennessee Militia
under Andrew Jackson

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:13.880
and it makes the point that
it was a Creek civil war,

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.460
that there were native people's
on both sides, the Cherokee

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:22.650
and the Choctaw joined in
confederation with the lower Creeks

02:01:22.650 --> 02:01:28.470
against the Red Sticks
who were very determined

02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:33.360
to preserve traditional ways and
to work against the encouragement

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:37.240
of white culture and
of western expansion.

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.310
Related to that is a
letter that Principal Chief

02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:45.910
of the Cherokee Nation, John Ross,
wrote to Andrew Jackson along

02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:49.320
with other delegates from the
Cherokee nation protesting the

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.260
violence and the confiscation
of property in Georgia

02:01:53.260 --> 02:02:04.000
and his long role in the 1830's and
reacting against Indian removal.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.730
I've brought a few items from the
Henry Rowe Schoolcraft Collection

02:02:07.730 --> 02:02:09.950
which is one of our
major collections

02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:13.850
of Native American material
in the Manuscript Division.

02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:17.740
Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, as you
may not know, was an Indian agent

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:22.300
in Michigan and became
superintendent of Indian Affairs

02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:26.560
in the Detroit area once
Michigan became a state.

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:32.140 position:56%
He married the Native American poet
who is now very famed and deservedly

02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:37.320
so as the first Native
American poet who published

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.310
in the mainstream literary
tradition in the United States,

02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:45.600
Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, and
I've brought a manuscript of one

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:51.590
of her poems and also an example
of one of the many Native American,

02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:57.000
in this case Chippewa legends
and tales that were collected.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.570
Henry Rowe Schoolcraft got credit
for the vocabularies and legends

02:03:01.570 --> 02:03:05.610
that were collected, but Jane was
instrumental in all of that work,

02:03:05.610 --> 02:03:08.420
and he could not have done
it without her family.

02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:13.180
It was her family that provided the
contacts and introduced the people

02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:15.860
that told the stories
that were transcribed

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:19.350
and we have several volumes of
those stories if you are interested

02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:24.550
in the literary tradition
of the Chippewa.

02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:29.310
I also brought a article
that Walt Whitman wrote.

02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:34.650
He wrote it in the 1880's but it's
reminiscence of his time serving

02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:38.610 position:56%
as a civil servant at the Department
of the Interior where he worked

02:03:38.610 --> 02:03:40.620 position:56%
in the Department of Indian Affairs.

02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:44.510
This was very briefly at the end
of the Civil War for a few months

02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:48.860
and he wrote a very paternalistic
article about it later in life

02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.240
and we do have the largest
collection of Walt Whitman papers

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.510
in the world here at the Library of
Congress and there are also drafts

02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:02.300
in his collection of poems
that mention Native Americans

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:08.590
and he did prescribe to a very
romanticized vanishing race,

02:04:08.590 --> 02:04:12.920
noble savage sort of vision
of Native American life

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:18.820
and the association with the
wilderness and I will just note,

02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.590
because it came up
in the collection,

02:04:20.590 --> 02:04:23.600
I mean in the earlier talks,
that we also have materials

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.110
on the beautiful city movement

02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:27.940
because we have the
Fredrick Law Olmsted papers,

02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:32.140
so there's a great deal
there about Native American

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:38.650
and other ethnic ideology and
symbolism that was replete

02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:44.080
and that school of
architecture and landscape design.

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.750
The last items that I
brought are from are

02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:48.770 position:56%
from the C. Hart Merriam Collection.

02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:53.240
C. Hart Merriam was an ethnologist,
archaeologist, zoologist,

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:56.850
and he did extensive work
in California and Nevada,

02:04:56.850 --> 02:05:01.340
and I've brought one of his
hand colored and labeled map

02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:05.650
that shows the linguist groups in
California and Nevada and also one

02:05:05.650 --> 02:05:11.090
of his many field work vocabulary
forms, which in this case is

02:05:11.090 --> 02:05:13.030
for the [inaudible]language.

02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:16.370
One of the things that was
interesting about that is

02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:20.360
that there is a category of names
for supernatural beings and one

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:24.220
of the things that he added in
by hand is the name for mermaid,

02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:29.800
which was a reference to
tails of nymphs who lived

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.810
in the deep holes of
[inaudible] River.

02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:37.510
So on that note, I'll pass it on.

02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:43.530
[ Applause ]

02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:46.280
&gt;&gt; So we do have a bit of time
to for some discussion but I want

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.610 position:56%
to put this map up which is actually

02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:50.260
in the Geography and
Maps Collection.

02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:52.470
Gabby, this is the map that I
mentioned to you previously.

02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:57.030
I meant to put this up before I
finished up, but this is a map

02:05:57.030 --> 02:06:01.650
from late 19th century put
together by a symposium

02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:04.770
of archeologists working
in the district.

02:06:04.770 --> 02:06:07.730
It's a map of the District
of Columbia showing

02:06:07.730 --> 02:06:10.810
"ancient village sights" and
you can see that triangles

02:06:10.810 --> 02:06:15.690
and rectangles there indicating
sites within the district

02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:20.820
that have been studied
at that point.

02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.710
So I have two sets of questions
that I would like to offer

02:06:23.710 --> 02:06:28.020
to our panelist and I would like
to invite any of you to come

02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:34.390
up after I ask the first
set, and that is, you know,

02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:37.480
we've got a number of
students in the room here.

02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:40.140
Students of mine from George
Mason University came today

02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:46.380
but were also being live cast
and a video of this panel will be

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.380
on the library's website so
potentially future students

02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:52.220
who are interested in the
history of this region

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.070
and working with communities here.

02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:57.900
All of you have devoted your lives
to this research, to this work,

02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:01.700
to these communities, and so I'd
like to ask for those who would

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:05.860
like to do the same or would
be interested in the same,

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.400
what is some advice that
you would offer to them?

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.750
What are some things
that you would suggest?

02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:13.960
What are some promises but also
what are some potential pitfalls.

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:17.900
What are things that researchers
wanting to work in this region

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:23.830
with communities here might want
to avoid, so I would like to open

02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:26.400
up to whom whoever to
actually come up for this.

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.510
All together.

02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:41.050
[ Background Sounds ]

02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:45.750
&gt;&gt; We'll just make a little
panel here [laughing].

02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:48.570
So pitfalls and opportunities.

02:07:48.570 --> 02:07:57.530 position:56%
Yeah so, I would have to say that
there are some really obvious issues

02:07:57.530 --> 02:08:04.100
for research regarding people
across the board and in particular

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:11.170
in this region is that the material
is very early and the ability

02:08:11.170 --> 02:08:13.300
to understand what the
Native point of view

02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:16.240
on this is also, it's difficult.

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:22.440
So you have to go through many
different filters and sometimes go

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:27.100
to places that you wouldn't
think to go, so for example

02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:33.450
so with Piscataway history,
we have the Jesuit relations,

02:08:33.450 --> 02:08:36.200
we have the Maryland archives,
all of this being told

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:46.660 position:56%
in English Colonial voice, sometimes
with reporting about how, you know,

02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:53.130
basically supposed transcriptions
of what Native people had to say.

02:08:53.130 --> 02:08:55.830
The way I started to
fill some of this in,

02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:59.230
this is just a lifelong thing and
some of it is just pay attention

02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:04.040
and start to have people who maybe
are doing other work pay attention

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:06.880
and sometime they'll start
to fill in the gaps so one

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.290
of the sources I did go
to, and it was really hard

02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:12.890
to get my dissertation committee to
accept this all those years ago--

02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:16.090
it took me a really long time
for them to finally get this--

02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:21.270
was that I went to Haudenosaunee
to the Iroquois confederacy,

02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:27.880 position:56%
because some of our people had ended
up because of the pressures here,

02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:29.480 position:56%
they ended up in Pennsylvania coming

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.330
under Haudenosaunee Iroquois
jurisdiction and some

02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:36.650
of our people got adopted into
the Cayuga Wolf Clan and ended

02:09:36.650 --> 02:09:43.170 position:56%
up in six nations, so this was
like, you're talking from about 1701

02:09:43.170 --> 02:09:48.330
up through, it was
about the year 1987,

02:09:48.330 --> 02:09:52.890
that I encountered Chief Jacob
Thomas Cayuga Wolf Clan chief

02:09:52.890 --> 02:09:58.020 position:56%
and I started to talk to him and I
said do you know anything, you know,

02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:02.090
about us because they know us as
[inaudible] and he said, yeah I do,

02:10:02.090 --> 02:10:09.090
and as a matter of fact I have
a binder here of written accord

02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:15.600
of what happened in the Cayuga
language and it was like telling it

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.200
from the other side
of what had happened.

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:24.640
So there's fragments and weird
pieces and having to look around

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:27.180
and to do the unexpected
and to listen

02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:30.100
to stories, hear people's names.

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.860
We have an oral account
about the Battle

02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:37.160
of Fallen Timbers of
our people in 1794.

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.530
We have an oral account
of it that has to do

02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:43.930
with that the people chose a
place that lightening hit trees

02:10:43.930 --> 02:10:46.050
and that's why it's
called Fallen Timbers.

02:10:46.050 --> 02:10:50.780
Fast forward a year to the 1990's
[inaudible] there's a guy whose

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.220
native name is Fallen Timbers.

02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:57.430 position:56%
I was like I need to talk to you and
so, you know, and so there's a lot,

02:10:57.430 --> 02:11:01.470
it's just these little fragments
and pulling it together,

02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:05.900
listening to what's involved in
terms of like other peoples' quoted

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.730
in songs, dances, oral account.

02:11:08.730 --> 02:11:12.630
Sometimes hearing it when we're not
doing research but maybe we're all

02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:16.140
at a protest together and we start
chatting, you know, or something.

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:21.510
So there's, yeah, there's
a lot there.

02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:25.130
[ Inaudible Comment ]

02:11:25.130 --> 02:11:29.330
&gt;&gt; So one pitfall I think I would
also add is, I would very, very,

02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:33.050
very strongly encourage, I can't
stress enough, when you're looking

02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:35.880
at these issues of indigenous
people, whatever it happens to be,

02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:37.870
talk to indigenous people.

02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:41.380
I've been involved in
too many situations

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:44.380
where the topic is something
involving Native Americans,

02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:47.480
it's a very specific issue too
Native American communities,

02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:50.130
and at the last second
a huge group of people,

02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:53.410
I mean 20-30 people are trying
to put together an event,

02:11:53.410 --> 02:11:56.570
maybe we should include a Native
American and they call you the day

02:11:56.570 --> 02:11:58.020
of or something like
or the day before,

02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.490
and you're like, and
yeah, you're one.

02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:02.490
You know, you're like
one person, you know,

02:12:02.490 --> 02:12:05.890
and there's this understanding,
yes, Native Americans are 2%

02:12:05.890 --> 02:12:08.320
of the population, there's
not like a whole lot of us,

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.320
and you know the capacity is not
always there, but we are there.

02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:14.650
And you will find someone that's
wiling to come and speak with you

02:12:14.650 --> 02:12:18.090
about these things and you know
there's going to be someone

02:12:18.090 --> 02:12:21.140
at that Nation or someone
that, you know, can connect you

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:24.270
to the right person to actually
get an indigenous perspective.

02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:27.760
Only doing it straight from
research and, you know,

02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:36.630
these often biased histories is not
the best way to go about things.

02:12:36.630 --> 02:12:39.340
&gt;&gt; I guess one thing I would
like to add having been

02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:42.510
on the Monacan Tribal
Council for about 12 years is

02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:48.150
that that very often academics and
people who want to get PhD's come

02:12:48.150 --> 02:12:53.640
to us with their projects and say,
can you help me, and they want us

02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:56.900
to help them put this dissertation
together, and then they're going

02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.740
to leave and we're never
going to see them again.

02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:03.640
And our attitude over time has
become, we really don't have time

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:08.790
to help you in the sense that,
what are you going to do in return?

02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:11.610
Are you going to build
a relationship with us

02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:13.440
that will be mutually beneficial

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.970
or are we just helping you
get your PhD and that's it?

02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:19.710
You know, and so often people
don't seem to understand

02:13:19.710 --> 02:13:22.550
that there should be
an exchange, you know,

02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:27.130 position:56%
or some group of well-meaning
people in our neighborhood will come

02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:30.480
and say, here's this project,
don't you think it's great,

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:31.780
we want you to approve of it.

02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:35.280
And they didn't' ask us to be
involved in it the planning

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.820
of the project or consider
whether it would be useful to us

02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:42.160
in terms of time as well.

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.210
So I think one of the things I
like to encourage people to do is,

02:13:46.210 --> 02:13:50.920
before you begin a project, develop
a relationship that is respectful

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:55.510
and it might benefit both parties
so that there is an actual dialog

02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:58.540
and that way everybody
feels included.

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:09.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; For me, thinking of what I do and
how to maybe encourage young people

02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:14.850 position:56%
out there may be watching this, that
maybe are interested in museums,

02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:20.860
there's a lot of great programs
and I remember when I was a kid,

02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.160
you know, I mean I didn't' think
I'd be working in a museum one day.

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:30.290 position:56%
That thought never really entered
into my mind, but I ended up working

02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:35.430
for a short time at our Pamunkey
Indian Museum and got interested

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:38.220
and got experience and
was able to come here,

02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:42.180
but if you're very
interested, definitely look

02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:48.210
at museum study programs, American
Indian study programs, yeah,

02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:57.950
and learn how to fill out job
applications [inaudible] jobs.

02:14:57.950 --> 02:15:00.960
That's really important.

02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.840
&gt;&gt; So the other question that I
had and it's kind of more, I guess,

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.720
a little bit more pointed
maybe and that is when I think

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:15.460 position:56%
about the history of Washington D.C.
and the history of the delegations

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:20.860
and diplomats coming into the
city over the past 200 plus years,

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:27.130 position:56%
all of them are coming to negotiate
treaties with the federal government

02:15:27.130 --> 02:15:31.910
but also making very
bold, very visible often,

02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:34.390
statements about sovereignty.

02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:36.670
When they do this, they're
not only making a statement

02:15:36.670 --> 02:15:41.160
of about the sovereignty of their
own nations and at the capital

02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.420
of the United States, but they're
also doing it on the homeland

02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:48.130
of the Piscataway people
and within a broader region.

02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:50.220
That makes Washington D.C.
a different kind of city

02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:54.850
and when we think about the urban
indigenous history of Seattle

02:15:54.850 --> 02:15:58.220
or Chicago or Detroit
or Minneapolis,

02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:02.820
that's a different history than
Washington and I just wonder what,

02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:06.350 position:56%
and I think you all have different
perspectives to offer on this issue,

02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:10.650
and I wonder what you
might think about that

02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:17.880
or what you might say about that?

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:19.180
&gt;&gt; Okay [laughing].

02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:23.380
Well, yeah, so here's to fast
forward a bit where, you know,

02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:27.500
I was talking earlier about some of
this really deep ancestral history,

02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:35.570
but given our location, that
has been absolutely integral,

02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:39.710
part and parcel of what did
happen, what has happened next

02:16:39.710 --> 02:16:45.200
and what continues to be
engaged with our community.

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:53.060 position:56%
We have really been in many ways
hosting these delegations coming in,

02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:56.000
the earliest ones that I
know my grandfather talked

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:03.010
about was relationships with people
coming into D.C. from the 1920's.

02:17:03.010 --> 02:17:06.770
This is where he started doing,
sometimes recordings with people.

02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:11.600
There was a few things that
actually there's cards for here,

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.310
but the sound recording was lost,

02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:19.770
but that's where there's just
been this incredible energy back

02:17:19.770 --> 02:17:21.070
and forth.

02:17:21.070 --> 02:17:24.590
I think that's probably been
a very key factor to the way

02:17:24.590 --> 02:17:27.770
that our community
really resuscitated,

02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:31.810
was because of our location,
because of Native people coming in,

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:36.500
our folks encountering them,
having them come to stay with us.

02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:40.920
I mean this was before people had
expense accounts and abilities

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:48.160 position:56%
to host from the 1920's through the
1940's with the founding of the NCAI

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:52.430
through the 1950's and
particularly in the late 1960's,

02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:57.850
a man maned Gene Shenandoah from
1970-71 came in as an advanced team

02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:03.630
for the American Indian Movement,
ran into my uncle at a diner,

02:18:03.630 --> 02:18:07.180
and they looked at each other
and they were like, hey.

02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:13.720
And that meant that
our folks went whole

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.460
in on the American Indian Movement.

02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:21.690
It meant that the couple
of people who hung

02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:26.670
on to the culture suddenly got very
energized, started to interact.

02:18:26.670 --> 02:18:29.810
They were at the [inaudible],
they were on the longest walk,

02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:32.630
then they started going out West,
started going to Sundance's.

02:18:32.630 --> 02:18:35.480
Our people started
intermarrying with people out West.

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:40.390
We were involved with the takeover
at Kinyonga up at Mohawk territory,

02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:42.560
going with people to
lobby at congress

02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:45.290
and then opening it
up hemispherically.

02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:49.490
So we have a lot of contacts with
Amazonian, Central Americans.

02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:51.050
We've married some of
those folks [laughing],

02:18:51.050 --> 02:18:53.390
had kids with some of those people.

02:18:53.390 --> 02:18:58.050
There's lot of like Turtle Island
Piscataways around and so I think,

02:18:58.050 --> 02:19:02.970 position:56%
yeah, that's been a huge factor back

02:19:02.970 --> 02:19:10.150
and forth even though there's not
a lot of us, that it really started

02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:16.390
to generate when we reincorporated
formally in 1974, we chose the date

02:19:16.390 --> 02:19:18.400
of the Battle of Little
Big Horn to do it.

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:24.510
So, you know, yeah, it's been
a very active relationship.

02:19:24.510 --> 02:19:30.070
[ Inaudible Comments ]

02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:31.650
&gt;&gt; So I think her perspective
is probably one

02:19:31.650 --> 02:19:35.440
of the more important ones,
since you are Piscataway.

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:41.250
It definitely is, you know, when
you come here it's often included

02:19:41.250 --> 02:19:44.200
in any type of dialogue that
you have or at least, you know,

02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:47.720
what I've seen of tribal leaders
talking to the federal government

02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:49.790
to remind them that
we're on Indian lands.

02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:51.800
That's always part
of the conversation,

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:54.300
is to remind them we're on
Indian lands because that kind

02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:56.480
of really stands for a lot.

02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:59.950
We're not here saying that, you
know, these old treaty rights

02:19:59.950 --> 02:20:02.450
or whatever, which I would like to
add, the constitution [inaudible],

02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:04.540 position:56%
so I never understand that argument.

02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:05.840
It's ridiculous.

02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:08.870
But to remind them that, you know,

02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:13.620 position:56%
the reason that the United States is
here is because of the Indian people

02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:15.730
that were and still are here.

02:20:15.730 --> 02:20:20.450
So I do think, you know, it's
great when people come in from

02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:23.330
out of town, and myself, I mean
the first thing you do is find

02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:24.630
a community.

02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:25.930
It's a little bit harder here.

02:20:25.930 --> 02:20:29.270
I actually lived and worked
in Minneapolis for a long time

02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:31.340
and that's where the American
Indian Movement was founded

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:35.090
and so we have a section and whole
area of town that's, you know,

02:20:35.090 --> 02:20:37.210
you go there and you're
going to see lots of people

02:20:37.210 --> 02:20:39.340
that you see all the time,
and you'll know exactly

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:40.640
that you're in your community.

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.940
It's a little bit different here.

02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:45.390
It's not nearly as visible.

02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:47.480
It's something where you
actually kind of have to have more

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.220
of a network of people to
figure out where you guys are.

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:54.190
It's a little bit harder,
and I think it kind of adds

02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:58.510
to making it a little bit more
difficult, I guess, being out here

02:20:58.510 --> 02:21:02.610
because where I'm from and where,
you know, a lot of us coming

02:21:02.610 --> 02:21:05.840
from like, you know, the Southwest,
or you know, the Pacific Northwest

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:09.750
or the Midwest, we're used
to a really strong community

02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:14.520
and here I think the community is
much, much smaller and, you know,

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:17.630
East Coast tribes are
a different situation.

02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:22.020 position:56%
You guys are in such a different
situation then we are but, you know,

02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:26.830
creating those relationships
is incredibly important, so.

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:32.610
&gt;&gt; Well I would say that our
people have had a different history

02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:35.750
and that we didn't come to
Washington to negotiate and that's

02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:38.500
because the only treaty I'm
aware of that we were involved

02:21:38.500 --> 02:21:42.050
with predates the establishment
of the United States.

02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:46.710
And by the time other tribes
were coming negotiate,

02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:51.410
our tribe was just hanging out in
the mountains trying to stay alive,

02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:55.860
but it was very interesting to me
because when the National Museum

02:21:55.860 --> 02:22:00.500 position:56%
of the American Indian opened, so
many native people came to take part

02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:04.900
in those events and our people were
among them, so they got to march

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:08.000
in the parade with all of
the other Indians nations

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.070
and to feel this incredible
validation and pride.

02:22:11.070 --> 02:22:13.540
It's the only time I ever
felt really comfortable

02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:18.220 position:56%
in Washington D.C. because there
was so many Indian people around us.

02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:24.420
So we have initiated more of a
dialog with other tribes and in

02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:29.340
so doing also initiated dialogs
with political organizations

02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:32.670
and have come here many,
many times on behalf

02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:36.770
of our federal recognition bill
which is still in Congress.

02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:46.380
&gt;&gt; It makes me think of, kind of
in a similar situation with Karenne

02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:50.670
where we're not federally
recognized but still I do know

02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:55.980
of some trips here to D.C. and
speeches that were given here

02:22:55.980 --> 02:23:00.780
in D.C. and also a major
issue that we've had

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:06.670
in Virginia is the Racial
Integrity Act, you know,

02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:12.210
it's a paper genocide where, you
know, we're not allowed to check

02:23:12.210 --> 02:23:15.590
that box of being Native
American, and I know a lot

02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:18.770
of Virginia native people
actually came here to D.C.

02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:24.960
to get married just to be able to,
you know, check that box to say,

02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.280
you know, on their
marriage certificate,

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:33.010
that they are Native Americans,
so that's definitely a big issue

02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:36.970
that still is having impact
today for Virginia native people.

02:23:36.970 --> 02:23:39.230
And also being here,
working here in D.C.,

02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:43.270 position:56%
it is always an interesting dynamic.

02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:47.940
Being at the museum, there's a
lot of Native visitors we see

02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:52.180
or even just somewhere around
in the city or suburb, you know,

02:23:52.180 --> 02:23:57.590
a lot of times we might see
Native people and just kind

02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:59.710
of like, hey where you from?

02:23:59.710 --> 02:24:04.360
So, you know, and help people
sometimes feel more comfortable,

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:07.560
you know, people that are maybe
just coming here or just here

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:12.700
for a short business trip
and for whatever reason,

02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:17.260
so it's always an interesting
dynamic as well, so.

02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:19.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want
to follow up on that.

02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:25.030
I mean that's, so this is a very,
I kind of mentioned it at the end

02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:29.680
and you guys were talking about
this, very distinctive to this area

02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:33.020
on the Atlantic seaboard,
Chesapeake in particular,

02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:38.780
is the documentary Erasure of
Native People on the record,

02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:42.820
so sometimes you'll see people
listed as Indians in the church

02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:48.730
on church records or in other
kinds of ethnic graphical records

02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:53.100
but on census, on being noted,
you know, free people of color,

02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:56.330
sometimes from one
census to the next

02:24:56.330 --> 02:24:59.200
or if a reservation was resolved,

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:03.770
once the reservations were
dissolved either legally

02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:09.920
or generally illegally, you see the
change of designation from Indian

02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:12.840
to free people of color,
free color, free negro.

02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:17.640
And then, of course, like
you were saying in Virginia,

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:22.700 position:56%
the category of Indian was outlawed,
it was prohibited until Loving

02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:25.930
versus Virginia in 1967 with
the Racial Integrity Act.

02:25:25.930 --> 02:25:29.020
It's astounding, so those
are the other things,

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:32.810
it's like you may be looking at
records that are Indian records,

02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:37.030 position:56%
but they don't appear that way
because you have to make a leap back

02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:40.480
to an earlier document to
then trace it back forward,

02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:43.960
so it's, you know, it's tricky.

02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:48.680
&gt;&gt; We do have time for a
question or two from the audience

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.920
if anyone would like to ask
questions of our panelists.

02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:01.370
&gt;&gt; Would you explain what you meant

02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:05.030
by racial genocide, I
mean paper genocide?

02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:08.510
&gt;&gt; So the question is, can
you explain by paper genocide?

02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:18.410
[ Multiple Speakers ]

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:21.350
&gt;&gt; Karenne Wood: We refer
to a specific instance

02:26:21.350 --> 02:26:27.230 position:56%
where a guy named Dr. Walter Plecker
and some of his colleagues managed

02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:32.060
to lobby for the passage for
the Racial Integrity Act in 1924

02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:35.730
which made it a felony for a
person of color to marry a person

02:26:35.730 --> 02:26:39.790
that was considered white and
Plecker mounted a campaign

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:42.350 position:56%
against Native people in particular,

02:26:42.350 --> 02:26:45.030
correcting he thought
their birth certificate

02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:50.910
so they did not say Indian and so
he changed their identification

02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:55.580
racially to colored to
free issue or a number

02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:59.930
of different terms had popularity
over the four decades he was

02:26:59.930 --> 02:27:04.330
in power which effectively erased
the Native people of the region.

02:27:04.330 --> 02:27:07.950
So when we say paper genocide
or documentary genocide,

02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:13.770
he wiped out whole groups of
people in policy and on paper

02:27:13.770 --> 02:27:17.680
where they continue to exist
but not with the identification

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.250
that they had for themselves.

02:27:22.770 --> 02:27:27.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to me there is one
other piece of paper genocide

02:27:27.570 --> 02:27:30.060
that is still very much an issue
today, which is [inaudible].

02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:34.880 position:56%
So when you meet a lot of people and
they ask, you know, what are you,

02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:37.390
after I tell them I I'm a person,
I explain, yes, I'm Native American

02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:41.590
and often people will
just say how much?

02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:45.180
Which people don't understand,
that's incredibly offensive right.

02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.640
I'm fully Native American, I'm 100
percent a citizen of my nation,

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:53.770 position:56%
but that mentality comes from the
Policy of [inaudible] and so it has,

02:27:53.770 --> 02:28:00.100
you know, there's a very, very set
idea to bleed Indians out, right.

02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:03.770
That was kind of like the federal
government's intent was let's say

02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:06.630
that you're not Indian
unless you're this much blood

02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:09.170
because we're are going to decide
just randomly, you're 100 percent,

02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:12.200
like so for instance my
own family, we have members

02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:13.500
that are the same generation

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:14.800
but somehow they all have
different blood [inaudible]

02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.330
because of how dark they were.

02:28:16.330 --> 02:28:18.000
I mean, that is a really
common thing.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.320
So it's those kind of politics,
once you're down to that, you know,

02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:25.240
quarter or eighth or
whatever it happens to be,

02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:26.730
then you're not Indian anymore.

02:28:26.730 --> 02:28:30.080
And to me that's absolutely
paper genocide and it's something

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.770
that a lot of our nations
are struggling with.

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:34.410
My own, we don't have
blood [inaudible],

02:28:34.410 --> 02:28:37.450
but we still have a little blood
[inaudible] on our cards still

02:28:37.450 --> 02:28:39.660
to remind you that you're
only this much Indian.

02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:43.740
And it's become a really
serious issue as far

02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:46.320
as maintaining the memberships
that we have we have.

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.100
I mean many nations are very small

02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:53.440
and if you can't marry outside your
own nation or you know if you have

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.350 position:56%
to meet a certain amount of whatever
the federal government said all

02:28:56.350 --> 02:29:01.530
those generations ago, it becomes a
real significant problem survival.

02:29:03.310 --> 02:29:05.510
&gt;&gt; I see one more question
over here.

02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:20.510
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:27.610
[ Background Sounds ]

02:29:27.610 --> 02:29:33.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, as I was mentioning earlier,
there is some work being done,

02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:37.390
you know, just recently
with our Pamunkey language.

02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:41.580
It's very similar to
Piscataway, and you could hear

02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.960
when she was saying
some of the words,

02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:46.750
you know, how similar they are.

02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:48.340
So there is some work.

02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:54.800
It's not, you know, fluently spoken
by anyone now, but, you know,

02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:59.900
with this work there have been some
classes recently on the reservation

02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:03.990
as well, so there's a little
work being done on that.

02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:07.790
And also in my house with my wife.

02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:15.300
My wife also is Pawnee, so
sometime she'll get out some things

02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:19.990
and we'll start practicing
and teaching our son as well.

02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:24.690
So yeah, it's going on.

02:30:24.690 --> 02:30:29.900
&gt;&gt; I would encourage you to
download the Nichi app also.

02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:33.230
That's [inaudible] of an
application to, you know,

02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:34.550
have basically a pocket dictionary.

02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:41.040 position:56%
So language revitalization is very
serious, you know, across the board.

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.260
Every nation is fully aware of it.

02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:46.290
There are a lot of congressional
members and currently we have,

02:30:46.290 --> 02:30:49.630
you know, Senator Tester is
actually really supportive

02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:52.830
of dedicating funding
to immerging schools,

02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:55.270
to including Native
American curriculum,

02:30:55.270 --> 02:30:56.570
you know, in public schools.

02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:59.810
They are Native Americans going to
public schools, there's lots of us.

02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:02.170
Most of us go to public schools.

02:31:02.170 --> 02:31:06.810
I did. There's actually,
if you also want to look,

02:31:06.810 --> 02:31:09.590
there's a [inaudible]
online dictionary.

02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:12.820
The efforts to preserve the
languages are still here.

02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:15.660
We are fortunate to have
lots of fluent speakers.

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.800
It's always so sad when
you hear about people

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:19.420
that don't have fluent
speakers left.

02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:22.960
But language legalization is
absolutely happening and I think,

02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:24.950
you know, Hawaii is a
really great example

02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:27.940
of seeing incredible
success by, you know,

02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:29.250
accommodation of immerging schools

02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:31.080
and developing these
modern applications

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:32.590
to children speaking
the language again

02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:39.930
and get their parents speaking
the language with them, so.

02:31:39.930 --> 02:31:41.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that question.

02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:45.030
I think saving our languages
is so important because the way

02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:48.220
that we think is embodied in
the way that we talk, you know,

02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:52.660
and how we translate the world
through the words that we use,

02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:55.950
so it's really essential
that we retain our languages

02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:59.480
if we still have them or try
to bring them back if we don't.

02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:02.870
In the face of my people, the
Monacan people, our language,

02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:06.550
the closest related language,
which is called [inaudible]

02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:09.850
and it was actually
documented in Canada after some

02:32:09.850 --> 02:32:13.050
of our people went there
and affiliated themselves

02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:17.570
with the Haudenosaunee Iroquois
people and it was documented there,

02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:22.950 position:56%
so my PhD is actually in linguistic
anthropology and that's the language

02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:27.300
that I'm working with, trying to
ascertain what is most important

02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:30.820
to my people about
brining that language back

02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:34.510
so that once we began a
language revitalization program,

02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:37.610
we'll be able to target
the areas they most want

02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:39.910
to learn about effectively.

02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:43.830
And what we've learned is that
they really want to be able to pray

02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:49.010 position:56%
because they feel like that is their
natural language that corresponds

02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:54.170
to our homeland geography and to
the ancestors that have died there.

02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:58.550
And we do our reburial ceremonies
which we've done 4 of them,

02:32:58.550 --> 02:33:01.780
they want to be able to talk
to the ancestors in the words

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:04.080
that they would recognize.

02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:12.420 position:56%

John to come up and say a few words,

thanking these amazing panelists.

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:49.030
and I'm here to represent
the Kluge Center.

02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:53.060
The mission of the Kluge Center, in
case somebody didn't say it before,

02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:56.530
is to bring together scholars and
researchers from around the world

02:33:56.530 --> 02:33:59.700
to stimulate and energize
one another, to steal wisdom

02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:01.810
from the library's rich
resources, and to interact

02:34:01.810 --> 02:34:03.660
with policymakers of the public.

02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:07.140
And I think what we've seen here
today is just a great example

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:10.330
of that actually happening
with a researcher

announcement about the program.

a program sponsored or run

a tour of the great hall

02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:42.080

indigenous tribal law portal, but
before the demonstration begins,

02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:38.520
I want to take a few moments
to make some brief comments

02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:41.360
about the importance of the
project, especially in light

02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:43.620
of Native American Heritage month.

02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:46.630 position:56%
It's probably obvious that the
indigenous law portal will provide a

02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:50.700
valuable resource and tool
for analysts and academics,

02:35:50.700 --> 02:35:53.800
practitioners and students
of both federal Indian law

02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:58.270
and federal Indian policy as
well as tribal law and policy.

02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.930
Well, and as an attorney
who has worked in the field

02:36:01.930 --> 02:36:05.300
of federal Indian law for quite
some time, I can speak directly

02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:09.700
to the value of the portal as a
resource that will provide access

02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:12.070
to an array of tribal
laws and documents

02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:13.960
that are necessary for that work.

02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:17.410
But, I also want to highlight
and speak more about the value

02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:21.380
of the portal outside of the
practice of law and outside

02:36:21.380 --> 02:36:23.700
of scholarship on tribal
law and policy.

02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:27.010
Since the portal will
provide an outstanding vehicle

02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:31.980 position:56%
for generally educating people about
Indian tribes and Native Americans.

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:34.310
As many of you many
know, Native Americans

02:36:34.310 --> 02:36:38.290
and Indian tribes are often
viewed as historical entities.

02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:41.550
Part of American history that
is taught in schools as relics

02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:46.110
of the past such as sharing food
with the Pilgrims at Thanksgiving,

02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:51.210 position:56%
but people are not often taught
that Indian tribes continue to exist

02:36:51.210 --> 02:36:55.170
as sovereign nations with
governments and judicial systems

02:36:55.170 --> 02:36:59.840 position:56%
that create, enforce, and adjudicate
their laws within the nations.

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:03.580
This portal, however, will
provide a tool for educating people

02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:06.330
about Indian tribes as
they currently exist

02:37:06.330 --> 02:37:08.460
and as they currently operate.

02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:12.210
This portal will show that tribes
have constitutions and laws

02:37:12.210 --> 02:37:16.020
that are created and amended as
the tribes continue to develop

02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.910
and deal with modern day issues.

02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:22.130
This portal will also show that
tribes have legislative branches

02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:26.790
that inact ordinances, regulations,
and laws and executive branches

02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:30.200
that enforce the laws, and judicial
branches that interpret the laws

02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:33.310
and make decisions that set
precedence for the tribes.

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:36.790
This portal will allow people to
access not only documents relating

02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:40.880
to Indian land sessions in
the 1700s and 1800s but also

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:44.300
to the 2013 amended constitution
of the Seminole Nation

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:46.490
of Oklahoma demonstrating

02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:49.680
that Indian tribes are not
historical entities locked

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.060
in the past but vibrant and
current, self-governing nations

02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:56.930
that importantly contribute
to American society.

&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Let me add
my welcome to Carrie's welcome.

02:38:19.350 --> 02:38:21.580
My name is Roberta Shaffer,
and I have the pleasure

02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:24.570
of serving currently as
the acting Law Librarian.

02:38:24.570 --> 02:38:27.540
We didn't confer on our
notes, but we should have

02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:31.760
because basically my prepared
remarks track Carrie's almost

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:34.690
to a t. And therefore,
it shows, well,

02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:38.210
I'm going to say not
so much great minds.

02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:43.300
This is so obvious and so
important that you don't have

02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:46.600
to have a great mind to see

02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:51.730
that this project is truly
breaking new ground for the Library

02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:55.480
of Congress and serves
so many purposes,

02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:58.610
not the least of which
is the proof of concept

02:38:58.610 --> 02:39:01.860
that Native American
tribes are alive and well

02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:04.470
in organic legal systems just

02:39:04.470 --> 02:39:08.640
like any other legal
jurisdiction in the world today.

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.380
But the beauty of the portal
is really multifaceted.

02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:15.500
First and foremost, I want
to say that for the Library

02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:19.870
of the Congress, it represents
a change in the way that we look

02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:26.790
at the entire classification
concept, and so for that alone,

02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:32.260
I applaud the woman who has really
born all of the bricks and mortar

02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:34.390
for that, and that is
Dr. Yolanda Goldberg,

02:39:34.390 --> 02:39:35.690
who is sitting in the audience.

02:39:35.690 --> 02:39:37.230
I don't know if you can pan her,

02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:40.510
but let us all just flatter
her with some applause.

02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:45.040
[ Applause ]

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.630
She, with the permission of
Beacher Wiggins, the head of one

02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:51.510
of the major sections
of library services,

02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:55.480
conceived of this ideology,
this concept of moving

02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:00.680
from a historical approach
to a geopolitical approach

02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:06.100 position:56%
to organizing the information and
then going that next step of linking

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:09.450
to external websites and sources

02:40:09.450 --> 02:40:15.440
so that a person can really almost
do a one-stop shop by, believe it

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:18.380
or not, using a classification
system.

02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:23.660
And so today we are really
marking a moment in which the idea

02:40:23.660 --> 02:40:29.410 position:56%
of the word classification system to
describe accessed information goes

02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:33.090
out the window and we
now finally can say

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:36.280
that classification is
a roadmap, is a guide,

02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:38.800
is a handbook for knowledge.

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.080
So I applaud Yolanda and Tina Gein
[phonetic] who worked with her

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.220
from the law library
originally, and now the 2 people

02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:51.780
who will be actually
demonstrating the portal for you

02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:56.900
from the library staff, and that
is Robert Brammer-I'm just looking

02:40:56.900 --> 02:41:00.290
down at my paper because I don't
want to get his title wrong-and

02:41:00.290 --> 02:41:06.440
so he is Senior Legal Reference
Specialist, and Jennifer Gonzalez

02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:11.220
who is an information
analyst in the library.

02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:15.080
The final thing that I do want
to say also about the value

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.140
of this port is, that it enables
one of the greatest assets

02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:23.660
of the Library of Congress as
a clearinghouse of knowledge,

02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:27.510
and that is that not only
does one now have access

02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:33.810
to the Seminole 2013
Constitutional Amendments,

02:41:33.810 --> 02:41:37.300
but there's an opportunity
to now compare among

02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:41.050
and between the documents
of indigenous peoples

02:41:41.050 --> 02:41:44.930
and other sovereign
nations all over the world.

02:41:44.930 --> 02:41:49.210
And this is as truly important
thing in today's times

02:41:49.210 --> 02:41:53.880
where no legal system exists as
an island an all legal systems

02:41:53.880 --> 02:42:00.400 position:56%
and all peoples of the world want to
compare and contrast their cultures,

02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:06.220
their commercial way of
life, their community habits,

02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:11.490
their civilizations to those
of the past, of the present,

02:42:11.490 --> 02:42:14.660
and by way of these
portals to the future.

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:18.220
So thank you for stepping
into the future with us,

02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:22.430
Dr. Yolanda Goldberg, and the rest
of you who are here this afternoon.

02:42:22.430 --> 02:42:25.510
And without further ado,
Robert and Jennifer.

[ Background Sounds ]

02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:46.510
&gt;&gt; Robert Brammer: Okay,
I'll bring up the site.

02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:48.140
Okay, let me start by saying,

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:51.290
researching indigenous
law can be very difficult.

02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:54.060
Often, the only source of the
materials, current materials,

02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:55.960
is the tribes themselves.

02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.840 position:56%
And if you're looking for historical
materials, they're often spread

02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:01.900
around many different sites.

02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:05.730
So to approach this challenge, the
indigenous law portal is organized

02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:08.950
around Dr. Goldberg's K
classification system.

02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:11.910
Providing a portal that
combines the Library

02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:14.490
of Congress's vast
historical resources

02:43:14.490 --> 02:43:18.030
with particularly historic
constitutions, charters,

02:43:18.030 --> 02:43:20.800
and codes with links to
current sources of law

02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:22.680
from the tribes themselves.

02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:27.670
That said, I want to mention what
the portal is not do is identify

02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:30.090
every single law that's
applicable to a given tribe.

02:43:30.090 --> 02:43:32.590
That's beyond the scope
of the project.

02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:35.860
The indigenous law portal
is integrated into law.gov,

02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:37.690
the Law Library of Congress site,

02:43:37.690 --> 02:43:42.650
and it initially focused
on the United States.

02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:45.580
We've branched out
to Canada and Mexico

02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:48.460
and in the future it
will incorporate laws

02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:52.310
and regulations effecting Native
Americans, particularly treaties

02:43:52.310 --> 02:43:54.690
and acts from the U.S.
statues at large.

02:43:54.690 --> 02:44:00.720
The metadata provided in
the portal is very detailed,

02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:05.260
built around Dr. Goldberg's
classification schedule.

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:07.610
And I want to go ahead and
illustrate that by clicking

02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:16.570
on Canada and going to Ontario
and now I'm going to bring

02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:21.510
up the source of the page.

02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:49.100
[ Background Sounds ]

02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:52.820
So I'm scrolling down
to illustrate this.

02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:58.030
So here you have the name of a
tribe and then you have the div ID

02:44:58.030 --> 02:45:01.010
which provides the
classification for the tribe source

02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:02.920
from Dr. Golderberg's work.

02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.320
So that's how imbedded the metadata
is, the classification schedule,

02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.120
and the metadata of the site.

02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:31.350
[ Background Sounds ]

02:45:31.350 --> 02:45:33.650
Sorry. Just going back here.

02:45:35.230 --> 02:45:40.380
Okay, so let's talk about
how you use the portal.

02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:43.400
First you choose a country.

02:45:47.090 --> 02:45:52.060
I'm not sure why I'm not
getting a map loading here.

02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:53.600
I apologize for that.

02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:55.700
We've got this great clickable maps
that were provided by [inaudible]

02:45:55.700 --> 02:45:59.650
that allow you to just click
on a state and go directly

02:45:59.650 --> 02:46:03.680
to that state's materials
and the tribes represented

02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:05.720 position:56%
within the boundaries of that state.

02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:08.810
So at the top, we've
got general resources

02:46:08.810 --> 02:46:10.950
for indigenous legal materials.

02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:15.430
And if you scroll down, those
resources include gateways,

02:46:15.430 --> 02:46:21.350
directories, research guides,
topic-specific resources

02:46:21.350 --> 02:46:25.120
such as here you see
like economic law.

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:31.390
You've also got links to NGOs,
IGOs, and indigenous organizations.

02:46:31.390 --> 02:46:39.510 position:56%
Below that, you've got a link to Dr.
Goldberg's classification schedule

02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:49.130
and the table of contents for
this is actually clickable.

02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:54.740
So you can choose the location
that you're interested in

02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:58.380
and then see the classifications
associated with that location.

02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:05.460
Below that, you have a link to the
digitized historical constitutions

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:06.760
as a separate collection.

02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:10.950
These are also represented
throughout the site

02:47:10.950 --> 02:47:13.960
with the tribe they're
associated with.

02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:17.900
And then below that, you
have links to tribes.

02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:21.150
You can browse tribes
by region, state,

02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:23.730
and also an alphabetical listing.

02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:35.190
So I'm going to go ahead and
go to state and choose Oklahoma

02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:40.780
to illustrate some of the
resources that we have on the site.

02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:47.430
I'm going to choose the
Cherokee Nation and I'm going

02:47:47.430 --> 02:47:52.220
to choose the constitution and laws
of the Cherokee Nation from 1875.

02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:57.990
So this is an example of one
of the historical resources

02:47:57.990 --> 02:48:00.440
from the Library of Congress
that has been digitized.

02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.710
I find this one particularly
interesting

02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:08.680
because it's actually
written in Cherokee.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.120
Here we go.

02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:17.120
I want to mention that not
everything on the site is written

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.320
in the, you know, the
tribe's language.

02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.840
So there's a lot of resources that
even if you can't read the language

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:23.210
that you can certainly make use of,

02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:25.930
but I just found this particular
interesting as an example of one

02:48:25.930 --> 02:48:32.260
of the historical resources
on the site.

02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:43.180
Okay, next I'm going to go
to Washington and I'm going

02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:46.300
to choose the [inaudible] Tribe.

02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:58.800
And this is just an example of
how we link to current sources

02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:04.170 position:56%
of a tribe's law by linking directly
to their website and also below

02:49:04.170 --> 02:49:07.090
that you see the [inaudible]
order code.

02:49:07.090 --> 02:49:10.220
This is actually hosted by one
of the partners that we link

02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:13.510
to to flush out the site, the
National Indian Law Library.

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:30.960
[ Background Sounds ]

02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:41.000 position:56%
Okay. Now, I'm going to Alaska and
specifically the Twin Hills Village.

02:49:45.250 --> 02:49:48.310
And this is just another
example of how we're looking

02:49:48.310 --> 02:49:51.940
for current sources of law we link
directly to the tribes themselves,

02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:55.940
making the sites easy to find
by organizing in the portal.

02:49:57.750 --> 02:50:04.290
So I want to mention that this
product is a collaboration both

02:50:04.290 --> 02:50:07.760
within and outside of the wall
of the Library of Congress.

02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:11.890 position:56%

Consortium all were essential

02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:29.390
to the success of this project.

02:50:29.390 --> 02:50:32.520
We encourage feedback from
all of our stakeholders

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.070
and we've already incorporated
feedback

02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:37.140
that we've received into the site.

02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:39.570

America are our next projects

02:50:39.570 --> 02:50:42.490
for inclusion into the portal.

02:50:42.490 --> 02:50:45.550 position:56%
And with that, I'm going to turn it
over to Jennifer who's going to talk

02:50:45.550 --> 02:50:49.360
about law.gov's resources for
American Indian legal materials.

02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:51.510

02:51:04.970 --> 02:51:09.840
Out front, if you have not
received it, we have little handout

02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:13.970
that has all of the URL's that
we've been talking about today,

02:51:13.970 --> 02:51:18.030
including the indigenous law portal
URL which happens to be quite long,

02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:22.600
because we want, we have to fit
into the website, so what I wanted

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.050
to do is to start off by
showing you an easy way to get

02:51:25.050 --> 02:51:26.990
to the indigenous law portal.

02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:31.980
The easiest way is to type in
law.gov and that will bring you

02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:35.140
to the Law Library's home page.

02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:39.260
Scrolling down slightly you'll
see this guide to law online

with the law square, indigenous
right here is in purple.

02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:46.520
That'll bring you directly
to the indigenous law guide.

02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:51.390 position:56%
This is the easiest way to get there
instead of typing in that long,

02:51:51.390 --> 02:51:55.220
this long URL that you see up here.

02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:58.410
The law library's website also
has several other resources,

02:51:58.410 --> 02:52:01.380
some of these resources we
are trying to include and some

02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:05.920
of them are proving a little
difficult so we're working on them

02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:08.650
but we want to be able to
show you all the resources

02:52:08.650 --> 02:52:12.540 position:56%
that the Law Library of Congress and
Library of Congress has available

02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:14.510
for indigenous legal materials.

02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:23.040
[ Background Sounds ]

02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:28.500
So headed back to the homepage, we
have law.gov, and scrolling down,

02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:31.450
I said that under this
guide to online is

02:52:31.450 --> 02:52:34.380
where the indigenous
law portal is housed.

02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:38.410
The guide to online also
has many other materials

02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:40.190
that could be helpful.

02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:45.230
If you click on nations,
you'll see that every nation

02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:46.900 position:56%
in the world is represented in here.

02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:49.690
This is a great place
to start for any sort

02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:53.850
of research on any other nation.

02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:58.470
And U.S. Federal is specifically

02:52:58.470 --> 02:53:01.530
where we have other
American Indian material

02:53:01.530 --> 02:53:03.580
that has not been incorporated.

02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:06.550
If I scroll down, you'll
see that we have an Indians

02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:13.710
of North America guide and this
is for U.S. Federal law that has,

02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:17.930
the indigenous law guide is
for indigenous legal materials.

02:53:17.930 --> 02:53:20.510
Legal material that are Native
to those indigenous nations,

02:53:20.510 --> 02:53:24.470
but the U.S. has also created
lots of legal material in regards

02:53:24.470 --> 02:53:29.690
to the Native Americans
population that live

02:53:29.690 --> 02:53:30.990
within the geographical borders.

02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:34.020
And so this is what this
material here is for.

02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:38.200
We have text, commentary, different
links to different agencies

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:40.510
and again another guide to
the indigenous law portal.

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:46.130
[ Background Sounds ]

02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:51.150
We are hoping to include many of
this material into the portal soon,

02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:55.780
but for now this is where it's
housed in sort of the same area.

02:53:55.780 --> 02:54:06.630
Headed back to law.gov, again to
the homepage and scrolling down,

02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:11.560
below the guide to online is
our section of legal reports.

02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:17.600
The Law Library writes reports
primarily for congress and if I go

02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:20.710
to the comprehensive
index we can see some

02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:25.440
of this report is written
actually on indigenous material.

02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:30.980
These are the four reports so
far that we have on our website

02:54:30.980 --> 02:54:33.330
about indigenous material.

02:54:33.330 --> 02:54:35.900
This one in particular
is quite interesting.

02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:37.970
It's the preservation
of historical cemeteries

02:54:37.970 --> 02:54:42.910
and it includes some
information on the United States.

02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:47.370
So clicking on the name of
the report brought us here

02:54:47.370 --> 02:54:51.720
to the report page and then
in this table of contents box,

02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:57.290 position:56%
clicking on the United States brings
up some of the United States portion

02:54:57.290 --> 02:55:00.910
of the report that was written
discussing of the preservation

02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:10.780 position:56%
of the historical cemeteries in the
U.S. Okay, scrolling back to the top

02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:18.320
and headed back to law.gov.

02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:22.380
Also from our homepage, if we
click on research and reports,

02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:26.920
I'm going to head a little bit
farther deeper into the website

02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:29.340
so that you can see more
of our materials that might

02:55:29.340 --> 02:55:32.030
or maybe hidden in there.

02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:35.030
The first one here, again we
clicked on research and reports

02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:37.460
of commemorative observances.

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:41.030
This is a collection of
materials that is all

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:44.840
about just different commemorative
observances that we have

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:51.100
in the U.S., one of them being the
American Indian Heritage month.

02:55:52.750 --> 02:55:57.480
We have an overview of the
month, legislative branch,

02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:02.540
executive branch documents, and web
resources specifically on, again,

02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:07.700 position:56%
the Native American heritage month
again these proclamations will bring

02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:09.500
you to a pdf.

02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:21.040
[ Background Sounds ]

02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:22.340
Excuse me [laughing].

02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:26.990
Okay, our pdf that is the
proclamation from the president

02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:33.380
about the National American Indian
Heritage Month in the year 2007.

02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:36.160
So while the portal is a
one stop shop, excuse me.

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:39.530
Well the portal is a one stop shop

02:56:39.530 --> 02:56:41.520
for all the indigenous
legal materials,

02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:45.700
again this is another place
where we have materials

02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:47.790
that don't exactly
fit into the confines

02:56:47.790 --> 02:56:52.910
of the portal that
we wanted to show.

02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:57.850
Okay, law.gov again,
research and reports,

02:56:57.850 --> 02:57:02.920
and then here we have
some digitized material.

02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:06.820 position:56%
This first link, American Indian
Constitutions and Legal Materials is

02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:09.290
where all of those links that
Robert was showing you before

02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:11.950
from the portal, where they live.

02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:18.370
Again we have a clickable
map for different regions.

02:57:18.370 --> 02:57:24.520
And this is the South.

02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.910
This is our earliest
material and it starts

02:57:27.910 --> 02:57:30.880
with 1810 in the Cherokee Nation.

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:34.820
This is also the place where you
can find the material [inaudible]

02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:40.870
of language of the tribe or
the [inaudible] of the tribe.

02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:46.060
And we have it noted here
by saying, in Cherokee

02:57:46.060 --> 02:57:52.010
or we several different
ones, there's one in Choctaw,

02:57:52.010 --> 02:58:00.220
and so you can download
this pdf and quickly view.

02:58:00.220 --> 02:58:03.370
There you go.

02:58:03.370 --> 02:58:05.510
And quickly view the document.

02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:16.040
[ Silence ]

02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:20.730
Okay, I'll go back to the South
and scroll down to where we were.

02:58:26.230 --> 02:58:32.050
Our historical materials continue
on through the 1950's-1960's

02:58:32.050 --> 02:58:35.360
with these constitutions
and corporate charters.

02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:38.670
These two materials happen to
be in several different places

02:58:38.670 --> 02:58:43.860
on the internet, but these
are pdfs that we've digitized

02:58:43.860 --> 02:58:46.470
from the Library of
Congress's collection.

02:58:46.470 --> 02:58:52.920
There are also some gems in
here for these older materials.

02:58:52.920 --> 02:58:59.650
[inaudible] I'm going
to search for this one.

02:58:59.650 --> 02:59:06.120
We have some ordinances that I
have found extremely interesting

02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:09.530
and continue to find interesting
as I keep going through.

02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:14.490
This is ordinances of this town.

02:59:14.490 --> 02:59:18.830
We can just look at some of
the different titles here.

02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:22.490
You have an ordinance
about dead animals.

02:59:22.490 --> 02:59:24.470
Yep [laughing].

02:59:24.470 --> 02:59:30.980
Many different ones, in regard to
dogs, taxes, oh, I haven't found--

02:59:30.980 --> 02:59:36.500
my favorite one is up here.

02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:37.800
Where is it?

02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:45.110
Oh no. There we go, this
is one of my favorite ones.

02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:53.130
Bean shooting [inaudible]
for boys only.

02:59:53.130 --> 02:59:56.330
They were not concerned
about girls, it seems.

02:59:56.330 --> 03:00:02.050
And no destroying of
bird nests [laughing].

03:00:02.050 --> 03:00:12.970
So this is one of my favorite
documents that we have.

03:00:12.970 --> 03:00:23.490
I wanted to make sure I showed you.

03:00:23.490 --> 03:00:29.390
Okay, now back to research and
reports and digitized material.

03:00:29.390 --> 03:00:31.260 position:56%
I'm going to continue going through.

03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:35.590
We have some collections from
the Law Library of Congress here,

03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:39.350
but we also have Statues at
Large and United States Treaties.

03:00:39.350 --> 03:00:42.890
These are two collections
that we are working

03:00:42.890 --> 03:00:47.280 position:56%
on increasing what we have available
currently, but here at the Statues

03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:51.670
at Large you are able to access
all of the historical statues

03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:56.850
at large from 1776 through 1950.

03:00:56.850 --> 03:01:00.660
Some of them are available
by chapter which means

03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:04.460
that you'll be able to look at
each of the individual titles

03:01:04.460 --> 03:01:09.330
and control F to find
those titles a lot quicker.

03:01:09.330 --> 03:01:18.370
I'm going to go to Congress
21 and you can see that each

03:01:18.370 --> 03:01:21.910
of these titles here
with an individual pdf.

03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:25.520
So up here at the top you can
download the full congress

03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:27.790
or you can download
the small pdf's here

03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:30.430
that would just get you
the chapter or the law

03:01:30.430 --> 03:01:32.590
that you are really looking for.

03:01:32.590 --> 03:01:44.260
I'm going to scroll down to chapter
148 to give an example of one

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:47.730
of the Indian Laws that we have.

03:01:47.730 --> 03:01:49.910
This is an act to provide
of an exchange of lands

03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:53.080
with the Indians residing of
any of the states or territories

03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:56.390
and for the removal
west of the Mississippi.

03:01:56.390 --> 03:02:00.540 position:56%
This is the Indian Removal Act that,
they didn't call it that back then,

03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:03.970
but this is was the actual title
for that, and so by clicking

03:02:03.970 --> 03:02:10.050
on this pdf, you will be able
to open up and directly read

03:02:10.050 --> 03:02:12.510
that statue starting here.

03:02:12.510 --> 03:02:22.040
[ Background Sounds ]

03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:25.960
Sorry, I'm going back to the
Statue, I forgot to show that each

03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:29.450
of these statues, the advantage of
breaking up each of these statues

03:02:29.450 --> 03:02:37.160
by title means that we are able to
individually put metadata into each

03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:43.080
of these statues so that they are
available to be searched exactly.

03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:48.380
So for instance, this statue about
the Indians Removal Act had all

03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:50.970
of these terms here applied to it,

03:02:50.970 --> 03:02:54.600
so the search on the libraries
main page putting in any

03:02:54.600 --> 03:03:03.040
of these terms will get
you straight to this act.

03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:04.920
Okay and I also mentioned treaties.

03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:09.750
These are the treaties that
the United States assigned

03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:11.400
with other nations.

03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:15.910
This treaties series so far does
not include any of the treaties

03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:19.320
that the United States has signed
with American Indian Nations.

03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:21.450
Those were in a separate
volume of Statues at Large

03:03:21.450 --> 03:03:25.080
that we are currently
working on very hard to get

03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:27.080
up as quickly as possible.

03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:28.840
But we have these treaties
currently,

03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:33.310
which will show some international
treaties that have happened

03:03:33.310 --> 03:03:36.800
that have to do with
American Indians

03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:40.030
or Native peoples of anywhere.

03:03:40.030 --> 03:03:47.230
So typing in Indian brings
us a search to this Inter-

03:03:47.230 --> 03:03:53.930
American Indian Institute and
clicking on this pdf will show

03:03:53.930 --> 03:04:01.290 position:56%
that this is something that has been
signed in 1940 and it was trying

03:04:01.290 --> 03:04:04.430
to create an Inter-American
Indian Institute.

03:04:06.510 --> 03:04:15.000
Okay, there's one more historical
source that I wanted to mention.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:23.980
Let's close out some of these tabs,
And I'm going to go back to law.gov

03:04:23.980 --> 03:04:30.520
and click on find legal resources.

03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:33.010
Legislative resources.

03:04:33.010 --> 03:04:37.910
Again this link is quite long,
but the URL is in your handout

03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:41.200
and century of law making is here.

03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:46.420
This is still the Library
of Congress website

03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:52.880
and it has the first hundred
years of legal documents here.

03:04:52.880 --> 03:04:59.080
So many different things, bills,
statues at large, journals.

03:04:59.080 --> 03:05:03.180
I'm going to click here
to the Annals of Congress.

03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:10.490
This is what is the current
congressional record or precursor

03:05:10.490 --> 03:05:14.030 position:56%
to the current congressional record,
which means all of the things

03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:17.760
that congress has said
or went on in that day.

03:05:17.760 --> 03:05:27.570
If I browse the page headings and
go to I and scroll down a little,

03:05:27.570 --> 03:05:30.710
we have, these are all
of the different topics

03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:38.230 position:56%
of what congress spoke about in
regards to Indians during this time.

03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:44.990
So for example I will click on
Indian fur trade in the Senate.

03:05:44.990 --> 03:05:48.820
They've spoken about this 5
times and so clicking on one

03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:54.550
of these will bring you directly
to the page that they talked

03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:56.920
about the Indian fur trade.

03:05:56.920 --> 03:06:03.690
So that's it for historical
documents that we have

03:06:03.690 --> 03:06:08.860
from the Library of Congress and
now we have some current documents.

03:06:08.860 --> 03:06:13.350
And I have that, that we are
going to go to congress.gov.

03:06:13.350 --> 03:06:20.310
This is available in multiple
places in our website but typing

03:06:20.310 --> 03:06:22.600
in congress.gov works just as well

03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:25.120
and brings you here
to this main page.

03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:28.520
The easiest way to get to
the indigenous materials

03:06:28.520 --> 03:06:31.190
that we have here is

to subject policy area
and policy areas.

03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:53.230 position:56%
Each of the bills that congress puts

03:06:53.230 --> 03:06:58.220
out that has one policy
area that is attached to it.

03:06:58.220 --> 03:07:02.060
And here we have Native
Americans which is one of,

they only have a few
subjects here to choose from

03:07:05.010 --> 03:07:11.370
but Native Americans have 97 bills
so far with this current congress.

03:07:11.370 --> 03:07:15.090
Clicking on Native American
gets you those 97 bills.

03:07:15.090 --> 03:07:20.000
As you can see several
have not gotten

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:24.150

introduced here, using these facets

03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:26.880
on the left hand side
you are able to navigate

03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:31.260
and see exactly what it
is you are looking for.

03:07:31.260 --> 03:07:35.140
So you have bills and resolutions,
let's say I only want bills,

03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:39.790
it will redo the search and
only give me those 93 bills

03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:42.300
and take out the resolutions.

03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:48.970
I can narrow this down and can
only look at the 3 that became law

03:07:48.970 --> 03:07:54.730
and we have other facets here that
you can narrow down with the bills

03:07:54.730 --> 03:07:56.780
down by sponsors, committee,
chamber or party.

03:07:56.780 --> 03:08:04.750
So I have the 3 bills that have
passed, but if you wanted to look

03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:07.790
at an expand the search you
can come here to the congress

03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:10.810
and currently we have
the 114 congress checked

03:08:10.810 --> 03:08:15.550
which is our current congress,
but by showing more you can look

03:08:15.550 --> 03:08:19.140
at all the bills, or in this case
the laws since they've passed

03:08:19.140 --> 03:08:23.040
and become law, that were
passed by congress in each

03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:25.510
of the different congressional
years.

03:08:48.380 --> 03:08:51.650
Nope. Not yet.

&gt;&gt; Jennifer Gonzalez: Right, we are
doing as much outreach as we can

03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:54.800
to try to speak with the tribes,
to let them know about the portal

03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:57.410
and all of the availability
that we have.

03:09:57.410 --> 03:09:59.910
I think the first step is really
making sure that people know

03:09:59.910 --> 03:10:03.400
about the portal and know that it's
out there and once people start

03:10:03.400 --> 03:10:04.700
to recognize that its out there

03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:07.610
and then hopefully those
relationships will really start

03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:09.410
