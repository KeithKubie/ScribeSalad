00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
 

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.350
Before we start going
off into things outside

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.780
of our solar system, I want
to take a few steps back

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.774
because I found this neat
picture of the Sun over here.

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:11.440
And the reason why,
at least in my mind,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.730
it's kind of mind blowing
is because at this scale,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.410
the Sun is obviously still
a huge object at this scale.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.580
The Earth would be
roughly-- and this

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.640
is an approximation--
roughly that big.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.290
And so for me at least,
this is mind blowing.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.600
Because it's this idea
that our whole planet,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.700
everything could fit into one
of these kind of plasma flares

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.974
coming off of the Sun.

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.140
And you can only imagine it.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.590
We can't realistically be there.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.673
But if you were in some
type of protected capsule,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:43.100
what it would be like to be in
this type of an environment.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.365
So I just thought this was
kind of a fascinating concept.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:47.990
Well, anyway, with
that out of the way,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.860
let's think about
what it means to be

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380
at the boundary of
the solar system.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.660
In the last video, we
explored the Ort Belt.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.454
It started a little under one
light year away from the Sun.

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.370
But depending on what
you view as the boundary

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.745
of the solar system, it could
be something way farther in

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:07.280
or could be something as far
out of something like the Oort

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.450
Cloud.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.850
So the Sun, we see these
things being ejected.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.470
But even in unseen ways,
or unseen particles,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.060
super high energy electrons,
electrons and protons,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.430
are also being
ejected from the Sun

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830
at super high velocities,
400 kilometers per second.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.870
Let me write that down,
400 kilometers per second.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.120
And on Earth, we're protected
from these highly energetic

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.610
particles because of
Earth's magnetic field.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.970
But if you're on the
surface of the Moon

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.450
when the Sun is on
top, and you're not

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.500
on the dark side
of the Moon, you'll

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.030
have direct contact with these.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.620
And as you can imagine,
it's not the best thing

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.650
to hang around in too along.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.910
But the whole reason why I'm
even talking about these, these

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.389
charged particles that are
coming out at huge velocities

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:00.805
from the surface
of the Sun, these

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:03.280
are considered the solar wind.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
These are the solar wind.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.414
And I'll put "wind' in quotes.

00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:09.830
Because it's really
very different

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.580
than our traditional
association of a nice breeze.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.720
These are just
charged particles that

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.370
are going out at super high
velocities from the Sun.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.100
And I'm even going into
the idea of the solar wind

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.120
because to some degree,
they can help us

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.250
with one definition of maybe
the limits of the solar system.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.830
And that's the limits of how
far the solar wind is getting

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.100
before it kind of
comes in confrontation

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.540
with the interstellar medium.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.370
And this right here shows
a depiction of that.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.900
So the Ort Cloud, it
was way-- at least

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.410
the edges of the dense part
of it is way outside of this.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.120
As we saw, this is just
where Voyager 1, Voyager 2.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.100
If we wanted the orbit
of Sedna, the close part

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.350
would be something over here
and then it would go out.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.730
But the Ort Cloud is
much, much further out.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.900
So if you look at this kind
of view of the solar system

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.880
as the extent of the solar wind,
its much smaller than the Ort

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.380
Cloud.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.130
But it's still fairly large.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.180
So this is right here.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.420
This heliopause right here--
and I got this from Wikipedia--

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.400
this is essentially where
the velocity and the forces

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.240
of the solar wind
are counteracted.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.730
That the pressure is so
diluted at this point

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.440
that it's counteracted by mainly
the hydrogen and the helium

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.380
that's in the interstellar
kind of medium,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.680
that's just kind of out there.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.590
So after this point,
it's not really

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.030
being injected out anymore.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.040
There's this kind of pause,
I guess you could say.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.690
And Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2, as I said,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.430
have essentially gotten pretty
close to, people believe,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.540
that pause over there.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.350
And so that's one view of the
edges of the solar system.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.510
There's never going to
be any hard edge to it.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.500
Another view would be something
like the Oort Cloud, the area

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.450
where you have the
still objects out there.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.160
And actually we haven't
directly observed

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.400
objects in the Ort Cloud.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.120
We think that they
are out there.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.170
And then maybe the most
abstract definition

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.750
would be a significant
influence from the Sun's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.990
gravitational pull.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.420
So all of those
ways are to imagine

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.000
the extent of the solar system.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.510
But they all kind of leave a
grey area for what is and what

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.111
is not in the solar system.

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:25.860
But my whole point
here, what I want to do

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.330
is start exploring a little
bit outside of the solar system

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.530
and just give you a
sense of the scale

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.560
as we just go to
the closest star.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.030
So if we go right
over here, this

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.471
shows our local neighborhood
from a stellar point of view.

00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:42.970
And even though these stars
look pretty big, if you actually

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.260
were to draw-- this is our
solar system right here.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.400
And you might be saying,
oh, maybe that's the Sun.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.480
No.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.142
The Sun, if you were
to draw it here,

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:53.600
it wouldn't even
make up one pixel.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.010
In fact, the entire orbit of
Pluto, everything inside of it,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.980
still would not make up one
pixel on the screen right here.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.210
What we see right here,
which is a radius-- it's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.360
roughly a radius of about
give or take a light year--

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.170
this is roughly maybe the
radius of the Oort Cloud.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.750
And we saw in the
last video, how

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:27.220
huge that was, especially
relative to the radius of

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.820
say Pluto's orbit, which
is roughly like that.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.000
And that itself is a huge, huge
diameter or a huge distance

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.420
away from the Sun.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.360
And that wouldn't
even make a pixel.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.220
That wouldn't even make
a pixel on this diagram

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.670
right over here.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.810
But just to give you an
idea of how far we are-- so

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.290
we're a speck of a speck
of a speck inside here,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.380
of a pixel of a
pixel in the center

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.920
here-- to make it
from our solar system,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.190
or in particular
from Earth maybe,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.315
to the nearest star or
maybe the nearest cluster

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:04.310
of stars, the Alpha Centauri.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.770
They're the nearest
cluster of stars.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.200
There's three stars,
Alpha Centauri A,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.330
which is the largest;
Alpha Centauri B;

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.300
and then, there's one
that you can't observe

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.820
with the naked eye,
Alpha Proximus.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.850
Or I think it's
Proximus Centauri,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.310
I think is what it's called,
not Alpha Proximus, Proximus

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.810
Centauri.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.820
But that's a much smaller star.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.770
But that's the
closest star-- well,

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.490
you could view it as this whole
cluster of stars right here.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.400
And they're the closest-- is
about 4.2 light years away.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.920
Or another way to
think about it,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.680
if someone were to shine a
light on one of these planets,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.780
and assuming that
light could get to us,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.900
it would take 4.2
years to get to us.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.990
Or if these guys just
disappeared or blew up,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.419
we wouldn't know
it for 4.2 years.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.210
And you might say, hey,
that's not too bad.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.010
We should take a trip over
there and check them out,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.968
see if there are any
other people there that we

00:06:55.968 --> 00:07:00.380
can meet and exchange
technologies with, or whatnot.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.200
But this is a huge distance.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.320
Just this 4.2 light years is
an unbelievably ridiculous

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.820
distance.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.424
And just to give you a
sense, the Voyager 1 and 2,

00:07:10.424 --> 00:07:11.840
we talked about
in the last video,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.730
and we can even see
how far they've gotten.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.210
They've gotten to pretty
much to the heliopause.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:26.030
These guys are traveling at
60,000 kilometers an hour,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.165
which is the same thing as
17 kilometers per second.

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:31.980
 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.260
If we were able to get up
to those type of velocities,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.460
and these guys got up to
those type of velocities

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.170
by leveraging the gravitational
pull of some of the larger

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.250
planets to accelerate
and keep accelerating.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.330
So this is a pretty hard
velocity to actually reach.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.420
But if you were able
to reach that velocity

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.670
and go straight in the direction
of the direction of the Alpha

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.550
Centauri system, the
closest stars to Earth,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.060
it would take you
80,000 years traveling

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.990
at the same velocity
as Voyager 1,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.870
which is the fastest
of the Voyagers.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.080
So it's a ridiculously
long time.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.591
So we're going to figure out
some better way to do that.

00:08:16.591 --> 00:08:17.091
