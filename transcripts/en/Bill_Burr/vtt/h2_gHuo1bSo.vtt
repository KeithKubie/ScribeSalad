1
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.720
Like a

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.160
<v 1>boss. And then we started watching this</v>

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.560
series on Netflix. It was something about these chefs.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.590
It was all these, these French cooks and a,

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.850
it was great to hear the French language cause I kind of stopped that.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.130
Once again I was picking up, you know,

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.760
little phrases here or there that made me feel good and these fucking,

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.470
these chefs were incredible. We watched like two or three episodes of it.

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.720
Of course, I don't know what the name of it is

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.303
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.100
<v 1>but it made me want to live in Paris for like fucking three months, four months,</v>

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.401
five,

13
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.230
whatever it would take just to get kind of passable and take a pastry maker.

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.070
I know that sounds like the stupidest thing ever, but this fucking guy,

15
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.770
he takes like an apple and he was going like this guy was an artist.

16
00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:58.330
He was just sitting there going like, you know,

17
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.670
I'm so sick of making all these fucking thing. I had to come up with some new,

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.050
the thing to do with an apple and he fucking just imagine if he just kept

19
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.510
peeling a thing. Right. If you just peeling the skin off.

20
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.460
But you just kept going all the way down to the core.

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.700
He did that and it was all one piece you did with some hand crank thing and he

22
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.920
said, I wanted to make a rose out of an apple.

23
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.250
And he somehow did it and turned it into a dessert.

24
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.050
<v 0>You've got pool of fellow visual models.</v>

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.610

<v 0>no, not [inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.750
[inaudible] Nash [inaudible] view

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.680
[inaudible] sauce to Lima. Did I eat

29
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.020
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

30
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
<v 1>fucking chop that duck in a, in a chicken in half. And he sewed them together,</v>

31
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.930
which was very naziesque slash American horror story that kind of creeped me

32
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:01.764
out.

33
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.563
<v 0>Sassy Cohen Food</v>

34
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.950
[inaudible] you afraid?

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.820
[inaudible]

36
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.100
<v 1>and then of course they had to show how they fucking,</v>

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.240
they were cooking lobsters. Live lobsters over an open flame.

38
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.200
Can I kiss you guys a question? What? What are the lobster ever do to us?

39
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.050
Every other animal has the decency of being dead before we fucking,

40
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.120
at least in this country. I know other countries,

41
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.380
they got fucking met maggots running around their apple jacks for extra protein.

42
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.170
You know, that's like us putting way potter into our shakes.

43
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.960
They put like fucking bugs and stuff, you know what I mean?

44
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.260
Puts a little spring in your step. A little twinkle in your eyes. So anyways,

45
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:50.261
I'm watching this fucking lunatic and I'm for the life of me.

46
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.450
I don't know why they just can't. At least just can you just fucking,

47
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:56.260
I don't know.

48
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.980
Can they make it like a little lobster hammer and just fucking knock it out?

49
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.090
At least does it have to be squirming on the flame and you have to keep telling

50
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.960
me that it doesn't feel pain. It doesn't have a central nervous system.

51
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.530
Whatever the fuck they try to say. It's just like, like what?

52
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.000
It's like an Amoeba. It isn't. Okay. The fucking thing's got eyeballs and shit.

53
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.180
It's walking around. It's got its little tentacles, whatever you call it, those,

54
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.630
those big fucking things coming out. It can see it breathes.

55
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.330
You gotta have paid. That's part of survival, right?

56
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.340
Wish it was a way to shut it off.

57
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.310
<v 3>Um,</v>

58
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.420
<v 1>Jesus, I'm all over the map. I was talking about l fucking nut LSU.</v>

59
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:39.000
I was talking about Alabama USC. Now where the hell am I? So anyways,

60
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.670
the guy got sick of talking about a week after a while,

61
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:44.250
he just got sick of the blood of all the animals.

62
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible]</v>

63
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.840
[inaudible] I pushed you back. T

64
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.110
J O v

65
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.540
<v 1>and he got three stars over in, in, um, in France.</v>

66
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.770
And three stars is the highest you can get, which is so fucking Parisian.

67
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.440
You know what I mean? There's so fucking understated and classy.

68
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:17.750
I hate to say it is American, but they really are.

69
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.770
They really earned their snooty fucking behavior over there. The people,

70
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.610
their style, their clothes, that's it. They crush it. You know,

71
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.150
Mr t would got himself a gold chain and there was this like, you know what?

72
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.690
One isn't enough. Let me get fucking 9,000 of them and hanger.

73
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.460
They're the exact opposite of that.

74
00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:37.400
They got like all mood muted colors and then Bam,

75
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:41.420
a sick ass pair of shoes or a hat or the ladies with their bags,

76
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.760
just fucking class. It's not like, you know, it's not like us loud Americans,

77
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.620
you know, but it's good to be loud sometimes.

78
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.370
<v 2>You're so skinny, your eyes are in single file. Well, you are so ugly.</v>

79
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:03.660
Your ears stick out to get away from your face. Well, your mom is,

80
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.160
oh wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't bring in one mother to this.

81
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.470
She Ain't here. It wasn't for your mother. You wouldn't be here.

82
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.390
So you remember when you put down one mother,

83
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.190
you putting out mothers all over the world.

84
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.510
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>
