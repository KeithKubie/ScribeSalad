00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.700
So in the physics
department, where Louis and I

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.160
are both faculty
members, we were

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.320
starting to get
interested in questions

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.900
about departmental-level
learning

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.270
objectives and department-level
learning outcomes.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.690
So a little bit of
history behind this.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.130
So Chris Stubbs, who recently
served a term as interim chair

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.549
and previously had been chair
of the physics department,

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.090
has long been
interested in improving

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.890
undergraduate education.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.080
When he was the
department chair,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.530
he brought Carl Wieman to
campus to talk to faculty

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.877
about creating learning
objectives for their courses

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:43.210
and helping faculty to try
to define, what do you really

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.540
want them to learn when they
take electricity and magnetism

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.320
or quantum mechanics or whatever
that individual course is?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.749
And Chris, at the time, said,
OK, I'm department chair.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.290
I can just wave my magic wand
and make everyone make learning

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.940
objectives for their courses.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.260
And of course, we
know that didn't work.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
But Chris realized that this
idea of actually defining

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.332
learning objectives is
a very powerful notion

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:09.790
that you can really
articulate what

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.780
it means to learn the content
and skills and concepts

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.550
in a course.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.890
And a few years later, when
Chris was serving a term

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.750
as interim chair
of the department,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.172
he wondered, is there anything
I can do, one semester as chair,

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:25.630
that could have a lasting impact
on undergraduate education

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.100
in the department?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.340
And he turned to
Louis Deslauriers,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.670
who is director of science
teaching and learning in FAS

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.220
and also a senior preceptor
in our department.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.570
And Louis is one of the great
experts in science education

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.650
here.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.480
And Louis immediately
said, well,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.210
there is something that
no one else is doing,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.640
which is actually looking
at the department level

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.132
at learning objectives.

00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:52.090
What, as a department,
are we actually teaching

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.770
our physics undergraduates?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.800
And Louis said, no one's doing
this at other institutions,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.970
because they think
it's just too hard.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.470
OK.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.011
They think that,
logistically, trying

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:03.460
to get all of the students
and trying to get faculty

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.710
to agree about what the
department learning objectives

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.750
are, these will be
too challenging.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.160
So Chris said, OK.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.230
Let's do it.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.430
And so this project was launched
with some specially arranged

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.220
help from HILT at the
HILT Conference, where

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.720
those of you who
were there remember

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.357
that Chris was presented as
a Guinea pig, if you will,

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.440
with an opportunity for
the entire HILT conference

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480
to weigh in on what Chris
ought to do in his one

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.241
semester as interim chair to
improve teaching and learning

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:35.990
in the department.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.990
And one of the
options was create

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.470
a departmental-level assessment
to assess teaching and learning

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.440
in the department.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.731
And lo and behold, that was
one of the recommendations.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.549
So with that
ringing endorsement,

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.840
one of the curriculum-mapping
projects that was started

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.670
was this very project.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.860
So we wanted to
know, how do we know

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.800
if the department as a whole is
actually successful in teaching

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.390
the concepts and
skills that we think

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.780
are important for undergraduate
success in physics and future

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.680
success as they go into their
careers or graduate schools?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.120
How do we actually
engage faculty

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.890
in thinking about
departmental-level learning

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.389
goals?

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.950
As you can imagine, that
can be a contentious issue.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.867
And how do we increase
our students' awareness

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:16.783
about what they know and
what they don't know?

00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:19.390
So we're looking here both at
the undergraduate concentrators

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.660
and at the faculty to try
to understand this better.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.150
So our goals by
June of next year

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.127
is that we'll have, we
hope, a system in place

00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:28.960
where all of our
undergraduate concentrators

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.460
are assessed twice--

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.230
first around the end
of their second year

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.230
and again in their fourth year--

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.240
that we have student-level
and departmental-level

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.670
interventions in response
to these results,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.360
and that we can actually
validate the assessment itself.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.000
This is a little snapshot of
part of the assessment, which

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.430
is something that we think
is a very simple question,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.170
conceptual question,
in quantum mechanics

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.060
about the eigenfunction
of a Schroedinger

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.100
equation for a semi-infinite--
well, anyway, I won't go on.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.440
And our hopes for
curriculum mapping

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.584
are that, in the future,
when we have our curricular

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:04.000
reforms in the
physics department,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.250
we can actually
target those reforms

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.170
at places where we
know that we need

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.360
to focus in terms of outcomes.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.520
And then we can actually
assess those changes

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.905
on a department level.

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:16.029
And finally, we hope that
our students can actually

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.904
be more confident
and can articulate

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:19.570
what the skills are
that they've learned

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.579
as undergraduate
concentrators in physics.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.100
And now, I will turn
this over to Louis,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.530
who understands this all
much more deeply than I do,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.824
to explain a little bit
more about the details

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:30.490
of this project.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.590
OK.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.060
So a little bit about
the design here.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.890
So first, the test is made up of
a broad range of topics, right?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.920
We want to make sure the faculty
and students feel like it's

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.540
quite representative
of what it means

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.530
to be a physicist by the
end of your fourth year.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.920
So I made sure to see as many
colleagues and department

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.930
as possible to get their input.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.850
And I asked them,
what do you think

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.400
are the most important skills,
most important concepts,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.760
that your students should
master by the time they get out

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.020
of the program?

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.535
And I got a lot of
feedback, obviously.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:13.720
But a feedback that was
common to everyone was about--

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.400
they wanted to make sure
that this assessment did not

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.310
look just like a final exam
at the end of a course, which,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.120
in physics, oftentimes involves
end of the chapter, end

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.170
of the textbook problems.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.430
So they didn't want the
exam to look like that.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.230
And that's why, if you
look at the assessment,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.061
we have some practical lab
physics questions on there.

00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.685
We have even some
open-ended questions.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:40.120
So it really does
feel quite different.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.200
But most importantly, I wanted
to make sure that it only

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.970
had conceptual questions.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.890
And it's well known,
now, in science education

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.450
that the retention of concepts
is quite robust over time

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.480
when you compare that
to retention of facts.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.125
Facts like procedures,
steps that you

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.250
need to solve an equation
or something, that's just

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.520
forgotten almost at the
same rate as a phone number

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.050
or someone's name, right?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.840
In fact, several years
ago, we published something

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.330
where we looked at how students
retain quantum mechanics

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.930
concepts.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.360
At the end of their first
quantum mechanics course,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.100
students were given
a test of learning.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.220
And the test of learning
comprised deeply

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.774
conceptual questions, as
well as procedures, right?

00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:26.440
So a year and a half
later, we gave them

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.640
the same test of learning.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.830
And we made sure that
they had no exposure

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.810
to quantum mechanics in between.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.360
And interestingly, the
concept was retained almost

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.660
at 100%, the deeply
conceptual ideas.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.820
But the facts, procedures,
not surprisingly,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.682
they had decayed almost
to zero, to noise level.

00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:44.140
So that's why I
wanted to make sure

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.950
that the feedback that
this test would give us,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.760
faculty, and students
was meaningful.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.260
So in fact, you'll see, when I
talk about student interviews

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.610
here, not a single student
said, oh, I learned this before.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.390
But I think I did not answer
it correctly, because I forgot.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.970
Because people know,
intuitively, these questions.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.520
If you just don't know how
to answer them a year later,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.770
that's because you didn't
learn it in the first place.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.320
So that's a very important
part of the design.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.750
So I tried to use as many
validated questions as

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.920
possible.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.910
I called my colleagues
at other universities,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.660
but we can only use a few.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.080
So this assessment will have
to be validated this year.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.050
So let's talk about
results a little bit.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.750
Students did not perform
as well as they hoped,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.270
so with an average of 46%.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.460
And the distribution
was pretty wide.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.000
So now, you should know.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.257
If you ask, is
this test too hard?

00:07:39.257 --> 00:07:41.590
Well, I guess I started to
give it to graduate students,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.850
so they score a lot higher.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.990
But still, not that great, much
worse than they would like.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.980
And I just got the green light,
I think, in the last faculty

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.740
meeting that we had, to start
giving it to my colleagues.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.150
Anyway, it'll be
anonymous, right?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.370
I'll say I'm the only one
that has the key, right,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.280
so I'll be able to get
favors from people.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.930
So here's what's really
interesting here.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.810
Everyone, no exception, expected
to get an A on this test,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.320
and they were all
very disappointed.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.900
So that's a bit of
a downer, right?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.970
Very disappointed,
in fact, to the point

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.340
where I was quite concerned
with the few first students.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.260
But I interviewed every student.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.140
So I met them one on one.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.930
And part of the script at the
beginning for the interview

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.510
was about their perception
of fairness for the test.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.120
I asked them, is the test
fair, in your opinion?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.618
And I just let them talk.

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.659
Then after that, I provide
them with a definition

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.250
we can both agree
on for "fairness."

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.410
The definition I gave
them was that I said,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.910
let's imagine, for example, the
questions on quantum mechanics

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.840
for this test.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.450
Let's say that you had
been asked those questions

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.329
at the end of your course where
you learned quantum mechanics.

00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:57.370
Would it be fair for the
instructor in the course

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.740
to expect you to get all
these questions right?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.337
And without exception,
students said yes, absolutely.

00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:05.170
At the end of a course
in quantum mechanics,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.750
I should get those quantum
mechanics questions right.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.880
So they did feel like
the test was fair.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.380
So it was very
disappointing to them.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.200
But on the upside,
students really

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.360
did appreciate the feedback.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.620
I mean, many of them went out of
their way to thank me, to say,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.420
oh, I'm so glad that
the department is

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.430
spending a lot of
time and energy

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.740
to give me additional feedback.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.792
And many of them asked, OK,
what can I do practically, now?

00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.000
These are students that are
about to graduate, right,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.700
in fourth years.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.450
They said, only got a few months
before I go to graduate school.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.220
What can I do?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.360
Give me some advice.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.390
So it's pretty clear that we
can't just give this assessment

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.684
and leave it at that, right?

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:45.600
We need to provide
students with opportunities

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.580
to bridge some of the gaps.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.120
So another upside is that
the assessment can definitely

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.220
help students improve their
self-awareness as they progress

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.334
through the program.

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:58.750
And that's in
addition, of course,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.570
to helping us improve teaching
and learning in our department.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.820
So something that's
very interesting here

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.990
as part of the
interviews is I asked

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.180
students, what is it that
made you think that you should

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.020
have gotten an A on this test?

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.950
And not all of them,
but almost all of them,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.530
they talk about their grades.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.880
They said, well, it's too bad.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.300
The only feedback that I get
from the program are my grades.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.960
And I did pretty
good in my classes.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.251
So that's why I would have
assumed that I would do well

00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:29.350
on something like that.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.330
So that was the source of their
disappointment, basically.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.270
So as Logan mentioned,
when you think

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.700
about this, that's a pretty
backward way to design things,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.200
right?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.172
You're supposed to do
learning outcomes first.

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:42.630
And then from that,
you're supposed

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.250
to build an assessment, right?

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.860
But we know it practically
just doesn't work that way.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.410
Well, you should have seen
this in the faculty meeting,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.460
the last one that we had.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.530
I mean, people were
really engaged, right?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.670
So that might be a good way
to trick faculty into starting

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.680
to talk about these things.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.500
So the next steps here
for this coming year

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.710
is, of course, we need to
design follow-up opportunities

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.130
for students, some
seminar-type courses.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.730
We're bouncing ideas,
what we should do.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.790
We need to revise and
validate the assessment.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.262
And that will involve
a lot of interviews.

00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:18.720
So I want to make
sure that we make

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.550
this available to
everyone around the world

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.710
so they can use this instrument.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.950
And Karen Pierce from
Institutional Research

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.670
is already helping us now
with looking at correlations

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.050
with other institutional data.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.160
For example, what courses
did students take?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.285
What grades did they take?

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:40.740
And does that inform their
performance on this test?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.644
And then finally,
and not the least,

00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:44.310
is that we need to
develop a sustainable

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.910
way to give that to students.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.420
So we want to give it at
the end of second year

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.950
and at the end of fourth year.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.170
So students did
mention in interviews,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.670
I wish I would
have had something

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.160
like this two years ago
so I would have been

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.750
able to make some corrections.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.920
It's too bad.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.710
So giving it the end of
second year, that's easy,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.250
I would think, not
just in physics

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.320
but in most departments.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.080
Because we have
core courses, right?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.110
Like this fall semester, I'm
teaching quantum mechanics.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.522
And every student has to go
through quantum mechanics.

00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:13.980
So I'm going to
give it to students

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.180
at the end of the course.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.107
That's easy.

00:12:16.107 --> 00:12:18.690
But at the end of fourth year,
though, that's a serious issue.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.530
This semester was really hard
to communicate with each student

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.080
individually and schedule
time and so forth.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.990
Can you imagine a
world where that was

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.830
happening in every department?
