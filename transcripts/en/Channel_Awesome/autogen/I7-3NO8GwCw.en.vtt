00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.629
reminds her a lot of Rose that's what
I'm feeling the direction the show

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639
I'm feeling the direction the show
 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.460
I'm feeling the direction the show
usually goes is usually the the very

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470
usually goes is usually the the very
 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.770
usually goes is usually the the very
affectionate ones and then the ones they

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780
affectionate ones and then the ones they
 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.240
affectionate ones and then the ones they
have very nice feelings to it and stuff

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250
have very nice feelings to it and stuff
 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.029
have very nice feelings to it and stuff
so I'm assuming it's heading that

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039
so I'm assuming it's heading that
 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.420
so I'm assuming it's heading that
direction but I don't know um you know I

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430
direction but I don't know um you know I
 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.310
direction but I don't know um you know I
don't know if this game out before or

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320
don't know if this game out before or
 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.860
don't know if this game out before or
after coral uh so we don't know if this

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870
after coral uh so we don't know if this
 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.779
after coral uh so we don't know if this
is like something that can happen yet or

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:34.789
is like something that can happen yet or
 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.520
is like something that can happen yet or
not or if they're just very strongly

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530
not or if they're just very strongly
 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.550
not or if they're just very strongly
hinting at it so um yeah but I don't

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560
hinting at it so um yeah but I don't
 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.309
hinting at it so um yeah but I don't
know that's a that that's there's like a

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319
know that's a that that's there's like a
 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.339
know that's a that that's there's like a
million clues pointing to this so either

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:45.349
million clues pointing to this so either
 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.050
million clues pointing to this so either
they're building up this one thing and

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.060
they're building up this one thing and
 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.999
they're building up this one thing and
it's just like haha we actually did this

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.009
it's just like haha we actually did this
 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.040
it's just like haha we actually did this
the whole time but knowing the show and

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.050
the whole time but knowing the show and
 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.510
the whole time but knowing the show and
how much they really sort of like these

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520
how much they really sort of like these
 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.129
how much they really sort of like these
relationships and these connections and

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:54.139
relationships and these connections and
 

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.779
relationships and these connections and
stuff like that that's the guess I'm

00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:55.789
stuff like that that's the guess I'm
 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:01.209
stuff like that that's the guess I'm
going with um so again I sort of the few

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:01.219
going with um so again I sort of the few
 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:02.980
going with um so again I sort of the few
episodes I've seen again I'll point them

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:02.990
episodes I've seen again I'll point them
 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.920
episodes I've seen again I'll point them
out when I see them uh the show does I

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:05.930
out when I see them uh the show does I
 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.719
out when I see them uh the show does I
say two million times but it really does

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:07.729
say two million times but it really does
 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:09.909
say two million times but it really does
interesting things with identity and if

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919
interesting things with identity and if
 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.709
interesting things with identity and if
that is the route they're going I think

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719
that is the route they're going I think
 

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:13.029
that is the route they're going I think
that'd be like a fascinating route

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039
that'd be like a fascinating route
 

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.890
that'd be like a fascinating route
that'd be a really interesting route um

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:14.900
that'd be a really interesting route um
 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.529
that'd be a really interesting route um
you know because you could argue stuff

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:17.539
you know because you could argue stuff
 

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.659
you know because you could argue stuff
about reincarnation or even taking that

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:19.669
about reincarnation or even taking that
 

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:21.430
about reincarnation or even taking that
