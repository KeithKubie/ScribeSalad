00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.680
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.750
interesting developer community.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.820
has asked this question.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.093
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:14.860
answer show.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.180
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.540
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.170
I'm Claudio and this is Alain.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.490
We're two engineers in the
Google Drive Developer

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.960
Relations Team.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.080
Today, we're going to talk
about an application that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.422
integrates with Drive and that
is available in the Chrome Web

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:42.430
Store, that allows you to do
image editing on the cloud.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.990
We're actually going to show you
two separate applications

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.680
from the same producer.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010
The two applications
are called Pixlr

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.870
Editor and Pixlr Express.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.550
As you can easily imagine, Pixlr
Editor is more powerful.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.120
Pixlr Express can be
used to do quick

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.250
editing to your images.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.720
But let's see how they work.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.810
Let's move to the screen.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.520
I just downloaded important
wallpaper for my computer from

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.890
freewallpapersweb.com.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.040
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Everybody
needs a wallpaper.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.510
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
everybody needs a wallpaper.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.900
So let's see, I have this
beautiful image on my Google

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.380
Drive account.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.800
This is of course
work related.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.890
And I need to do some editing.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.100
So I just clicked on File and
it opened into Google Drive

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.120
default viewer.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.870
But I previously installed
this application

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.650
called Pixlr Editor.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.190
So instead of opening the
application from here, I can

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.480
do Open With and select
Pixlr Editor.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.970
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: You can do it
from here, or we can do it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.770
back from the Google
Drive web URI.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.590
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Exactly.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.600
And of course, Drive, Filter, to
list some applications that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.470
can open that file.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770
So if you have many applications
installed, but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.970
some of them open text files,
some of them open images, and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.760
some of them can open other
kinds of files.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.350
Of course, when you right click
on an image, you will

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.930
only see the applications that
can actually open images, and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.479
Pixlr Editor and Pixlr Express
are two of those.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.889
So let's start with Pixlr
Editor, which

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.790
is very, very powerful.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.820
So when we click on a file,
the image gets loaded into

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.090
this web interface.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.220
As you can see, we have a
lot of features here.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.890
So some easy ones.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.230
You can, obviously, resize
images, you can add some

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.480
editing, you can make this image
worse by drawing on it.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.095
Want to try something?

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.280
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: What
to draw something?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.770
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.190
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: What
do you want to draw?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.400
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's
see, I don't know.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.050
The sun.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.390
Can you draw--

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.470
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: A sun.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.320
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Oh, a black sun.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.300
That's really creepy.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.150
OK, so Alain is definitely
really--

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.650
what is that?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.480
OK, OK, that's going to be my
wallpaper for the future.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.430
Thank you, Alain.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.890
So as you can see, you have
a lot of features here.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.140
So you have a number of
filters you can apply.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.820
You have a lot of layers
you can create.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.680
You can resize the image.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.000
You can make it bigger.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.080
You can draw on it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.220
You can add text.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.470
You have gradients.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.036
What is it you're going
to try now?

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:14.850
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
You can select--

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.770
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh,
use Magic Wand.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.140
Oh, great.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.870
I see you're very
good at that.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.384
What else can you do?

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:23.360
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Select
this thing.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.193
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
OK, now what?

00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:26.040
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
I don't know.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.360
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, well
you're definitely very good.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.320
So I mean there are actually
people who can do something

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.950
with graphic applications.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.690
Alain is not one of those.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.580
And he's randomly pressing
buttons and--

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.050
what is that now?

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.690
A filter.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.570
You're applying a filter.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.310
Why are you're doing that?

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.100
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Just
trying to do that.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.680
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
just trying that.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.920
OK, let's say you made this
image better, and you did that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.150
by adding a smile.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.060
Now, we want to save
that to Drive.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.580
Can we go back to real stuff?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.280
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
All right, sure.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
let's say you want to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.900
save back to Drive.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.410
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: So you go
to Find, Save, and then you

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.480
have the option to
save to Drive.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.170
So we can save on the same
image or make a copy.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.580
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, and
then you see this same

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.630
application, Pixlr Editor, can
save to a number of different

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.519
online services.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.680
Of course, you can export it
to your local computer.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.250
So you can have these jpeg
files saved to your local

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.160
computer, and use
it from there.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.840
But if you want to save
it to Drive--

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.230
you want to save to Picasa,
Flickr, and other social

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.940
destinations--

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.140
you can do all of
that from here.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.110
So you save it.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.480
And one thing we notice, because
we're going to focus

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.730
more on, of course, on the Drive
indication, is that, as

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.560
a default, you're saving
it as a copy.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.590
And of course you can
set the quality.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.585
What is the difference in saving
as a copy or saying as

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:53.800
a new file?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.980
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: In Drive,
as opposed to an online

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.300
[? circumstance, ?]

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.020
we can have many files with
the same file name.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.500
So if you save it is
a copy, you have

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.570
two files named kittens.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.350
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I see.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.580
So let's see what happens.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.790
Let's save it as a copy, and
then when that is done, we go

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.240
back to Drive and see
what we have there.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.700
And what we're expecting is to
see two different images, one

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.240
with a nice smile
and one without.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.850
And so, let's see, let's
try to open one.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.114
I see we have two.

00:05:27.114 --> 00:05:27.920
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: First one.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.473
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And this is
the original one, and this is

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:32.360
actually good.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.430
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
And this one.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.570
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
you also set a very

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.600
low quality, I see.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.320
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Yes.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.950
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Obviously,
Pixlr can do

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.930
much better than this.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.210
You can select the quality you
want, and I think you made a

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.100
very bad choice.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.000
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: No, I used
the pixelate feature, so I

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.810
tried to do a [? [INAUDIBLE]. ?]

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.000
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I see, you
are very good at that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.520
OK, so this is Pixlr Editor, and
there are some things we

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.080
noticed that can be improved and
integration between Pixlr

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.130
Editor and Google Drive.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.210
So what we've seen
so far is great.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.040
Of course, you can also create
a new image from scratch from

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.960
Google Drive by clicking on
Create, More, and then you see

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.450
the list of applications we can
create a file, including

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.300
Pixlr Editor.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.640
So when we start from there,
you can create a new image,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.310
you can open an image from
your computer, and so on.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.400
Let's say we create a new one.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.540
OK, you gave a name, and you
can select a size for the

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.180
image, and then you can express
your creativity now.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.080
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: All right,
let's draw another smiley.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.030
That's the best thing
you can do, right?

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.460
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Yes.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.000
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.850
This is beautiful.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.510
Let's save it to Drive, because
we want to store it

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.200
for future generations.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.370
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
Save to Drive.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.005
There we go.

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.990
Extension jpeg, png.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.285
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, so you
have different extensions, you

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.180
can save to different formats.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.660
OK.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.920
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: The good
thing is that it let's you

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.480
know the approximate file size
of the resulting image, so

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.700
printing out of quota, you
know before saving.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.420
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Oh, perfect.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.390
And of course we--

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.110
I mean, as image editors--

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.440
know with some files formats
you can select a quality so

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.340
that you can make the file be
bigger or smaller, but you

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.650
have better or worse quality.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.580
So we've got this file in
Google Drive, right.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.090
So we have a new image.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.720
OK, this is working perfectly.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.130
But there's actually a scenario
we've found that is

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.890
not perfect, and we wish Pixlr
is going to fix it.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.480
So when you install an
application from the Chrome

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.820
Web Store--

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.190
and this is the listing
for Pixlr Editor--

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.860
the application is added
to the Chrome New Tab

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.580
page, which is this.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.880
In the Chrome New Tab page,
you get a link to all the

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.960
applications you have installed,
including those

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.480
that integrate with Drive.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.630
So you can start Pixlr Editor
from here, and you start it

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.330
just by clicking.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.370
And it seems the same.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.910
It seems like the flow
is exactly the same.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.270
But now you create
a new image.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.840
You can select wherever you
want here, as before.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.060
You can draw something.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.230
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: All right.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.640
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This time
it's going to be sad.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.220
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: OK, why?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.340
Oh.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.360
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Because--

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.960
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
We'll see why.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.050
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
--we'll see why.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.790
So then you try to save, and you
want to save it to Drive.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.970
However, Drive is not included
in the list of cloud

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.770
destinations you can save to.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.390
So Pixlr behaves differently if
you start from Drive or if

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.010
you start from the
Chrome Web Store.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.150
This is something that should be
addressed for the best user

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.549
experience, as the user should
have the same features

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.400
regardless of where
they start from.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.500
This should be very
easy to fix.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.030
I think it's just
a small mistake.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.980
And we will definitely
reach out to Pixlr.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.600
Maybe they're watching
us right now, but

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.020
let's fix it guys.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.470
OK.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.410
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: One
other thing is

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.250
opening files from Pixlr.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
another thing.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.710
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: You have the
option to open image, open

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.650
image via URL, or open image
library [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.250
system.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.530
Unfortunately, Drive is not
one of the options.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.320
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
that's another

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.490
thing they can improve.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.400
First, it's not a bug,
it's not an issue.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.900
But users might want to open
a file directly from Drive.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.030
This can be done by using the
Picker API, which is part of

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.330
the Google Drive SDK.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.860
And so they can easily embed the
Picker dialogue in their

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.790
application, or they might want
to list files into the

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.590
style of which they style.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.910
So you have the two options.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.560
Using the Google provided Picker
is very easy, so you

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.440
only need a couple of
lines of JavaScript

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.740
code and you get it.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.120
But the [INAUDIBLE] will have
the URI we designed it for.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.420
While if you want to write that,
and style it inside your

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.780
application, you can basically
draw that yourself.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.100
You have [? calls ?] to list all
the files on Drive and you

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.490
can group them into folders,
and so on.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.140
You could do basically
everything with the API, and

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.690
then you can embed
it into here.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.430
So we've got two feature
requests for Pixlr from here.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:19.230
Use or embed a Picker to open
files directly from Drive.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.470
And make sure that if the user
starts from the Chrome New Tab

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:29.010
page or goes directly to
Pixlr.com, these should be

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.560
allowed to save to Drive.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.600
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
That's correct.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.510
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But besides
that, I would say the

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.590
application is awesome.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.610
Even, I mean, OK, not you, but
even average users, like me,

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.690
they can do crazy things
with Pixlr.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.180
The application is very good.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.470
And obviously, one of the main
advantages is that you can use

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.700
that wherever you are
on the cloud.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.320
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
On a Chromebook

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.180
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: On a
Chromebook, on whatever

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.860
computer you are, just log in
to your account with your

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.780
credentials, and you
have Pixlr there.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.530
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: You don't
even need a desktop anymore.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.610
You don't even need a hard
drive, as all your files are

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.150
stored in the cloud.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.670
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
that's absolutely true.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.280
So we said that we have two
applications to talk about.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.190
Pixlr Editor is the
advanced one.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.660
It has a lot of features,
really a lot.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.380
So you have so many filters, and
so many things you can do

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:24.250
in Pixlr, that a professional
can use that and do a lot of

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.870
very good image editing.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:30.320
But if you're not a pro, let's
say you're Alain, you might

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.090
want to use another
application.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.500
Still by the same company, still
by Pixlr, it is called

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.040
Pixlr Express.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.505
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
Let's open it.

00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:38.060
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Let's open it.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.770
So we're opening the same
file, aren't we?

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.010
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Yes, the
original kittens from the web.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Freewallpapersweb.com.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.280
So with this application, you
can see the UI is really

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.430
simplified.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.570
You have a limited number
of features.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.320
But still a lot.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.420
But limited compared
to the [? prop ?]

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.740
application, that is the one
we just talked about.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:07.530
And you can easily make changes
to the image, applying

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.160
some filters.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.420
You can crop image.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.530
You can resize them.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.570
You can apply some effects.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.120
Let's try one.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.430
Let's see how your creativity
goes now.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:22.050
You have black and white,
dark kittens.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.850
OK, I think we can do better.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.400
For instance, one of the things
I like, you can add

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.190
borders to the image.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.200
OK, this is getting funky.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.330
It's getting better
and better.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.820
Another option is
to add borders.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.850
So you have your photo, and you
want to add a nice frame

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.600
around it, so you can
do it from here.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.050
And it's not going to be great
now, because everything is

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.160
black and white-ish.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.590
But you have a lot of
very easy to use--

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.588
vintage kittens now.

00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:56.580
How do we get this application
if you want it?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.610
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: From
the Chrome Store.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.150
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So it's
exactly the same thing.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:05.480
So we go to the Chrome Web
Store, and we will find Pixlr

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.190
Editor and Pixlr Express.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.900
We sell both.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.690
They have--

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.770
as all the applications
on the web store--

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.210
they have a lot of reviews.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.050
So then you can read about them
before you install the

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.400
application.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.890
Remember, reviews are by other
users like you, so you should

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.910
probably trust them and read
them before installing any

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.070
application.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.435
We install that from here, and
you can launch it from Google

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.560
Drive, but you can also
launch it from here.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.960
What happens if you launch the
application from here?

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.630
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
Let's try that.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.512
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Let's see if it

00:13:36.512 --> 00:13:39.410
behaves like Pixlr Editor.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.200
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Obviously,
we don't have any pictures

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.825
because we just opened the app
from Chrome Web Store.

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.760
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
so we need to browse.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.140
And what we would expect, what
we would like to get, is that

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.220
you can open a file
from Drive.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.695
So browse doesn't
let you do that.

00:13:55.695 --> 00:13:55.990
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: No.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.550
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: With browse,
you browse your local

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.770
files, which is another
important feature.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.770
So that is not the case.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.210
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: So
you can open URL.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You
can open a URL.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.270
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: From the
web or use your webcam.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So this is
a feature that Pixlr Editor

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.210
doesn't have, so remember these
two applications are

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.540
targeted at two different
audiences.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.915
So with this [INAUDIBLE]
application, you can, I'd say,

00:14:19.915 --> 00:14:23.680
fire up your webcam, take a
photo, and apply some filters.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.050
So maybe you need to create a
new profile photo, this might

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.370
be the best application
for you.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.300
You can do that in 10 seconds.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.180
And then you can add these very
good special effects.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.790
Both applications are installed
into Drive.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.660
So once you install them, you
can right-click on any image

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:50.200
file and open an existing file,
or we can do create, and

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.920
then select either of those,
and then start a new image.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.680
What are you trying to do now?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.820
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: I'm
saving the image.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.230
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, I want
to see what happens now.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.690
So now we have many copies of
this wallpaper we got from

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.260
freewallpapersweb.com,
and this is the

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.630
latest version of it.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.050
This is amazing.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.020
It's probably your
masterpiece.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.940
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: So from Pixlr
Editor, you can only

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.290
save a copy.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.040
From Pixlr Express, you
can only save a copy.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.570
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That's save
and replay, save and replay.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.700
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: I
missed that, sorry.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.730
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: As you can
see, the UI is simplified

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.370
compared to Pixlr Editor.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.150
So instead of having a UI
dialogue for saving, you have

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.590
two very specific buttons that
say what they're going to do.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.830
So you have one to save and
replay, because of course you

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.300
might want to replay
the existing one.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.440
Or you can save a copy.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.140
And everything you said about
saving a copy for

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.980
Pixlr Editor applies.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.090
And of course, you can--

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.110
I mean, the next one is to
close it and that's it.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.530
OK let's just go
back to Drive.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.630
And just to remind you before
we wrap up, if you want to

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.230
start any of these applications,
and you have no

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.900
image files on your computer,
you can do Create, select

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.750
More, and you'll find all the
applications we have.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.860
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH:
That's correct.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.710
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK,
I think we're done.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.810
We're basically done with
Pixlr Editor and Pixlr

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.900
Express, two great image
editors that

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.746
integrate with Drive.

00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:23.120
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: Two
feature requests.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.700
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, we have
two feature requests for

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.410
Pixlr Editor, and I'm pretty
sure they're going to be fixed

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.060
soon, because so far these
applications are being

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.070
developed and adding new
features very, very, quickly.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.960
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: And feature
request for Pixlr Express

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.080
integrates with the Picker API
as well, so we can open an

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.200
image from the application
directly.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, last
thing before we wrap up.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.190
If you are a developer, and you
want to integrate with the

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.290
Google Drive SDK and you have
technical questions,

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.520
where do you go?

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.240
ALAIN VONGSOUVANH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.260
under the tag Google dash
Drive dash SDK.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.480
We go through the questions
almost every day, and try to

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.640
reply to all of them.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.470
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.200
OK, so see you next time on
Google Developers Live.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.900
Thank you for joining us, and
feel free to reach out to us

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.890
for any feedback.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:14.679
Thank you.
