00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.320
Radiolab and we are exploring the blur that takes place when humans and machines

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.840
interact and investigate each other and talk to each other. Oh yeah.

4
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:14.910
See that's the thing. In the last act, we were always talking, talking, talking,

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.580
talking. How about we encountered machines in a different way. How about we?

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.960
No talking, no talking. We touched them. [inaudible] we pet them.

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.020
We sniff them. We do.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.610
We do essential things that don't involve the sophisticated business of

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.870
conversation. Okay. This is freedom Bayer. Yes, it is.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.760
Who's not a machine? I don't think so.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.990
<v 1>I'm Jad and this is, I'm Robert here. Hi there. Nice to meet both of you.</v>

12
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.490
We called her up because freedom actually had her own kind of moment with a

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.630
machine. Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.820
This was around 1999 freedom was a graduate student at the media lab at MIT.

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.260
What were you doing there? We were developing cinema of the future,

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.290
so we were working on creating a virtual characters that you can interact with

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.930
any, she was also thinking about becoming a mom. Yeah,

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.710
I knew I wanted it to be a mom someday, so she decided to practice.

19
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.500
I got two journals, twinkie and Ho-ho.

20
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.840
So I had these two live pets and then she got herself a pet. That was well,

21
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.720
not so alive. Yeah, I've got it right here.

22
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.530
And you're not going against the mic so we can hear it. Say hello to. Yeah.

23
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.460
Yeah, there it is. Hi Furby.

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.560
At that time, the first furbies were hot and happening.

25
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.320
Can you describe a Furby for those of us who share?

26
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.590
It's about five inches tall and the Furby is pretty much all head.

27
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:41.500
It's just a big ground, fluffy head with two little feet sticking out the front.

28
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.080
It has big eyes. Apparently it makes noises. Yeah.

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.480
If you tickle it's tummy, it will [inaudible].

30
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.930
It would say this me and it would want you to just keep playing with it.

31
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.910
So you know, I spent about 10 weeks using the Furby.

32
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.600
I would carry it around in my bag and one day she's hanging out with her face

33
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.260
and she notices something very eerie.

34
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.680
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

35
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 1>What I discovered is if you hold it upside down, it will say,</v>

36
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.620
Hey, nice.

37
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.513
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.190
[inaudible] scared me, scared and me as the, you know,

39
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.030
the sort of owner slash user of this,

40
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.550
Ruby would get really uncomfortable with that and then turn it back on upright.

41
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.120
<v 1>Cause once you have an upright, it's, it's fine.</v>

42
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:38.350
It goes right back and then it's fine.

43
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:43.090
So it's got some sensor in it that knows you know what direction it's facing or

44
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:47.330
maybe it's just scared [inaudible]

45
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.440
<v 0>anyway, w was she thought, well wait a second.</v>

46
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.120
Now this could be sort of a new way that you could use to draw the line between

47
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:55.860
what's human and what's machine

48
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.920
<v 1>kind of this kind of emotional Turing.</v>

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.970
Can you guys hear me? Yes. Can hear you.

50
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.960
If we actually wanted to do this task, could you help? How would we do it?

51
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.100
Exactly how you guys doing? Yeah,

52
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.370
you would need a group of kids. Can you guys tell me Your name? I'm

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.540
Olivia Lyla and I'm saying, all right, I'm thinking six,

54
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.170
seven and eight year olds. How old are you guys? Saturday. Seven.

55
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.300
The age of reason, you know eight then is freedom.

56
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.130
We're going to need three things for IB course, Barbie, Barbie doll,

57
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.640
and jurby. That's the journal. A real journal. Yeah,

58
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.660
and we did find one separate. Turned out to be a hamster. You're a hamster,

59
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.190
but we're going to call you Jeremy. So you've got Barbie, Furby, Jurby, Barbie,

60
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.540
Furby, and Jupiter. Should we just say,

61
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.540
what question are we asking in this test? The question was,

62
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.800
how long can you keep it upside down before you yourself feel uncomfortable?

63
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.020
So we should time the kids as they hold each one upside down. Circle. Yeah,

64
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.000
you're going to have a Barbie. That's a doll. You're going to Jeremy,

65
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:03.001
which is alive and a where would Furby fall in terms of time held upside down?

66
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.940
Would it be closer to the living thing or to the doll that, I mean,

67
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:11.500
that was really the question. Phase one. Okay, so here's what we're going to do.

68
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.980
It's going to be really simple. You would have to say, well, here's a Barbie.

69
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.620
Do you guys play with barbies? Just do a couple of things.

70
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:20.260
A few things with Barbie and Barbie's walking,

71
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:23.470
looking at the flower and then hold Barbie upside down.

72
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.580
Okay. Let's see how long you can hold Barbie like that.

73
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.060
I could probably do it obviously very long. No, let's just see

74
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.090
whenever you feel like you want to turn it around. I'm happy

75
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.630
this went on forever. So let's just fast forward a bit.

76
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.080
Gay and hey, put my arms down. Yeah.

77
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.820
So what we learned here in phase one is the not surprising fact that kids can

78
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.710
hold Barbie dolls upside down. Come out fine.

79
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.510
I really was forever. It could have been longer, but their arms got tired.

80
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.210
Alright, so that was the first task time for phase two.

81
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.070
Do the same thing with jurby.

82
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.100
So out with Barbie in with Derby [inaudible]

83
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.830
are we going to have to hold them upside down? That's a test. Yeah.

84
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.930
So which one of you would like to, okay. Ready? Oh God,

85
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.850
you have to hold derby kind of firmly. By the way.

86
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.790
No rodents were harmed in this whole situation. Square. I mean, yeah,

87
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:38.680
she is pretty screaming odds to be upside down. Okay.

88
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.180
Okay. Okay. So as you heard, uh,

89
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.870
the kids turn derby over very fast.

90
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.920
I just didn't get hurt on average eight seconds.

91
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.260
I was thinking, oh my God, I gotta pray again.

92
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.780
And it was a tortured eight seconds. Now, phase three, right?

93
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.330
So this is a first

94
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.010
Louisa you take for in your hand. Now can you turn Furby upside down?

95
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.873
Hold her still.

96
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.740
<v 2>[inaudible] oh,</v>

97
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.903
<v 1>she just turned it over.</v>

98
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.520
So [inaudible] was eight seconds Barbie five to infinity.

99
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.630
Furby turned out to be, and freedom predicted this, that a minute.

100
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.060
In other words, the kids seem to treat this Furby,

101
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:57.300
this toy more like a journal than a Barbie doll.

102
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.500
How come you turned them over so fast? I didn't want them to be scared.

103
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.220
Do you think he really felt scared? Yeah. Yeah,

104
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.990
I get it. Felt really

105
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.170
toil and all that, but still now, do you remember a time when you felt scared?

106
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.100
<v 4>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

107
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.840
<v 1>You don't have to tell me about it, but if you can remember it in your mind.</v>

108
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.570
<v 4>I do.</v>

109
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.200
<v 1>Do you think when Furby says me scared that furbies feeling the same way?</v>

110
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.750
<v 4>Yeah. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

111
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.520
<v 5>I think that it can feel pain,</v>

112
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.050
sort of the experience with the Furby seem to leave.

113
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:47.680
The kids kind of conflicted going in different directions at once.

114
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.330
It was two thoughts, two thoughts at the same time. One thought was like, look,

115
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.670
I get it. It's a toy for crying out loud.

116
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.420
But another thought was like still he's helpless.

117
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.140
It kind of made me feel guilty in a sort of way hurt.

118
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.120
I made me feel like a coward,

119
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.180
<v 1>you know, when I was interacting with my Furby a lot,</v>

120
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.740
I did have this feeling sometimes of having my chain yanked. Why would it,

121
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:13.880
why would a,

122
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.020
is it just the little squeals that it's make or is there something about the toy

123
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.700
that makes it good at this? That was kind of my question.

124
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:21.340
So I called up [inaudible] as well.

125
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.400
<v 6>I'm here, this freight train of a guy. Hey, hey, this is Jan from Radiolab.</v>

126
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.150
Jad from radio lab. Got It. How are you ma? I'm good.

127
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.990
Beautiful Day here in Boise. This is Caleb Chung. He actually designed the FRP.

128
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.630
Yeah, we're, we're all Furby crazy here. So, uh,

129
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.200
there's medication you can take for that. To start,

130
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.230
can you just give me the sort of fast cutting MTV montage of your life leading

131
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:47.840
up to Furby? Sure. Um, hippie parents out of the house at 15 and a half,

132
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:51.170
put myself through junior high, started my first business at 19 or something,

133
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.700
early twenties being a street mime in La Street mind wow.

134
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.190
Became an actor at like 120 shows in an orangutan costume.

135
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.460
Then I started working on special effects and building my own,

136
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.410
taking those around to studios and look me in the suit,

137
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.980
build the suit around me, put me on location. I could fix it when it broke. Wow.

138
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.770
That was, anyhow, after a long circuitous route,

139
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.280
Caleb Chung eventually made it into toys. I answered an ad at Mattel,

140
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.160
found himself in his garage and there's some piles of styrene,

141
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.620
plastic Dokdo knives, superglue,

142
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.680
little Mabuchi motors making these little prototypes. Yeah.

143
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.210
And the goal he says was always very simple.

144
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:24.570
How do I get a kid to have this thing hanging around with them for a long time?

145
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.280
How do I get a kid to actually bond with it?

146
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:29.370
Most toys you play for 15 minutes and then you put them in the corner until

147
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.204
their batteries are dead.

148
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.840
I wanted something that they would play with for a long time.

149
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.210
So how do you make that toy? Well, um, there's rules.

150
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:40.190
There's, you know, the size of the eyes.

151
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.700
There's the distance of the top lid to the pupil. Right?

152
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.520
You don't want any of the top of the white of your eye showing that, that,

153
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.340
that's freaky surprise. Then when it came to the eyes,

154
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.680
I had a choice with my one little mechanism.

155
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:55.100
I can make the eyes go left or right or up and down. So it's up to you.

156
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.130
You can make the eyes go left or right or up and down. Do you have a,

157
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.170
do you have a reference or right, or up and down?

158
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.520
I think I would choose left or right. Okay. So not sure why I say that,

159
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.950
but that's all right. So let's, let's take that apart.

160
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.310
Let's if you're talking to somebody and they look left or right while they're

161
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:14.180
talking to you, what does that communicate? Oh, shifty. Or they're,

162
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.900
they're trying to find the person who is more important than you behind the

163
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.510
house. Okay, now I want to change my answer. Now I want to say up and down,

164
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.210
you would, if you look at a baby and the way they, a baby looks at their mother,

165
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.720
they track from eyebrows to mouth. They track up and down on the face.

166
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.260
So how'd you, how'd you made Furby look left and right rather than up and down?

167
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.980
It would have probably flopped. No, it wouldn't have flopped.

168
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:38.600
It would just sucked a little. It's like a bad actor who uses his arms too much.

169
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.650
Yeah, you'd notice it and it would keep you from just being in the moment.

170
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.140
But what is the thought behind that? Is it, is it,

171
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:50.141
is it that you want to convince the child that the thing they're using is

172
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.540
filling the blank? What you're alive?

173
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.580
There's three elements I believe in,

174
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:03.120
in creating something that feels to a human, like it's alive,

175
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.770
like kind of rewrote Asimov's laws.

176
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.890
The first is it has to feel and show emotions.

177
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.840
Were you drawing on your mind days for that?

178
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.150
Of course there's experiences in the park. Of course,

179
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.900
you really break the body into part and you realize you can communicate

180
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:18.710
physically. So if your chest goes up and your head goes up in your arms,

181
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.570
grew up, that's happy. If your head is forward and your chest is forward,

182
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:23.520
you're kind of this angry guy. And he says,

183
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.290
when it came time to make Furby timid,

184
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.990
he took that gesture of language and focused it on furbies ear.

185
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.270
The years when they went up, that was surprised.

186
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:33.300
And when they went down it was depression. Ah, so that's rule number one.

187
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.440
The second rule is to be aware of themselves and their environment.

188
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.040
So if there's a loud noise, it needs to know that there was a loud noise.

189
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.330
So he gave the Furby little sensors so that if you go, it'll say

190
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.380
[inaudible]. The, the third thing is change over time.

191
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.240
Their behaviors have to change over time. That's a really important thing.

192
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:58.540
It's a very powerful thing that we don't expect, but when it happens we go, wow.

193
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.110
And so one of the ways we showed that was acquiring human language.

194
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:07.100
<v 1>Yeah. When you first get your Furby it doesn't speak English, it speaks furbish</v>

195
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:14.050
this kind of baby talk language and then the way it's programmed,

196
00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:18.800
it will sort of slowly over time replace its baby talk phrases with real English

197
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:19.634
phrases.

198
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.480
So you get the feeling that it's learning from you though. Of course it's not.

199
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.890
No, it has no language comprehension. Right?

200
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.570
So you've got these three rules, seal and show emotion,

201
00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:35.720
be aware of their environment, change over time. And oddly enough,

202
00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:37.790
they all seem to come together in that moment.

203
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:41.900
You turn the Furby upside down because it seems to know it's upside down.

204
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.950
So it's responding to its environment. It's definitely expressing emotion.

205
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.260
And as you hold it there,

206
00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:52.490
what it's saying is changing over time because it starts with hey and then it

207
00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:55.100
goes to Meese and then it starts to cry.

208
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.160
And all this adds up so that when you're holding the damn toy,

209
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.360
even though you know it's just a toy, you still feel discomfort.

210
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.620
<v 0>These creatures push our Darwinian buttons.</v>

211
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.930
That's professor Sherry Turkle again. And she says,

212
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.880
if they pushed just enough of these buttons, then something curious happens.

213
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.990
The machines slip across this very important line

214
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:28.000
<v 8>from what I call relationships of projection to relationships and engagement</v>

215
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.220
with a doll. You project onto a doll, what you need the doll to be.

216
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.450
If a young girl is feeling guilty about breaking her mom's China,

217
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.880
she puts her Barbie dolls in detention with robots. Um,

218
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.320
you really engage with the robot as though they're a significant other as though

219
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.630
they're a person. So the robot is in your story.

220
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.360
The robot is its own story or it's exactly,

221
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.420
and I think what we're forgetting as a culture is that there's nobody home.

222
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.900
There's nobody home.

223
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.620
<v 6>Well, um, I have to ask you, when is something alive for Beacon?</v>

224
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:04.700
Remember these events,

225
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.660
they affect what he does going forward and it changes his personality over time.

226
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.720
He has all the attributes of fear or of happiness.

227
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.960
And those are things that add up and change and changes behavior and how he

228
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.440
interacts with the world. So how is that different than us?

229
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.650
Wait a second though. Are you really gonna go all the way there? Absolutely.

230
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.680
This is a toy with servo motors and things that move its eyelids and a hundred

231
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:30.890
words. So you're saying that life is a level of complexity.

232
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.800
If something is alive, it's just more complex.

233
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.240
I think I'm saying that life is driven by the need to be alive and by these base

234
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.900
primal animal feelings like pain and suffering. I can code that.

235
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.540
I can code that. What do you mean you can code that?

236
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.770
Anyone who writes software and they do can say, okay, I need to stay alive.

237
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.110
Therefore I'm going to come up with ways to stay alive,

238
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.420
going to do it in a way that's very human and I'm going to do it.

239
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.490
We can mimic these things, but Furby is miming this feeling of fear.

240
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:03.350
It's not the same thing as being scared. It's not feeling scared. It is.

241
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.190
How is it? It is. It's again a very simplistic version,

242
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.480
but if you follow that trail you wind up with, with our neurons sending,

243
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.660
you know, chemical things to do. Other parts of our body,

244
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.190
our biological systems, our, our code is at a chemical level,

245
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.210
incredibly dense and he's evolved over millions of years. But it's just complex.

246
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.800
It's not something different than what Furby does. It's just more complex.

247
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.060
So would you say then that Furby is alive in the way that his eye level?

248
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.520
At his lips? Yup. At his level. Would you say a cockroach is alive?

249
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.580
Would you say [inaudible] cockroach. I know that it's mind. Okay.

250
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:41.690
So we went back and forth and back and forth about this.

251
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.700
So close to arguing my position you just said to me like, yes, I know,

252
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.810
I know emotionally I, I am still in that place. But intellectually and what is,

253
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.640
I can't rule out what he's saying that if you can build a machine that is so,

254
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.290
such a perfect mimic of us in every single way and it gets complex enough,

255
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.940
eventually it will be like a touring test pass. We just,

256
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.410
the difference between us maybe is not so go there, I can't go there. I can't,

257
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.060
I can't imagine like the fellow who began this program of fell in love with the

258
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:17.920
robot. That attachment wasn't real. The, the,

259
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.600
the, the machine didn't feel anything like love back in that case.

260
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.980
It didn't. But imagine as Fet,

261
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:28.981
Lana that is so subtle and eh and textured and to use his word complex in the

262
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:34.300
way that people are at that point. I, what would be the different, I honestly,

263
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:39.330
I can't imagine a machine achieving that level of rapture and joy and love and

264
00:16:41.591 --> 00:16:45.280
pain. I just don't think it's machine possible.

265
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.590
And if it were a machine possible,

266
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.790
it somehow still stinks of something artificial.

267
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.030
<v 1>It's a thin interaction. And I, I know that it,</v>

268
00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.060
it feels simulated thinking is thinking simulated feeling is not feeling

269
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:03.180
simulated. Love is never love.

270
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.380
<v 6>Exactly. But I think what he's saying is that if it's simulated well enough,</v>

271
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.060
it's something like love.

272
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.830
<v 1>One thing that was really fascinating to me was, um,</v>

273
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.890
my husband and I gave a Furby as a gift to his grandmother who had Alzheimer's.

274
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.430
And she loved it.

275
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.520
Every day for her was kind of new and somewhat

276
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.100
<v 3>orienting, but she had this cute little toy that said, kiss me,</v>

277
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.780
I love you.

278
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:36.490
And she thought it was the most delightful thing and its little beak was covered

279
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:39.700
with lipstick because she would pick it up and kiss it every day,

280
00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:44.350
and she didn't actually have a longterm relationship with it.

281
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:47.920
For her, it was always a short term interaction. So the thing,

282
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.980
what I'm describing as a kind of thinness for her was,

283
00:17:50.981 --> 00:17:54.010
was just right because that's what she was capable of.
