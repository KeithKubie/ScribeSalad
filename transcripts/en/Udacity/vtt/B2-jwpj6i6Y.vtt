00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.770
There're theories in psychology that psychologists don't necessarily agree on.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.994
And one of them is language acquisition. But, lucky for you, we have two very

00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:11.354
skilled PhD level psychologists, Greg and Susan, here to discuss their

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:15.741
different views. And this will allow you to make an education decision about

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.147
the strengths and weaknesses of each theory. As well as what each theory helps

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:23.710
us to accomplish. So I'm going to step out for a little while, and let Greg and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.280
Susan take over the lesson. I'll see you guys a little later. Have fun thinking

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.390
like true psychologists.
