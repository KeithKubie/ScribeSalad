00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.070
So take a look at this diagram.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; Can you tell me what this is?

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Amie, it's an ear.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.029
&gt;&gt; Okay, it is and can you tell me what

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.570
happens when a sound wave comes and enters our ear?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.200
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm guessing it's collected by this tube thing here right?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.800
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that tube thing is called the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.520
ear canal. And then what do you think happens?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.590
&gt;&gt; Then, it gets to this thing here.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.470
&gt;&gt; That's right. And this thing is called the eardrum, and it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.510
a tight membrane that vibrates at the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.740
same frequency as this incoming sound wave.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.680
&gt;&gt; That's really cool Andy, but then, what

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.280
are these things that's connected to the eardrum?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; These are three tiny bones. So. The

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.730
vibrations in the eardrum cause these bones to vibrate.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.010
&gt;&gt; Alright, well then, what happens when

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.540
the vibrations get to this curly thing here?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.470
&gt;&gt; Right, this curly snake like looking thing is

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.350
called the cochlea. And the cochlea is filled with fluid. So, when the bones

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.450
here vibrate, they actually cause the fluid in the cochlea to vibrate as well.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.170
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we have vibrating air, which goes in to vibrate

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.950
the eardrum, which vibrates the bones, which vibrates the fluid in the cochlea?

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.470
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and lining the inside of this cochlea are

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.960
thousands of tiny little hairs. And when these hairs vibrate,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.940
they cause neurons to fire. The signal gets sent off to part of the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.060
brain called the temporal lobe, which is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.300
where it's interpreted as sound. Something else that's

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.310
amazing is that the different frequencies who

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.940
actually cause different hairs in the cochlea

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.060
to vibrate. Which is part of how we're able to hear so many different sounds.
