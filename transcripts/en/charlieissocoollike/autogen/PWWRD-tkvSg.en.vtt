finishing stamp the idea behind this is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
finishing stamp the idea behind this is
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920
finishing stamp the idea behind this is
very simple if I finish something that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
very simple if I finish something that
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900
very simple if I finish something that
I'm working on then I get to put a stamp

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
I'm working on then I get to put a stamp
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.290
I'm working on then I get to put a stamp
on it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
on it
 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.790
on it
and because putting stamps on things is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800
and because putting stamps on things is
 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.530
and because putting stamps on things is
fun it encourages me to finish more

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
fun it encourages me to finish more
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.570
fun it encourages me to finish more
things and that's it admittedly it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
things and that's it admittedly it
 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.830
things and that's it admittedly it
probably doesn't seem like a bit of a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
probably doesn't seem like a bit of a
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.020
probably doesn't seem like a bit of a
weird incentive but for example I'm very

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
weird incentive but for example I'm very
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.970
weird incentive but for example I'm very
