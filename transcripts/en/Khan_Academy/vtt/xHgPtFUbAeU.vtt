00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:04.592
We saw in the last video that when you multiply or you divide

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:07.187
numbers, or (I guess I should say when you multiply or

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:12.569
divide measurements) your result can only have as many

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.067
significant digits as the thing with the smallest significant

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.333
digits you ended up multiplying and dividing.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:28.789
So just as a quick example, if I have 2.00 times (I don't know)

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.058
3.5 my answer over here can only have 2 significant digits

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:41.559
This has 2 significant digits, this has 3. 2 times 3.5

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.311
is 7, and we can get to 1 zero to the right of the decimal.

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:48.912
Because we can have 2 significant digits.

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:50.328
This was 3, this is 2.

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:53.575
We only limited it to 2, because that was the smallest

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.605
number of significant digits we had in all of the things

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.712
that we were taking the product of.

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:00.152
When we do addition and subtraction, it's a little bit different.

00:01:00.152 --> 00:01:01.627
And I'll do an example first.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:06.227
I just do a kind of a numerical example first, and then I'll think of a little bit more of a real world example.

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:09.027
And obviously even my real world examples aren't really real world.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.026
In my last video, I talked about laying down carpet

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:13.776
and someone rightfully pointed out,"Hey, if you are laying down

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:17.267
carpet, you always want to round up. Just because you don't wanna

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.875
it's easier to cut carpet away, then somehow glue carpet there.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:24.467
But that's particular to carpet. I was just saying a general way

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.420
to think about precision in significant figures.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.286
That was only particular to carpets or tiles.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:34.679
But when you add, when you add, or subtract,

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.409
now these significant digits or these significant figures don't matter as much

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.867
as the actual precision of the things that you are adding.

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:45.333
How many decimal places do you go? For example,

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:53.996
if I were to add 1.26, and I were to add it to - let's say - to 2.3.

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:57.200
If you just add these two numbers up, and let's say these are measurements,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.956
so when you make it (these are clearly 3

00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:02.886
significant digits) we're able to measure to the nearest hundreth.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:06.967
Here this is two significant digits so three significant digits

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:10.303
this is two significant digits, we are able to measure to the nearest tenth.

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:14.008
Let me label this. This is the hundredth

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.998
and this is the tenth. When you add or subtract numbers,

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:20.229
your answer, so if you just do this, if we just add these

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:24.499
two numbers, I get - what? - 3.56.

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:30.799
The sum, or the difference whatever you take, you don't count significant figures

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.099
You don't say,"Hey, this can only have two significant figures."

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.233
What you can say is, "This can only be as precise as the least precise thing that I had over here.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.965
The least precise thing I had over here is 2.3.

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:44.129
It only went to the tenths place, so in our answer

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.233
we can only go to the tenths place. So we need to round

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:54.166
this guy up. Cause we have a six right here, so we round up

00:02:54.166 --> 00:03:00.383
so if you care about significant figures, this is going to become a 3.7.

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:02.466
And I want to be clear. This time it worked out,

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:04.048
cause this also has 2 significant figures,

00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:06.899
this also has two significant figures. But this could have been...

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:12.129
(let me do another situation) you could have 1.26 plus

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.768
102.3, and you would get obviously 103.56.

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:23.396
Then, in this situation - this obviously over here has 4 significant figures,

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:26.768
this over here has 3 significant figures. But in our answer

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:29.501
we don't want to have 3 significant figures. We wanna have the...

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.768
only as precise as the least precise thing that we added up.

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:36.400
The least precise thing we only go one digit behind the decimal over here,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.035
so we can only go to the tenth, only one digit over the decimal there.

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:45.234
So once again, we round it up to 103.6.

00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:49.317
And to see why that makes sense, let's do a little bit of an example here

00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:50.769
with actually measuring something.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.628
So let's say we have a block here,

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:56.896
let's say that I have a block, we draw that block a little bit neater,

00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:59.069
and let's say we have a pretty good meter stick,

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.501
and we're able to measure to the nearest centimeter,

00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:06.901
we get, it is 2.09 meters.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:14.368
Let's say we have another block, and this is the other block right over there.

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:18.638
We have a, let's say we have an even more precise meter stick,

00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.501
which can measure to the nearest millimeter.

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:26.319
And we get this to be 1.901 meters.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.402
So measuring to the nearest millimeter.

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.166
And let's say those measurements were done a long time ago,

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.237
and we don't have access to measure them any more,

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:36.649
but someone says 'How tall is it if I were stack the blue block

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:40.228
on the top of the red block - or the orange block, or whatever that color that is?"

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.736
So how high would this height be?

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:45.814
Well, if you didn't care about significant figures or precision,

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:47.236
you would just add them up.

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:52.982
You'd add the 1.901 plus the 2.09.

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:54.168
So let me add those up:

00:04:54.168 --> 00:05:01.643
so if you take 1.901 and add that to 2.09,

00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:05.986
you get 1 plus nothing is 1,

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:07.968
0 plus 9 is 9,

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:09.501
9 plus 0 is 9,

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:10.835
you get the decimal point,

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:15.168
1 plus 2 is 3. So you get 3.991.

00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:19.508
And the problem with this, the reason why this is a little bit...

00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.832
it's kind of misrepresenting how precise you measurement is.

00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:26.811
You don't know, if I told you that the tower is 3.991 meters tall,

00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.768
I'm implying that I somehow was able to measure

00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:32.234
the entire tower to the nearest millimeter.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:34.442
The reality is that I was only be able to

00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:36.508
measure the part of the tower to the millimeter.

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:39.835
This part of the tower I was able to measure to the nearest centimeter.

00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:43.101
So to make it clear the our measurement is only good

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:44.307
to the nearest centimeter,

00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:46.067
because there is more error here, then...

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:50.101
it might overwhelm or whatever the precision we had on the millimeters there.

00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:53.168
To make that clear, we have to make this only as precise

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:55.708
as the least precise thing that we are adding up.

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:58.818
So over here, the least precise thing was, we went to the hundredths,

00:05:58.818 --> 00:06:01.501
so over here we have to round to the hundredths.

00:06:01.501 --> 00:06:04.832
So, since 1 is less then 5, we are going to round down,

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:06.968
and so we can only legitimately say,

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.646
if we want to represent what we did properly

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:12.311
that the tower is 3.99 meters.

00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:16.174
And I also want to make it clear that this doesn't just apply

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:17.811
to when there is a decimal point.

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:23.105
If I were tell you that... Let's say that I were to measure...

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:25.239
I want to measure a building.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.035
I was only able to measure the building to the nearest 10 feet.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:32.155
So I tell you that that building is 350 feet tall.

00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:34.615
So this is the building.

00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:37.830
This is a building.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.708
And let's say there is a manufacturer of radio antennas, so...

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.366
or radio towers.

00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:49.378
And the manufacturers has measured their tower to the nearest foot.

00:06:49.378 --> 00:06:53.715
And they say, their tower is 8 feet tall.

00:06:53.715 --> 00:06:56.174
So notice: here they measure to the nearest 10 feet,

00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:58.100
here they measure to the nearest foot.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.234
And actually to make it clear, because once again,

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:01.900
as I said, this is ambiguous,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.167
it's not 100% clear how many significant figures there are.

00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:09.241
Maybe it was exactly 350 feet or maybe they just rounded it to the nearest 10 feet.

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:10.878
So a better way to represent this,

00:07:10.878 --> 00:07:14.234
they... would be to say instead of writing it 350,

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:21.234
a better way to write it would be 3.5 times 10 to the second feet tall.

00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:22.835
And when you are writing in scientific notation,

00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:26.635
that makes it very clear that there is only 2 significant digits here,

00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:28.635
you are only measuring to the nearest 10 feet.

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:30.167
Other way to represent it:

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:33.242
you could write 350 this notation has done less,

00:07:33.242 --> 00:07:36.768
but sometimes the last significant digit has a line on the top of it,

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:39.635
or the last significant digit has a line below it.

00:07:39.635 --> 00:07:42.460
Either of those are ways to specify it,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.968
this is probably the least ambiguous,

00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:47.794
but assuming that they only make measure to the nearest 10 feet,

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:52.100
If someone were ask you: "How tall is the building plus the tower?"

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.301
Well, your first reaction were, let's just add

00:07:54.301 --> 00:07:58.213
the 350 plus 8, you get 358.

00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:04.715
You'd get 358 feet. So this is the building plus the tower. 358 feet.

00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:06.900
For once again, we are misrepresenting it.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.794
We are making it look like we were able

00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:10.842
to measure the combination to the nearest foot.

00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:13.642
But we were able to measure only the tower to the nearest foot.

00:08:13.642 --> 00:08:19.568
So in order to represent our measurement at the level of precision at we really did,

00:08:19.568 --> 00:08:22.042
we really have to round this to the nearest 10 feet.

00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:24.635
Because that was our least precise measurement.

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:26.840
So we would really have to round this up to,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.234
8 is greater-than-or-equal to 5,

00:08:29.234 --> 00:08:33.710
so we round this up to 360 feet.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.768
So once again, whatever is...

00:08:35.768 --> 00:08:39.044
Just to make it clear, even this ambiguous,

00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:42.301
maybe we put a line over to show, that is our level of precision,

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:43.968
that we have 2 significant digits.

00:08:43.968 --> 00:08:49.301
Or we could write this as 3.6 times 10 to the second.

00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:50.301
Which is times 100.

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.382
3.6 times 10 to the second feet in scientific notation.

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:57.567
And this makes it very clear that we only have 2 significant digits here.
