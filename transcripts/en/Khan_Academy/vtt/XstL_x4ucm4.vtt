00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.352
- [Voiceover] "Vivek and Camila's
teacher gave them a system

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.185
"of linear equations to solve.

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.118
"They each took a few steps that lead

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.284
"to the systems shown in the table below."

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:10.052
So we have the teacher's original system,

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.450
what Vivek got after
doing some operations,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.552
what Camila got after
doing some operations.

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:17.484
Which of them obtained a
system that is equivalent

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.018
to the teacher's system?

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.651
So the first question
we should ask ourselves

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:24.151
is what does it mean to even
have an equivalent system?

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.152
For the sake of this
question, or for our purposes,

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:29.918
an equivalent system is a system
that has the same solution.

00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:32.418
So if there's some X-Y pair that satisfies

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.585
the teacher's system that is the solution

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.218
to the teacher's system.

00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:38.418
Well Vivek's system, we're
gonna call it equivalent

00:00:38.418 --> 00:00:41.011
if it has the same solution.

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.118
Similarly, if Camila's
system has the same solution,

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:48.851
then we're gonna call it
equivalent to the teacher's system.

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:50.751
So let's make some comparisons here.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.451
So first let's look at Vivek.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.051
So his first equation
is actually unchanged

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.917
from the teacher's equation,

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:58.618
is unchanged from the teacher's equation,

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:02.551
so any solution that meets
both of these equations

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.018
is for sure gonna meet this top equation

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:07.251
because it's literally the
same as the top equation

00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:08.984
of the teacher, so that works out.

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.521
Also look at the second one.

00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.551
The second one is definitely a
different equation over here.

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:17.551
We can check that it's
not just being multiplied

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.977
by some number on both sides.

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.618
To go from one to zero
if you were multiplying,

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:25.251
you would have to multiply one times zero

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.351
and then in order to
maintain the equality,

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.918
you would have to do that on both sides.

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:31.218
But zero times this left-hand
side would have been zero,

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:33.085
you would have gotten zero equals zero,

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.918
so he didn't just scale
both sides by some number,

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.317
looks like he did another operation.

00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:41.984
He probably looks like
he's adding or subtracting

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.252
something to both sides, so let's see how

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:45.351
he could have gotten this right over here.

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:48.521
So he took -4x

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.701
plus 5y is equal to one.

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.717
And it looks like from
that he was able to get

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:57.118
- 3x plus 7y

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.288
is equal to zero.

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:02.251
So let's see what he had to do to do that.

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.818
Let's see, he would have had to,

00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:07.217
to go from -4x to -3x,

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.717
he would have had to add an X,

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:11.384
so I could just write
an X right over there.

00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:12.851
To go from 5y to 7y,

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:14.917
he would have had to add 2y.

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.717
So on the left-hand side,
he would have to add

00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:18.284
X plus 2y.

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:20.818
Notice we have an X plus
2y right over there.

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:23.251
And on the right-hand side,
he would have had to add

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.551
or subtract a one, or add a negative one.

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:28.251
Notice we see a negative
one right over there.

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.084
So what he essentially did is
he added the left-hand sides

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.451
of these two equations to
get this new left-hand side

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.184
right over here, and he
added the right-hand sides

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:39.818
to get this new right-hand side.

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:42.534
And that is a legitimate operation.

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.384
This new equation that you got,

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:48.452
this new linear equation,
it's going to represent

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:51.285
a different line than
this one right over here,

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:55.018
but the resulting system is
going to have the same solution.

00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:56.984
Why do we feel confident
that the resulting system

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.019
is going to have the same solution?

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.019
Well for an X-Y pair that
satisfies both of these equations,

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:06.351
that's what a solution would be,

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:09.452
for that X-Y pair, X plus 2y

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:11.585
is equal to negative one.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:13.051
So for that solution,

00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:15.385
we're adding the same thing to both sides.

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.784
We're saying: "Look,
I'm gonna add X plus 2y

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.884
"to the left-hand side.

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:23.584
"Well if I don't wanna
change the solution,

00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:26.284
"I have to add the same thing
to the right-hand side."

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:29.251
Well they're telling us for
the solution to this equation,

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.584
X plus 2y is equal to negative one,

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.318
so negative one is the
same thing as X plus 2y

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.917
for that solution, so
we're not gonna change

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.584
the resulting solution of the system,

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.251
so it's a completely legitimate
operation what Vivek did

00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:42.517
is adding the left-hand sides

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:43.751
and adding the right-hand sides

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.651
to get this new second equation.

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.850
That's not going to change
the solution of the system.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.518
In fact, that's a technique we often use

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.185
to eventually find the
solution of a system.

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:54.785
So now let's look at Camila, or Camila.

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:58.318
So her first equation is
actually the exact same equation

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:02.617
as the teacher's second equation.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.318
Now let's see, her second equation,

00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:08.351
how does it relate possibly
to the first equation?

00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.317
So just looking at it offhand,

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:11.819
it looks like it might just be,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.750
it looks like she just multiplied
both sides times a number.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.485
And it looks like that
number, she clearly multiplied

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:20.917
the right-hand side times negative eight.

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.151
So times negative eight.

00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:26.884
Negative one times negative
eight is positive eight.

00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:29.051
And it looks like she also multiplied

00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:30.618
the left-hand side by negative eight.

00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:33.384
Negative eight times X is -8X.

00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:36.717
Negative eight times 2y is -16y.

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:39.718
So she just multiplied both
sides by the same value

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.284
which actually doesn't
change the equation.

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:43.105
This actually is going to be--

00:04:43.105 --> 00:04:44.834
It changes it the way it looks,

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.951
but it actually represents the same line.

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:51.232
So this is definitely
still an equivalent system.

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:52.851
These are still the same constraints.

00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:54.718
You're going to have the same solution.

00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.118
Whenever you're dealing with systems,

00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:58.818
you're not going to change
the solution of the system

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:02.885
as long as you either multiply
both sides of an equation by

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.651
a scaler, or you are adding
and subtracting the equations.

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.184
When I say add or subtract the equations,

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:09.085
you're adding the left-hand
side to the left-hand side,

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:10.752
adding the right-hand side
to the right-hand side

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:14.285
like we had here, or subtracting
the one from the other

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.651
on the left-hand side and
if we subtract the bottom

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:17.718
from the top on the left-hand

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.751
and we subtract the bottom
from the top on the right-hand,

00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:21.785
it's not going to change our solution.

00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:25.417
So both of them obtained a
system that is equivalent,

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:27.385
meaning that it has the same solution

00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:30.189
as the teacher's system.
