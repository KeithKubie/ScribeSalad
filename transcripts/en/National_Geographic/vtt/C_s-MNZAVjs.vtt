00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.633
[music playing]

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.467
Let's go, [inaudible].

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.367
FEDERICO PISANI (VOICEOVER):
We've come here to Angel Falls

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.500
to climb this huge overhang.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.266
One of the biggest in the world.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.266
You just feel like
you're flying when

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.333
you're hanging from the wall.

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:40.367
The sound of the waterfall
is like a constant storm.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.400
Climbing Angel Falls
is very dangerous.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
I wanna keep climbing.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.033
You wanna take the lead?

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.367
Yeah, of course.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.767
FEDERICO PISANI
(VOICEOVER): Where

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:24.867
the rock is being more exposed
to the water, the rock,

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.633
it's crumbly.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:32.500
It's very sandy, so I'm going
to put one protection here.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
Wanna be really careful in this.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:40.734
FEDERICO PISANI (VOICEOVER):
On the other hand, where there

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.200
is no water at all,
you can see the rock

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.333
is completely different.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.834
How does it look?

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.900
It's very hard.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.867
FEDERICO PISANI (VOICEOVER):
It's extremely hard.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:52.734
Are you [inaudible]?

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:53.567
Yeah.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:54.834
I will try.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.800
[grunting]

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.500
FEDERICO PISANI (VOICEOVER):
When you get to see

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.066
this landscape from above--

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.633
All right!

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.500
[chuckle]

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.033
FEDERICO PISANI (VOICEOVER):
--you can see how the water

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.767
is a big destroyer, in a way.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:22.767
It dissolves the rocks.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:35.200
The continuous flow of
water for millions of years

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.834
made this incredible
island in the sky.
