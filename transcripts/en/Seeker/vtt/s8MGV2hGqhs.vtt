00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.860
The United States in 1969.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.240
Nixon [We are caught in war, wanting peace.]

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.400
Nixon [We are torn by division, wanting unity.]

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.980
There wasn’t a whole lot for Americans to
celebrate.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.500
Nixon [We find ourselves rich in goods, but
ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.619
precision for the moon, but falling into raucous
discord on earth.]

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.660
The race to space was one of the things that
made the decade a little more bearable.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.059
But soon, the 60s would become the 70s and
NASA still had two crucial missions to complete

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.860
before it could even attempt to put a man
on the moon.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.219
Time was running out.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.640
It had been eight years since President Kennedy
put NASA on a path to our nearest celestial neighbor.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.159
Now, in 1969, newly inaugurated president
Richard Nixon would be the leader to ensure

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.460
mankind’s giant leap before the turn of
the decade.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.440
NASA just marked a major milestone with Apollo
8 proving we were capable of reaching lunar orbit.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.560
But the possibility of a lunar landing was
still uncertain.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.220
The Lunar Module, or LEM would be the crucial
bridge to the moon, and it was finally time

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.930
for a manned test.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.770
The LEM was the vehicle that would take two
astronauts from the Command-Service Module

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.640
to the lunar surface and back again.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.720
The Apollo 9 crew would be the first to operate
this spacecraft in orbit and they decided

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.980
to name their Lunar Module, Spider... because
well, it looked like a spider.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.500
The small spacecraft had two sections: the
ascent and descent stages.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.969
The upper section carried the crew and housed
the control systems and ascent rocket engine

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.649
while, the lower section consisted of the
descent rocket engine, lunar surface experiments

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.200
and the landing gear.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.580
But before the LEM could get anywhere close
to the moon, one of the most sophisticated

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.970
and dangerous series of maneuvers for the
Apollo Program needed to be perfected.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.740
Apollo 9 launched on March 3, 1969 with astronauts James McDivitt, David Scott

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.900
and Russell, “Rusty” Schweickart aboard.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.080
Once in Earth’s orbit, the S-IVB’s engine
was fired and propelled the crew on a translunar flight.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.220
This is where things got complicated.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.250
The CSM and the Lunar Module were stacked
separate on the rocket and they needed to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.800
connect before venturing closer to the moon.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.220
The crew did this through a maneuver known
as transposition and docking.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.820
Successful docking created a sealed, pressurized
tunnel between the two spacecraft which the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.320
astronauts used to transfer from one spacecraft
to the other.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.000
Apollo 9 proved that the maneuvers worked as designed and gave the astronauts access to the Lunar Module.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.460
On the fifth day of the mission, the crew
undocked the Lunar Module.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.360
McDivitt and Schweickart took Spider on an
excursion successfully testing the ascent

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.700
stage and ability to re-dock with the CSM.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.060
Since the Lunar Module was designed to only
operate in space, once the mission was complete,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.120
the crew had to cut Spider loose before returning
to earth.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.460
Apollo 9 splashed down on March 13th, and
just two months later NASA launched Apollo 10.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.220
This mission encompassed all the aspects of a
crewed lunar landing… except the landing part.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.740
The veteran Apollo 10 team, Thomas Stafford,
John Young and Eugene Cernan named their CSM

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.480
Charlie Brown and their Lunar Module Snoopy

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.680
which had become a safety mascot of sorts for NASA.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.640
The crew completed many of the same tests as the mission before but with some added pressure.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.900
This time, millions of people were watching.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.900
Apollo 10 was the first mission to broadcast
a live color TV transmission, giving Earthlings

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.290
a new view from space.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.810
Stafford and Cernan flew the Lunar Module closer to
the moon’s surface than ever before, gaining

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.320
insight into the lunar gravitational field
and scouting the landing site for Apollo 11.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.620
But about 12 kilometers from the moon’s surface, Snoopy began to spin out of control.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.360
The spacecraft was nearing gimbal lock - which
essentially meant that the guidance system

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.340
could no longer trust its computer.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.040
According to a NASA engineer, the result is
similar to when a car spins out on an icy road.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.440
Fortunately, the astronauts were able to quickly
regain control, but if they hadn’t, the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.459
spacecraft would have lost its navigation
system and could have slammed into the moon.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.539
Despite that near disastrous human caused hiccup, the mission was relatively smooth.

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.650
Most importantly the Lunar Module did its
job… again.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.729
The United States was finally ready to put
a man on the moon.

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.040
For over a decade, all of NASA’s astronauts
had been training for this moment.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.160
From the jungle to the desert to the ocean,
the Apollo crews were pushed to the limit,

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.870
and in some cases risked and even gave their lives for this goal.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.000
In the end only two astronauts would be the
first to step foot on the moon, and one of

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.680
them almost died trying to get there.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.520
