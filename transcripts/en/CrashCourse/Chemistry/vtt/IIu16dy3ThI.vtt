00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.100
You're at dinner with your best friend: fine conversation, fine wine, some barbecued beef cheeks.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.730
You look outside to admire the full moon,
but when you glance back you realize that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.389
your friend has turned into a werewolf.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.770
Fortunately, the cutlery is made of silver,
and you know how to use it!

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.180
Or perhaps, you're in the bath one day, and as you reach for the soap you notice a wart on your big toe.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.400
Well squeeze a little silver nitrate on that big boy and you'll be ready for sandals season in no time.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.540
Shiny, electrically conductive, and oh-so-useful,
silver has been valued since ancient times

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.440
and has a reputation for purity and warding off evil, whether in the form of werewolves or warts.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.880
Silver was also a big driver of settlement in the western United States, including Montana, where I live.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.860
And, of course, all that silver got here because
of chemistry.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.030
Specifically, it's here because of countless
chemical reactions that took place over the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.940
eons called precipitation reactions:

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.460
when chemicals in a solution react to form
a solid.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.200
Precipitation reactions are what create geological deposits in the earth as well as rings around your bathtub.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.739
They're what we use to make our waste water
drinkable

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.369
and they've been used by folks for thousands
of years to get rich.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.860
Because precipitation reactions happen to be one of the best ways to produce chemicals of the highest purity.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.620
So they're not only the key to how silver was deposited in these mountains hundreds of millions of years ago.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.040
They're also the key to getting that silver back out.
I can do it, right here on this desk.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640
And all I need to get started is this.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.200
[Theme Music]

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.320
Precipitation. It's stuff falling out of other stuff: water falling out of the sky, solids falling out of solution.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.779
And for us here it all comes down to a little
thing called solubility.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.600
Water, as we've discussed here before, is pretty dang good at dissolving stuff, ionic compounds in particular.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.579
A positively charged ion and a negatively
charged ion held together by their charges

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.200
might form a crystal when they're dry,
but add a bit of water

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.760
and those little polar molecules slide their way between the ions dissolving massive amounts of ionic compounds.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.320
But some ionic compounds can overcome even
the dissolving power of water

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.890
and when they form through reactions in solution,
they fall out as a solid precipitate.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.410
Yes, precipitate is both a noun and verb.
Get used to it.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.640
When we talk about an ionic compound that's
fallen out of solution I say precipitate [pre-sip-uh-tit]

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.990
to distinguish it from from precipitate [pre-sip-eh-tate]
which is more the verb-y sound.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.710
And this is purely my preference because that's
how my teacher said it when I was being taught.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.530
So the rich silver veins in Montana formed

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.570
when water stuffed with ionic compounds ran
through cracks in paleozoic limestone.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.780
Where conditions were right, silver ions in
the water reacted with ionic compounds,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.030
or salts, in the limestone to make insoluble
silver compounds that fell out of solution.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.360
And it looks, a little bit, like this. It
actually looks exactly like this.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.700
It's pretty cool because, uh, you can't feel this but, it is extremely heavy, because silver is a pretty heavy element.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.660
And it wasn't just the silver salts in solution, all kinds of stuff: gold and potassium and copper salts,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.300
and, most notably, sodium salts are dissolved
as water rushes across the landscape.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.580
If these dissolved compounds stay in solution until they get to the ocean, they pretty much stay there forever.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.460
The water evaporates, leaving the salts behind in the ocean where over the eons it has built up,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.800
leaving the ocean super salty.
As we know it today.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.740
And while sodium chloride, what we call salt when not doing chemistry, is the most common salt,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.000
there are also tons of other things dissolved
in the ocean, including quite a lot of gold.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.020
In fact, at today's market value the ocean contains about one hundred million trillion dollars of gold.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.440
And that was not a stutter, a hundred million
trillion.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.650
That's a hundred trillion with six more zeros
after it.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.930
So you can see why it might be nice to master
some precipitation reactions.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.470
There have been chemists that have driven
themselves crazy trying to figure out

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.990
how to economically extract gold from seawater,
but thus far none have done it.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.340
This solution here of silver nitrate is similar
to that ion rich water

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.940
that steeped through the Montana limestone
millions of years ago.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.319
And we can use it right here at this desk
to recreate

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.459
the ancient reactions that deposited silver
in veins across our landscape.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.800
But instead of the types of salts found in
limestone,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.280
we can use a very similar and substantially more familiar ion compound: table salt, good old NaCl.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.749
Add some drops of sodium chloride, also known
as your salt water,

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:29.240
to the silver nitrate solution and there you
see your precipitate. Ooooo...gross.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.800
Now the question that we immediately want
to ask is, "What is this white stuff down here?"

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.999
The key to understanding what just happened
here is that both of the compounds are ionic.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.259
You remember there are two kinds of ions,
right?

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.340
Cations are positively charged and anions
are negatively charged.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.580
Just like little bar magnets, they attract.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.139
So cations only react with anions to form
new compounds.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.460
And don't just think that there's one anion
and one cation.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.370
The sodium ion in sodium chloride will have
chloride ions on all four sides,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.729
which in turn are surrounded by four sodiums,
and this pattern repeats many, many, many times

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.300
until we end up with the salt crystals that
we dissolved in the water.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.569
But how do we know which ions are cations
and which are anions?

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.409
Well sodium is positively charged so it's
a cation

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.480
and we know that it's positively charged because sodium is a metal from the left side of the periodic table

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.500
and those are always cations when they're
alone.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.840
Silver is also a metal and is also a cation.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.820
We know that chlorine is a gas from the right
side of the periodic table, so that is an anion.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.279
Now what about the nitrate? Also anion.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.129
Nitrates, sulfates and phosphates are really
common and they're always anions.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.300
Whenever you see an N, S, or P followed by a bunch of oxygens, you know you're looking at an anion.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.780
With that in mind, look at the possible products
of this reaction.

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.649
What we're looking for is a product that doesn't dissolve in water, so we know it's not sodium chloride.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.650
That was one of our reactants and it dissolves
readily in water, hence the oceans.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.559
And it isn't silver nitrate, our other reactant,
or sodium nitrate,

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:58.689
because as a rule, nitrates dissolve really
easily in water, so we know that's dissolved.

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.419
So we're left with silver chloride.
Just process of elimination.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.099
This makes sense because silver also makes
insoluble compounds with bromine and iodine,

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.969
which are in the same column of the periodic
table as chlorine.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.669
Elements in the same column often behave in
similar ways.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.400
And you'll notice of course that we don't end up with, like, a huge, nice chunk of pure silver here;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.240
now it's bonded to chlorine.

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:21.589
Kinda like table salt, silver chloride is
a crystalline solid.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.199
Unlike salt though it's not very soluble in
water.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.700
Now getting the silver out of this compound will involve another kind of reaction, a redox reaction,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.620
which we'll talk more about next week.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.180
In the meantime, we still have to learn the
language of describing this sort of reaction.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.759
Because of the neat and somewhat unique interactions
that are involved in precipitation reactions

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.159
-- dissolved substances producing solids,
ions dissociating and rebonding --

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.930
there are special ways to write and balance
them as equations.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.320
One way is to include notations in parenthesis that tell you what state the chemicals are in:

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.759
Aq meaning aqueous, or in solution,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.660
and s for solid, meaning that it's your precipitate,
this is called the molecular equation.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.559
Another way which tends to give a clearer
picture of what actually happens during the

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.789
reaction is to write everything out as ions.

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:12.319
Here you list the compounds that dissolve
completely in solution as ions;

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.009
makes sense because as soon as the salts are
dissolved every ion is on it's own,

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.219
and it doesn't really matter where it originally
came from.

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.650
So the left side shows silver, and nitrate,
and sodium, and chloride ions all in one solution.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.930
And the right side shows sodium and nitrate
still as separate ions in solution

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.529
with the silver chloride precipitated out
as solid.

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:32.259
Now if we don't care about the complete equation,

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:36.300
and only want to see the active participants,
we can write it in yet a third way.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.919
We just leave out the so-called spectator ions: nitrate and sodium, which don't participate directly in the reaction,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.839
and end up with a net ionic equation showing just silver and chloride ions reacting to form silver chloride.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:50.069
This is nice, and short, and to the point,
which is what chemists love

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.979
because remember some of them have terrible writing skills and have to dictate their stuff to their mom.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.460
Now as an aside remember when I first brought up the weirdness of using Ag to denote the word silver?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.860
Well all that stems from the fact that the
Latin world for silver is argentum,

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:06.159
and the ancients were, as most people are
today,

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:10.439
obsessed with what silver represented, not
just wealth, but also health.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.660
Ancient Indo-Europeans associated silver with
purity and goodness.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.399
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek doctor, wrote
about silver's anti-disease properties.

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.939
And there's good science behind silver's medical
uses.

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:23.369
A lot of the metals are toxic to things like
fungi and microbes.

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.869
But unlike say, lead, silver isn't that toxic
to humans.

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:30.480
Silver nitrate and a compound called silver
sulfadiazine,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.650
were used to disinfect wounds in World War
I, before antibiotics were discovered.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.080
Silver sulfadiazine is still used to dress
burns.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.520
And researchers are now looking at the antimicrobial
uses for silver nanoparticles.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.680
Some people even take colloidal silver, basically
silver particles in a liquid suspension,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.180
as a kind of general health booster, but there's
not actually any evidence that it boosts health.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.310
It can turn you blue though. Now you want
that silver even more, don't you.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.400
Now, as we always do, in order to make a reaction
practical,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.820
you have to go through the final step of converting
the formula equation into a molar mass equation.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.970
If we wanted to get the silver out of solution,
how much salt would we need?

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.580
Specifically, let's say that we want to get
one troy ounce of silver.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.920
The troy ounce is part of the troy weight
system which is used to weigh precious metals.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.500
It's derived from the way the Romans measured bronze and silver bars they used for currency 2,000 years ago.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.540
And we are still stuck with it.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.680
But let's be at least a little bit modern
about this, a troy ounce equals 31.1 grams.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.470
So we want 31.1 grams of silver, the molar
mass of silver is 107.868 grams per mole.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.270
Do the calculation and we find that 31.1 grams
equals 0.288 moles of silver.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.420
From the molecular equation we can see that
in order for it to balance

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.200
we'll need one mole of sodium chloride for
every mole of silver.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.990
So to get 0.288 moles of silver, how much
sodium chloride do we need?

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.400
We've made it easy for you; it's 0.288 moles.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.050
So then we convert 0.288 moles of sodium chloride
into units of mass and grams.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.960
Sodium chloride's molar mass is 58.45 grams
per mole.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.320
Multiply 58.45 grams per mole by 0.288 and
we find:

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.400
we need 16.8 grams of sodium chloride to precipitate out 1 troy ounce of silver out of silver nitrate solution.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.140
And look at that you get a nice pile of silver chloride in solution. Yes, it's not pure silver not yet.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.680
Just like real miners who dig ores out of the ground that contain just a few percent silver,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.200
we need to do some refining.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.500
In our case, there's another type of reaction
necessary called a redox reaction.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.860
Redox is short for reduction-oxidation and
that is what we'll be talking about next time.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.320
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.070
This week we discussed what defines precipitation
reactions

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.920
and how you can determine what precipitants
they form.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.470
We also learned how to write precipitate reaction
equations

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.240
and finally we calculated a molar mass equation
to figure out how much of a reactant we need

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.550
to produce a desired amount of precipitant.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.180
