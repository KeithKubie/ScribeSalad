00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:04.715
Everything is horrible!

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:06.000
What makes you say that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.527
It's just this general
feeling I always have.

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:11.141
Yeah, I feel that way too.

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:16.925
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:19.595
It's New Year, y'all, a time
when we all tend to take stock

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:21.695
in ourselves and
the world around us.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:24.745
It's also the time of year
when I consume the most media,

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.305
since I'm pretty much stuck
on my grandma's living room

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.525
couch watching TV,
mostly under duress.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:34.325
It's really easy to think, based
on our introspective New Year's

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.794
mindset and all the news around
us, with the wars and the crime

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:39.835
and the disease and the
environmental destruction

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:42.694
and the oppressive governments
watching us, and the drones--

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:44.277
Anthony, I'm going
to need you to take

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.775
a deep breath in and out.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.831
Sorry, it is just really easy
to get caught up in that stuff.

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:50.705
But here's the thing.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.685
It is genuinely the best time
in the history of the world

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:54.485
to be alive.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.545
And it actually
keeps getting better,

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:59.255
especially when you realize
how short of a period of time

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.725
that we've been around, and
just how long humans have been

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.305
struggling against the elements.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:03.805
True.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:06.755
We hear a lot of stuff about
epidemics and mortality rates

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:07.855
in developing nations.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:11.045
But since 1950, the infant
and child mortality rate

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.305
has gone down in every
single country in the world

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.682
in every income bracket,
every single one.

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:19.265
And the average life
span in the world

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.704
has gone from 47 to 70
years old in that time.

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:23.245
In the 1850's in
England, pretty much

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.475
the easiest place to live
on Earth at the time,

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.915
the average person
only lived to be 40.

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:28.955
So we've doubled that.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.830
And there's still a lot
do to combat disease,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.525
but this is still a huge gain.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.495
And hunger is also
in a huge decline.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:38.805
We're talking about 925 million
people living in hunger today,

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.495
as opposed to 958
million in 1970.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.805
And that might seem like
a really small difference,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:46.955
but the population
then was 3.7 billion,

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.345
and now it is 7 billion.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:52.255
So that means we went from
having 25% of the world

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:55.465
not having enough
to eat to 13% now.

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.845
We dropped hunger by half.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.585
We're even decimating poverty.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.245
We hear a lot about
recessions and unemployment.

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:04.355
But 30 years ago,
40% of the world

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:07.055
was living on less
than $1.25 a day.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:09.795
In 2010, that number
dropped to 14%.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.895
Murder and violent
crime is dropping too.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.615
Look, in the Middle Ages,
there was about 15% chance

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:16.836
that somebody was
going to murder you.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.585
That was the deal.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.385
You get born, you get an axe
to the face, and then you die.

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:23.155
In the 20th century, even
with both world wars,

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.275
violent death was down to 3%.

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:31.415
13 years into 21st century,
and we're down to 0.003%.

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:31.965
Still early.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:32.686
I'm optimistic.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.185
Yeah.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.355
Well, those aren't just
some pretty solid numbers.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.745
These are feel good numbers.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.747
So why do we feel so bad?

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:41.205
Part of it is that,
hey, we weren't

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:42.475
around hundreds of years ago.

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:44.975
We're looking at such a
narrow picture of things.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:47.515
And there's also the
problem of media saturation.

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:50.005
We know about everything
that's going on everywhere all

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:51.355
the time right now.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:54.755
And the media tends to
focus on the negative.

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:57.065
A study done on the
content of Time Magazine

00:02:57.065 --> 00:03:00.845
over a 30-year period showed
that 73% of those stories

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.809
were about violent crime, but
only 10% of the total crimes

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.225
reported to the police during
that same time were actually

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:07.785
violent.

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:10.365
It contributes to something that
mass media researcher George

00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:12.625
Gerbner called Mean
World Syndrome.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.555
That's a good name.

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:15.505
The media focuses
on the negative.

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:16.825
We only see the negative.

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.195
We only know the negative.

00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:20.605
You can also call it the
Availability Heuristic.

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.235
You are more likely to
believe that the world matches

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.485
the available information
that's already in your head.

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:25.930
Right.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.180
So you have to fill your
head with a more rounded view

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.855
of everything.

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:31.015
Dig down and find
the real information

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.785
and the good news
that's out there.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.910
But don't think that we're just
glossing over all the work that

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.975
still needs to be done.

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:38.805
We know that there
are things to fix.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:41.245
Just don't forget that
we're working on fixing them

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:44.315
while you're reading about
how to tear them apart.

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:45.815
When the world looks
bleak, you just

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:47.295
remember what DNews told you.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:50.025
You are so much more unlikely
to get an axe in the face

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:50.995
than you once were.

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:54.495
So on that note, what's your
good news for 2014, guys?

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.265
Let us know down below and
subscribe for more good news.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.685
I can't think of
a single person I

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:00.701
know who's gotten hit
in the face with an axe.

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:01.201
Me neither.

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:02.750
I did once in Scouts.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.455
Why did you have to
go ruin it, Trace?
