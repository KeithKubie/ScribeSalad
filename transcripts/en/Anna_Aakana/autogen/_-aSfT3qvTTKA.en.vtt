00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.520
 I suffer from depression. 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.380
 Antidepressants is something my psychiatrist has recommended for years 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.220
 This is something I did not want to do 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.640
 I will try St. John's tea or mood enhancers 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.400
 Very afraid of what side effects of the drug 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 I am afraid that if you take antidepressants they make depression more or less realistic 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.660
 This is something I do not want to admit 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.980
 Because, you know all you hear about the side effects of terrible antidepressants 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 All we hear about antidepressants 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.220
 "My weight has increased after my use of antidepressants" 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.680
 Or "Antidepressants cause me nausea" 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.060
 Or "terrible things have happened" 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.820
 But recently, I have experienced a bout of depression 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.060
 This pushed me somewhat into madness 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.340
 This has turned me into a difficult person to live with 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220
 Only if I've never been better 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.580
 The psychiatrist raised the subject of antidepressants again 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.520
 "What if I just tried antidepressants, I tried the herbs that you wanted to try" 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 "I used antidepressants, my wife used antidepressants, and both of us helped tremendously" 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.660
 "We used antidepressants from 10 to 15 years old to try it" 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.780
 I reached the point of my life where I realized 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 I am active in the field of protection from suicide, especially 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.060
 In the youth, I am someone who fights to remove the stigma surrounding mental illness and mental illness 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.940
 I pay to make myself a lot of money to help me in my life 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.160
 I do not listen to his advice, and I did not listen to this part of his advice 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.440
 for many years 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.200
 This is something I should try, maybe it will help me or maybe not 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.820
 But it is a solution that I can try. 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.620
 I do not argue that all people should use drugs 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.400
 I just think that if a licensed psychologist advises me to use drugs for many years 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 Maybe this is something I should try 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.140
 right right? Yeah 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.980
 Maybe this is something I should try 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.740
 There is no 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.320
 I have a sister who committed suicide, this means that every member of my family increases the probability of suicide 50% 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.120
 My doctor has a very good explanation 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.940
 Or, a way to address my fears, he said to me, 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.240
 "If my family suffers from allergies, if I do not take allergy, I'll be miserable" 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.520
 Can I recover from my sensitivity? No, this is just the allergy that I was born with 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.300
 "You have depression, depression in your genes, you're more prone to depression," he said. 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.360
 I know this is like self-congratulation, but I'm proud of myself. 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.320
 I took steps towards my mental health 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.400
 And whether this step does not do or do anything for the quality of my life 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.820
 This is something I did not want to do 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.720
 Because of stereotypes that follow antidepressants, because of my fear, and because of my feeling of insecurity 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.140
 What would people think when they knew I was using antidepressants? 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.620
 And all these stupid things 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.180
 I do not want to be afraid of small things 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.620
 And I know that they do not seem to me to do this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.380
 Because of my expressions about myself online but 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.740
 As you know, when something small comes out of control enter into this vortex of 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.200
 Emotional disorder. Or if you read an article on Facebook about the death of a sad rabbit 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 I go into a whirlwind of bad mood and I can not get out of it 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.680
 I am quick to annoy daily 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.620
 My usual mood is that I am easily upset and very sad and miserable 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.060
 If using the medicine will give me a better life 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.420
 Or makes me a more entertaining person or makes me a happier person 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.180
 I must be ready to be impressed because 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.100
 That's really what I want. Steps have been taken 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.440
 To get to my house 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.280
 Except for medicines. 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.900
 So .... this is just a funny * voice * a chapter in the life of a journey, 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.320
 I do not know .. I feel strange to make a video about it. 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.160
 The title says it all 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.540
 I have not used the medicine yet so I do not know any side effects 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.240
 I just took a step 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.780
 Where is my Academy Award? Where is my prize? 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.320
 * Silly sound * 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.720
 Anna Anna, stay strong
