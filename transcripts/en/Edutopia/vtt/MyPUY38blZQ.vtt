00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
- What's that?

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:10.120
- That's another check in
and check out of somebody

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.950
who had the perfect day so we
put it on the wall of fame.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.390
You gonna be the next one?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.760
- [Mathew Voiceover] Because
we do check in and check out,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.400
students feel supported through

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060
a positive relationship every single day,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.860
which builds their capacity
to be successful students.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.640
- I know you can do it, okay.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.010
- [Mathew Voiceover] At the
Fall-Hamilton, we've really put

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.839
a lot of effort in building
positive relationships.

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:35.672
- Hi

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:36.586
- [Emily] How was your day?

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:37.419
- [Student] Good

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.020
- One strategy we utilize

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.860
is our check in and check out system,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.020
where adults are meeting
with kids every single day

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.990
and it's not their classroom teacher.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.800
We have 41 students on
check in and check out here.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.050
You're gonna do great are you?

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.250
We identify the students that just need

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.350
a little bit more support where
they're struggling meeting

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.700
some of their requirements
on a educational level,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
but more of a social and
emotional level as well.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.133
- [Teacher] You did, I'm so proud of you.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.980
- The child knows every day
they come in this building

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.560
that somebody's excited
to see them in the morning

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.980
and excited to see them
right before they leave.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.280
- [Emily] Hey Moriah

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.310
- Hi

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.210
- You ready to have
another great day today?

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.043
- Yup

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:24.630
- My check in check out buddy,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.890
her name is Moriah and
she's in fourth grade.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.610
She has three goals
everyday that she works on.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.872
What are your goals for today?

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:35.910
- Listen, be on task and nice.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.780
- Awesome

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.480
She can get zero, one, or two
points for each of her goals.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.090
- The goal sheet is based
off the student's needs

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.270
and it is agreed upon by

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.020
the classroom teacher and the student.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.840
So whatever they're struggling with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.730
is what the goal is set around.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.060
Then every increment of the day,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.420
at the end of a literacy block,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.160
at the of a mathematics
block, at the end of recess,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.830
they're just getting feedback.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.663
- How about being nice?

00:01:58.663 --> 00:01:59.524
Do you think you're a
nice to everyone around?

00:01:59.524 --> 00:02:00.357
- Yes

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:01.850
- Good job, I agree you
were doing a great job.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.380
- Whoever the teacher is will give

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.550
her points throughout the day.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.450
If she had a bad day, I
try to just let her know

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.450
that she still has a capability
to do great tomorrow.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520
But today was a really great day.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040
You had a perfect day.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.910
She got a perfect score
on her goals for the day.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.620
- What I let about check in and check out

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.420
that you get prizes and you
get to see what you did good

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.020
and what you did wrong and
you can do better next time.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.990
- We try to pick things that
the kids like, school supplies,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.120
or non-tangible things like
a positive phone call home

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.930
to the parent congratulating them.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.600
It is a great day for Moriah isn't it?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.330
So it's not just about the points.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.830
The relationship and the accountability

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.280
is really the important part.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.280
- How was your day?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.370
- Good.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.613
Actually it was fantastic.

00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:49.750
- Fantastic?

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.670
- Mr.Portell, he's our
principal and my mentor.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.310
You go to him and them
he asks about your day

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.660
and if you had a problem somewhere,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.890
we'll talk about that and
see how you can fix it.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.570
- We've seen kids transform

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.870
their own opinions of themselves.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.820
Paydon, man he had a rough year last year.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.660
Just to see his growth
on a foundation level,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.700
being able to be in a class
all day without incident

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
and being able to start
growing on his academics.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360
So do you think you
knocked it out of the park?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.780
That's what I'm talking about.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.280
That's been a huge success.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.113
- You did it with me.

00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:29.470
- That's right, no but
you did it on your own.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.140
That's you my man, nice work.
