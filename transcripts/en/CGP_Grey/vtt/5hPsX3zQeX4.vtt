00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Remember in the first footnote how I said there are 23 Catholic churches within the Catholic Church, *all* with different traditions?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.400
This is one of the times that matters. Only the Latin Church, the largest of the 23, requires priests to be celibate.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.340
The other 22 Catholic Churches known as the Eastern Churches allow married men to become priests, but not to advance any more.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.740
But even this is a bit of an oversimplification, because priests in the Latin Church *can* be married under certain circumstances;

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.320
most notably, former Anglican priests who *were* married at the time of their conversion to Catholicism are not required to relinquish their wives.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.860
But as with the Eastern churches their marriage prevents them from rising any higher.
