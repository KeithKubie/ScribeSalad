00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.896
When we talk, sometimes
we say things directly.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.736
"I'm going to the store,
I'll be back in five minutes."

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.376
Other times though, we talk in a way
that conjures up a small scene.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.976
"It's raining cats and dogs out," we say,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.976
or "I was waiting
for the other shoe to drop."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.536
Metaphors are a way
to talk about one thing

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.496
by describing something else.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.456
That may seem roundabout, but it's not.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.096
Seeing and hearing and tasting
are how we know anything first.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.136
The philosopher William James
described the world of newborn infants

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.176
as a "buzzing and blooming confusion."

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.496
Abstract ideas are pale things

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.200
compared to those first bees and blossoms.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.856
Metaphors think
with the imagination and the senses.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.016
The hot chili peppers in them
explode in the mouth and the mind.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.496
They're also precise.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.696
We don't really stop
to think about a raindrop

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.856
the size of an actual cat or dog,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.336
but as soon as I do,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.816
I realize that I'm quite certain
the dog has to be a small one --

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.216
a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund --

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.136
and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720
I think a beagle might be about right.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.456
A metaphor isn't true or untrue
in any ordinary sense.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.936
Metaphors are art, not science,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.536
but they can still feel right or wrong.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.576
A metaphor that isn't good
leaves you confused.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.616
You know what it means
to feel like a square wheel,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.406
but not what it's like
to be tired as a whale.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.776
There's a paradox to metaphors.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.816
They almost always
say things that aren't true.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.296
If you say, "there's
an elephant in the room,"

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.136
there isn't an actual one,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.576
looking for the peanut dish on the table.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.536
Metaphors get under your skin
by ghosting right past the logical mind.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.856
Plus, we're used to thinking in images.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.616
Every night we dream impossible things.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.936
And when we wake up,
that way of thinking's still in us.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.696
We take off our dream shoes,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.048
and button ourselves into our lives.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.576
Some metaphors
include the words "like" or "as."

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.176
"Sweet as honey," "strong as a tree."

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.936
Those are called similes.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.350
A simile is a metaphor
that admits it's making a comparison.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.967
Similes tend to make you think.

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.296
Metaphors let you feel things directly.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.696
Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.440
"All the world's a stage."

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.033
"The world is like a stage"
just seems thinner, and more boring.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
Metaphors can also live in verbs.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.176
Emily Dickinson begins a poem,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.496
"I saw no way --
the heavens were stitched --"

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.736
and we know instantly

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.680
what it would feel like
if the sky were a fabric sewn shut.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.416
They can live in adjectives, too.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.936
"Still waters run deep,"
we say of someone quiet and thoughtful.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.560
And the deep matters
as much as the stillness and the water do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.616
One of the clearest places
to find good metaphors is in poems.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.041
Take this haiku by the 18th-century
Japanese poet Issa.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.400
"On a branch floating downriver,
a cricket singing."

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.016
The first way to meet a metaphor
is just to see the world through its eyes:

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.718
an insect sings from a branch
passing by in the middle of the river.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.696
Even as you see that though,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.976
some part of you recognizes in the image

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.056
a small portrait of what it's like
to live in this world of change and time,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.456
our human fate is to vanish,
as surely as that small cricket will,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.936
and still, we do what it does.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.640
We live, we sing.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.240
Sometimes a poem
takes a metaphor and extends it,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.480
building on one idea in many ways.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.456
Here's the beginning
of Langston Hughes' famous poem

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880
"Mother to Son."

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.816
"Well, son, I'll tell you.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.480
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.176
It's had tacks in it, and splinters,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.496
and boards torn up,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.120
and places with no carpet on the floor."

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.816
Langston Hughes is making
a metaphor that compares

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.456
a hard life to a wrecked house
you still have to live in.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.176
Those splinters and tacks feel real,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.976
they hurt your own feet
and your own heart,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.576
but the mother
is describing her life here,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.296
not her actual house.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.056
And hunger, and cold,
exhausting work and poverty

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.566
are what's also inside those splinters.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.536
Metaphors aren't always
about our human lives and feelings.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.336
The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.256
"The fog comes on little cat feet.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.736
It sits looking over harbor
and city on silent haunches,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.416
and then moves on."

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.736
The comparison here is simple.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.983
Fog is being described as a cat.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.496
But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.656
or a way to convey hidden meanings,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.280
it's a way to let you feel
and know something differently.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.136
No one who's heard this poem forgets it.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.376
You see fog,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.634
and there's a small grey cat nearby.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.016
Metaphors give words a way
to go beyond their own meaning.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.416
They're handles on the door
of what we can know,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.040
and of what we can imagine.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.016
Each door leads to some new house,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.200
and some new world
that only that one handle can open.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.616
What's amazing is this:

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.256
by making a handle,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.880
you can make a world.
