00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.389
Remember when everyone was bagging on millennials
for our “hookup culture.”

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:13.129
Joke’s on you, old people, turns out we’re
barely having sex!

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.469
Hello just friends, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.430
Smartphone apps can do anything.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
Press the right buttons and you can order
a pizza, or get directions to pizza, or match

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
with someone on a dating app like Tinder and
trick them into bringing you pizza.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.640
Apparently, though, some people actually use
Tinder for casual sex.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.500
This has led to predictions that dating would
end and relationships would be replaced by

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.170
a string of one night stands.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.859
And then a funny thing happened: researchers
asked millennials just how much sex they were

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.640
having and the answer was lower than anybody
was expecting.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.350
It’s not just low compared to the crazy
expectations set by their prudent parents,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.239
it’s the lowest it’s been since the 1940s.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.719
Psychologist and author of the book Generation
Me Jean Twenge examined data from the General

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.530
Social Survey, which looks at American social
trends going back 70 years.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.910
Twenge and other researchers analyzed over
26,000 responses to the GSS and examined how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.260
many sexual partners people reported having
between the ages of 18 and 24.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.430
6% of adults born in the late 1960s reported
having no partners at that age, while for

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.050
today’s adults born in the ‘90s, that
figure was closer to 15%.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.580
Twenge remarked, "This generation appears
to be waiting longer to have sex, with an

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.380
increasing minority apparently waiting until
their early twenties or later.”

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.380
I know that’s why I didn’t have sex in
high school… because I was “waiting”...

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.830
But everything’s going to be ok, 18 year
old Julian, because the Center for Disease

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.770
control has also found that high school virgin
rates are on the rise.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.300
Data published by the CDC last year showed
that 41% of high school students had had sex

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.690
at some point, compared to 54% of students
in 1991.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.500
Millennials aren’t just waiting longer to
have sex either, they also report fewer sexual

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.480
partners on average compared to generations
past.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.920
Another analysis of the GSS by Twenge found
that while baby boomers typically had 11.68

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.000
partners in their lifetime, millennials are
on pace to average only 8.26.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.080
I don’t know how you can have sex with .26
people, but I’m a millennial so clearly

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.770
my experience is limited.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.049
This all appears to contradict other data
about our newest crop of adults.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.239
In 1972, 45% of young adults said premarital
sex was “not wrong at all.”

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.040
As of 2014, that number had jumped to 64%,
so you’d think they’d all be on board

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.799
the boner train to pleasure town.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.080
Why the hedonism has died down despite more
openness to hedonism is something of a mystery

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.989
that the data can’t answer yet.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.239
This hasn’t stopped people from speculating
though.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.069
Twenge thinks that the rise of technology
means we have more ways to entertain ourselves,

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.129
so sex becomes less important.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.019
And communicating through texting has diminished
face-to-face interactions, meaning there’s

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.049
less opportunity to get it on.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.499
So our intercourse is getting in the way of
our intercourse.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.900
One of Twenge’s co-authors, Ryne Sherman,
suggested that the abundance of other outlets

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.819
like pornography or the rise in sexual education
and awareness of sexually transmitted diseases

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.360
may lead to more prudent youth.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.349
It’s also possible that we have a more casual
definition of casual sex, so it only looks

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.900
like we’re not getting busy.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.090
Anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher told Business
Insider that the casual hookups may be leading

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.270
to meaningful relationships when millennials
catch feelings for their partner.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.189
Fisher also thinks that online dating apps
are actually having a negative impact on our

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.189
hookups.

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.049
When people are presented with so many choices,
they’re less likely to pick one, a phenomenon

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.549
I’m calling “App-stinence.”

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.930
All these factors may have lead to our sex
drives hitting the brakes, but none have been

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.370
looked at in depth.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.859
So if you’re a millennial and your parents
think your generation is too frisky, be comforted

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.249
knowing that your parents probably had way
more sex than you.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.519
Wait that’s not comforting at all!

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.940
If you’re trying to buck statistics, you
know what will set you apart from the shirtless

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.260
bros on tinder?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.610
Your own website.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.849
And no domain extension will help you tell
your story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:49.849
name.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.329
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.760
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.349
Of course we may be less frisky because we’re
carrying around a few more pounds than our

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.440
parents too.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:11.260
To find out why, Julia explores that here.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:21.120
Why do you think millennials aren’t doing
the dirty horizontal mambo?
