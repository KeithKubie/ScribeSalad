00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.080
That concludes EHR certification.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.390
The other two components of high
tech are meaningful use and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.090
incentive payments.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.830
Before we discuss them,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.340
we'll have a basic overview of
electronic medical records.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
Physicians are in the data business.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.870
They collect data.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.940
They make treatment decisions
based on that data.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.130
And they follow patients through other
data and make adjustments as needed.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.130
The data physicians record can be
divided into subjective information,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.380
generally information collected from the
patient, such as the chief complaint,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.130
the reason they visited the physician
today, their medical history, and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.740
history of the particular problem
that brought them to the doctor.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.320
Physicians may collect objective
data by doing a physical exam,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.060
ordering X-rays or rather images,
or doing lab tests.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.370
The resulting data can be in many forms.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.830
It can be free text.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.870
It can be structured codes,
such as the ICD we referred to earlier.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.780
Could be continuous wave forms
from an electrocardiogram, images,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.330
sound recordings, or even videos.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.400
Increasingly data from
chronic disease and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.460
other patients may be coming from
their smart phone or from physiologic

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.660
measurement devices they use to
track their own health at home.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.600
Storing and presenting this rich data
set is an EMR design challenge, yet

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.310
many EMRs still mimic the organization
of the paper chart, even simulating

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.030
the tabs that divide the sections
where the data types are stored.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.060
Despite its key role in medicine,
physicians have historically focused far

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.620
more on collecting the right data than
they have on recording it completely,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.099
accurately, and legibly.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.860
As we've seen, in a fragmented system
of care where many physicians treat

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.860
aspects of a single patient's care,
this can lead to duplicate testing or

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.460
even errors.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.250
Here's a particularly dramatic example.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.450
For which medication was
this prescription written?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.890
What is Isordil, Plendil,
or are you not sure?
