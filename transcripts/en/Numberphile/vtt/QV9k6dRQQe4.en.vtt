MATT PARKER: See, most people
forgot about the Rubik's Cube

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.270
back in the '80s, so it had
its heyday and then

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.550
disappeared.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.770
But mathematicians remain
obsessed with it.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.340
KATIE STECKLES: I mean, people
probably are aware that there

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250
is some math involved
in Rubik's Cube.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.990
JAMES GRIME: The reason I not
interested in the Rubik's Cube

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.130
was I wanted to use as
a teaching tool.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.530
In my day job I study something
called group theory.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.100
KATIE STECKLES: If you go to
any kind of Wikipedia page

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.270
about anything to do with group
theory, there will be,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.460
in the top corner, a picture
of a Rubik's Cube.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.220
And the reason for that is that
it has got quite a nice

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.150
example of a group associated
with it.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.520
And the group is the number of
different combinations that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.590
there are on the Rubik's Cube.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.310
It's all the different
ways that you can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.570
scramble up a cube.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.610
JAMES GRIME: So for example,
if you had a square, and I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.000
turn it a quarter turn, you
still get a square, don't you?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.330
And even if I take a square, and
I flip it over, you still

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.120
get square, right?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.700
So it has that symmetry.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.720
Now, this is what I study.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.410
So I started to learn how the
Rubik's Cube worked, because

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.590
the mathematics is the same.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.220
So if I turn this here, the
right hand side a quarter

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460
turn, I can do that.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.400
I do it twice, you get a half
turn. you do it get three

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.080
times, that's equal to
a quarter turn in

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.670
the opposite direction.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.480
If you do it four times, you get
back to where you started.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.175
LUCAS GARRON: Hey,
Numberphile.

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.515
My name is Lucas, and
I'm a speed cuber.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.545
That was about 9.6 seconds,
although I got

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:37.530
a little bit lucky.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.040
MATT PARKER: Other things
do have permutations and

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.350
symmetry, but there's just
something nice and tactile,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.230
and you can grab it,
and you can see

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.840
everything as it happens.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.835
So there are a lot of other
things with symmetric, but

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:52.180
nothing quite as tangible
as a Rubik's Cube.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.700
JAMES GRIME: The mathematics
of the Rubik's Cube is rock

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.760
hard, but we'll try and do
a few things about it.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.530
We'll talk about the
combinations, first of all.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.260
How many ways can you mix
up the Rubik's Cube?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.640
Let's do that.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.080
ANKUR SADHOO: This is my Rubik's
Cube [INAUDIBLE] for

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.568
Numberphile.

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:09.520
Here goes.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.030
MATT PARKER: I'm adequate at the
Rubik's cube, so I solve

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690
it on average, about a
minute and a half.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.960
On a good day, if you give me a
mixed a Rubik's Cube, I can

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.090
do it in a minute.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.990
I will almost always get
it done in two minutes.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.700
Personally, my goal, I like to
be able to solve it talking to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.190
other people.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.210
So it's my goal to solve the
Rubik's Cube while having a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.780
conversation, and I can do that
between two and three

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.250
minutes, give or take.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.420
BRADY HARAN: You've set
yourself up, you know?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.655
You know what I'm going to do.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:38.670
Give it here.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920
I'm going to mix it up.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.770
JAMES GRIME: So imagine I can
take these cubes off, these

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.240
little sub cubes here.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.640
These, what are they called?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.610
Cubelettes?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.430
Cubits?

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.790
We can take those off, and just
arrange them all on the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.080
table, and we'll put it
back together again.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.290
And we'll do the corners first,
let's say, for the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.530
first corner I'll eight choices
of corner cubes.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.110
I'll have eight corner
cubes to put there.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.000
For the second corner, I'll have
seven corner cubes left.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.270
For the next one, I'll have
six corner cubes left.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.910
Then five, then four, then
three, then two, then one.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.370
Now, you multiply
that together.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.630
8 times 7 times 6 times
5 times 4 times 3

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.270
times 2 times 1.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.380
That's called 8 factorial,
which is an 8 with an

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.723
exclamation mark after it.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.010
BRADY HARAN: So I've mixed
up this cube for Matt.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.460
He told me that he can solve it
while talking, so I'm going

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.260
to give it to him while I talk
to him about the Rubik's Cube.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.212
There you go.

00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:47.690
MATT PARKER: Right.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.110
So I mean, me and
my big mouth.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.050
I did admit that I can
solve it while

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.040
talking to someone else.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.490
So I believe, Brady, you're
going to attempt to engage me

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.670
in conversation.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.080
JAMES GRIME: We can do the
edges in the same way.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.430
There are 12 edges.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.710
We're going to put the edges in,
and there are 12 factorial

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.380
ways to arrange the edges.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.250
So we've got 8 factorial
and 12 factorial.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.760
Now for each corner, there are
three ways to orientate it.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.817
So there are three colors there
on each corner, and you

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:17.300
can, you know, if you have
free choice, you

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.585
can move them around.

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:21.750
There are three ways to
do that for each one.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.320
Three choices for that, three
choices for that, three

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.380
choices for that, three choices
for that, three

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.700
choices for that, three choices
for that, three

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.140
choices for that, three choices
for that, and you

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.993
times them.

00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:35.950
What I've done is that's
3 to the power 8.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.190
Times 3 times 3 times
3 times--

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.340
MATT PARKER: When you are mixing
this up, there's a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.190
number of different ways you
could have mixed this up

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.150
before you give it to me when
I start solving it.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.140
So there's only one arrangement
of all these

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.400
pieces which counts as a
solved Rubik's Cube.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.150
JAMES GRIME: And now finally,
let's look at the edges.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.030
And each one has two
ways to arrange it.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.990
And so there's two ways,
and two ways, and two

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.560
ways, and two ways.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.330
And you times them together.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.950
And because there's 12 edges
altogether, there are 2

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.480
to the power 12.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.110
ADAM HADASH: 3, 2, 1.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.750
MATT PARKER: These two corners
are where I want them, but

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.300
these two are the wrong
way around.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.320
And so I know if I do that,
that, that, that, that, that,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.280
and then double twist,
that will have

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.630
swapped those two pieces.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.300
This is the total number of
ways if I could take the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.460
pieces off and then put
them back on again.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.540
Now, how many ways is
that all together?

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.420
It's a very large number,
so we work it out.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.860
3 to the power 5.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.066
Well, 5.2 times 10 to the 20.

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.120
It has 20 zeroes after it.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.820
But this is not the
right answer yet.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.820
BRADY HARAN: Matt, are you doing
maths here, or are you

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.240
just kind of, like a monkey
having learned

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.455
something by rote?

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:50.490
MATT PARKER: A combination
of the two.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.330
I've memorized, oh, yes, it's
solved, by the way.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.850
I've memorized a lot of
combinations of twists.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.830
That's pure rote.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.670
And then what I'm doing is I've
just got to spot what I

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.730
need to do, and then do
it at the same time.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.130
And so my method is very lazy.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.100
I'm spotting one bit I want to
do at a time and doing it.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.400
The more advanced people will
spot two different things they

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.610
want to do the same time and
then do those together.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.330
ED BANKS: I love Numberphile,
it's great.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.390
And I saw the post about you're
making a video on

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.755
Rubik's Cubes, so I'm just
going to mess this up

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:20.870
and then solve it.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.650
JAMES GRIME: Not all
permutations are possible.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.130
I can't reach every combination
by these twists.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.220
In fact, if I take one of those
edges off and turn it

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.630
around, and then start twisting
it, I get a whole new

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.270
set of combinations that you
won't usually get to on a

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.880
Rubik's Cube.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.770
It's called an orbit.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.610
A whole new orbit.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.410
A whole new universe
of combinations.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.370
So if I do that with one
of the edges, you get

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.090
this whole new set.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.820
If I do that with the corner,
there are three ways to turn

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.940
the corner.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.550
And again, for each one of
those, you get a whole new

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.650
universe of combinations.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.060
And finally, if I take
two pieces, like two

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.700
edges or two corners.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.890
If I took them off and swapped
them over, you again get a

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.030
whole new universe that you
can't really reach on a

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.450
standard Rubik's Cube.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.400
Now, because of these
universes,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.610
there's 12 of these universes.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.180
12 of these orbits.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.680
So I'm going to divide
that number by 12.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.170
4.3 times 10 to the 19.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.240
Some people call that 43
quintillion, but I don't like

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.020
things like that.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.820
4.3 times 10 to the 19.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.260
It's a massive number, though.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.920
It's a massive number
of combinations.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.160
MATT PARKER: If you want the
exact number of different ways

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:54.570
you can mix up a cube, it's
43,252,003,274,489,856,000.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.180
The number of possible ways.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.540
And to get a sense of how big
that number is, there's not

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.235
enough raw material in
the UK to make 43.25

00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:05.190
billion billion cubes.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.440
So you couldn't make enough
to put one in every single

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.680
possible arrangement.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.600
In fact, there's not enough of
the UK to make enough Rubik's

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.770
Cubes to have one in every
single arrangement.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.315
If you started just breaking
off anything around you, so

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:20.060
just grab anything and break
it off into a 57 millimeter

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.820
cube, the exact size
of a Rubik's Cube.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.470
And then if you panted those,
all the different possible

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.866
combinations, by the time you
had made all 43.25 billion

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:32.000
billion, you would have
a UK-shaped hole

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.539
over 20 miles deep.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.440
It's just, it's a mind numbing
number of possible

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.382
arrangements.

00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:40.480
LEONARD KOCH: And there we go.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.960
Brady, this is your solved
Rubik's Cube.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.990
JAMES GRIME: So this was a
big crazy in the 1980s.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.150
Big craze.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.480
In the 1880s, exactly 100 years
earlier, there was a

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.220
similar puzzle that was
also a big craze.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.040
It was this.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.430
This is called the 15 puzzle.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.860
It's got the numbers 1-15,
and it's like the

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.170
Rubik's Cube, though.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.110
You just move the
pieces around.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.210
The Rubik's Cube is
essentially a

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.445
3D version of this.

00:09:09.445 --> 00:09:13.630
Now, there was an American
puzzle expert called Sam Loyd.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.710
He would sell this puzzle.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.400
But he would set
it very meanly.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.070
He would set it with the 14
and the 15 swapped over.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.080
This was how he would sell it.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.580
And he would say, can
you solve it?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.950
And he offered a price of $1,000
to anyone who could

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.820
solve this puzzle.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.600
What he knew, though, was that
it was like the Rubik's Cube.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.000
If you take one of those pieces
off and turn it around,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.390
you get a whole new universe.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.520
You can't get back to
the solved Rubik's

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.970
Cube if you do that.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.850
And that's what Sam
Loyd was doing.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.290
But that is essentially a
simpler version of this craze

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.388
100 years later.

00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:58.260
BRADY HARAN: Can I just say, for
the record, Matt actually

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.470
wrote the number on
the board there.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.470
But you do that without--

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.870
MATT PARKER: I did it without,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.350
BRADY HARAN: Let the
record show, he did

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.170
that without looking.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.870
MATT PARKER: Just knowing
it was on the board

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.620
was enough for me.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.066
KATIE STECKLES: I guess
it comes in the

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:10.440
official Rubik's packaging.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.170
And you know, this is the
original design that they had

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.420
when they invented it in--
