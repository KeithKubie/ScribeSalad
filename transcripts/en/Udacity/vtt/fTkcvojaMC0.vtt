00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.700
can test the app using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.640
An Android virtual device should have already been created for

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.010
So you can go ahead and click OK.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.170
While the emulator's booting up,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.130
I want to point out that if you ever want to modify your emulator devices,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.140
you can click on this button with the purple device and the Android, and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.520
open up the AVD manager to manage your Android virtual devices.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.210
It lists out your existing devices, and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.600
you can always create another virtual device.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.660
You can select the category of device and then a specific device.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.530
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.010
And this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.830
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google API's target, because it

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.810
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.890
You can choose Next.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.230
There's a couple more options and settings that you can modify, for example,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.990
if you want an SD card, or a camera you can change those here, and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.420
then you can go ahead and click Finish, and it'll create a new AVD for you.
