00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.820
The town of Celebration was first loosely
imagined by Walt Disney himself, though the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.090
current town differs wildly from Disney’s
original idea.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.730
Whereas Disney pictured a “perfect” futuristic
city where technology blended seamlessly with

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.710
real life and all possible needs were taken
care of, an idea that served as the basis

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.870
for the Epcot theme park in Disney Land, Michael
Eisner (the CEO of Disney at the time it was

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.790
built) instead visualised Celebration as a
quintessentially classic American town, a

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.759
nostalgic holdover from a purportedly (see
Bonus Facts below) better time in history.

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.000
celebration-florida-2While Celebration didn’t
exactly conform to Walt’s original plans

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.220
for a futuristic city housed beneath a cool
dome, it was conceived with his idea of creating

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.430
a perfect, utopian society firmly in mind,
looking with a giant set of rose-coloured

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.430
glasses to the past instead.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.920
Built just a few miles away from the Magic
Kingdom on land that was originally used to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.759
dump alligators, Celebration was designed
from the ground up to be “perfect” and

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:21.380
the company spared no expense, spending some
$2.5 billion making sure that everything fell

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.780
in line with their vision.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.390
Disney hired some of the world’s foremost
architectural minds to design each building

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.210
in the town, inviting renowned architects
like Robert Venturi and César Pelli to design

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.500
buildings even as humble as banks and post
offices.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.080
In addition to this, Disney also hired urban
planning experts and graphic designers to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.360
oversee where these buildings went and how
they were decorated.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.920
For instance, the graphic design firm was
tasked with creating signage that could be

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.860
displayed around the town that didn’t convey
a sense of branding.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.380
Disney was so impressed with this work that
they went on to hire the same company to design

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.860
such trivial things for the town as manhole
covers and the arrows you see on signs telling

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.290
you which way to walk around the town’s
park.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.060
On that note, perhaps the most jarring thing
about Celebration was that for many years

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.069
there was no branding of any kind, anywhere
in the town.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.670
Celebration had no billboards, no franchises
and no advertising.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.200
Ironically, this is something Disney, one
of the biggest mega-brands on Earth, used

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.849
to sell the idea of the town to potential
residents when it first opened in the mid-1990s.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.109
When it opened, demand for properties in the
development were high, so much so that Disney

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.109
had to hold a drawing which required a deposit
of a thousand dollars just to see who could

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.950
speak to their salespeople first when homes
first started being auctioned off in 1995.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.709
Over the next few years, prices slowly dropped
in Celebration and today they’re roughly

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.560
in line with the average house prices in the
region.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.579
As for how many people live there, according
to the most recent available census from 2010,

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.079
the town is currently home to 7,247 residents.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.450
However, Celebration’s official website
lists this figure as being closer to 9,000.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.859
In terms of demographics, the town is made
up of about 90% white residents (compared

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.549
to about 58% in surrounding areas) with almost
no single people living in the town, which

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.980
may have something to do with the “Declaration
of Covenants”.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.870
The Declaration of Covenants is an amazingly
detailed 166 page document prospective residents

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.760
of Celebration have to sign agreeing to adhere
to a number of rules when they move in.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.959
These rules include things like how you can
park your car in your drive way; how big your

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.959
bushes are allowed to be; what kind of compost
you’re allowed to use; how much bark must

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.389
be around certain plants at all times; a rule
preventing more than two people from sleeping

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.689
in the same bedroom; and a rule stipulating
that a pet can be removed from the community

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.281
without the homeowner’s permission if it’s
deemed to be a “nuisance”, among an amazing

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:04.930
number of other restrictions that would make
even the strictest of HOA’s elsewhere blush.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.510
Of course, as Eisner said when Disney opened
the town, “The first principle of Celebration

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.040
is that no one is actually required to live
here.”

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.940
As you might imagine from all this, many residents
and visitors have said the town feels very

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.400
Truman Show-esque and that it’s so well
designed that it comes off as looking artificial.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.270
Speaking of artificial, the lengths Disney
went to when designing Celebration to make

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.120
it look like the “perfect” town is nothing
short of astounding.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.130
Plastic trees housing speakers that blast
muzak from the 1940s and 1950s are found across

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.130
the town.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.720
In winter, fake snow, nicknamed “snoap”,
is dropped regularly.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.640
Dead leaves are imported each autumn to make
the town look more picturesque.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.650
There were even rumors in the 1990s that Disney
hired actors to walk around the town just

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.000
to make it look more inviting to prospective
buyers.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.900
Disney also attempted to get people to regularly
hold get-togethers on their porches, with

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.410
such events as “lights and lemonade” nights,
but these sorts of efforts were mostly failures.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.510
As one resident noted, “Society’s not
like that.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.060
People wanted to sit indoors and watch TV
instead.”

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.020
In 2003, Disney auctioned off much of the
developed parts of the town to a private buyer,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.090
partially eliminating its stranglehold; by
2004, the majority of the town was no longer

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.570
owned by the Disney corporation.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.090
This was much to the chagrin of many living
in the town who feared this rose-colored time

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.950
capsule of a town would turn into a suburb
like any other without Disney at the helm.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.840
This is something that hasn’t yet happened
even a decade later, partially thanks to the

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.010
Declaration of Covenants that is still in
place and that the residents themselves fight

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.120
any such change tooth and nail.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.650
While we humans often like to look at the
past with amazingly thick rose-coloured glasses

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.930
(whether it’s our own lives or recent human
history), by most metrics, the world for humans

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.500
has never been better.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.810
For instance, while an era like 1950s America
is often propped up as a simple time where

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.840
life was just about as perfect as can be (think
Leave It To Beaver), it was also a time when

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.450
a woman’s place was in the kitchen; a black
person’s (among others) place was in the

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.380
back of the bus; imminent threat of global
nuclear war was just part of day to day life;

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.240
getting your brains (literally) scrambled
was the pinnacle of medical science including

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.310
earning the originator of the procedure, António
Egas Moniz, a Nobel Prize in Physiology or

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.400
Medicine; infant death rates were 750% higher,
while the average life span, partially because

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.560
of this child mortality rate along with the
state of medical science among other things,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.990
was around 45; the CIA was busy conducting
experiments on the effects of biological and

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.490
chemical agents on American citizens without
their knowledge; various forms of eugenics,

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.700
including forced sterilization of undesirables,
was still a thing in numerous countries (including

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.310
the United States) ; the Great Chinese Famine
was just getting started killing some 20-43

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.960
million people; Robin Hood was being purged
from school text books because he was declared

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.630
a communist (just the tip of the iceberg when
it came to the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism);

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.820
and deaths due to wars, while drastically
declining from the decade before, were still

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.820
absurdly high relative to today…

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.932
While certainly every era has its problems
and positive elements, on the whole you’d

00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:19.230
be hard pressed to make the case that this
quintessentially “perfect” time for America

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.350
was even in the same league as today in terms
of quality of life for most citizens of this

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.010
particular rock floating around in space.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.139
Nevertheless, we humans almost universally
love to think of the past as better than the

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.310
present, even if all evidence is to the contrary,
for a variety of fascinating reasons which

00:07:38.310 --> 00:09:21.810
we’ll discuss in an upcoming article.
