what should move forward in time with me

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149
what should move forward in time with me
 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.360
what should move forward in time with me
and what should be let go as if it's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370
and what should be let go as if it's
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.120
and what should be let go as if it's
Deadwood and the more Deadwood that you

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
Deadwood and the more Deadwood that you
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.339
Deadwood and the more Deadwood that you
let go of and burn off when you have the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
let go of and burn off when you have the
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.230
let go of and burn off when you have the
opportunity the less it accretes around

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
opportunity the less it accretes around
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.669
opportunity the less it accretes around
you here here's something interesting

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
you here here's something interesting
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.070
you here here's something interesting
about forest fires you know people have

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
about forest fires you know people have
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.750
about forest fires you know people have
been trying to prevent forest fires for

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
been trying to prevent forest fires for
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519
been trying to prevent forest fires for
a long time especially that damn bear

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
a long time especially that damn bear
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230
a long time especially that damn bear
smokey right he's trying to prevent

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
smokey right he's trying to prevent
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.980
smokey right he's trying to prevent
forest fires

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
forest fires
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.370
forest fires
and so because forest fires burn up the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
and so because forest fires burn up the
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.470
and so because forest fires burn up the
forest and that can't be good but here's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
forest and that can't be good but here's
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810
forest and that can't be good but here's
what happens if you don't let forest

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
what happens if you don't let forest
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150
what happens if you don't let forest
fires burn is that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
fires burn is that
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.569
fires burn is that
well forests collect a lot of dry

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579
well forests collect a lot of dry
 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.160
well forests collect a lot of dry
branches right because tree branches die

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
branches right because tree branches die
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.030
branches right because tree branches die
and wood falls on the forest floor and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
and wood falls on the forest floor and
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030
and wood falls on the forest floor and
collects and so the amount of flammable

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
collects and so the amount of flammable
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.959
collects and so the amount of flammable
material keeps increasing with time and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969
material keeps increasing with time and
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.510
material keeps increasing with time and
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the
amount of flammable material is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
amount of flammable material is
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049
amount of flammable material is
increasing and it gets really dry and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
increasing and it gets really dry and
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389
increasing and it gets really dry and
then it burns then you have a real

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
then it burns then you have a real
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.569
then it burns then you have a real
problem the forest fire can burn so hot

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
problem the forest fire can burn so hot
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.660
problem the forest fire can burn so hot
that it burns root does topsoil right

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
that it burns root does topsoil right
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030
that it burns root does topsoil right
off in which case you don't have a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
off in which case you don't have a
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410
off in which case you don't have a
forest at all anymore you just have a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
forest at all anymore you just have a
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.590
forest at all anymore you just have a
desert and lots of trees are evolved to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
desert and lots of trees are evolved to
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420
desert and lots of trees are evolved to
withstand forest fires of a certain

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
withstand forest fires of a certain
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.090
withstand forest fires of a certain
intensity and some won't even release

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
intensity and some won't even release
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
intensity and some won't even release
their seeds unless there's been a fire

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
their seeds unless there's been a fire
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280
their seeds unless there's been a fire
and so a little bit of fire at the right

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
and so a little bit of fire at the right
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980
and so a little bit of fire at the right
time can stop everything from burning to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
time can stop everything from burning to
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080
time can stop everything from burning to
the ground and that's also a really

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
the ground and that's also a really
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.289
the ground and that's also a really
useful insight a metaphorical insight

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
useful insight a metaphorical insight
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810
useful insight a metaphorical insight
into the nature of sacrifice right it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
into the nature of sacrifice right it's
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640
into the nature of sacrifice right it's
also a lot easier to let go of something

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
also a lot easier to let go of something
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620
also a lot easier to let go of something
when you're deciding to let go of it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
when you're deciding to let go of it
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569
when you're deciding to let go of it
because you've decided yourself that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
because you've decided yourself that
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.399
because you've decided yourself that
it's you're done with that it's a weak

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
it's you're done with that it's a weak
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.249
it's you're done with that it's a weak
part of you it needs to disappear you do

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
part of you it needs to disappear you do
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410
part of you it needs to disappear you do
that yourself it's much better and much

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
that yourself it's much better and much
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.569
that yourself it's much better and much
easier than it is if it's taken away

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
easier than it is if it's taken away
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219
easier than it is if it's taken away
from you forcibly in which case you're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
from you forcibly in which case you're
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.310
from you forcibly in which case you're
very much likely to fight it these other

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
very much likely to fight it these other
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440
very much likely to fight it these other
there's another interesting thing here a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
there's another interesting thing here a
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660
there's another interesting thing here a
motif that runs through the entire Bible

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
motif that runs through the entire Bible
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999
motif that runs through the entire Bible
it's a very very powerful motif and it's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
it's a very very powerful motif and it's
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620
it's a very very powerful motif and it's
partly associated with this idea of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
partly associated with this idea of
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.670
partly associated with this idea of
walking with or walking before God and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
walking with or walking before God and
 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.319
walking with or walking before God and
you know in the New Testament Christ

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
you know in the New Testament Christ
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.840
you know in the New Testament Christ
says something like the father's will be

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
says something like the father's will be
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.419
says something like the father's will be
done and he means that that will should

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
done and he means that that will should
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.190
done and he means that that will should
be done through him and so I can't I

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
be done through him and so I can't I
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.460
be done through him and so I can't I
won't

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
won't
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870
won't
the state that's exactly right but it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880
the state that's exactly right but it's
 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.820
the state that's exactly right but it's
something like this you know a lot of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
something like this you know a lot of
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.560
something like this you know a lot of
what people regard as their own

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
what people regard as their own
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.500
what people regard as their own
personalities and are proud of about

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
personalities and are proud of about
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.180
personalities and are proud of about
their own personalities aren't their own

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
their own personalities aren't their own
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.110
their own personalities aren't their own
personalities at all they're useless

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
personalities at all they're useless
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.470
personalities at all they're useless
idiosyncrasies that differ them

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
idiosyncrasies that differ them
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.640
idiosyncrasies that differ them
differentiate them trivially from other

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
differentiate them trivially from other
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.830
differentiate them trivially from other
people but they have no value in and of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
people but they have no value in and of
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780
people but they have no value in and of
themselves they're more like quirks I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
themselves they're more like quirks I
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.210
themselves they're more like quirks I
remember once I was trying to teach a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
remember once I was trying to teach a
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.870
remember once I was trying to teach a
particularly stubborn student about how

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
particularly stubborn student about how
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.230
particularly stubborn student about how
to write and she had written a number of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240
to write and she had written a number of
 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.870
to write and she had written a number of
essays in in University and got

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
essays in in University and got
 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.510
essays in in University and got
universally walloped for them and the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
universally walloped for them and the
 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.740
universally walloped for them and the
reason for that was she couldn't write

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
reason for that was she couldn't write
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740
reason for that was she couldn't write
really at all she was really really bad

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
really at all she was really really bad
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440
really at all she was really really bad
at writing and so I was sitting down

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
at writing and so I was sitting down
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.890
at writing and so I was sitting down
with her trying to explain to her what

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
with her trying to explain to her what
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.190
with her trying to explain to her what
she was doing wrong and she was being

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
she was doing wrong and she was being
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.140
she was doing wrong and she was being
very annoying about it very recalcitrant

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
very annoying about it very recalcitrant
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.360
very annoying about it very recalcitrant
very very unwilling to listen that was a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
very very unwilling to listen that was a
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.810
very very unwilling to listen that was a
pearls before swine thing you know and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820
pearls before swine thing you know and
 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.730
pearls before swine thing you know and
at one point she said it I can write

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740
at one point she said it I can write
 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.199
at one point she said it I can write
perfectly well this university

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209
perfectly well this university
 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.060
perfectly well this university
professors just don't like my style and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070
professors just don't like my style and
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.190
professors just don't like my style and
I could see all my hands creep towards

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
I could see all my hands creep towards
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.850
I could see all my hands creep towards
her neck yeah well then I'd be funny if

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
her neck yeah well then I'd be funny if
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.610
her neck yeah well then I'd be funny if
it wasn't true but was also true you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620
it wasn't true but was also true you
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020
it wasn't true but was also true you
know when I thought what the hell's with

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
know when I thought what the hell's with
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.110
know when I thought what the hell's with
you you can't even write and you think

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120
you you can't even write and you think
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.300
you you can't even write and you think
you have a style and not only do you

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
you have a style and not only do you
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.520
you have a style and not only do you
think ya know not knowing how to write

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
think ya know not knowing how to write
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.110
think ya know not knowing how to write
is not a style that's the other point

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
is not a style that's the other point
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.490

this internal voice that at least told
 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.700
this internal voice that at least told
him what not to do and then he didn't do

becomes a judge because it's above you
 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.280
becomes a judge because it's above you
right and then you're you're terrified

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.290
right and then you're you're terrified
 

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.110
right and then you're you're terrified
of it maybe that's why you might be

afraid when you go start a new job right
because your this thing is above you and

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:08.690
because your this thing is above you and
 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.300
because your this thing is above you and
you're terrified of it and it judges you

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.310
you're terrified of it and it judges you
 

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.210
you're terrified of it and it judges you
and that's useful because that's the

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220
and that's useful because that's the
 

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.130
and that's useful because that's the
judge that you're creating by

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.140
judge that you're creating by
 

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.560
judge that you're creating by
formulating the ideal tells you what's

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:17.570
formulating the ideal tells you what's
 

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.750
formulating the ideal tells you what's
useless about yourself and then you can

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:19.760
useless about yourself and then you can
 

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.420
useless about yourself and then you can
dispense with it and you want to keep

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.430
dispense with it and you want to keep
 

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.070
dispense with it and you want to keep
doing that and then every time you make

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080
doing that and then every time you make
 

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.570
doing that and then every time you make
a judge that's more elevated then

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:25.580
a judge that's more elevated then
 

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.280
a judge that's more elevated then
there's more useless you that has to be

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:27.290
there's more useless you that has to be
 

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.830
there's more useless you that has to be
dispensed with and then if you pre

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.900

create an ultimate judge which is what

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:31.910
create an ultimate judge which is what

the archetypal imagination of humankind

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.160
the archetypal imagination of humankind
 

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.310
the archetypal imagination of humankind
has done say with the figure of Christ

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320
has done say with the figure of Christ
 

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.500
has done say with the figure of Christ
because if Christ is nothing else he is

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:38.510
because if Christ is nothing else he is
 

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.020
because if Christ is nothing else he is
at least the archetypal perfect man and

at least the archetypal perfect man and
 

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.300
at least the archetypal perfect man and
therefore the judge you have a judge

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.310
therefore the judge you have a judge
 

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.020
therefore the judge you have a judge
that says

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.030

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:45.590
get rid of everything about yourself
 

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.070

pick an ideal that's high enough and you

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.190
pick an ideal that's high enough and you
 

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.560
pick an ideal that's high enough and you
can do this the thing that's interesting

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.570
can do this the thing that's interesting
 

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.450
can do this the thing that's interesting
about this I think is you can do it more

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:58.460
about this I think is you can do it more
 

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.590
about this I think is you can do it more
or less on your own terms

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600
or less on your own terms
 

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.200
or less on your own terms
you have to have some collaboration from

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.210
you have to have some collaboration from
 

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.000
you have to have some collaboration from
other people but you don't have to pick

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.010
other people but you don't have to pick
 

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.920
other people but you don't have to pick
an external ideal you can pick an ideal

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:05.930
an external ideal you can pick an ideal
 

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.440
an external ideal you can pick an ideal
that fills the role of ideal for you you

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.450
that fills the role of ideal for you you
 

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.350
that fills the role of ideal for you you
can say okay well if things could be set

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360
can say okay well if things could be set
 

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.300
can say okay well if things could be set
up for me the way I need them to be and

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.310
up for me the way I need them to be and
 

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.790
up for me the way I need them to be and
if I could be who I needed to be what

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800
if I could be who I needed to be what

would that look like and you can figure

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.230
would that look like and you can figure
 

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.630
would that look like and you can figure
that out for yourself and then instantly

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640
that out for yourself and then instantly
 

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.160
that out for yourself and then instantly
you have a judge and I also think that's

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.170
you have a judge and I also think that's
 

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.510
you have a judge and I also think that's
part of the reason people don't do it

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:22.520
part of the reason people don't do it
 

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.940
part of the reason people don't do it
right why don't why don't people look up

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:24.950
right why don't why don't people look up
 

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.700
right why don't why don't people look up
and move ahead an answer is well you

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:27.710
and move ahead an answer is well you
 

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.980
and move ahead an answer is well you
know you start formulating an ideal you

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:29.990
know you start formulating an ideal you
 

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.660
know you start formulating an ideal you
formulate a judge it's pretty easy to

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:31.670
formulate a judge it's pretty easy to
 

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.790
formulate a judge it's pretty easy to
feel intimidated in the face of your own

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800
feel intimidated in the face of your own
 

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.310
feel intimidated in the face of your own
ideal that's what happens to Kane vs

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320
ideal that's what happens to Kane vs
 

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.900
ideal that's what happens to Kane vs
Abel for example then it's really easy

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:37.910
Abel for example then it's really easy
 

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.090
Abel for example then it's really easy
to destroy the ideal instead of to try

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:40.100
to destroy the ideal instead of to try
 

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.920
to destroy the ideal instead of to try
to pursue it because then you get rid of

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:41.930
to pursue it because then you get rid of
 

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.070
to pursue it because then you get rid of
the judge but it's way better lower the

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.080
the judge but it's way better lower the
 

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.140
the judge but it's way better lower the
damn judge if it's too much like if your

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.150
damn judge if it's too much like if your
 

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.690
damn judge if it's too much like if your
current ambition is crushing you you

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:49.700
current ambition is crushing you you
 

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.860
current ambition is crushing you you
know then maybe you're playing the

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:50.870
know then maybe you're playing the
 

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.170
know then maybe you're playing the
tyrant to yourself and you should tap

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.180
tyrant to yourself and you should tap
 

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.180
tyrant to yourself and you should tap
down your ambitions not get rid of them

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.190
down your ambitions not get rid of them
 

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.800
down your ambitions not get rid of them
by any stretch of the imagination but at

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:56.810
by any stretch of the imagination but at
 

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.050
by any stretch of the imagination but at
least put them more reasonably within

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.060
least put them more reasonably within
 

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.120
least put them more reasonably within
your grasp you don't have to leap from

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.130
your grasp you don't have to leap from
 

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.490
your grasp you don't have to leap from
point one to point 50 in one leap right

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:03.500
point one to point 50 in one leap right
 

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.100
point one to point 50 in one leap right
you can do it incrementally but I really

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.110
you can do it incrementally but I really
 

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.420
you can do it incrementally but I really
like this idea I think it's a profound

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:07.430
like this idea I think it's a profound
 

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:12.280
like this idea I think it's a profound
idea that the process of recapitulating

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.290
idea that the process of recapitulating
 

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.650
idea that the process of recapitulating
yourself continually is also the process

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:14.660
yourself continually is also the process
 

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.079
yourself continually is also the process
of it's a phoenix-like process right

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:17.089
of it's a phoenix-like process right
 

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:19.360
of it's a phoenix-like process right
you're shedding all those elements of

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.370
you're shedding all those elements of
 

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.250
you're shedding all those elements of
you that are no longer worthy of the

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:21.260
you that are no longer worthy of the
 

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.730
you that are no longer worthy of the
pursuits that you're that you're valuing

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:24.740
pursuits that you're that you're valuing
 

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.790
pursuits that you're that you're valuing
and then I would say the idea here is

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800
and then I would say the idea here is
 

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.790
and then I would say the idea here is
that as you do that you shape yourself

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800
that as you do that you shape yourself
 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.620
that as you do that you shape yourself
ever more precisely into something that

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:34.630
ever more precisely into something that
 

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.300
ever more precisely into something that
can withstand the tragedy of life and

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.310
can withstand the tragedy of life and
 

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.050
can withstand the tragedy of life and
that can act as a as a beacon to the

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.060
that can act as a as a beacon to the
 

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.490
that can act as a as a beacon to the
world that's the right way of thinking

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:42.500
world that's the right way of thinking
 

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.560
world that's the right way of thinking
about it maybe first to your friends and

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:44.570
about it maybe first to your friends and
 

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.300
about it maybe first to your friends and
then to your family it's like it's a

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:46.310
then to your family it's like it's a
 

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.190
then to your family it's like it's a
hell of a fine ambition and there's no

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200
hell of a fine ambition and there's no
 

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.410
hell of a fine ambition and there's no
reason that it can't happen you know

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
reason that it can't happen you know
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.150
reason that it can't happen you know
every one of you knows people who are

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160
every one of you knows people who are
 

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.370
every one of you knows people who are
really bloody useful in a crisis and

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.380
really bloody useful in a crisis and
 

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.750
really bloody useful in a crisis and
