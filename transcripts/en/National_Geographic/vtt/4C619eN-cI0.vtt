KELLY STEWART: Dian Fossey
was definitely a pioneer.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.633
I do not think that
word has been overused.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.734
Before that, nobody had done
a long-term study of gorillas.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.633
Nobody had studied
them month after month

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.133
and year after year.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.433
IAN REDMOND: She wanted to
be the scientist who began

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.467
the first long-term field
study of gorilla behavior

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.734
in their society, and to take
that as far as it would go.

NARRATOR: (READING
FOSSEY'S JOURNAL)

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.700
I've been following
one guerrilla group

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.400
round all month, and
I'm now able to get

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.200
within 30 to 60 feet of them.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.367
To be perfectly frank,
I think they're quite

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:08.100
confused as to my species.

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.433
IAN REDMOND: In
order to study them

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.000
and learn about
the behavior, Dian

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.033
had to get them used to her.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.333
And that process is called
habituation, winning the trust.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:41.367
The habituation
process is not nice,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.133
because you're upsetting
this family of gorillas

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.300
day after day after day.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:51.767
Dian's methods played on
the gorillas' curiosity.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:56.433
So she would behave in ways
that would elicit a curious

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.734
rather than anger response.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.266
Like when she was climbing
a tree to get a better look,

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.600
she would deliberately
ham it up.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.633
And she found that that
got their attention.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.400
NARRATOR: (READING FOSSEY'S
JOURNAL) I've gotten

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.800
them accustomed to
me by aping them,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
and they are fascinated
by my facial grimaces

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.367
and other actions that I
wouldn't be caught dead

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.734
doing in front of anyone.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:32.033
I feel like a complete
fool, but this technique

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:33.767
seems to be working.
