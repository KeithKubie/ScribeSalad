00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
The first word we want to think about

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.230
is something called Total Available Market,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.210
and I like to think of Total Available Market as a pie.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.080
It's the entire pie.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410
Total Available Market says, look,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.030
how many people or companies or whatever your unit of sale is

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.390
would want or need this product,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.820
and how large is the market

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.810
in dollars or units

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.210
if they all bought?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540
That's just a pretty nice calculation.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.080
And the question is, okay,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.120
how would I find out?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.950
In different industries, there are analysts that

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.660
specialize in vertical markets and enterprise software,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.510
it's Gartner and Forrester; in video games,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.290
it's the MPD Group; in consumer research,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.120
it's Nielsen; if you want to understand

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.950
how many mobile startups there are,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.350
you go to the Mobile Startup Genome Project, et cetera.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.600
So you need to ask some questions as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470
which industry analysts kind of follow your specific domain,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.010
and then also Wall Street analysts follow competitors in this business.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
That is, they follow whoever's public;

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.870
in fact, some of them write very nice research reports.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.130
If you have access to university library or a friendly broker,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.890
you can get a great free industry analyst report

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.840
and I would be asking others, as well,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.000
and Google is your best friend here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.920
I truly would be spending time trying to understand,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.940
is this a $1 billion market,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.760
and by the way, if you throw out those numbers,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.300
the first thing I'm going to ask you is,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.960
well, that's nice, but break it down for me.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.730
Help me understand how many users,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.630
who are the players, what are the competitors, et cetera.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.160
You need to understand this total available market pie

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.890
in some detail before I'll let you get to the next step,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.650
and the next step is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.070
how big is my slice?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.850
And we tend to use a fancy word for that:

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.470
What's the served available market?

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.340
The served available market means

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.820
okay, well instead of the theory that there are 7 billion people in the world,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.880
how many people really can use a mobile app?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.310
Oh, well a mobile app is kind of dependent on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.070
how many people have mobile Smart Phones,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.389
and if I'm making the mobile app for, let's say an Android platform,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.000
then the first question is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.310
how many theoretical people are going to be using

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.590
Android platforms in this year and in the next 5?

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.990
Oh, now I can start estimating

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.180
what's my served available market.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.800
And so many people have the money to buy the product;

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.050
that is, are you a 99-cent product

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.390
or are you a $99 product?

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.580
Now you're narrowing the market based on pricing or availability

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.360
and you want to do some thought experiments like

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.960
how large would the market be in dollars

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.000
if they all bought--

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.540
if everyone in the served available market bought,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.000
how large would this be,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.540
and this is kind of your first test

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.240
to say, "Oh" or "Wow."

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.870
So you want to understand this before dollars and units.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.190
How do you find out?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.380
Well, this is one where you're really out of the building and talking to customers.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.360
Then I think of this again using the pie analogy

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.070
the first step was

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.140
try to understand the number of people in the world,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.680
but now we can narrow it down if I have the Android app

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.530
to number of Android phones--capable phones,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.500
and then down to how many would buy it at my price,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.480
but now we really want to get pretty specific.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.440
Who example am I going to sell in years 1, 2, and 3?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.400
How many customers is that?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100
How large is the market if they all bought?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.330
That is, what we now are coming up with

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.480
is the total number of dollars

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.820
if you had 100% market share,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.370
your revenue isn't going to exceed this number,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.900
and many units would that be?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.300
Again, how do I find out?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.100
Boy, this is really about

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.000
getting out of the building and talking to customers

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.230
and talking to potential channel partners,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.480
and talking to competitors, et cetera.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.300
You really, at the end of this exercise,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.300
now have the first pass hypothesis

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.770
about is this business model canvas

00:03:50.770 --> 99:59:59.000
worth executing for the next couple of years?
