How did you feel about your results, did you think that the test was accurate?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.844
Many students are surprised to find out that they have implicit biases towards

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:10.821
different groups of people. Now, as you saw from the website, they are many

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:15.900
different implicit association tests. For example, on gun control or politics.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.609
And I strongly encourage you to try these out, and discuss them on the forums

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.030
with your peers.
