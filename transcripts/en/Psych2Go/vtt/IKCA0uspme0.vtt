00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.690
Anxiety is an issue that is being brought to light more and more frequently in Mainstream Media

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.589
Which can really help those that suffer from this issue people often see anxiety as just something that everyone experiences

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.810
But it's important to recognize that there's a difference between the occasional bout of nerves and the debilitating

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.279
symptoms of those that suffer from anxiety as an actual mental illness

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.820
Graham Cl Davie is an experimental psychopathology

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.989
He researches mental health in labs and in particular tries to get a better understanding of the causes of anxiety based problems

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.210
through controlled experimentation

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.700
Devi has spoken a lot about the phenomenon of helicopter parents as Devi explains

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.790
It's only natural for parents to want to do the best for their kids particularly in terms of health and education

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.180
but helicopter parents probably overdo this

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.750
Devi Elaborates further saying in life

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.659
Everyone will be faced by threats and challenges at some point and will need to know how to deal with these when they arise

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.299
Kids whose parents shield them from every kind of challenge even challenges they face in education

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.809
Run the risk of growing up anxious largely because their parents protective behavior has prevented them from

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.859
practicing suitable coping responses

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:30.119
And has conveyed to them that maybe there is something frightening about those things their parents have been shielding them from

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.019
Along with helicopter parents you have snowplow parents

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.530
Snowplow parents are probably the worst observed Devi

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.788
by removing everything in life that might be a potential obstacle to their child they never allow their children to learn how to cope with

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.789
Their own obstacles in Life I

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.489
Suspect many helicopter parents are themselves anxious people who are genuinely attempting to do the best for their kids?

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.539
Says Devi when discussing what makes helicopter parents so protective?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.148
But as a result they're not allowing their offspring to find out about the world and how to cope with it

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.608
Devi points out that kids don't come with manuals

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.458
Every parent has a different way of raising kids

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.410
But it's been proven time and again that overprotection is a downside and doesn't allow children to develop coping mechanisms later in life

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.049
Devi is quick to point out what a major influence a parent can have on the mental health of their children

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.469
Parents can be quite subjective about what issues they consider important in their children's lives explains Davey

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.729
But arguably more important than this is the way these issues are dealt with

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.240
Negative parenting for example is particularly problematic and a common source of mental health problems in offspring

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.440
Negative parenting includes disciplining strategies such as threatening a child you stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.100
Or attending to the child only when they're doing something wrong

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.769
Studies have shown that about 30% of our anxiety can be traced to our own genetics

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.030
But the other 70% is influenced by experience and upbringing

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.649
Even 10 month old babies can pick up on negative behaviors from a parent and avoid things that their parents have behaved negatively towards

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.839
Davey explains this probably stays with kids through their childhood and is likely to override any contrary explanations given by the parent

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.359
Vicarious learning is a significant way in which children pick up anxieties throughout childhood

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.820
many non-Human animals also learn their fears by watching other conspecifics behaving Fearfully, so it's quite a common mechanism in Nature A

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.410
Parent will need a very convincing argument to dissuade an offspring not to be fearful of something they've seen someone else behaving Fearfully of to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.679
Graham clearly shows how parents have a massive impact on what experiences children will take from the world around them if

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.790
You convince a child that something should be feared even if you don't intend to

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.309
Then they will be more likely to fear it as well

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.250
It is good to allow a child to experience things in their own way instead of removing all risks that they may face

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.310
Although it is understandable to want to protect your child

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.940
Parenting is a difficult thing, but as long as you're there for your child and ready to help when needed you'll be just fine

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.470
