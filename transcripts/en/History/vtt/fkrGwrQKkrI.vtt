00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.210
NARRATOR: Irvine,
California, April 2017--

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.500
ancient astronaut theorist,
Giorgio Tsoukalos,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.540
is visiting the Keck
Carbon Cycle Research Lab

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.120
at the University of
California to see firsthand

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.210
how radiation can
dramatically alter

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
the results of carbon dating.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.250
Dr. Southon, I'm Georgio.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.250
Pleasure to meet you.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.170
How are you doing?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.420
Pleasure to meet you.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.880
I'm here to learn
about carbon dating.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.170
Well, let me show you
how this thing works.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.920
Follow me.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.080
NARRATOR: Dr. John Southon
is using accelerator

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.920
mass spectrometry
equipment to carbon date

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.420
a sample of redwood
that was exposed

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.750
to radiation during the testing
of atomic weapons in the 1950s.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.080
The process begins by
sterilizing the wood chip

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.080
and then exposing it to
various chemical processes

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.580
to remove any contamination.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.750
The material undergoes
a combustion process

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.380
and is reduced to graphite
for optimal data retrieval.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.080
Finally, the graphite is sent
through an accelerated mass

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.750
spectrometer to measure the
rate of radiocarbon decay

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.960
and generate the
age of the object.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.710
Pull up a chair.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.580
All right.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.620
So what are we looking at here?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.620
OK, so this is
our result here.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.960
This is how much radiocarbon
was in the samples

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.380
that we've measured
from that redwood.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.250
OK.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.460
And the thing that's
strange about them

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.460
is that the radiocarbon age
is negative, which means,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.620
at least at face
value, these are

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.120
from 600 years in the future.
- Really?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.670
OK.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.790
And the explanation
for that has

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.420
to do with nuclear weapons
testing in the atmosphere

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.830
in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.500
This is amazing.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.670
In your estimation, do you think
that if an object is closer,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.170
let's say, to a nuclear testing
site, that an item like that

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.790
would be yielding
more crazy results?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.170
If it was really close, yes.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.330
OK.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.120
So it would give
you dates that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.830
would be the equivalent
of tens of thousands

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.670
of years in the future.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.120
But I think that's so
incredibly fascinating.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
If any object is exposed to some
type of a thermonuclear event,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.790
it changes the result
of the carbon dating.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.120
So I think that it's
about time for us

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.830
to look at our ancient history
because what if something

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.880
similar happened in our past?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.620
NARRATOR: Stories of
ancient warfare involving

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.500
the gods using
sophisticated weapons

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.040
can be found in numerous texts.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.460
And ancient astronaut
theorists have long

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.210
proposed that these
stories are backed

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.500
up by physical evidence that can
be found throughout the world.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.670
One curious site
that seems to indicate

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.540
some kind of an
atomic explosion is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.540
the very southwestern
corner of Egypt

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.080
right up along the
border of Libya.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.380
And that area is a sandy
area, but it is covered

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.210
with evidence of vitrification.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.170
That's what happens when
you detonate an atomic bomb

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.210
in a desert area.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.380
It turns the desert into glass.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.750
And also at Moen Jo Daro, which
is on the border of Pakistan

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.380
and India, were these
lumps of glass that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.710
had been molten and melted.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.880
And there were
skeletons that were also

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.380
found that were radioactive.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.120
So the evidence
shows that there was

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.620
some kind of atomic
detonation or atomic war

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.920
in our ancient history.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.460
There are
suggestions that there

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.290
may have been some past
nuclear weapons detonation.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.620
And if that occurred, then
the carbon dating must

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.880
account for that possibility.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.040
And that would make,
by the way, everything

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.790
look younger in carbon dating.
