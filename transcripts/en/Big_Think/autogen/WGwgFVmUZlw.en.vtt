00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.180
You know Steve Jobs was one of those romantic
innovators who comes up with great ideas,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.900
has real passion, real vision and that prickly
personality, that very pushy reality distorting

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.120
personality that can get something done.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.300
However, in writing about Steve Jobs I realized
something interesting.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.680
It wasn’t just his one vision.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.779
It was his ability to create a team around
him, his ability to work in partnership with

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.189
Steve Wozniak.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.270
You go down the list with dozens of people
all the way to Tim Cook.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.000
And not only to work in partnership but to
create a collaborative team around him of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.690
great designers like Jony Ive and software
people like Phil Schiller and Johnny Rubinstein.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.660
And I once asked Steve Jobs, you know, what
product are you the proudest of.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
And I thought he might say the iPod or the
iPhone or the iPad, whatever, the Mac.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.989
And he said, you know, making a product is
hard but making a team that can continually

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.020
make products is even harder.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.939
The product I’m most proud of is Apple and
the team I built at Apple.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.670
And that’s when I moved to this new book,
The Innovators, because I wanted to say it’s

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.990
not just about the visionary, it’s about
the visionary being able to execute on the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.689
vision by finding the right people to be collaborative
and creative with.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.259
So with Steve Jobs even though we think of
him as being a tough boss or we think of him

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.380
as having sort of a prickly personality, there
were people who were so loyal to Steve they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.680
would walk through walls for him.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.350
He developed around him the tightest, most
loyal, most integrated team in Silicon Valley.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.700
You know, Steve Jobs was very intuitive in
the way he made decisions.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.720
He wasn’t somebody who deeply reflected
or spent a whole lot of time hashing it through.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.240
But he would work with everybody from the
hardware designers like Jony Ive to the software

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.789
people and just sort of say no, that doesn’t
feel right.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.299
Sometimes he used a little bit stronger language
than that.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.789
Or it’s genius, it’s perfect, it’s awesome,
it’s incredible.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.569
But, you know, don’t try this at home.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.349
People come up to me sometimes and say I’m
like Steve Jobs - when somebody does something

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.360
that stinks I tell them it stinks.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.599
Yeah and have you invented the iPod?

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.160
Have you invented an iPhone?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.709
No, Steve Jobs didn’t just have a tough
personality.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.830
He also had a charismatic visionary personality
and he brought people in.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.069
And he really could inspire people because
even though sometimes he couldn’t articulate

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.710
exactly what he wanted he could sure point
the way to getting it there.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.599
He also believed in physical space as necessary
for collaboration.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.730
We think maybe we can collaborate in the digital
age by doing it virtually from afar but when

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.170
he built the Pixar building and when he designed
what will be the new headquarters for Apple

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.460
it was all about making sure people had serendipitous
encounters.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.280
That they came through the atrium.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.989
That they walked through the perimeter where
the light was in the new Apple headquarters.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.530
Where they would just bump into people and
say what are you working on.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.760
And then naturally collaborate.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.150
But he felt that, you know, just by walking
through Jony Ives design studio and touching

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.270
a few things and talking to people he could
collaborate by being in a physical space better

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.910
than he could do it by Skype or email or,
you know, Google hangouts.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.980
So Steve’s team building skills really sort
of came from the force of his personality

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.999
and being with him.
