&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This afternoon,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.840
my guest is a celebrated
novelist and poet Ha Jin.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.400
Thank you so much for coming today.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.700
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Oh, thank you.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.500
I'm happy to be here again.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.090
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.860
Thank you.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The life of this
remarkable writer began in China

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.080
where his father was
a military officer.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.430
At 13, Ha Jin himself joined
the People's Liberation Army

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400
which he stayed with
until he was 19.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.790
He earned a Masters degree
in Literature in China,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.400 position:56%
and earned a scholarship to Brandeis
University in the late 1980s.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.650
When he and the rest of world
watched the Chinese government

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.740
murder democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square in 1989,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.450
he decided to remain
in the United States.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.270 position:56%
He eventually earned a PhD, and now,
he teaches at Boston University.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.910
Over the years, he's published
several unforgettable novels

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.720
about life in China and the
immigrant experience in America.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.020
He's won a number of awards,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.010 position:56%
including two PEN/Faulkner awards
including for one called "War Trash"

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.850
which was also a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.440
His new novel is called
"The Boat Rocker".

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.300
It's a story of a Chinese
patriot named Feng Danlin?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.600
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.470
Who works in New York as a
reporter for a news service

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.630
that appeals primarily to
Chinese people living abroad.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.230
And, Danlin is so passionate
about exposing what he calls

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.460
"the towering corruption of Chinese
politics" with his acid tongue

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090
and his heart stabbing commentary.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.260
His personal credo is
"Honesty is strength.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.010
Democracy dies in darkness."

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.810
[ Laughter ]

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.630
[ Applause ]

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.010
Now, you must have started "The
Boat Rocker" several years ago.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.310
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Many years ago.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, yet, it's
being published at a time,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.530
at a climate of ferocious
attacks on the press.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.540
How is that possible?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.840
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I don't know.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880
Maybe something, you know,
really, it's beyond myself.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.870
Always, there is some coincidence.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.520
The same thing happened with "War
Trash", and the abuse of prisoners.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.140
By the way, I started the
book there was no such thing

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.600
in my, on my horizon, and.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.090
But, this book, in fact, I started
my, started on the, in 2007.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
inspired you to write a story

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.570
about a Chinese journalist
in America who's so excited

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.060
about freedom of expression?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.060
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Back in 2003,
there was a friend of mine

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.670
who was a freelancer,
freelancing journalist.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.780
He wrote a series of exposes
about a novel of a similar kind.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.830
Not exact the same by
Canadian immigrant.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.670
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, because this,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.340
my friend's political
position, he was very radical.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Radical
in what sense?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.290
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: He supported
Taiwan's independence.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.890
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, debated.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: All right.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.490
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Independence.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.710
So, he was viewed as
a kind of enemy.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.140
More than a distant enemy of China.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Of
the [inaudible] state.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.740
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.800
So, [inaudible] expose
didn't get anywhere.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600
He was completely suppressed.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.900
Couldn't get anywhere.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
about in America?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.560
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Even in America
didn't get anywhere.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.630
Very briefly people, you know,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.070
it was published online,
but didn't get anywhere.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I know the feeling.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.420
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, was amazed.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.790
I was really amazed by, you know,
the power that we could manage

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.830
to suppress the voice like that.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.770 position:56%
President Trump has called American
journalists really dishonest people,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.750
bad people, sick people, people who
don't like America, and he's mused

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.440
about how much he'd like to
arrest and jail journalists.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.140
How does that kind of
language strike you?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.930
How does it make you
feel, as someone who's?

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.230
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Sure.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.990
But, I think, again, that is
against the Constitution, right?

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.530
And, I think apparently, that was
really, that was not American.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.800
I think that kind of
stuff is not American.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.370
We, it's more like something
from the Chinese government.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.670
[laughs]

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.880
Danlin, this journalist who's
the center of your novel thinks

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.630
that rocking the boat is not
just right, it's a sacred duty.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.930
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do
you feel that way?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.280
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: For me,
it's not just duty.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.480
It's a way, how I exist, I think.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.130
That is very important.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.910
All I have is a voice.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.450
As long as I continue to write,
I have a voice of my own.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.890
I think that's important.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are you, does your
work get any attention in China?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.620
Are you allowed to
travel there, speak there?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.920
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I couldn't.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.030
You know, I've been in the states
for 32, I couldn't go back.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.420
And, even my parents died,
when they were dying,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.300
still I couldn't go
back to see them.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.340
And, so I really, personally,
I cannot go back to China

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.020
or have anything to do in China.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.490
But, about a third of my
books got published in China.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.670
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, many of
them, really, censored.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.820
And, for instance, I
have a book I say, like,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.220
of poems that just came out.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.740
But, all the poems have
political resonance were pulled.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.310
So, I felt all the
teeth were pulled.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.910
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: From that book.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, this book,
has it been published in China?

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.070
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No, no.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.370
It's impossible.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.670
This is.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Impossible, you say.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.270
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Impossible.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.570
Impossible.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.870
Only a third of my books.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.170
For instance, for a short story
collection like "The Bridegroom",

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.770
they publish it, but when they came
to me, I saw two stories missing.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.750
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Two stories
missing, so basically,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.850
they were somehow,
they were incomplete.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.450
Yes. Well, Danlin's passion

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.470
for American journalism
sometimes sounds kind of naïve.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.770
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: He tells one critic,
"In this great country, America,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.040 position:56%
people go by the rules, and
reporters always publish the truth."

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.340
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, I
know a lot of journalists.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.720
I am a journalist, and I
think that is generally true.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.640
And, yet, when he says it like
that, it kind of makes me cringe.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.310
Is he being set, are you setting
him up as some kind of a zealot?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.040
Is this a parody of?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.800
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: You know,
he's a troubled man.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.270
So, psychologically, he's, you
know, he has a lot of problem, too.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.990
A lot of problems.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.530
He, the moment he arrived, his
wife gave him divorce papers,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.870
and his Chinese passport
was confiscated.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.020
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, he, basically,
he was forced into exile.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.760
So, he was troubled.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.950
So, there was kind of
a kind of entangled,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.660
conjugated feelings
between him and China.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.260
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, he's
trying to find this kind

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.150
of a different value
system to sustain himself.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, he, that's why he had
to believe in democracy and freedom,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.920 position:56%
and of course, eventually, he knows.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Knows what?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.220
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Knows, you know, it
doesn't always work that way.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.200
He finds American, you know,
official appear basically

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.510
in response to Chinese
government's request.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.610 position:56%
And, basically, they also cooperated

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.470
with the Chinese government
indirectly.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.530
Your point, your theme of the
book is that American freedom

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.600
of expression is more complex,
more compromised than we let on.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.930
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I think so.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.450
But, yes, there's all, there are
always some kind of the seedy side.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.180
I think I, on the one
hand, American, you know,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.380
I like the American idealism.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.160
You know, we're supposed to be the
city [inaudible] city on the hill.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.460
That's great.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.060
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: The vision, the
beacon of freedom and democracy.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.730
On the other hand,
American pragmatism.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.890
That's also part of
the American character.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.610
We calculate everything
by dollars, and.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Danlin has to
learn that having free expression

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.240
and having the money to express
oneself are two different things.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.540
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Two different things.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.700
Yes. Eventually, he learn that
because even the agency was.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.300
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Bothered by
the Chinese government.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.900
You can express yourself freely,
but if no one's listening,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.740
it's a tree falling in the forest.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.630
Can you describe for us, to people
who don't know much about China,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.880
haven't been there, what are
the essentially differences

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.020
between the media in this
country and in China?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.990
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: In China,
I think, basically,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.720
there is no freedom of the media.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.400
Basically, really, there is,
for instance, something happened

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.430
in [inaudible] at the central
government they will issue a text

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.130
basically to all the
agencies, all the newspapers

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.930
and TV stations will
follow the same format.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.570
So, you cannot go beyond that.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.060
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, but in this
country, basically, every agency,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:13.180
every paper has his own
room to report a truth.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.100
I think. That's a huge difference.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.080 position:56%
For instance, recently, there was a
counter border dispute between China

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.630
and India, and the China
side, basically, backed down.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:30.300
But, they reported as a huge
victory in their troops retreat,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.290
retreated from the occupied ground.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.770
But, the truth is, the
Chinese government agreed

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.350
to stop building the road.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.920
That was a huge, huge setback to
the Chinese government's plan.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.360
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, this was
unknown to the Chinese.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.660
Not reported at all.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So, there are many
newspapers, many news sources,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.000
but they're all basically
telling the same story.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.300
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Exactly the same.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.730
The propaganda department.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.090
They issue the order.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.680
You can't go beyond that.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In this country,
we hear so much, so many references

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.650
to "the media" as though
it were some sort

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.110
of monolithic thing,
but of course, it's not.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.410
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.330
It's not. That's why there're
varied voices and diverse voices

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.880
that make people, you know, we
have a different perspectives,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.810
our own personal take on events.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.450
But, in China, most of the
people, just the one voice.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.550
That's very, make people
blind to realities.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We're
still trying to figure

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.580
out to what extent the Russians
influenced public opinion

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.880
on our election.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.130
Do you see the Chinese government
influencing public opinion

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.570
or reporting in this country?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.870
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.860
Yes. And.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.730
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: For instance, there are
some news agencies basically they

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.870
give the feeling that
they are just the branch

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.470
of the Chinese government
official, official media.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.720
For instance, there's one
called Doorway, it's similar,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.450
similar like People's [inaudible]
overseas [inaudible] edition.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:08.730
And, also, I think even
American Chinese language media

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.140
or newspapers, they have
to beware of the responses

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.230
from the Chinese government.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.400
So, that is also indirect
censorship.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.880
Lot of things they can't
just report blindly, openly.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you
think we're naïve

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:29.410
about how foreign governments are
influencing our public opinion?

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.320
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I think to
some standard, yes.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.500
I do believe the Russians
and the Chinese, they try.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.560
They try hard, and
not just directly.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.320
For instance, Trump has
family businesses in China,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.400
and so there are ways for the
Chinese government, basically,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.670
to influence officials
holding the offices.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.270
That's normal.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.620
Even from, you know, early,
the Bush Administration.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.430
I remember clearly the Chinese,
once there was a dispute

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.320
within China the United States.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.610
A Chinese delegation landed
in Washington D.C. airport.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.800
They said, "We're not
talking to the Bush Jr.,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.490
President Bush Jr. We're
going to his father

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.370
and asking the father
to teach him lesson."

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.940
So.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.210
[ Laughter ]

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.030
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, really, they
have, we are, they have ways of.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.010
They, my feeling is that they
speak different language.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.290
They communicate on
different frequencies

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.880
that we don't know about those.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The plot
of your novel which is,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.170
it's kind of remarkable, is that
Danlin receives an assignment

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.380
to expose the truth about
a romance novel from China.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.680
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
about, it's about 911.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.360
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It sounds like a
kind of "Fifty Shades of 9/11".

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.170
[ Laughter ]

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.760
And, for some reason, the Chinese
government takes an interest

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.250 position:56%
in promoting this romance novel,
and the Bush people also promote it.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.550
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: That was [inaudible].

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's a lot

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.200
of different people
promoting this novel.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.500
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.800
Yes.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But, it's just a
novel, but Danlin becomes obsessed

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.930
with exposing it as
a work of propaganda.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.420
There are lucrative
Hollywood contracts,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.210 position:56%
etc. Why would the Communist Party
take an interest in a romance novel?

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.980
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: See [inaudible]
government is involved.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.820
Very often, it's just one or two
officials who have the connections

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.180
with the author or the publisher.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.140
So, either [inaudible] use public,
you know, the power of their office

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.380
to sponsor [inaudible] like that.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.510
In the actually [inaudible]
more serious than that.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.790
In fact, it was reported
the novel was accepted by,

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:45.280
was purchased by James Cameron,
you know, the great Director.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.880
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Comedian Directors.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.120
You know, for millions of dollars.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.580
It's really, it's even more absurd.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Than your book.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.680
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Than my book.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, now Danlin, it
comes out later, I guess early on,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.720
that this novel is
written by his ex-wife.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.680
So, he's being asked to expose as
propaganda a novel by his ex-wife.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.840
That's the kind of assignment
that would never be made

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.330
in a legitimate U.S. newspaper.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.630
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I know.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.930
Personal, yes.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.230
Conflict of interest.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, that would
be a clear conflict of interest,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.830
and any newspaper I know of.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.900
Why did you pursue
that sort of a plot?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.660
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Because I think I
want him, he's not just flat.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.410 position:56%
You know, black and white character.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.990
There's a personal
motivation involved.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.820
I do believe personal
motivations at historical moment.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.110
That is where often
change a lot of things.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.090
Yes. And, he, of course, is
convinced that he can do this

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.650
without any influence at all.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.130
He will be completely objective as
he goes about exposing his ex-wife.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:53.080
She's, he's totally convinced
himself that he will be.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.760
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I know.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.060
Yes.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But, that
does seem absurd to me.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.410
Which raises the issue.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.050
We're laughing, and it is funny.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.020 position:56%
I think you're a brilliant novelist,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.070
but I do not think
you're a funny novelist.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.130
[ Laughter ]

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.480
But, this book is really funny.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.360 position:56%
I mean, it totally took me off guard

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.850
that you were writing
this witty, funny story.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.860
What did it feel different to you
to be writing what is often comedy?

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.440
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I only, you
know, before this book, or,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.660
there's a small novel called
"In the Pond", my earlier book.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, this book, in terms
of style, they are, you know, comic.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.610
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, in the, really, I
agree, you know, people, you know,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.650
my publisher didn't know
how to deal with this.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.250
Yeah.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.550
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Basically,
this was not typical.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, it's not.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.710
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: My book at
all, and but I really

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:52.860
about to write a kind
of cynical dark humor.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.160
That kind of novel.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Does it have
any precedent in your life?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.920
Have you been writing comedy
and not showing anybody?

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.630
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No, just before this,
there's only one "In the Pond".

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, "The Pond".

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.230
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: "In the Pond", yeah.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.400
"In the Pond", but that book,
even, there was not, there was no,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.960
there was published by a very
small place called Zoland Books

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.570
in Cambridge in Massachusetts.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.170
I know Zoland.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.470
They're gone now.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.770
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.070
It went out of business.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.670
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Twenty years ago.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.270
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, the book, basically,
it, most people might not know it.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I didn't
know about it.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.870
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah, it's, but it is
the same in terms of the style.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.170
They're similar.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How funny.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.770
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, this one
is, the [inaudible] is told

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.720
in the first person, so
that is the difference.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, it has a
kind of Kafkaesque comedy to it.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.010
The increasingly absurd,
bizarre situations.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.850
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah, I do believe
reality is more bizarre

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.150
than fiction.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.750
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, I really
believe in that.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I was talking to
Jasmine Moore, and she said she had

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.460
to write a particular
story as nonfiction

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.140
because if she wrote it is
fiction, no one would believe her.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.440
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.040
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: [inaudible] very
often, [inaudible] you shave them.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.710 position:56%
You want to make them fictionalized,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.360
make them [inaudible]
the story better.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.660
People don't believe in that.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.260
Yeah.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.560
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, reality,
you will reality,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.860
they are even darker, more bizarre.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.830
Yeah. Like Joseph Conrad, you're
writing in an adapted language,

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.990
and when you accepted the National
Book award for "Waiting", you said,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.870
"I also wish to thank America, a
land of generosity and abundance,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.840
but they have accepted
me as a citizen.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.900
Above all, I thank the English
language which is embracive

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.620
and vibrant and has
provided me with a niche

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.730
where I can do meaningful work."

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.800
Can you explain to us
what it's like to try

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.690
and create art in another language?

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.950
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Oh, there was a
lot of, lot of frustration.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.250
I think in the beginning,

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.600
uncertainty was a big
[inaudible] part

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.390
because I didn't know whether I
could write and how far I could go.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.770
But, the beauty of the language,
the English language is that it has

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:06.430 position:56%
within it a grand tradition in which
non-native speaking authors became

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.070
essential writers such
as Conrad and Nabokov.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.600
So, in other words, the
road is there already open.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.690
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, really,
there's nothing original.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:28.950
It all depended on when I have the
courage, the luck, and the ability.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.660
So, [inaudible] in
fact, uncertainty.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.650
Certainty is another
human condition.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.810
So, we had to take [inaudible],
and that's part of the process.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.140
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: That's also
price for freedom, right?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.650
And, we are responsible for
ourself, ourselves, body and soul.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.950
So, that.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.550
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: In that sense,
I could take uncertainty

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.070
as a [inaudible] process.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.230
Eventually, I realized,
in fact, this is good.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.090
Because if everything
is clear and certain.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.690
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I cannot be a bad book.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
I know what you mean.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.290
Yes. No, it has to be.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.590
There has to be tension in there.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.890
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Mediocre, mediocre book.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.280
Yes, you need a nervousness,
the edge.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.580
But, what do mean about English
being embracive language.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.380
Not just that it embraces
other words.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.870
I suppose you means something else.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.170
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.040
But, I look at, you
know, the people writing,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.650
lot of people from
different languages.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.320
And, the but things you can't
accept, all the language,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.220
all kinds of English is
as a literary language.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.590
That's a great, great,
you know, phenomenon.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.520
I really, for other authors.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.550
For people from different
backgrounds, different languages,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.950
this is a great, great opportunity.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.250
Great, great space.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.980
I think a great space
where you can work.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.120
For instance, Chinese is a
highly literary language.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.240
People speak all kinds of dialects.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.610
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, when
we come to the page,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.880
you have to write a language that's
separated from natural speech.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: It's a literary language.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.340
So, in other words, that language
is somehow already formal.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It shapes the story.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.940
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: It shapes, yes.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.220
The dialect, many dialects
are not presented

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.570 position:56%
in the literary language, discourse.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
no way to represent them?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.170
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No, no.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.800
But, by contrast, the English,
all kind of [inaudible].

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.400
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: You write well.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.460
Everything can be accepted
as a literary language.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Google
Translate gives us the impression

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.060
that translation is a
matter of replacing one word

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.260
with a word in another language.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.560
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But,
that's not the case.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.160
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.460
No, no, no.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.760
It's no, no.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.060
It's completely different because
when you write the literary work,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.340 position:56%
you have, that's always playfulness.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:53.470
You want the language to be
somehow slightly odd, fresh.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.480
Where, academic language
deformalization, right?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.010
You make unfamiliar to others.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.620
But, in fact, for people
from another,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.700
people from different languages,

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.410
[inaudible] task is what
can I bring to English.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.600
So, that's for me because
I started as a poet,

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.980
and that was a question
on my mind constantly.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Without
embarrassing you,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.320
what do you think you
bring to the language?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.450
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I, basically, I try
to really try to write languages

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.510
that have different
resonances, that sound foreign,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.830
but at the same time,
entirely natural.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.130
That's my vision.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, I think
that's a vision you realize.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.860
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I don't know.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.160
I don't know.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You do.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.760
You do.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.060
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Oh, thank you.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.360
By that, you know, I try to
imagine because other people

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.790
from my situation, I didn't,
I had not met a single person

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.440
who spoke English before I was 21.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Job.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.100
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, and there
was no way for me to,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.840
to just write standard English.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.440
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Because
that would be flat.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.040
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Unoriginal anyway.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.640
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, it's better
for me to basically just

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.850
to write make it strange,
a little bit strange.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you
conceive of stories

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.270
in Chinese or in English now?

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.930
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I always in English.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In English.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.530
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: In English, yeah.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: If you conceived
of this story in Chinese,

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.150
it would be a different story?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.450
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Very different.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.960
As I said just now,
there's a language,

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.130
the language Chinese
literary language,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.910
it has little to do
with natural speech.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.950
It's created by all the Chinese

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.000
to share no matter
what dialect you speak.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.210
That's different, very different.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.560
So, but the English is
really, it's remarkable,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.320
just so close to natural speech.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.530 position:56%
In that sense, it is very embracive.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.600
Everything can be included.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Including
Danlin's thoughts.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.460
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: His urgency,
his naivete, all those things

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.320
that you capture in both his
thoughts and his spoken language.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.980
When he sounds so strident that
it almost sounds like a parody

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.980
of somebody believing in America.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.280
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.410 position:56%
But, see, that's the situation I
should be more elaborate about this.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.740
That is, when the character's
the one that's communicating,

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.160 position:56%
especially this Chinese [inaudible].

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.230
I would hear Chinese expressions.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.830
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, I would adapt.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.810
Try to not transcribe,
but adapt, adjust.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.550
Make them more comprehensible
to the English ear.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.530
So, I do, the Chinese,
the language is behind,

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.620
in the background for the creation.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because
these characters.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.220
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Also speak Chinese.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.820
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes, yes.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.580
Exactly. So, I wouldn't say this
has nothing to do with Chinese.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.180
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Chinese
always in the background.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.480
It make noise.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.080
and it influences the
way they speak English.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.380
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.680
Yes. Yeah.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I thought it
was a fascinating novel in terms

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.890
of its themes about journalism and
the place of journalism in America.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.880
Oh, it's really troubling.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.180
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Thank you.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.480
Yes.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Made me
think in more complex ways

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.370
about the privileges we have and
how they are so routinely abused.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.560
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes, a lot of things
that, you know, I didn't expect,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.200
but when it was published, a lot
of things became transparent.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.850
For instance, the [inaudible]
in the early 2000s, I think,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:21.350
they began to acquire
media facilities.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.890
I was troubled by it.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.310
I talked to some friends.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.990
They didn't care, but
it gradually got bigger.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.240
Now, they're just newspapers
and TV stations,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.810
but [inaudible] there are
a lot of other things.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.600
Even companies at Hollywood.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, what your
novel explores and brings out is

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.180
that what we think of
as government control

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.020
of the media is far too simplistic.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.370
It's not just the governments
will censor stories.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.670
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: No.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's that
they will obscure the truth.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.270
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: By
flooding our lives

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:52.870
with so many slightly
different stories.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.170
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.950
That's the, I think that
comes propaganda, they don't,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.020
they don't report anything
without some kind of facts.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.880
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: [laughs] Under it.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.300
Usually, they shave the
facts, they start the facts,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.920 position:56%
but often there is some truth in it,
but they stretch it and distort it,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.760
make it feel differently.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, promoting
so many different stories

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.230
that after a while, you
just kind of check out.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.850
Cool, what can we believe.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.150
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I know.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.450
Yes.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.050
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you, it's such
an important subject for this town.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.650
I'm just so grateful
you wrote this book.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.950
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Oh, thank you.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you take
some questions from the audience?

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.550
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Sure.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.850
I'll be, yeah.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.150
I'll be very happy.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's two
microphones, one here, and one here.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.750
Please come to the mic.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.050
Wave your hands a bit.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.350
It's hard for us to see you,
the lights are so bright.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.650
Yes, sir.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.950
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.250
It's very interesting
to hear your remarks.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.780
My question is about
"Nanjing Requiem".

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.920
For those who don't
know, I urge them to buy

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.910
and read the story of
the Nanjing massacre.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.730
I read in the New York Times review
of that, that Jinling University

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.500
at that heart of that was
a symbol of civilization.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.910 position:56%
And, when I read the novel, I
didn't see it in an allegorical way.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.290
I just thought it was a very
compelling story, and I wondered

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:07.580
as you were writing it whether
you were thinking allegorically

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.420 position:56%
or whether you were just telling the
events as they unfolding in Nanjing.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.720
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Hi.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.020
Thank you.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.320
It's kind.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.180
The book is really, it's very hard
because there were so many authors

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.390
who tried, not only Chinese, in
fact, authors in [inaudible] tried

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:29.870
to really write about that
horrendous historical event.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.440
For me, I think I made
it allegorical,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.810 position:56%
but it's not, it was not my purpose.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:43.540
There was a, there was a narrative
about missionaries in China.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.890
Always, these people were described
as kind of semi spies and people

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.170
who really were [inaudible].

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.830
To some extent, that was
true, but on the other hand,

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.280
there's another kind of
story that was not reported.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.830
The Chinese didn't know that it
also did a lot of good things.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.920
For instance, in China, every
hospital would have a red cross.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.720
That is from the Catholic church.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.350
People would know where to
look for medical service.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.750 position:56%
In this country, we don't have that,
but in China, it's always there.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.180
Always there.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.030
That's, you know, that's
a good influence.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.170
Good missionary work.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:34.300 position:56%
And, in a same, in a same situation,
I want to really write about the,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.570
basically, the group of American
missionaries how they were involved

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.970
in this tragedy.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.270
I think that it was an
important moment in history,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:48.560
and because this is [inaudible]
can not only, you know,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:54.790
because some event happened
between China and Japan,

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.950
it involved people
from other countries.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.530
It was an international event.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.450
Toward the end of the book,
it was, it became transparent

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.470
that the Chinese didn't
collect any material evidence.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:14.430
Only Americans shot, Americans
and Germans shot photographs,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.200
even footage of the atrocities.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.800
But, for me, personally,
basically, it was a huge challenge.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.350
I really, I made so many
missteps in the beginning.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:29.630
I told everything in third
person, but after 30, 32 drafts,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.370
I couldn't continue anymore.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.950
I had to scratch the whole,
scrap the whole thing and restart

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:41.940
and equate a character who is
narrator as assistant to Minnie.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.680
And, but for me, that,
personally, as an artist,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.650
that book was important because
afterward, I felt I could write.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:55.430
And, any novel, no matter
how difficult, I could,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.970
I could try to manage
to confront it.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.720
So, before that, I didn't
have that kind of confidence.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.250
So, for me, it's very personal.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.910
It's like a hurdle.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:13.080
I had to cross it.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.380
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.880
Two of my favorite books of yours
are "The Crazed" and "A Free Life".

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.780
And, to some degree, characters
seem to be defined by the degree

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.030
to which they resist change
or adaptation or degree

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:29.620
to which they embrace or adapt
to change in their lives.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.380
But, there seems to be sort of
a sadness of those characters

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.600
who adapt in terms of
dreams that die or.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.900
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.640
&gt;&gt; Or, things they leave behind
that they can never take with them.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.760
I would like to ask you, you know,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.000
do you see something
redemptive in that adaptation?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.090
You know, is there, do
they become more focused,

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.350
and how does that relate
to your own experience?

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.650
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I'm glad.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.950
Thank you so much.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.960
Those books are very close
to my heart, and in fact,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.990
"The Crazed" was my first novel,

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.010
but I didn't have the
skill to finish it.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:06.190
So, it came out after I had
published two, six books.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:13.910
And, I think there is a redemptive
kind of aspect of their experience.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.710
I think, toward the end, they
all become, somehow, they become,

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.420
the characters become independent.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:27.470
They want to go their own way
whether they perish or survive,

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:33.290
but they want the freedom
to seek their own existence.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:39.970
In that way, my personal
experience does correspond to that.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.390
I do have a question that may
challenge your earlier comment

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.150
about the modern Chinese language.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.570 position:56%
You said it was, it is
standardized and some kind of stiff.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:02.540
But, I know this is somehow
true in public realm.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.840
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.140
&gt;&gt; For example, Chinese media.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.440
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.190
&gt;&gt; When they are writing, it's
really some standard language.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:15.260
But, from my own knowledge of
Chinese literature in Chinese

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.970
in the past three decades.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.030
I see some really good
examples of dialect writing.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.330
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:28.410
&gt;&gt; For example, [inaudible] and
newer experiments by a novelist

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.190
from Shanghai [inaudible].

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.590
I just want to ask if you're
informed of this development,

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.290
and if yes, how would
you make sense of it?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.590
Thank you.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.890
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Okay.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.190
That's a good question.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.490
I know these writings,
especially [inaudible].

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.420
I think that that's an
experimental novel trying

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.400
to incorporate [inaudible]
dialect into the stand Mandarin.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:59.400
And, but, again, it's not
a pure dialect because,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.400
but people can feel
this is different.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.430
That is a great experiment.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:09.010
I think that's why on
different occasion,

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.070
I said it's a political gesture

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:16.160
because the book challenges
the political linguistic order.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.840
And, as for [inaudible], there's
another, you know, a great novelist

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.410
who by the last year
or two years ago.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.980
I think his book is
not based, I mean,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:35.560
the language is not exactly based
on the dialect, original dialect.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.250
I heard him speak, and [inaudible].

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:45.920
The way they speak the language,
it's very hard to understand,

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.110
to be understood by me even.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.600
But, the, on page,
absolutely transparent.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.910
The style's very clear, and I
think in Chinese literature,

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.280
there has always been
a kind of a tradition.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.080
People from the south
suffer from the fact

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.570
that their dialects
are not presented

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.760
in the official standard
of Mandarin.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.530
Whereas, the people from the
north, they have that advantage.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.680
That's why a lot of
people from Beijing

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.430
and from the north very often
they write more naturally

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:28.520
because the official language is
close to their natural speech.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.600
So, there is a huge difference.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.420
This, I think, is in fact,
reflect where historical facts.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.090
See, the Chinese, when the first
emperor, when he came to power,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.810
he basically violently,
he killed all the scripts.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:49.430
At the time, there were all kind
of [inaudible] script, bird script.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.670
All kinds, but he killed them all.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:57.340
So, there's only one written word,
so [inaudible] in Chinese history,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.230
political history,
the cultural history,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:04.470
there is a term called
rectification of word, the word.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.060 position:56%
That means the word must be precise,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:12.570
and that is part of
the ruling machine.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:17.260
You cannot violate,
change the shape of words.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:22.930 position:56%
So, I think that is, that is, but
the two books you mentioned, really,

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.530
I think they, especially
[inaudible],

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.210
I think is a great experiment.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.180 position:56%
I think more authors should do that.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:36.180
In other words, people began to
try to make the dialect present

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.770
in the literary discourse.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.480
But, this is just the beginning.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When you say the
word can't be shaped or changed,

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.420
do you mean its physical
representation on the page,

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.220
or do you mean something
about its meaning?

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.520
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Both.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.640
Especially the, even the
physical presentation.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, how does
that effect you as a poet

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.670
where the shades of meaning
and the shaping of words seems

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.000
to be the whole industry of poetry?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.300
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I know.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.780
That's why, that's why
the literary discourse has

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.330
to be, has been some official.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.860
It might be less now, but
conventionally, it was important,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:19.040
especially when you write a report
to the palace, to the court.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.870
I think there was one
case the guy drop a dot.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.910
He thought he would be beheaded.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.310
He was terrified.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.110
There are moments like that.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.670
You're not supposed to
change the shape of the word.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you run up
against though, you don't write in,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.840
you don't write poetry
in Chinese, I suppose.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.140
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: I do.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.220
I do, in fact, in recent
years, my wife was sick.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:50.610
So, for a long time, I couldn't
get into a start a novel.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.420
So, I began to write poetry.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.870
Originally, I thought I
wrote them in Chinese,

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.550
but I thought they would
be just the drafts.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.380 position:56%
So, [inaudible] good poetry English.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.880
But, once I started, I felt

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.070
in Chinese it was still my first
language, my mother tongue.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.730
So, these should be poems in
Chinese, so I began to publish

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.690
and publish a lot, in
fact, late in recent years.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.440
I published two books of
poetry in Chinese, but then,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.890
I rewrote them, some of them.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In English.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.490
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: In English.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you
do your own translations?

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.090
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Not translation.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.390
I just rewrote them.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What do you mean?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.990
Why is that different to you?

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.290
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Lot of poems,
a lot of poems,

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.980
you can't just translate them.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:40.730
For instance, I'll give
you two lines, and you go.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:45.440
In Chinese, it would be
something like [speaking Chinese].

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:51.930
This is like, "I landed in the
place my ancestors never heard of.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.150
I need to develop another
kind of fortitude."

00:36:55.150 --> 00:37:00.750
But, this, the last line is not
that good because that is flat.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The fortitude.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.350
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: But, in
Chinese, it's very neat

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.140
because there is a rhyme there.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.480
But, in English, I
rewrote the last line.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.040
I said, "I need to
grow a new backbone."

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.120
A new image.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.990
So, this is the case, I have

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:20.430
to rewrite them, not
just translate them.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's fascinating.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.850
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: So, I rewrote some
of the poems so there was a book

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.240
of poems forthcoming
from Copper Canyon Press.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.590
So, I was, it's a convoluted
process,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.740
but I'm very fortunate somehow.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.520
I manage it, to get them published.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.120
That's fascinating.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.420
Yes, sir.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.980
&gt;&gt; No, I think you kind
of answered my question.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.800
A few years ago, you translate
one of your work "A Good Fall".

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.100
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yes.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.400
&gt;&gt; Into Chinese by yourself.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.370 position:56%
I just want to ask how does it feel.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.040
I mean, after all these decades
writing English, how did it feel

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.190
for you to write in Chinese again?

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.470
You have any plans to write an
original novel in Chinese again,

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:07.140
and what makes you to
translate that book

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.110
into Chinese in the first place?

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.410
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Okay.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.870
Let me answer your
question backward.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:19.510
When I, in a, you have a collection
of short stories to be translated,

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:23.480
you should keep the stories
copyrights, the translation rights

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.980
in your own hands because
it'll be too complicated

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.030
if another person translated
your stories.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:37.640
Because every time a magazine or
anthology want to reprint a piece,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.030
you have to go to the translator.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.400
So, for practical reasons,
it's always better

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.300 position:56%
to do the short fiction by yourself.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.470
Now, also, short stories,
there were less words.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:57.230
So, that doesn't pay much,
so it's better for you to be,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:03.180
to do the work more careful, you
know, more laborious the process.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.800
But, as for the writing,
I felt, you know, really,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.920
I enjoy that, the writing process.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.010
Suddenly, I felt I was so
at home with the language.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.420
But, to be honest, I didn't
spend enough time, perhaps.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.710
Maybe I spent 5% of the labor
of the [inaudible] compared

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.320
with the English, the English text.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.770
But, I, there was [inaudible]
of loss.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.700
I do believe that if
I wrote in Chinese,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.980
I would become different
kind of a writer.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.580
Perhaps more like a poet, but
I think this one, even poetry,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:45.250
I didn't invest enough energy in my
personal existence in the language.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.460
So, I couldn't say much about that.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.730
But, at least my recent two books
of poetry in Chinese does show

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:59.150
that I really, I could have become
a meaningful writer in Chinese.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:05.380
But, again, we have to accept
what the world has made of us.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.680
[laughs]

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Fascinating concept.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.630
Yes.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:14.040
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, in my last
year of college,

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.240
I took a class called The
American Novel with Philip Fisher,

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.940
and the last book that we read in
the class, kind of the culmination

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.750
of the class was your book
"Waiting" which was striking

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.060
because it wasn't even
set in America.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.850
The other non-English speaking or.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.150
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Sure.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:36.470
&gt;&gt; Original English native
author that we read was Nabokov.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:43.430 position:56%
And, I guess, I had my own kind of
reactions and hypotheses in thinking

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.670
about why this book
fit in this class.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:50.050
I was reminded of when my
father told me many years ago

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:54.460
that he believes that China will
eventually become a democracy

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.800
and led me to wonder about how many
generations of people and authors

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.150
that have to wait until
that is ever realized.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:07.440
I wonder, maybe, if it was because
of, kind of the universality

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.740
of waiting as the kind
of a state of being.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:14.280
But, I wondered, I guess you're
the most natural person to ask

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.460
and to hypothesize about why

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.660
"Waiting" is really
an American novel.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.600
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: And, I knew,
Fisher was my teacher, too.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.720
But, at the time, he
was at Brandeis,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.700
but then he went to Harvard.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:33.640
And, I heard that the book was
taught as American, American novel.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.480
In fact, there were many courses.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.910
In fact, a colleague of
mine also have their novel

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:42.330
in his American fiction class.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.150
I think the universality
is a big part of it.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.270
Also, the language is a combination

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.140
of American idiom,
the American idiom.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.480
Also, some Chinese
accent in that novel.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.480
I think, also, the
perception of the world.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.780
That's important.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.990
Without my American existence,
the [inaudible] experience,

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.700
I couldn't have possibly
written a book like that.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.970
So, the other was the creation.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.410
It's also part of American
experience.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.160
But, also, it was published
in America.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.460
That's important.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
why it's an American book.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.060
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Yeah, and
nobody, in fact.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.450
In the beginning, people
say, "This book,

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.250
no [inaudible] publisher
will take such a book."

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.140 position:56%
They thought it was too plain, and
the language was basically the book,

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.680
the experiences are so common.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.470
But, I, in other words, entered the
sensibilities America in many ways.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:41.060
I knew what was essential to
human experience, so I didn't go

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.990
to any flashy novel experience.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.180
But, I tried to stay with facts.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.800
In other words, my American
experience sharpened my eyes

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.680
for the meaningful details.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.250
So, there are many ways
to justify the choice

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.770 position:56%
of [inaudible] as an American novel.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.640
But, also, eventually, I have
become an American author, I think.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.240
We think so.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.840
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Thank you.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, ma'am.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.570
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious about your sort
of foundational American experience

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.990
which were those first years at,

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.210
in university as a
young man at Brandeis.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:26.890
What, how did that appear to you,
and what did you take advantage

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.160
of in those first few years when
you were making your decisions

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.160
about becoming part
of our American life?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.410
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: You know, when I
came, I, as, to do graduate work,

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.690
I had a wonderful job waiting
for me in China, in a university

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.590
as a researcher or translator,

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.490
and also professor for
American Literature.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:53.820 position:56%
But, so, I didn't plan to immigrate.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.710
I work very hard, but I was
separated from my family

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:03.750
because my wife and son were
not allowed to come with me.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.050
So, it was painful.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.660
We were, in that sense.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.350
I had to work very hard to make
enough money for, so the bank.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:16.340
In order to get the Visa, you
have to have, like, $3000,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.640
you know, saving account.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:22.240
And, so I really work, but I
did all kinds of work, jobs.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.730
I think that helped me a lot.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:29.730
Custodian and nighttime
watchman and bus boy.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:31.780
I did all kinds of work.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.080
I think that's very important.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.080
I started from scratch,
making me feel that, you know,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.730
how as a person you bring
bread to table, how that,

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.300
the process, how that works.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.670
That's important for me.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:50.260
So, that is really
down to earth process.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.950
I think what is most important
moment in my, in my first year,

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:58.800
in fact, I, people knew, my
fellow graduate students all knew

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.470
that I was married, but
I had no family with me.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:11.300
So, my one Indian student,
Sangeeta, who lived a floor

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:16.310
under my apartment, below
my apartment, at a party,

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:20.650
she ask me why did you, why
didn't you bring your family

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.410
with me, with you.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:28.540
I said government doesn't allow,
and he said, "Why don't you?"

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.510
She said, "Why don't you
sue your government?"

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.390
[ Laughter ]

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:39.040
For her part, it was careless and
[inaudible] question I didn't know.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.320
I didn't know how to put my
head around the question.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.040
But, it stayed all the
time, for many, many years.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.100
Because essentially, that is,
in fact, the question pointing

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:53.380
to the heart of a democracy
which is, in theory,

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.190
in the eyes of the law, the
Constitution, the individual,

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:02.100
and the country are equal.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:07.950
For, also, in this country, we
do have that kind of legal system

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:13.230
to guarantee the individual,
civil rights, at least in theory.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.220
So, individual can sue a
government, but in China,

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.330
China's Constitution is fabulous.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.960
But, it's just piece of paper.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.410
Nobody take it seriously.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.990
You can't sue your government,
so I think that was very,

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.860
very important moment, really
shaped my understanding

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.040
and perception of American society.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.750 position:56%
Eventually, in fact, at the
beginning of this year, [inaudible],

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.750
he overturned President Trump's ban

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.740
on the seven Muslim
majority countries

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.960
from coming to the United States.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.100
Right? Just a regular
judge overturned

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.280
that because it doesn't
compart with our Constitution.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.760
So, in other words, a simple
question that really resonate stay

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.660
with me, like basically if
the manifest points to many,

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.750
many meaningful aspects for
American life and culture.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's just such
a pleasure to talk to you.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.610
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Thank you.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm so
glad you were here today.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:17.210
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Thank you.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you very much.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.810
&gt;&gt; Ha Jin: Thank you.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.110
Thank you.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.410
Thank you.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.210
Thank you so much.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:30.500
[ Applause ]
