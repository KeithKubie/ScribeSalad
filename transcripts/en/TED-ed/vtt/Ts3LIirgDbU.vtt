00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.430
Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two
years preparing his Arctic expedition.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.210
He had secured funding from the Norwegian
Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.470
He’d even received the blessing of
the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.950
along with the use of his ship, Fram, 
specially constructed to withstand the ice.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.280
Now, with the voyage departing, he had 
one final announcement to his shipmates:

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.300
They were going to head in the
opposite direction.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.840
By the early 20th century,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.270
nearly every region of the globe had
been visited and mapped,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.190
with only two key locations
remaining:

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.880
the North Pole, deep in the
frozen waters of the Arctic region,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.170
and the South Pole, nestled within a
recently discovered icy continent

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.680
in the vast Antarctic Ocean.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.050
A veteran of several expeditions, 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.630
Amundsen had long dreamed of
reaching the North Pole.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.570
But in 1909, amidst his preparations,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.240
news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.570
had staked rival claims
to the achievement.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.090
Instead of abandoning the planned voyage,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.690
Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.”

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.930
But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.190
British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.090
and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.120
Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova 
reached Melbourne in 1910,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.860
he was greeted with the news
that Amundsen was also heading south.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.910
Yet if it was a race,
it was a strange one.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.130
The expeditions left at different times
from different locations,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.750
and they had very different 
plans for the journey.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.010
Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.100
Informed by his Arctic exploration,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.310
he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.360
arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.570
His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.728
as well as specially
designed skis and boots.

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:21.348
But Scott's venture was more complicated.

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:24.898
Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition,

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.118
he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen,

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:32.619
alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies,

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.109
and three state-of-the-art
motorized sledges.

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.979
But these additional tools and bodies

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.699
weighed down the ship as it battled
the storms of the southern ocean.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.449
And as they finally began to lay supplies,

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.989
they found both their ponies and 
motor-sledges ineffective

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.809
in the harsh ice and snow.

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:55.189
In the spring of 1911, after waiting out
the long polar night,

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.569
both parties began the journey south. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.709
Scott’s team traveled 
over the Beardmore Glacier,

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.799
following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.549
But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.149
Meanwhile, despite an initial false start,

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:17.119
Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.139
through the same Transantarctic Mountains.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.939
They stayed ahead of Scott’s team,

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.669
and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.669
To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims,

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.579
Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.699
to make sure they covered
the Pole’s location.

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.609
Along with flags and a tent marker,

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.029
they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later.

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.301
But when Scott’s party
finally reached the pole,

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.161
losing the ‘race’ was
the least of their problems. 

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:53.901
On the way back towards the camp,
two of the five men succumbed to frostbite

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.101
starvation, and exhaustion.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:59.341
The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:01.111
with a team sent from their base,

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:05.471
but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications,

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:07.571
their rescue never arrived.

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:12.851
Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.612
Today, scientists from various countries

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:18.732
live and work at Antarctic 
research stations.

00:04:18.732 --> 00:04:22.092
But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten.

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:25.892
Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history,

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:29.550
and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.
