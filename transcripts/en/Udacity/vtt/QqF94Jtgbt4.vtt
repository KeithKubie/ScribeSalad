00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.100
So I'm here with Cameron Pittman, who
is a course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.000
He's going to talk to us
a little bit about metacognition.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.170
So thank you for talking to us today.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, happy to be here.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.530
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I want to ask is,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.300
the reason why I'm talking to Cameron
about metacognition is that Udacity has

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.950
started a new type of
debate class they call R&amp;R.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.010
And can you tell us a little
bit about what that is?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.040
&gt;&gt; Sure, R&amp;R is not a replacement for
the classroom.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.350
It's just another way
to engage students.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.600
Our classes are essentially a series of,
as you guys probably well know, videos,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.460
questions, problems, projects,
and some short readings.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.205
And that's actually where we're
extending the classroom here with R&amp;R.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.730
R&amp;R is actually, I think it stands for
reading and reflection.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
It's essentially a set of
topics online or blog posts or

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.090
news articles or any kind of writings
online that are relevant to the course.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.140
And what we simply do is ask
students to read them and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.770
then reflect in the forums.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.830
It's just another way of
trying to engage students and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.530
introducing them to material
that's out in the world.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.490
&gt;&gt; So it's worth noting that when they
started the R&amp;R way of doing classes

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.510
here at Udacity I didn't know about it.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.940
And they did it in parallel
to me designing this class.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.880
And so this R&amp;R approach is very
much what we do in this class where

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.540
it's all about readings and going out
and finding your own resources and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.330
reflecting on them and
sharing them with classmates.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.780
But something I'd ask for both these
students in this class as well as for

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.300
general understanding of the way this
is used, is this for everybody, or

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.950
is this a kind of approach
that's specifically for

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.090
people who don't learn
from traditional methods,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.420
that don't like to learn from lectures,
that they need an alternate way?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.780
Or is this the better way to learn for
everybody?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.800
&gt;&gt; I would never couch something
as a better way to learn for

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.940
everybody because everybody
learns differently.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.930
There are different modes of learning.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.670
Some people learn better visually,
auditorially, or in-discussionally.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.685
Okay, that's not a word.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.750
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But anyways, so this is just another

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.950
way of introducing students to material,
that they wouldn't normally see.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.890
And I think this is a great method,
because as a developer, which is what

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.480
we're training people to become, you
have to be up to date with current news.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.335
You have to be up to date with the
current thoughts on whatever technology

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:00.610
it is you're working with.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.880
And R&amp;R is just a great
way to reflect that.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.920
So, its not replacing anything and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.055
I don't think its necessarily
a better way to learn.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:11.330
It's just another way of introducing
students to the world around them.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.550
I like it a lot because it doesn't
just teach you the content

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.350
that you're learning about.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.650
It doesn't teach you how to design
a form or how to write a line of code.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.203
But it also teaches you that in the
future when you encounter a problem that

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.400
you don't know how to solve,
how would you go out and solve it?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800
And that's almost more important.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.320
It's one thing to teach
someone something but

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.220
it's something else to teach them
how to solve their future problems.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
&gt;&gt; And not to mention it also introduces
students to developer communities.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.480
You start meeting other people or seeing
other people who are interested in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.310
the same technologies and it gives
students a chance to get involved.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.540
So since this is an Ed Tech class
though, one question I would have is,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.630
is technology, aside from us being in
computer science, so let's imagine for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.480
a second we're doing R&amp;R
in an English class or

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.380
something like that, how does
technology actually help with this?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.440
Is it a core part of the R&amp;R process, or
is it just that, because we're teaching

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.030
computer science here at Udacity we
tend to use technology along with this.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.352
&gt;&gt; Well, I think technology in this case
is just a better way to do paperwork.

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:02.864
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:03.437
&gt;&gt; You know,

00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:05.860
you could easily do this in the class.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.440
Millions of teachers probably have.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.620
You assign a reading to your students,
you get them to read.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.100
And that's essentially
all we're doing here.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.990
And technology just makes it easier.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.340
It's not necessarily better or worse,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.030
it's just easier and
more accessible to students.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.124
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like it introduces
a more rapid feedback cycle because

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:23.858
instead of having to go to the library,
find an encyclopedia,

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:26.384
read about it, go home and
realize I read the wrong thing,

00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:28.880
I can go through that cycle in
a minute instead of in a day.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.805
So it really let's them go
through that more often.

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:33.910
So if we have any students in the class
who want to apply an approach like this,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.760
an R&amp;R style approach, or an approach
that really fosters metacognition in

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.630
their project that they develop for this
class, do you have any suggestions for

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.630
what they should think about
while they're doing it?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.590
So one of the nice things about R&amp;R is
it let's students go at their own pace,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.000
and gives them control over
what they're learning, and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.280
then what they do with
what they're learning.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.280
Because they're simply reflecting on it,
and maybe they hate the article,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.700
maybe they love the article, maybe they
want to share it, maybe they don't.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.426
But either way they have
the power to do all these things.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.150
And that actually is a huge part of
learning is having the power to control

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.350
what you're learning and
how you're learning and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.090
what you're going to do
with what you've learned.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.840
And so any kind of tool that gives
students that kind of power is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.230
obviously a good way to go.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.320
&gt;&gt; Great.
Well, thank you so much for

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.870
talking to us.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Happy to be here.
