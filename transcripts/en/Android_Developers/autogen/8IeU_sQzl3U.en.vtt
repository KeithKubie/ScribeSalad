same application for multiple clients
 

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.780
same application for multiple clients
and you don't want all the resources in

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:21.790
and you don't want all the resources in
 

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.939
and you don't want all the resources in
both in which case the library project

00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:23.949
both in which case the library project
 

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:29.250
both in which case the library project
would be a great way to go

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:29.260
 

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.530
downloadable skins like beautiful

downloadable skins like beautiful
 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.960
downloadable skins like beautiful
widgets or something like that yeah what

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:33.970
widgets or something like that yeah what
 

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.050
widgets or something like that yeah what
about just like do you know how they

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.060
about just like do you know how they
 

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.560
about just like do you know how they
organize their there are themes there

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:40.570
organize their there are themes there
 

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.579

are they plugin for widgets light

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:44.589
are they plugin for widgets light
 

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:46.949

download into the SD card and then they

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959
download into the SD card and then they
 

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:50.069
download into the SD card and then they
load the images via Fred and then just

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079
load the images via Fred and then just
 

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:52.980
load the images via Fred and then just
sit the drawables on each view and to

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:52.990
sit the drawables on each view and to
 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.139
sit the drawables on each view and to
sort of manually write so they're not

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:55.149
sort of manually write so they're not
 

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:56.430
sort of manually write so they're not
using the resource framework they're

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440
using the resource framework they're
 

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.129
using the resource framework they're
just using drawables there are apps so

00:09:59.129 --> 00:09:59.139
just using drawables there are apps so
 

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:00.780
just using drawables there are apps so
all the apps where the themes are

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:00.790
all the apps where the themes are
 

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.490
all the apps where the themes are
downloaded via google play they're done

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:02.500
downloaded via google play they're done
 

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.410
downloaded via google play they're done
by resources so I think you can access

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:04.420
by resources so I think you can access
 

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.360
by resources so I think you can access
external resources there package manager

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.370
external resources there package manager
 

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.629
external resources there package manager
if I remember rightly mmm but I've never

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:09.639
if I remember rightly mmm but I've never
 

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:14.819
if I remember rightly mmm but I've never
done it self coming next week yeah I

00:10:14.819 --> 00:10:14.829
done it self coming next week yeah I
 

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.100
done it self coming next week yeah I
know I've seen apps on other platforms

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.110
know I've seen apps on other platforms
 

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.480
know I've seen apps on other platforms
where it was you know you could have

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.490
where it was you know you could have
 

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.400
where it was you know you could have
these these skins and it was very

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.410
these these skins and it was very
 

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.900
these these skins and it was very
important that your resources be

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:21.910
important that your resources be
 

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.389
important that your resources be
numbered with exactly the same

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399
numbered with exactly the same
 

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.280
numbered with exactly the same
identifiers as in the base project so

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.290
identifiers as in the base project so
 

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.319
identifiers as in the base project so
funny one example where developers and

00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:28.329
funny one example where developers and
 

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:31.350
funny one example where developers and
designers collide for the latest updates

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360
designers collide for the latest updates
 

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.759
designers collide for the latest updates
the ultimate stopwatch Marie wanted to

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:32.769
the ultimate stopwatch Marie wanted to
 

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:34.050
the ultimate stopwatch Marie wanted to
change the theme as he went through to

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.060
change the theme as he went through to
 

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.540
change the theme as he went through to
the countdown but of course that would

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:36.550
the countdown but of course that would
 

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.220
the countdown but of course that would
require it was it was in a few pages so

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.230
require it was it was in a few pages so
 

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.389
require it was it was in a few pages so
you could swipe across the countdown but

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399
you could swipe across the countdown but
 

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.340
you could swipe across the countdown but
required restarting the activity to

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:41.350
required restarting the activity to
 

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.050
required restarting the activity to
change the theme which I didn't find a

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.060
change the theme which I didn't find a
 

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.750
change the theme which I didn't find a
solution around unfortunately yeah but

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760
solution around unfortunately yeah but
 

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.250
solution around unfortunately yeah but
the action bar I have tabs in it and

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.260
the action bar I have tabs in it and
 

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.400
the action bar I have tabs in it and
drop down overflow and button

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:52.410
drop down overflow and button
 

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.530
drop down overflow and button
I didn't really know that so we didn't

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540
I didn't really know that so we didn't
 

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.360
I didn't really know that so we didn't
happen the only kind of thing that I've

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:56.370
happen the only kind of thing that I've
 

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.860
happen the only kind of thing that I've
done remove you like this is the

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:57.870
done remove you like this is the
 

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.660
done remove you like this is the
scenario you have multiple clients one

00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.670
scenario you have multiple clients one
 

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.889
scenario you have multiple clients one
thing you pretty much the same out of

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899
thing you pretty much the same out of
 

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:02.900
thing you pretty much the same out of
the different themes and yeah the

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:02.910
the different themes and yeah the
 

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.009
the different themes and yeah the
library route is probably the best way

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019
library route is probably the best way
 

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:05.509
library route is probably the best way
to go because you have to remember when

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519
to go because you have to remember when
 

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.769
to go because you have to remember when
you're publishing to play store you need

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779
you're publishing to play store you need
 

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.030
you're publishing to play store you need
a different package name to everyone

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040
a different package name to everyone
 

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040
a different package name to everyone
else so then yeah see you basically

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.050
else so then yeah see you basically
 

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.449
else so then yeah see you basically
understand doing that and they might

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459
understand doing that and they might
 

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:15.670
understand doing that and they might
sell resources so yeah any sort of

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680
sell resources so yeah any sort of
 

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.800
sell resources so yeah any sort of
comment I have nice okay hopefully

presume the apps have their own data

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:53.370
presume the apps have their own data
 

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.269
presume the apps have their own data
areas for her user with things like

contacts and yeah the only thing that
 

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:14.900
contacts and yeah the only thing that
shared are the application binaries

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:14.910
shared are the application binaries
 

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.490
shared are the application binaries
themselves so if if you download an app

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500
themselves so if if you download an app
 

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.470
themselves so if if you download an app
and the one user the other user about to

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480
and the one user the other user about to
 

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.420
and the one user the other user about to
see that same up downloaded into their

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:23.430
see that same up downloaded into their
 

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.150
see that same up downloaded into their
no no okay if they go to Google Play and

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160
no no okay if they go to Google Play and
 

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.379
no no okay if they go to Google Play and
then try and install that the same app

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:27.389
then try and install that the same app
 

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:29.300
then try and install that the same app
they will install instantly it won't do

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.310
they will install instantly it won't do
 

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.420
they will install instantly it won't do
the download again okay so you just

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:31.430
the download again okay so you just
 

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.059
the download again okay so you just
copies itself in the like they don't

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:35.069
copies itself in the like they don't
 

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:36.110
copies itself in the like they don't
actually know if it's copying itself

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120
actually know if it's copying itself

about apps that download substantial
amounts of supplemental data you know

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:49.649
amounts of supplemental data you know
 

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:51.679

say like your game apps that have 400
 

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:53.480
say like your game apps that have 400
bytes of resources that's going to

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.490
bytes of resources that's going to
 

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.100
bytes of resources that's going to
depend on that app itself and how

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.110
depend on that app itself and how
 

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.299
depend on that app itself and how
they've implemented that so if they yeah

00:12:58.299 --> 00:12:58.309
they've implemented that so if they yeah
 

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.079
they've implemented that so if they yeah

I haven't tried it that's not quite sure

00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:02.819
I haven't tried it that's not quite sure
 

00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:05.019
I haven't tried it that's not quite sure
my guess is that it would have to

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:05.029
my guess is that it would have to
 

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:07.189
my guess is that it would have to
probably download that set of resources

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199
probably download that set of resources
 

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:08.920
probably download that set of resources
again I don't actually know

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:08.930
again I don't actually know
 

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.759
again I don't actually know
well trying to get some recommendations

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:10.769
well trying to get some recommendations
 

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:15.980
well trying to get some recommendations
for you what did you find about that

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:15.990
for you what did you find about that
 

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:24.139
for you what did you find about that
issue sorry regarding the storage if we

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:24.149
issue sorry regarding the storage if we
 

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:26.139
issue sorry regarding the storage if we
were using an external storage is

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:26.149
were using an external storage is
 

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:31.879
were using an external storage is
caching for images or so on yeah each

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:31.889
caching for images or so on yeah each
 

00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:35.720
caching for images or so on yeah each
user will we won't see the folder we

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:35.730
user will we won't see the folder we
 

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:43.059
user will we won't see the folder we
created for the different users because

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:43.069
created for the different users because
 

00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:46.340
created for the different users because
basically today we're creating a folder

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.350
basically today we're creating a folder
 

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.199
basically today we're creating a folder
on the SD card get external storage and

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:50.209
on the SD card get external storage and
 

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:54.410
on the SD card get external storage and
then create an a folder for you know

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420
then create an a folder for you know
 

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.470
then create an a folder for you know
lazy loading the images and so on yes so

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480
lazy loading the images and so on yes so
 

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.480
lazy loading the images and so on yes so
an example is the gallery and the

00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.490
an example is the gallery and the
 

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.239
an example is the gallery and the
cameras so if I go into one para file

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:02.249
cameras so if I go into one para file
 

00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:02.929
cameras so if I go into one para file
and take a picture

00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:02.939
and take a picture
 

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:05.720
and take a picture
it goes into slash SD card dicen

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:05.730
it goes into slash SD card dicen
 

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.549
it goes into slash SD card dicen
whatever it is puts it in there if I

00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:07.559
whatever it is puts it in there if I
 

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.009
whatever it is puts it in there if I
switch users then I get a completely

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019
switch users then I get a completely
 

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:11.360
switch users then I get a completely
different view of that folder and I can

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:11.370
different view of that folder and I can
 

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.429
different view of that folder and I can
take I don't see the the photos that the

00:14:13.429 --> 00:14:13.439
take I don't see the the photos that the
 

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:21.590
take I don't see the the photos that the
original user took is it mountain volume

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600
original user took is it mountain volume
 

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.980
original user took is it mountain volume
well this is all of our devices don't

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:24.990
well this is all of our devices don't
 

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.379
well this is all of our devices don't
have the external SD card of course so

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:27.389
have the external SD card of course so
 

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:29.389
have the external SD card of course so
that could be a different matter of

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399
that could be a different matter of
 

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.590
that could be a different matter of
people releasing this with that I don't

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600
people releasing this with that I don't
 

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.549
people releasing this with that I don't
have work at month does anyone know what

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:34.559
have work at month does anyone know what
 

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:38.480
have work at month does anyone know what
the security what security implications

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.490
the security what security implications
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.040
the security what security implications
is may have although they're in

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.050
is may have although they're in
 

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.809
is may have although they're in
different areas is it completely secure

00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:41.819
different areas is it completely secure
 

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:47.139
different areas is it completely secure
in terms of from one but user to another

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:47.149
 

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.429
passed our knowledge of it at the moment

00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:49.439
passed our knowledge of it at the moment
 

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:50.840
passed our knowledge of it at the moment
cuz we haven't tested out on any devices

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:50.850
cuz we haven't tested out on any devices
 

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.460
cuz we haven't tested out on any devices
that do have SD cards my guess is if

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:52.470
that do have SD cards my guess is if
 

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.749
that do have SD cards my guess is if
you've actually got an external sd card

00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759
you've actually got an external sd card
 

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.249
you've actually got an external sd card
and you're using this and you can still

00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:55.259
and you're using this and you can still
 

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:59.230
and you're using this and you can still
take it out and read the space on it

00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240
take it out and read the space on it
 

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.100
take it out and read the space on it
that you'd be able to see each other's

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.110
that you'd be able to see each other's
 

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.079
that you'd be able to see each other's
data on the SD card but I don't actually

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:03.089
data on the SD card but I don't actually
 

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:05.600
data on the SD card but I don't actually
know there are no devices that support

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:05.610
know there are no devices that support
 

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.909
know there are no devices that support
that at the moment okay so try it out

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:10.919
 

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:12.780
and what do you mean by completely

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:12.790
and what do you mean by completely
 

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.659
and what do you mean by completely
secure I mean what is that what I mean

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:15.669
secure I mean what is that what I mean
 

00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:18.599
secure I mean what is that what I mean
is from I don't mean bout external SD

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:18.609
is from I don't mean bout external SD
 

00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:20.460

other way outside of the app I believe
 

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:30.269
other way outside of the app I believe
the intention is for the users to be

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279
the intention is for the users to be
 

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.619
the intention is for the users to be
completely firewalled from each other

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:31.629

you're seeing when you upload it to the
 

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080
you're seeing when you upload it to the
Play Store then that sounds like a bug

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.090
Play Store then that sounds like a bug
 

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.060
Play Store then that sounds like a bug
so you let us know if that doesn't match

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.070
so you let us know if that doesn't match
 

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.240
so you let us know if that doesn't match
up that's it okay I'll try it using that

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.250
up that's it okay I'll try it using that
 

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.460
up that's it okay I'll try it using that
so actually this a bit if I understand

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:57.470
so actually this a bit if I understand
 

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.669
so actually this a bit if I understand
correctly the situation is that that's

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679
correctly the situation is that that's
 

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:03.370
correctly the situation is that that's
somewhat some of the libraries that I

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.380
somewhat some of the libraries that I
 

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.560
somewhat some of the libraries that I
may be using may be a question for my

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.570
may be using may be a question for my
 

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.789

permission is that correct
it could well be yeah well we don't have

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:09.529
it could well be yeah well we don't have
 

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:11.169
it could well be yeah well we don't have
to be in your manifest right I think the

00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:11.179
to be in your manifest right I think the
 

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:13.389

was simple enough why do the tabs need
to be in the fragment not question that

00:40:16.089 --> 00:40:16.099
to be in the fragment not question that
 

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:19.870
to be in the fragment not question that
yeah why can't I just be any activity

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880
yeah why can't I just be any activity
 

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.880
yeah why can't I just be any activity
because then it would cover the entire

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:21.890
because then it would cover the entire
 

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.789
because then it would cover the entire
set of the fragment yeah you want to see

00:40:25.789 --> 00:40:25.799
set of the fragment yeah you want to see
 

00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:28.279
set of the fragment yeah you want to see
them only on the right pane and not all

00:40:28.279 --> 00:40:28.289
them only on the right pane and not all
 

00:40:28.289 --> 00:40:30.079
them only on the right pane and not all
over the sky be you need that winglets

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:30.089
over the sky be you need that winglets
 

00:40:30.089 --> 00:40:32.420
over the sky be you need that winglets
anyway like I don't think it's any

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:32.430
anyway like I don't think it's any
 

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.309
anyway like I don't think it's any
reason it has to be a fragment yeah you

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319
reason it has to be a fragment yeah you
 

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:37.430
reason it has to be a fragment yeah you
could fight the tabs by noting a copy

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440
could fight the tabs by noting a copy
 

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.249
could fight the tabs by noting a copy
the action bar show cool maybe a

00:40:40.249 --> 00:40:40.259
the action bar show cool maybe a
 

00:40:40.259 --> 00:40:46.269
the action bar show cool maybe a
fragment yeah and then it's just a view

00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:46.279
fragment yeah and then it's just a view
 

00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:49.099
fragment yeah and then it's just a view
holding the linear layout top would be

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:49.109
holding the linear layout top would be
 

00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:51.650
holding the linear layout top would be
your tabs under that with a layout way

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660
your tabs under that with a layout way
 

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.539
your tabs under that with a layout way
of one would be if refraining on your

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:53.549
of one would be if refraining on your
 

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:55.700
of one would be if refraining on your
side which is linear layer from this

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:55.710
side which is linear layer from this
 

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.640
side which is linear layer from this
yeah then taps in the Libyan lamp we

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.650
yeah then taps in the Libyan lamp we
 

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:03.910
yeah then taps in the Libyan lamp we
would be home so my mic is working again

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920
would be home so my mic is working again
 

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.220
would be home so my mic is working again
yay so what I meant was is that on the

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:10.230
yay so what I meant was is that on the
 

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.029
yay so what I meant was is that on the
left side I have this menu which

00:41:13.029 --> 00:41:13.039
left side I have this menu which
 

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:18.319
left side I have this menu which
displays a couple of data types on the

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:18.329
displays a couple of data types on the
 

00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:20.539
displays a couple of data types on the
right side you have a couple of list

00:41:20.539 --> 00:41:20.549
right side you have a couple of list
 

00:41:20.549 --> 00:41:22.759
right side you have a couple of list
views in this particular case I have

00:41:22.759 --> 00:41:22.769
views in this particular case I have
 

00:41:22.769 --> 00:41:26.690
views in this particular case I have
three list use and because I need to

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700
three list use and because I need to
 

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.890
three list use and because I need to
target both there you are because I need

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900
target both there you are because I need
 

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.920
target both there you are because I need
to target both mobile phones and tablets

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:33.930
to target both mobile phones and tablets
 

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.630
to target both mobile phones and tablets
I wasn't natural enough to put those it

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640
I wasn't natural enough to put those it
 

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.220
I wasn't natural enough to put those it
feels just on top of each other so I was

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.230
feels just on top of each other so I was
 

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.670
feels just on top of each other so I was
looking for a tab solution with the tab

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680
looking for a tab solution with the tab
 

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:53.450
looking for a tab solution with the tab
to tell our top but it's somehow the tab

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460
to tell our top but it's somehow the tab
 

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.490

it won't kill do tabs in the in the
 

00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:20.569
it won't kill do tabs in the in the
action bar and tablets rather than in

an Android question I'm building an app

00:43:30.089 --> 00:43:30.099
an Android question I'm building an app
 

00:43:30.099 --> 00:43:32.880
an Android question I'm building an app
and I'm trying to use a service to

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:32.890
and I'm trying to use a service to
 

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.640
and I'm trying to use a service to
collect JSON data from a web service

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:35.650
collect JSON data from a web service
 

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.189
collect JSON data from a web service
Monge that data stick it into a database

00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:38.199
Monge that data stick it into a database
 

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:41.160
Monge that data stick it into a database
and then make that data available via a

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.170
and then make that data available via a
 

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.339
and then make that data available via a
content provider to my main activities

00:43:44.339 --> 00:43:44.349
content provider to my main activities
 

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:48.329
content provider to my main activities
what I've noticed is I'm able to fetch

00:43:48.329 --> 00:43:48.339
what I've noticed is I'm able to fetch
 

00:43:48.339 --> 00:43:50.099
what I've noticed is I'm able to fetch
the data without issue I'm able to parse

00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:50.109
the data without issue I'm able to parse
 

00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:52.939
the data without issue I'm able to parse
it standard JSON dump it in the database

00:43:52.939 --> 00:43:52.949
it standard JSON dump it in the database
 

00:43:52.949 --> 00:43:56.279
it standard JSON dump it in the database
the moment I try and access the data

00:43:56.279 --> 00:43:56.289
the moment I try and access the data
 

00:43:56.289 --> 00:43:59.069
the moment I try and access the data
from the content provider later and I'm

00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079
from the content provider later and I'm
 

00:43:59.079 --> 00:44:00.299
from the content provider later and I'm
using the content provider from the

00:44:00.299 --> 00:44:00.309
using the content provider from the
 

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:03.209
using the content provider from the
service as well to inject the data when

00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:03.219
service as well to inject the data when
 

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:04.650
service as well to inject the data when
I try and use the content provider from

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:04.660
I try and use the content provider from
 

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.049
I try and use the content provider from
the activity I get nothing back from my

00:44:07.049 --> 00:44:07.059
the activity I get nothing back from my
 

00:44:07.059 --> 00:44:16.709
the activity I get nothing back from my
cursors if they're always empty I

00:44:16.709 --> 00:44:16.719
cursors if they're always empty I
 

00:44:16.719 --> 00:44:18.419
cursors if they're always empty I
thought that at first but these are very

00:44:18.419 --> 00:44:18.429
thought that at first but these are very
 

00:44:18.429 --> 00:44:20.579
thought that at first but these are very
very simple like I'm basically doing it

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:20.589
very simple like I'm basically doing it
 

00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:23.309
very simple like I'm basically doing it
on one key it's like I have a YouTube ID

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319
on one key it's like I have a YouTube ID
 

00:44:23.319 --> 00:44:25.769
on one key it's like I have a YouTube ID
and it's just like give me the first

00:44:25.769 --> 00:44:25.779
and it's just like give me the first
 

00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:29.999
and it's just like give me the first
result that matches this ID maybe or

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:30.009
result that matches this ID maybe or
 

00:44:30.009 --> 00:44:33.630
result that matches this ID maybe or

and you're on loadcomplete or something
 

00:44:35.259 --> 00:44:38.579
and you're on loadcomplete or something
simple like that swap cursor I don't

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:38.589
simple like that swap cursor I don't
 

00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:40.769
simple like that swap cursor I don't
know about that one would explain a

00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:40.779
know about that one would explain a
 

00:44:40.779 --> 00:44:47.779
know about that one would explain a
little bit more sorry i easy loaders I

00:44:47.779 --> 00:44:47.789
little bit more sorry i easy loaders I
 

00:44:47.789 --> 00:44:52.650
little bit more sorry i easy loaders I
don't think so so you're just doing a

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:52.660
don't think so so you're just doing a
 

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.279
don't think so so you're just doing a
Content resolver doc query yeah if you

00:44:56.279 --> 00:44:56.289
Content resolver doc query yeah if you
 

00:44:56.289 --> 00:44:57.989
Content resolver doc query yeah if you
check that the dice is actually hitting

00:44:57.989 --> 00:44:57.999
check that the dice is actually hitting
 

00:44:57.999 --> 00:45:01.739
check that the dice is actually hitting
the database yeah yeah the data is in

00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:01.749
the database yeah yeah the data is in
 

00:45:01.749 --> 00:45:04.079
