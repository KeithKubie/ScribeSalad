00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, before we jump in to actually solving some problems,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we're going to do the experiment ourselves.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to calculate as a class the circumference of the earth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, we're going to do this by having every single student and myself take some data.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then, we're going to aggregate that data in the next unit and come to some consensus

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about what the circumference of the earth is.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There will be errors and we'll talk about that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This will be a big data set so we'll have to learn some skills about how to handle that,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but we'll figure that all out in the next unit, but for now we just need to collect the data.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In order to this, what you're going to need is a string or a stick.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For example, in the beginning I used earlier, I used a string with a weight attached to it,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because the string need to be completely straight.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can also use the edge of a building as long as you know it's vertical,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and you can measure its height, or anything else that's straight and vertical.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You're going to need a measuring device, maybe a meter stick or tape measure or something like that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Again, the units aren't going to matter because they cancel out when we compute ratios.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Next, you're going to need a sunny day, and I understand this could be tricky,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
especially if you live in a region where it's not so sunny out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Once you have a sunny day, you're going need to do is experiment as close to solar noon

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on a flat surface as you possibly can.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now, what's solar noon? Solar noon is when the sun is highest in the sky and it's not necessarily--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in fact, it generally doesn't occur at 12 o'clock.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There's a link below this video where you can figure out what solar noon is in your location,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, but I think this experiment can be done

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
quite quickly, and I think it will be interesting to see the data that the class collects.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I hope you participate in this. Of course, you don't have to participate but it'd be great if you did.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, once you have everything you need, it's solar noon in your location, you have a sunny day,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and a flat surface, you have your measuring device, your stick or a string,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the procedure is basically what you saw in the previous video.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Make sure the string/stick is vertical. Measure the length of whatever object you're using.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In the case of the experiment I did that was the string with the mass on it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Next, we're going to measure the length of the shadow and be sure to record both of these.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then you're going to enter the data here. Now, entering data, well, what data do we need to enter?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We're going to be doing this experiment a little different than Eratosthenes,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because I don't want you to have to use a camel to measure distances between nearby cities.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Instead, what we're going to do is you're going to enter your object length

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and just enter a number, you don't need to enter any units because, like we said, they don't matter.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Shadow length, enter that. Enter your true latitude.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is the actual latitude of where you do the experiment and you can find this in the link below.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Next, your going to have to enter the month and the day. Now, why do we need to do that?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Think about that for a second.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well ideally, you're doing this experiment on the summer solstice, which occurs around

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
June 21st or 22nd--that's the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Unfortunately, by the time this class comes out, it's going to be

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
too late to actually get the summer solstice.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But, it's still right in the middle of summer for the northern hemisphere and it's pretty close

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to the solstice--so let's set to introduce a small correction to the data,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and that's something we'll talk about in the next unit.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But to introduce that correction, we are going to need to know both the month in which you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
collect the data so that would be June or July and you can enter June as the number 6,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and July as the number 7--so month will either be 6 or 7.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And then, you can enter the day--so if you do this on July 1st, you'll enter 7 in the month field

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and 1 in the day field--go ahead, get your data.

00:03:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I am very excited to see what we come up as a class.
