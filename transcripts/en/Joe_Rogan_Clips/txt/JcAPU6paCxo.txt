Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, what race races that Lee's gonna run and don't run those races. Yeah. Run a different run a different race. That's always been money you feel about trans athletes, you know? Uh, it's a good, it's a good question. I think it's, we're really going to go through like a cultural change on how we

Speaker 2:          00:17          think about that, you know, and it's, it's morphing so quickly, you know what I mean? Um, uh, I'm very much because I am of this opinion that there is no such thing as like perfect fairness. And when we make those distinctions, we're always choosing who to allow and because I think we should choose to allow like trans people to participate in society. I'm for and inclusive approach where, you know, we're able to like find a, find like a model that allows those folks to compete fairly in a way that everybody's happy with. I think that's the, I think that's what we should do, you know? Um, and that to me is like, that's what makes me like sports more, you know? Um, is those comparisons like um, you know, another thing that pissed me off so much was like, ah, fuck, what's his name? The um, the disabled runner who then killed his girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Oh yeah. The [inaudible] and people were saying about this guy that his, that is a, a prosthetic gave him an advantage. Now, first of all, there's no fucking way that's true because he doesn't have muscles, muscles. Conversely, food into does give you an advantage. I mean to do things. So I think mechanically it does cause their springs. They essentially, the way his leg works with those things is you put, you've seen them, right? They don't even look remotely like feet. I've seen any other cheesy things. Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy like, but dude, the SI's hooked but, but hold on site, that's not an advantage because how mechanics work, right? Is that a spring you put energy in

Speaker 2:          01:44          and you get a little bit less energy out. Right. So cause that's the laws of thermodynamics, right? You can't get more out than you put in, except a muscle does give you more than you put in because a muscle converts food into energy for a brief period. Right. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:56          and so he does, he has sprint, he doesn't have springs. Sorry. He has springs. He doesn't have a machine in his leg. The way the rest of us do that creates force out of food. The question is whether or not the lower half of his legs, which is what he's missing, could make up for the, the advantage, the mechanical advantage of the shape of those things, which applies all sorts of really unusual leverage when you're right, it's totally or not, I mean I don't, I don't know if it's, I mean I don't know if you took him with full legs and took him with those things if they'd run the same amount of time. But the thing that we can run fast as fuck with those things. You've seen those guys, well he could write, but where's all the other double amputees who are like, you know, common of track and field. How many of them are trying to, I mean, the Para Olympics is huge. There's like a ton of Paralympic athletes, you know, like I've been told that it has an mechanical advantage by someone who actually should know what they're talking about. But I want to, I would like to look it up to those, um, legs. [inaudible] I remember reading stuff

Speaker 2:          02:56          the time from, you know, uh, know exercise,

Speaker 1:          03:00          whatever, uh, athletic scientists forget what it's called. Um, who said that? Who said that it didn't, right? Yeah, but so that's a debate that we could have. Right. But the point that I was trying to make was looking at that Olympics. God, that's a better event with that guy in it. You know, I'm so happy he was in it. Right? Like if it does give you an advantage comes in second place, you know? Well, so, so the point is when we make the rules of a game, right, and this is the point of our episode about Games, which is about the Olympics. Actually when we make the rules of the game we are, there's no such thing as a perfectly fair competition that would be designed by God to be perfect and be perfectly fair. Right, right. We're always making choices about what kind of competition we want to have and who we want to allow into it and what sort of outcome we want to have.

Speaker 1:          03:45          You know what I mean? Just like in baseball, too many home runs moved them round up or down. You know how they changed the rules a little bit because they want more homeruns same thing with same thing with track and field. We changed the rules a little bit to allow this person and not allow this person. Right. I think that when we're talking about people, we should always try to include more people, not less. We should, you know, like if and if hey, if you're a double amputee and you can get your way into the Olympics and you can make a plausible case, I think we should try to entertain that notion and we should try to find a way to get that guy in there. Right. As far as trans athletes go, you know, we could have, we could sit here and talk for three hours about like all the different ways that hormones might affect your body.

Speaker 1:          04:19          It might not affect your body. And I'm not an expert on that, and I don't want to claim to be right. But a sports with a trans athletes who are, uh, you know, competing with the, you know, with their gender, right? That's, uh, that is a sporting world that I'm Morgan trusted in. Right? And I think we should find a way to make that happen. I know it's gonna be really complicated, complicated and messy, right? Um, and, uh, there's gonna be a lot of debate about it and it's gonna make it's going to be uncomfortable. You know, there's gonna be a lot of arguments, but, you know, I hope that that's the world that we've moved forward to. That's my, that's my point of view. My point of view is that there's a reason there's a distinction. Uh, there's a reason why we make the distinction to have male athletics versus female athletics.

Speaker 1:          05:01          The reason is that males have a physiological, physiological advantage over women. So in most sports, most physical sports, we do not have males compete with females. The question becomes when someone who was male transitions and becomes female, do those same physiological advantages apply? And what, what are the, what is the evidence? Well, the evidence and competition seems to be that it shows that it does apply, particularly in weightlifting, rugby, mountain biking, power, heavy sports that are, that favor larger people, stronger bodies, males that transitioned to females have a significant advantage and they're breaking world records. So if you're a woman and you're a natural woman and you don't take any extra hormones or male hormones, you not taking steroids or any sort of performance enhancing drugs, you're doing your very best to compete and you're at the top of the heap. But then someone comes along that was a man for 30

Speaker 3:          05:58          years and decides that they're going to be a woman and this has happened and literally transition a few months ago and compete as a woman and destroys records and dominates you in that sport. That's bullshit. And that's not competing on a level playing field. That's a person who is biologically a male and who was a male for 30 plus years of having testosterone run through their body and effect their tendon strength and affect the shape of their bones and the mechanical advantages of the male hips versus the female hips. And then they're competing with smaller people who have been a woman their whole life. It's not fair. It's, it's is as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn't or taking performance enhancing drugs when the other person doesn't. Maybe even more so maybe in more so because you also have, there's a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction time that males enjoy. It's like it's some significant difference in reaction time between males and even untrained males versus female professional athletes. Well,

Speaker 2:          06:58          uh, I disagree and I have, what do you disagree about? I've, I've already, well the, my main point being the one that I already made, right? That like, I don't think that there is such a thing as a perfectly level playing field. I think we decide what kind of playing field we want to have. Sure.

Speaker 3:          07:14          The distinction where we don't allow men to come

Speaker 2:          07:17          and women's divisions. And I think that that distinction may be breaking down a bit. Right? And I think it may be time to break down that distinction.

Speaker 3:          07:24          The male should be able to compete in the women's division of weightlift.

Speaker 2:          07:27          Uh, no, I don't necessarily. Um, but can, if they transition, uh, well first of all, uh, uh, the, there's, there's a lot of stuff to break down, right? And I'm not an expert on the subject, right? So it's just sort of my, off the top of my head. Um, one thing is, you know, you're postulating a particular person who decided to transition, uh, at the age of 30. Right? And they were very big and strong before, right? And they decide to transition. Now that is a type of person that exists. Right? Um, I think over the next certainly 30 years, we're going to see, you know, now that people are starting to understand that being trans is just a way that people are, right. They're just people who are trans. You know, and this is something that we're going to accept and support, right? You're seeing folks tra transition much, much earlier age, you know, um, uh, and, and so if someone is, if someone is transitioning from the age of like, you know, seven years old, right?

Speaker 2:          08:22          Um, and, uh, you know, working with those hormones, you know, from that age, right, they're not going to have their bodies situations can be very different than the one that you, that you postulated. Right. Uh, I also know from my trans friends that the, uh, the effects that the hormones have on your body are like really profound. You know, like really, really profound. Like we're not like, um, uh, to a surprising degree. Right. Uh, and so, uh, you know, I have, look, if the question is how does, you know, how does a person who taking hormones at a, at a particular age, right, how does their body change and how's that affect visa vi athletic performance? I don't know. We're in such new territory here, right?

Speaker 3:          09:03          Well, we certainly are, and we particularly would just scratched upon the idea of kids transitioning in a very early age. I mean, there's been more scientific evidence that points that if kids don't do that, then when they wanted to be trans at an early age, they just become gay men. And that there's nothing wrong with that either. Um, there's no reason to give kids hormones and there's no reason to decide before a person's frontal lobe is completely full, completely fully developed, which doesn't even take place till like 25 people don't know who they are. You, yes, a seven year old you, you won't even, people don't even give their seven year old phones. You don't let them vote. You're going to let them decide what sex they're going to be for the rest of their lives.

Speaker 2:          09:40          The research that I've seen, and again, I'm not an expert on this and, and you know, I'd love to, this is a conversation. This is something I, I'd love to talk about on our show and I'd specifically love, you know, this is before does the kind of topic where I really want to make sure that I know the research and that, um, you know, also speaking to Trans folks, you know, um, in, in this conversation. But so to touch on just what I've, you know, my own experience and what I've, the research I've seen, the research I've seen is that trans kids from a young age, uh, they are incredibly consistent in their w, you know, when they're expressing their gender identity, um, and, and that and that

Speaker 3:          10:17          human beings. Yeah, yeah. But the, that's, that's fit. I'm just narrative by saying they're incredibly consistent. Billy, if you polled these people, like what are you talking about? Like a, you,

Speaker 2:          10:26          I mean that's, I, I look, I don't have the research in front of me that I saw, so I can't like go into the details on it. But like, yeah, it was, I mean, it was, you know, it was a research that was surveying and tracking like trans kids who declared their identity from a young age. Did it change? The answer was, uh, generally no, it really didn't. Um, and, uh, you know, I have a friend who has a, who has a trans kid, um, don't know the kids exact age, but you know, we're in the age range that we're talking about and you know, he's explained that like, well, you know, my child from a very young age consistently like said, I am a girl, like, and has never contradict themselves, never changed their mind. And so the humane thing and the thing that he felt was going to do as a parent was to like, embrace that choice on his child's part. Right. Um, and yeah, that's,

Speaker 3:          11:12          we embrace that choice meaning hormone really.

Speaker 2:          11:16          I shouldn't even phrase it as a choice, like, like embrace that identity. Um,

Speaker 3:          11:20          but it is a choice, right? I mean, if I choosing to add hormones to a child's body, that's a choice.

Speaker 2:          11:25          Uh, it's a multiple, the choice. It's, it's the, it's the choice on the, on the part of the parent. Um, it's not a choice in the, on the, on the, uh, on the part of the child to like, in the same way that being said with it being gay isn't a choice. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:39          That's who they are. If they think that they're a girl, why do you have to give them hormones to make them more of a girl?

Speaker 2:          11:46          Uh, because uh, I'm sorry, can you expand on the question? Simple. If you say

Speaker 3:          11:54          that the child thinks it's a girl, so you're going to give the child hormones [inaudible] if the child thinks it's a girl, let it be a girl. Like you don't have, why are you adding hormones? If you're shooting hormones into the child and you're affecting the child's development, you're saying that's not a choice. That's nonsense. Of course. It's a choice. You're choosing to chemically change this child's body. He choosing to inject things into this child's body on a regular basis that are going to radically affect the physical development of their body. Yeah. And you're saying that this isn't a choice. What's definitely a choice to do that. So,

Speaker 2:          12:28          so what Trans People Express, um, and again, I'm not an expert. This is from me talking to my trans friends and, and you know, uh, seeing what other trans folks say. Um, is that the experience of being trans and not receiving hormones, right? And not, uh, having the body that you identify with, the feeling of Dysphoria, right, is, um, extremely like painful, um, and is a condition unto itself, right? Um, and, uh, the, the, the feeling of not belonging with the body that you have of that mismatch, right? That seems to be in the broad variety of humanity, the way that some people are born, right? Where their inner self, right. The self that they are, they're like, I am a, you know, they're not thinking they are a woman. They're like, this is the person that I am doesn't match the body that they have. Right. And that gives them extreme distress. Right? And that leads to, you know, suicide that leads to, uh, you know, uh, other damaging behaviors. Right. And the best treatment for that, that we know exists is to, uh, you know, have, do gender confirmation via a hormones. Um, and

Speaker 3:          13:38          that doesn't effect the suicide rate. The suicide rate for Trans People's very high, postop and preop really doesn't get affected by whether or not you treat them well. The operation, you know, one of the questions conception is why is that? Is that because they're not accepted by society and we're not more loving? Could it be underlying issues that are, that are causing them to feel this way in the first place? Like what is it we don't know? And I felt, I'm sure it varies widely. Look, so I, all I can do

Speaker 2:          14:04          is a defer to the experts that, that I know about this, right. So, um, uh, you know, for instance, there's an author named Brynn Tannehill who is a former, uh, uh, former military helicopter pilot. I just interviewed her for my new podcast that's coming out soon, called a factually, I'm doing it on Earwolf and it's like a long form interview podcast. Um, and so she's one of the people who's affected by, uh, the, uh, Trump, uh, uh, military ban on Trans Service people, you know, so that's why you brought her around because she's trans. Yeah. Um, and uh, she wrote a fantastic book called everything you need to know about trans that like she's a, she is now a researcher, right. Um, and she went into really deep detail about like, here is all of the medical science here is all of here's all the science about it. And so at this point in the conversation, I would say, hey man, I just got to bone up on, you know, on that part. Cause I don't want to speak to suicide rates. My entire

Speaker 3:          14:57          or concern is with children. My concern is not with young adults deciding to take steps to confirm their gender identity, who they feel they really are. I'm all for you doing whatever you want to do when you're an adult, when your mind is formed. But people change their mind. They change their opinion, they changed their thoughts. There's nothing wrong with just deciding to be a gay man. There's nothing wrong with your body, uh, you know, as you grow and mature and develop, you growing out of these ideas, some wheel in some world and the ones who won't, they always have the option to do something later on in life. But if you do something to hormonally block a child very, very early on, there's no turning back from that.

Speaker 2:          15:34          Well let me say, let me say a few things of that. First of all, it's not wrong to be concerned about children. And there's a reason this is the most intense part of this conversation and I think it's correct, right? Because we're all very concerned about children. Right? But I do want to say, first of all, I don't think it's correct that trans people, if they don't receive hormones from an, from a young age, they simply become gay men. Because I know it happens very often. I Know Trans People,

Speaker 3:          15:58          cause it was a big article that was written about that recently where they were talking about whether or not gender confirmation surgery and hormone blockers on young children is ethical because of this fact. And this was what they were talking about, where people at one point in time wanted to be trans and they listed several famous examples and then as they became older, just decided to be gay, including women who wanted to be men who just became gay women. And I think, what's that girl's name that was in John Wick? Ruby rose. She was one of those, she wants to be trans when she was younger and now she's just a gay woman.

Speaker 2:          16:30          So look, I, I know, I know quite a few, uh, trans folks. Right? Um, and I have to be honest, none of the ones that I know where, I don't know any trans women personally who are gay men up until they transitioned. Right. Um, I know quite a few trans women who are straight men. Right. Um, or who, you know, lived their lives as to presented as straight men. Right. And then transitioned. Right. Um, as an order come lesbians. Uh, yeah, I mean that's, that's one of the ways that people can be, I really recommend that. Um, oh, the other thing I was going to say is that I do know also among the Trans folks that I know where the Trans people who speak about this, that I've heard so many of them say, I wish I had access. I knew this about myself at a very young age and I wish to God that I had, that we had, I had had the ability to receive these hormones at a young age. My life would be so much better. And I'm not gonna Argue with those folks. You know

Speaker 3:          17:24          these folks either. But you have to address the fact that there are people that have gone through transition surgery and said, I wish to God that I never did this. There's a lot of those people too. So if you're looking for anecdotal evidence and you want to be objective, you kind of have,

Speaker 2:          17:35          I'm sure we can. I'm sure we can find the anecdotes. Um, I'm very curious and this is what I'd go consult my friend, uh, or my recent interview subject Tana Hills, uh, work on this to see how many, uh, see how many are in each group right now, which, which, which sets of these folks are the outliers. I think the folks that you're talking about are probably the outliers, but I can't, you know, uh, confirm that all sir

Speaker 3:          17:56          juries have potential costs. However, according to a Swedish study of 324 patients, three 40, 1% of whom were born female surgery was associated with considerably higher risk for mortality, suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. So that's people who got the surgery.

Speaker 2:          18:16          I am curious, wait, 3.4, 1% of them. The devil of this is in the details, right? Because how much is the, is the higher risk? What does it mean? 3.1% of those who were born female

Speaker 3:          18:28          from were born female and the other ones were born male. The males that transition to females is what it's saying. It's only saying a small percentage of them were born female that transitioned to male, but the larger percentage was males who transitioned to female. And that the surgery that they received was associated with considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Sure. That's not healing them. That's saying that having that surgery is associated with higher risks of mortality, suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity.

Speaker 2:          19:00          But it also says above following surgery, patients report lower gender dysphoria and improved sexual relationships right before they killed themselves. Everything's awesome. Well, this isn't saying that people are killing themselves. You know, you're looking for, you're looking for something that confirms a previously established opinion and as are you, you know, I mean we're, we're, we're looking at this and just look at the, we should be, we should always be careful of drawing too much from, you know, a single study. I'm like, look at it widely. Right. Um, but, uh, uh, what was the point I was about to make? Um, it flipped my head. Uh, I, I'm sort of at the, Oh, here's what it was. Um, surgery. Another thing I know from, from speaking with Trans folks is that surgery is overemphasized, right? And then, and that, uh, surgery for those folks is not the, you know, we as sort of straight says people tend to put too much emphasis on like, oh, did you get the surgery yet?

Speaker 2:          19:50          Or not? You know, and really it's more about what are you living as and what is, you know, what sort of set of hormones do you have? Right. Um, but I, I would really, uh, one of the, I've sort of reached the limit of like my facility with this topic. I really want to shout out, um, uh, videos made by a friend of mine. Her videos are called a contra points. Her name's Natalie when, and she does these increase. She's a former, a philosopher, former philosophy phd, and she does these incredibly funny videos about, is not just about transitions, about all types of things. Um, uh, she had really great one about comedy recently. Um, but she really breaks down like a lot of these, a lot of misconceptions, right. And has really changed every time I watch. One of her videos, I'm like learning new things and like new ideas are like pop, pop, pop in my head, you know. Um, and I, I think you should check them out and you might enjoy talking to her on the, on the show. She's like a really fascinating person. Contra points. It's an incredibly complex subject. You really had a really is

Speaker 3:          20:44          angel on the podcast before who transitioned from female to male, which is also a different and interesting thing. Yeah. Um, you know, and he said that his whole life just felt like he was a boy and he didn't understand why he didn't have a penis. He didn't understand like the whole, it didn't make sense. And then once he transitioned to being a male, then he felt complete. You know, I don't deny that. My entire concern is that you're making decisions for children and that this is a completely new thing with no historical precedent. We've never done this before. There's not like a history of hundreds of years of hormone blocker blockers being used on young children and whether or not that is healthy and promotes a positive life. I feel like if a child thinks there are girl, let them live as a girl, but you don't have to hormonally engage with their body with chemicals.

Speaker 3:          21:35          It just seems crazy. It seems ill advised. It does. It seems like this movement of acceptance and progressive thinking in in in many ways is a fantastic thing. It's a fantastic movement. But this seems to me to be, uh, a leap and that you're making this leap to confirm your ideology and to confirm that, you know, you're 100% cool with trans people and you're 100% co and you, you're going to recognize this child is trans, but you're doing something. You're, you're doing something to this child's body that you can't turn around. And if this child decides at whatever age we decide that you can make rational decisions to transition as trans, let them fully develop first. Let them be a person. Let them make these decisions. If you want to identify as a woman, you and you want to keep your penis, that should be fine too.

Speaker 3:          22:25          There's nothing wrong with that. If you want to keep a functional penis, you want to identify as a woman and not even take hormones. Who Cares? Do that, do that. But when you're stepping in to a developing baby that's only been alive for six years and you're shooting chemicals into its body to change the way it develops. Show me the research. Show me the decades of peer reviewed studies on one of the most important things that we know of the development of a human being. Well, you're going to hear more hormonally interact with their body and some sort of a random doctor Frankenstein sort of way, like say, how much evidence do we know? What evidence do we have that this is a a powerful, absolute like intelligent, smart way to handle a child's life over the long term. Like when these kids grow to be 60 as opposed to kids who don't get the the hormone shots when they're six, they, these people are 15% more happy. There's nothing like that, but yet people are jumping into it because it seems like the thing to do because it seems like the tide of society is moving in that direction.

Speaker 2:          23:27          Well, I, I don't jump into it for that reason. Um, I do think that when we're talking about an issue that affects those people, right? The first thing we should do is listen to those people, right? So the children listen to the children and listen to the adults, right? Who said used to be that child.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Okay. You know, but they are not that child. And you know, to you said the look, everyone's different. So for them to say, I was that child, that's nonsense. You were a similar child in a similar situation. You are not that shadow. They're not literally, but they don't know how that child is feeling. They don't know how much that child is being influenced by its environment. They don't know how much their thoughts and their expressions are being encouraged by their parents. They don't know that child. Sure. So my point is, when we're taught, when you and I are talking about this right now, we're speaking pretty hypothetically, right? We're, we're talking about a child that is not in the room that we don't have. We're talking about a fictional trial, right? So what we really care about are the actual people, right? Um, and when we talk to the actual trans folks, right.

Speaker 1:          24:29          And, uh, talk to, you know, say, Hey, what do you think, you know, how do you feel? And, uh, you know, include them in that conversation. I think we have a different conversation about it. You know, we do have an open conversation, but we also have a different conversation. We talked to people that have regret from transition surgery cause there's a lot of those. Sure. But we're not, we don't have either of those folks in the room. Right. You know, we have to acknowledge that they're real as well. Yeah. I, I don't, uh, I'm not, I'm not dismissing that those people are real. Right. But when we say if you talk to Trans folks, you get this impression that's not necessarily true. Um, uh, Wa a wide range of impressions. I wasn't just, I wasn't talking about specifically the impression that I wasn't saying we should reason from anecdotal evidence.

Speaker 1:          25:12          Right. I'm saying that, um, look, the last conversation I had with a person about this was a, uh, was a trans military veteran who is a researcher who wrote a book on, uh, on these issues. Right. Comprehensively looked at the research and told me that the research shows, uh, that the evidence that you're asking for, um, exists maybe not on a 30 year timeline, but there have been studies of this and here's what we know about them, right. About Children's. Um, uh, yeah, I mean that's a, that is my understanding of the role. I have not looked at the research myself and you know, I don't have, not on this topic on my shows, the positive benefits of children transitioning. I don't think that exists. Well, we can't solve that in this conversation right here. Um, but, uh, so my point is, look, I'm not going to go out on a limb and tell you more than I can.

Speaker 1:          25:59          I can say off the top of my head, right, because I'm not an expert on the subject. Uh, this is something that, you know, if I, if this were something we had done on our show and I had doubt dive into the research more, I can tell you more. I know it exists, but I can tell you what I have been told exists by people who have made it their business to know, you know. Um, so, uh, so, you know, that would be my next step in the conversation. Um, uh, but, you know, that's what I'm saying is, uh, those are, you know, including those folks in this conversation is a really critical part of it for me. Um, so yeah. Uh, well it's a conversation in the world needs to have for sure. Yeah. And I think it's one that we will have and you know, again, just to bring it back to athletics, right?

Speaker 1:          26:43          Um, I think that the, uh, undeniable existence of trans, you know, children to teenagers to adults, right, who want to compete, right. Um, and who make a compelling case to is that, that they should be able to compete, right. Um, is going to be something that we're going to have to grapple with. You know, I think there's going to be easy answers to it. Um, and now, yeah, I mean, I think the real, the legitimate solution as a Trans League or a trans division to have a male division of female division of Trans Division if you want to compete athletically. That's fair to me. That makes sense. Well, I hope that there's, you know, like say with the, you've got the Para Olympics, right? And the Paralympics is really like, it's divided. Why do you know how they do it? Where they do like all the different levels for, you've got this much amputated or you're this mobile and you can compete in this way.

Speaker 1:          27:29          You know? And so that's really great to make a way that, you know, those folks can compete on a level as a playing field as we can be, get, you know, given the manifold variations in human bodies. Right. But the fact that I, Oscar Pistorius, which by the way we should bring up again, he killed his girlfriend, which is a very weird part of the story. And he said he thought she was a robber bazaar. Completely bizarre. But the fact that he was able to compete in the Olympics, right, not just in the Paralympics. I think such a wonderful thing, you know. And so I would hope that whatever organization we come up with, you know, allows for the, uh, allows for humans and all their variations to compete in the Maine League as well. Right. Honestly, because as possible, they come up with bionic legs like Steve Austin from the $6 million man.

Speaker 1:          28:15          There's some people out there, they'll cut their fucking legs off to run faster and that's real. There are people that want to win so bad they would cut the bottom of their legs off to get bionic prosthesis. They wouldn't really for sure 100% would, would you? No, I wouldn't, but I'm not crazy. Look this people, I mean these are hands just cause they, they, they're, they are a bit, do you know that people have that feeling that they're supposed to be disabled? So they amputated? Yes. Their hands. Yes. There's people with all sorts of psychological disorders, but the need to win is so insanely strong in some people. And if they found out that, hey man, well who gives a fuck about your feet and your calves? Man, they're going to look just like feet and calves, except they allow you to run 45 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          28:53          But I don't think people would do it. Isn't that a little similar to the argument when people say, Oh, trans bathrooms, it's just so man are just going to lie about it. So they can go in the bathroom and peep at women and then when you actually expand that, right, and you're like, hold on a second, you're telling me a dude is going to tell the entire world I am. I'm not a man. I'm a woman. They're going to start dressing differently. They're going to take hormones. They're going to like live with the stigma, right? They're going to one of the most stigmatized type of people. You can be in America today as a trans person and they're going to live with that stigma. They're gonna change our whole lives and they're gonna do all of that just so they can peep at women in the bathroom.

Speaker 1:          29:26          It doesn't make any sense. Highly Unlikely, and it doesn't make any sense, but it also, that's not entirely what could happen. What also could happen is you could get some creep who dresses up like a woman and goes to the mail to the women's bathroom. You can get that. I mean, I'm all for trans. You can't have it now. I'm all for it. But if you have a bathroom that allows trans people and you get some creep who says, I'm just gonna pretend to be trans. If you don't think that's real, then you're crazy. Of course people do that. Of course there's, and people have been arrested. No, no, no. There is. There's people who have been arrested, men who were sex offenders who dressed up as women and went into the women's room and harassed women. There's already been risks. This is, but it's not because at least they have trans transplant.

Speaker 1:          30:07          But here's the thing, they're not the trans people. The people that are taking advantage of a loophole and their creeps and they, they probably wanted to go into the female bathroom anyway, but they just couldn't do it before. And now that there's trans exclusive, inclusive bathrooms, some creeps have been arrested doing that. They're not trans people. The real problem is the creeps. The real problem is not the Trans people using the women's room. They should of course be able to use the women's room, but the creeps can go like you don't need a law for like it. So if they're not trans people, right, they are not supposed to be in the bathroom right there for way trans people. And this is what people were worried about, but so have arrested people doing that. So they could also do that. Even if it was not a gender inclusive.

Speaker 1:          30:47          Sure. It would be breaking the rules of the bathroom and exactly the same way, but everybody waking the bathroom man in a dress versus them being trans. See if you see a trans person, oftentimes tramps, people look very masculine. There's no need. If you're just going to pretend to be trans, there's no need to hide what we have to ask address. All you have to ask ourselves is if the hypothetical or if the extremely, extremely rare situation that you're discussing, right is so horrifying to us and such a, uh, such a big problem that it's worth disenfranchising millions of people from the ability to simply go to the bathroom when they need to. You know, if, if that extreme edge case or hypothetical case, right, are we really going to, uh, are we really going to, you know, uh, hurt all, all of these actual people who actually exist in say, hey, I just need to Goddamn go to the bathroom, you know, um, in a, in a place that is, uh, you know, safe for me.

Speaker 1:          31:49          Right. Um, and I don't think, I don't think it is, you know, like we, we can talk about that one edge case all day long. Don't know. But these are the days has been more than one case. But I think here's the question, what were, what, what are there more of, are there more trans people or they're more sexual predators? 100% more trans people than sexual predators who are specifically going to put on a dress and in order to go into a bathroom specifically, yeah, I 100%. There's more trans people, like, like by a factor of a million. Why don't but affected million? I mean, how many people are trans? Uh, what's the, what's the numbers on that? You know, I don't know. But I would, I would consult my, a consultant, my friend Brian's book to find out, because I'm sure it's in there because she, she wrote a book that breaks down all these statistics called everything you need to know about train mind of a subject. You

Speaker 3:          32:40          know, as soon as you start bringing this shit up, people go crazy because it's, uh, it's complicated and people, they dig their heels in the ground on both sides, you know, and, you know, I tried to have, um, you know, happy, we able to have a conversation about, I try to have a conversation that's based on, you know, what, I try not to say more than I than I think I can say, uh, with, you know, with surety. Um, and uh, you know, but my basic principle is, man, I just want to defer to the humanity of the people that I'm talking about. You know what I mean? And rather than saying, oh, well, here's my idea, here's my concern. What about the what, what if, uh, what if, uh, a space alien were to come down and do x, Y, z. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          33:19          Rather, rather than try to come up with thought experiments about it, you know, it's like, hey, there's some people in America, they're making a polite request. Can we use the bathroom? Please go ahead. You know, that's, that's my, that's what I default to write. Just killed the perverts. And if they kill the perverts and you don't have any issues, I think there's a way with sports again, right? I genuinely think, hey my, my default is I understand his problem. I understand you're going to have female athletes who, who are, who say, Hey, wait a second. Is this fair? Right. I think we can go forward with good faith and find a way. Let's find a model that works for everybody. You know, I think we can do it in a way that respects the humanity of the trans athletes and assist athletes. I think that we can do that.

Speaker 3:          33:57          Um, and that's that, that that will always be my thing. It's easy to say, as an outsider, if you're a female athletes, it's been forced to compete with trans women who used to be men for most of their lives. I think you'd have a different opinion because I think they have a distinct physiological advantage that's been expressed many times. I mean it's, there's just a lot of records have been broken by Trans women who are now weightlifters. And there's that one who's the fucking dirt biker, who's was a professional dirt bike professional writer before as a man and then transitioned over to a woman. It's just dominating these things. It's just, I don't necessarily think it's fair. I think just like, it's not fair for a man to compete as a woman. I don't think that all those disadvantages or those advantages rather go away when you transition, especially in a short time period.

Speaker 3:          34:43          I just don't think they do. And I don't think there's any evidence that shows they do. There's a diminishing amount, but how much so, and in fact, there's a doctor, board certified endocrinologist, doctor Ramona crushed sick, I think is her name. We did a whole article on this about fighters, about male fighters, uh, transitioning to becoming female and competing as female, which has happened. And they're saying that not only does the estrogen therapy, uh, it actually preserves bone density done, doesn't just turn them into a woman or turn them into female or the, so their hormone profiles similar to females but also preserves their masculine bone density. Because one of the reasons why women lose bone density as they get older, there's a lack of estrogen. That's part of the reason why osteoporosis kicks in well that they, that stops it in its tracks when you're, you're injecting, um, female hormones into a male's frame. So they maintain this male bone density. Now there's also arguments that African American female bone density is on, in many cases, similar to a white European male bone density. So that's the, um, the argument about the outliers and about whether or not it's a level playing field because it most certainly is.

Speaker 2:          35:51          Yeah. I mean, so that, that's where I get back to the idea that look, could someone show that a athlete who, a Trans Athlete who wants to compete is going to have a physiological advantage because of their history of transition. Right. Could that be the case? Sometimes. Probably so. You know, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna argue that. Let let, well let's, how about this, cause I actually don't want to know one way or the other because I have not looked at any research on that, so I don't want to make any claim. Um, so let's just, let's just grant that for the sake of this thought experiment. Right. Okay. Um, so that being said, let's compare that against every single other advantage that every other competitor could have. Socioeconomic advantage, right? Country of origin. Um, you know, whether or not they live in Denver or if they live below sea level, you know, like all those different things. Right. Um, do, is it humane to draw a line around that one on earned advantage, right. Uh, against all those other honor advantages, you know, is at what point does our fantasy of having a level of having a true level playing field end up hurting people, you know, end up, end up excluding people. And that's the conversation that I, that I think we could have.
