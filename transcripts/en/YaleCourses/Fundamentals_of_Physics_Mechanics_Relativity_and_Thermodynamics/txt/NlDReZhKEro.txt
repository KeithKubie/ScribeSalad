Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I was going to do a brand new topic, but I didn't want to go without making sure everyone understands the loop, the loop problem, because that's one problem where if you didn't learn Newton's laws and I played them properly, you just couldn't figure it out. Okay. All the other things we do in know block, sliding down planes, friction, police, you have an intuitive feeling for that. But this one really is a very non intuitive, right? Here's is a trolley at the top of the track, the forces on the trolley. What gravity and the force of the track or bought pushing down. And the question is why isn't it falling down? Everything pushing down. Why isn't it falling down? That's the mystery. So what's the answer you would give to somebody says, why isn't the falling down? Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       that's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Yes. So they might say, well, if you say it's falling down, oh, how come it doesn't end up here to the center of the circle? Yes. You had a night. Somebody at an answer to that? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       Pardon me.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       Well, it's just hard time.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Uh, no. There are no forces in the horizontal direction. The forces are all yes.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Uh, it's not negligible. Debt is an acceleration that's producing a change in velocity. When we say an apple has a downward acceleration, you let it go and it falls down. That's what we think is downward acceleration. Here is something which a downward acceleration, but it's not falling down. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Changes the direction of, of feedback. Apple, over time, acceleration times, time changes. It just changes the direction of the velocity vector. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Yeah. I like take one more answer. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       The downward component and a horizontal component of the velocities are independent of each other. So the same time that the car can be falling down in one direction to that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       All right, so let me summarize all the different answers. First of all, one thing you should remember, no horizontal forces here. The forces are what I brought. That's the way it should be. Very, very careful. Just because something has a tendency, the mode to the left doesn't mean there's a force to the left. That's the whole point of Newton's law forces connected or acceleration not to velocity. So yes, this will have an acceleration. You cannot avoid it. F equals m. A we'll tell you t plus m g is m a and a that you want in this problem. If it moving in a circle, M v squared over R so it is accelerating and the difference between this one accelerating. Let us say I got the loop, the loop and I drop an apple. Forget the track. It's got an mg acting. The owner's accelerating too.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       What's the difference between these two here you start with zero velocity, you accelerate downwards. That means you pick up a downward velocity. I said this or the which is keep falling down and picking up more and more speed. The same acceleration is experienced by the cart also and a little more because tea is also pushing down, but they're the change in velocity over a tiny amount of time. It's not added to zero velocity, but to this large velocity it has at that instant and the tiny increment and velocity you've added this way will produce a velocity in that direction and what that really means if you wait a smaller amount of time, this thing is going along the new velocity direction. So that's the difference between, so the acceleration is the same for the falling apple as for the loop, the loop card, but in the apple case it has added two zero initial velocity.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       So the acceleration and the velocity or the same namely down, if you have a huge velocity to which you at a tiny change in velocity in the downward direction, you rotate the velocity vector. That just means that as it goes around the circle, the velocity vector is constantly tangent to the circle. That's another way in which people understand this. If around the earth and you a standing say on a building and you fire the gun, it goes like that and it hits the ground because of an acceleration due to gravity. If you find it a little faster, it'll go there. They'll be certain speed at which it keeps falling for. It doesn't get any closer to the center. That is in fact how you launch a bullet into orbit. So what's the first thing you should do when you fired this gun?

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       More away because it's going to come back and get you from behind. Okay. All right. That's a very useful lesson. So you might think, hey, I sharted in that direction. It's not my problem. Like everything else, it'll come back and get you when you least expect it, but this is how you have, so it's this thing falling or not. It is constantly falling, but the earth is falling under that. So it's endless search to come to the earth. Whereas if you dropped the bullet and he'd just fall and hit the ground, that's what we always think us draw. Okay. So this is something I did in a rush and I didn't want that because this is really the part of physics which is not intuitive and I think we all know what the main part is. The main point is velocity is a vector and its value can change. You're the change in direction. Natya Indian magnitude. Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       Or changing velocity, right? What does that equal to? Okay. If you wait a certain time, Delta t then the acceleration is v squared over r put the, we put the art, get some number, multiply by that Delta t one 10th of a second. That would be the change in that time. So in that time also the guy would've moved over and the circle a little bit just precisely so that at that point you knew velocity vector is tangent to the new location. So this little Delta v I drew, it's not a fixed number. It depends on how long I want to wait. Calculuses wait infinitesimal amount of time and practice. Wait one femtosecond and it'll be fine. Okay. Today is very, very important concept I want introduce. It's a very robust and powerful concept. It has to do with energy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       It is powerful because after the loss of quantum mechanics were discovered in the subatomic world, we basically gave up on many cherished notions. You know, you must have heard that particles can not have a definite position and definitely velocity at a given time. They don't have any trajectories. You see a particular here now, then you see it there. That's true because they are observed events. What happens in between, you might think they have a trajectory, but they don't force us are not well defined because if you don't know where the guy is, you don't know what [inaudible] is. You don't know about the acceleration. So most of the ideas of Newtonian mechanics are basically surrendered. But the notion of energy turns out to be very robust and survives all the quantum revolution. In fact, there was a period when people are studying nuclear reactions and the energy you began with them seem to be the energy you ended up with.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       So something was missing. So Niels Bohr, father of the atom said maybe the law of conservation of energy is not valid. Then Polly said, I think I put my money on the law of conservation of energy. I would postulate that that is some other tiny particle that you guys cannot see that's carrying away all the missing energy. That is a very radical thing to do. In those days when people did not lightly postulate new particles. Nowadays, if you don't postulate a particle, you don't get your Phd in particle physics those days it was very radical and the particular is not seen for many, many years. It is called the Neutrino. Nowadays, neutrinos are one of the most exciting things. One could study a lot of ministries. The universe connected with neutrinos. Okay, so energy is a concept you're going to learn. Here is again, place where it asks you don't memorize the formulas and start plugging them in.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       Try to follow the logic by which you are driven to this notion because then it will be less luggage for you to carry in your head and I'll try to make the notion as natural as possible rather than saying, this is my definition of energy. This is the definition of kinetic energy. Let's ask, where does all that come from? How many people have seen Kennedy can potential energies in your past? Okay. If you haven't seen it, that's fine. This is not something you're supposed to know. If you know it and you learned it properly, it will be helpful. But you don't have to know that. We just have to know what we have done so far. So let's go back and ask simple question. When a force acts on a body, what is its main effect? What does it do?

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       Uh, be more precise by when you say changes its motion, what does it mean to change its motion?

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       Yes. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       That's from Newton's law. That means it changes the velocity. So let's for the mill for a moment, in fact, for the entire lecture today, go back to one dimension. Then we will do the whole business and higher dimensions. One dimension. Judging the velocity simply means speeding up. So bodies are going to speed up and forces act on them. That we know. We're going to find the relation between how much speed is accumulated. When a force acts on a body are going to deny that. So let us take an example where they force is an x, that action. And there's some constant constant meaning. It's not varying with time. Somebody decides to just applied 10 newtons constantly to a body. What does that do? That produces an acceleration, which is f over an APP, right? That's Newton's law.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       That's a constant acceleration, so let's go back to lecture number one. Lecture Number One, we learn that if a body has constant acceleration than the velocity at the end is the velocity squared in the beginning plus two times a times the distance traveled. This part we learned long back. This is just kinematics. In those days we didn't ask why is it having a constant acceleration? You were just told that's a constant acceleration. Just go ahead. Now that we learned dynamics, we know acceleration as a cost, namely a certain force, so I'm going to right here as you can imagine for with them in the place of a, but I'm going to make one more cosmetic change and notation in all these energy formulas. Rather than calling the initial velocity or initial anything with a subscript zero and the finalists, no subscript we're going to use in rotation with the final quantities are denoted with a subscript two initial quantities had been noted by a subscript one. In other words, initially the body had a Velocity v one and then you'd had an acceleration a farther the distance d than the relation between final initial velocities is this, so let's put that f over em here and let you put a,

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       since we are interested in the effect or the force, we want to see what the force due to the velocity. What you find here is that if you want to find the tangent of velocity, of course you should take this guy to the left hand side, right? Take her to the other side and you want to isolate the force of bring em over two to the left hand side, so do that in your head and what you get ammo word to be two square minus m over to the one square is f Times D.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Yeah. This is a very important concept. It says when the force acts on the body, it changes the velocity and it depends on how far the force has been acting, how many meters you've been pushing the object. It's clear that if you had done push it at all than even though forces acting velocity hasn't had time to change, so it seems to depend on how far the forest acted and the change is not simply in velocity, but in velocity square. That's what comes out. Then you realize that it's the most natural thing in the world to give this combination a name because that's what comes out of this. That combination is called the Kennedy Energy and I'm going to call it kid. Too many care at the end minus k at the beginning is f Times d f times. The

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       yes

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       is denoted by the symbol w and that's called a work done.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       Why f?

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       That's how he introduced the notion of a force times distance of the definition of work. This is how people, you can say, why did anyone think of taking the combination f Times d will. This is how it happens, so you need to have a unit for this, which is actually a Newton meters, but we are tired of calling everything in Newton meter so we are going to call it a jewel. Jewel or Jay is just a shorthand for Newton meters.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       All right, so let us know right down the say following expression here. Delta K Delta K in anything we do is a change in any quantity is called Delta of that quantity. Delta K is a change in k is SQL. Do the F, time to distance travel. Let the distance travel be some tiny amount. Delta x, this formula is valid even if the is one kilometer as long as forces constant, but I'm saying let's focus on a problem whether the forces constant or not or what a tiny interval in which the body moves to distance delta x. Then we find that the change, the candidate energy is force times delta x. What if there are 36 forces acting on the body? Which one should I use? I'm pulling and you're pushing and it's gotta be the net force because Newton's law connects the net force to the acceleration. If you and I have a tag of war and we cancel each other out to zero, then there is no acceleration, so you got to go back to the definition.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       This is very, very important. This F better be the total force. I should really use the subscript t four total, but I don't want to do that when we write ethicals. I miss understood. F is everything. We will come back later to the notion of what happens if, if efforts made up of two parts. So maybe I'll just give you a simple example. Here's a body, right, and I'm pushing it this way and you're pushing it that way. Let's say with equal force and the body could be addressed or if the body had an initial velocity, it'll maintain the initial velocity because velocity is for free. Then you can ask, what does this theater say? This is called a work energy theater work. Energy Theorem says the tangent energy is equal to the work done by all the forces.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       In this case there is no change in energy but there are two forces at work that cancel. Then it turns out that it's sensible to define the work done by me with this equals f times the distance of travel and the work done by you will be in fact given a minus sign. So when do we attach a plus sign and when do we attach a minus sign? If you go back to the whole innovation it was at, it was understood that a was a positive quantity, then everything works. But if the body is moving to the right and I'm pushing to the right, then the work done by me is positive and if you are pushing to the left and the body is still moved to the right to work done by you as negative. In other words, if you get your way, namely things move.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       The way you're pushing the work done by you is positive. If people are pushing your counter to your wheel in the opposite direction to your force worked, then by you is negative. So here's a simple example. I have a piece of chalk and I'm lifting it at constant velocity from the ground is kinetic. Energy is not changing. That means the total work done on it, the zero, but it's not because there are no forces on it. That is gravity acting down. That is me countering gravity with exactly the right amount. I'm applying a force AMG. So work then by me it would be positive because I wanted to go up and it goes up. So if it goes up by an Ahmad age work done by me is mg times age worked on by gravity in the meantime is minus empty time set. So the total work done is zero.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       So this formula says this is the total force, but I'm telling you if you take the work done and call it Delta w it may be a result of many works work done by me, worked on baby you worked on by somebody else. Some are positive, some are negative. You add them all up. So that is the notion of work done by one of many forces acting on the body and the total work done is the Algebraic sum of the work done by all the forces are. So we got this resolved. Let's do the following. Let us imagine all this occurs in a time Delta t then Delta k over Delta t which will eventually become DKD t if you take all the proper limits becomes f times Dxdt, which is force times velocity. That's called power.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       So power is the rate at which work is done. For example, if I climate 12 story building, I've done some work my m times g times the height of the building, I can claim the building in one minute, I can climb the building in one hour to work. Done is the same, but the power is a measure of how rapidly work is done. That's why it's the product of force and velocity. So the units for power or jewels per second. Now that also has a new name, which is watts or this w you may use a kilowatt, which is kw, little kid mw thousand watts. So if you've got a 60 watt bulb, it's consuming energy or the rate of 60 joules per second. That's the meaning of a 60 watt boat. Okay. Now I'm going to do the next generalization, which is when the force is not a constant but varies with x.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       So do we know any example of a force that varies with location? Spring is one example. Even gravity, I think we know it's not a secret. The force of is mg near the earth. But if you go sufficiently far, you will noticed gravity itself is getting weaker. It'll still look like AMG, but g won't be 9.8 g able to become 9.6 and 9.2 and 9.1 or decrease. But the variation of gravity in terrestrial experiments is pretty small. So we won what he bought it. But the force of a spring definitely varies with x and in order to civil away and the force of the spring. So one concrete example is what you all seem to recognize is this one. So then we have to ask what is the work energy theory theorem when the forces itself very, so let's draw ourselves a force, which is very [inaudible] is my force. It does something f equals Kx or minusK is a particular graph. I'm just taking any function of f that I want.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       Now the acceleration is not constant because the forest is not a constant. So if you wait for one hour, the change in Canada energy is not simply force times distance because what force are you going to use? It was something now with something later as positive, I was negative later. So we cannot apply this formula because F it's not a constant. So the usual trick and calculuses find me an interval in x. We just saw an arrow and I'll make it as narrow as you insist so that during that period I think that f is a constant and a constant value of f is just the function f at that Timex at that time where the location is x. So for that tiny interval, I can still say that fs constant or what? Emma's some constant over the tiny interval. Then the change in Kennedy, Kennedy will be then F of x Times Delta X. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Then you wait a little longer, you go to a new place, then you got a new value of the force. Maybe somewhere here. Then that times they'll tax is the work done in that region, but geometrically FX them. Delta x is the area of the little rectangle who's basest delta x and it was hyped as the function effort at time. So if you eventually went from here to here, let me call that point. The next one and let me call the ending point is x two then the work done by you. It's really given by the area under the graph and in every segment you pick up the chain than Kennedy energy you. You add it all up. Then we say added all up on the left hand side. All the case will add up to give me the final minus initial candidate energy. This one is what is written in the notation of Calculus as Fx.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       DX from x one two x two this is called the integral of the function ffx oh again, in a course at this level, I'm assuming that you guys know what an integral is. Even if you've never heard of an integral, if I give you a function and you'd never heard of calculus, you can still deal with this problem because you will come to me and say, give me your function. I'm going to plot it in a some kind of graph paper with a grid on it and I'm just going to count the number of pioneers squares and closed here. That's the area and that's the chain that Kennedy energy integration is finding the area under graphs bounded by the function of the top x axis below and two vertical lines at the starting and ending points.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Now a little digression, even though you're supposed to know this, I want to make sure part of the no child left behind program that you all follow this, so if you never heard calculus or integral calculus is going to be a two minute, three minute introduction. That is a great secret, which is that if you give me a function and you told me to find the area under this from x one two x two I can go to the graph paper and draw that are, that is quite often a trick. You don't have to draw anything, you know, and I will tell you a little more about what it is if you give me a function ffx the area under the graph happens to be the following day to see another function. Gfx can be specified in a moment and you just have to find g of the upper limit. Wayne at g are the lower limit and that will be the area. And who is this mystery function? G Eight is any function who did of it too is the given function. F

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       So the whole business of finding area with a solid around Newton's time is if you have a function they want the 80 on, did it. You go and think of a function who is dead of active is the given function. So this is the opposite of taking derivatives. Differentiation is an algorithmic process. You take ffx, you add a delta x two the x, you find the change in after wide without tax given any function, you can do that. This is the opposite. This is guessing the function g who is delivered to the staff, so if I say F of x equals x cubed, the Gfx is that function was deliberative is x cubed. So I know I got to start with x to the fourth because of when I take derivatives it'll become an x cube but with the foreign in it. So I fight that by putting a four downstairs and that's the function g yes.

Speaker 3:          00:25:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       Yes, that is the plus c Betsy is of course velocity of light. Now why is this plus see there? He's quite right because if you've got a function with database or something, adding a constant doesn't change the date of it too. Then you can say, well we are in trouble now because you told me to find a function g and you're telling me the world cannot agree on what g is because I've got one g you got another one with different constants. But the beauty is that when you take this difference, I'm in awkward. The constant didn't. You may put the constant but he's going to cancel out so most of the time people don't bother with the cons. Sometimes it's very important to keep the constantly plays a special role, but we don't want that here. We'll just call this the integral

Speaker 1:          00:26:25       so maybe it's again worth asking for a second. Why is this true? You know, why is g the function? Who's data Vudu is f why is that the answer to the problem? We had one way to think about it, is it really more for your completeness than anything else? Suppose that is a function f and I'm finding the area, let me find it up to the point that I'm going to call x two for the starting point. Let me just pick zero. This is the ADM looking for and I rated as FFX DX from zero to the point x two you agreed that I say slight x do back and forth the areas bedding with x two so it's legitimate to call that a function off x two

Speaker 3:          00:27:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       Function is anything that depends on something else. And we all agree that if the point x to moves the area moves, this is my shorthand for the area. The starting point is nailed at zero. This is GFX do the Lex ask what is g of x two plus Delta? That is the area till this point that we in as FFX DX from zero to x two plus Delta, that g of x two plus Delta. So what is the difference between the two difference between the two is Gfx two plus Delta minus g of x two. If we look at the graph, the extra area that I have is this thing and that is clearly equal to f at the point x to with Delta x.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Other words by how much is the area changing? When I changed the upper limit, well the changing by the height of the function of the very last moment times the change in x. Well we know what to do and are divided by Delta x and take the limit and you can see that f of x two is DG the x at the point x too. But the point x two is whatever point you want. So we dropped the label and we just say thatF as a function of Xs d GDX. This is the origin of the result that the area can be found. If you can find the inverse that of the function.

Speaker 3:          00:28:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       so let's keep a couple of popular examples in mind. One is f of x equals the constant. Then GFX is he going to constant times x, f of x equals x. Then GFX is equal to x squared over two as you know, the integral of extra the Nsx to the n plus one over n plus one that are integral for all kinds of functions and you check them by taking derivatives and make sure to get back your f. All right. Suppose this is what we learned from the map guys. Then go back to the work energy theater. I'm and see what it says. Kid Two minus k one oh by the way, I didn't complete one story. Let me finish that. This was a DFX too. Was the area from zero to the point x too. Gfx One is the area from zero to the point x one. Then there's perhaps clear to you that if I only want the area between the [inaudible] and the point x two I can take the 80 all the way up to x to subtract from it the area all the way up to x one and that's of course the claim that this integral f of x Dx from x one two x two is GFX to find is GFX.

Speaker 3:          00:30:15       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       steps. The reason the integral is given by a difference of this g, so let me use a shorthand notation and call GFX to as simply Jeetu DFX. One is do you want, you should understand g two means g evaluated at the final point. Do you want to achieve out of it at the initial point? So you have got kid two minus K one is g two minus g one but g is some definite function of act. You got to understand that for example, it could be x to the square over two minus x one squared over two in the problem, but f is equal to X. Yeah. Then let's rearrange this thing to read. Kid to minus g two is equal to k one minus g one

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       so the work energy theorem says that if a forces acting on a body of radial force associated with the forest is the function g available function of x, who's data was the given force. Then at the beginning if you take the difference of Kennedy energy minus the value of d to e be the same, I'm sorry, k minus d one it'll be the same as k two minors, g two now we don't like the form in which this is written. We have to make a little cosmetic change and the cosmetic chain is to introduce a function you affects with this minus this function GFX so once you do that, you got to remember now the force is equal to minus the deliberative at this function because of the minus sign of relating g to you. Then we can write it as kid to bless you to this k one plus you want. And that combination, if you call that as e two and you call this combination is e one we are saying [inaudible] equal to t two and that's called the conservation of energy.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       So what does conservation mean? Conservation of energy in physics has a totally different meaning from conservation of energy in daily life. Here at means when a body's moving on to the effect of this force ffx you agree it's gaining speed or losing speed or doing all kinds of things. So as it moves around it speeding up and slowing down. So it's speed is definitely a variable, but a certain magic combination connected to the velocity of the object and to its location. You depends on x. That does not change with time. And there's a bit of useful to know that does not change with time because if you knew the value of e even able to eat to equal to some fixed numbers, he at one time, you know he had all of the Times. So let's take a simple example. So we take a rock and we dropped it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       We know we're speaking of speed, we know as losing height. So you may think maybe that is some combination of height and speed, which does not change in this exchange. And we find the combination by this rule. Now in the case of gravity,F is equal to minus AMG. Therefore you physical the mg times. Why? Because mine is dod. Why will now be my f? Then we may conclude that one half MV squared plus Amg, why are the initial time will be equal to one half m we two square plus AMG white too at the final time

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       and that was the, and the whole thing can be evaluated. Any time you take any random time you want, the sum of these two numbers doesn't change. That's the video. Very powerful results. So I'm going to give you one more example later when you can see the power of this. But in the case of gravity, this is what it means. So this agrees with that intuitive notion that when you lose height, you gain speed. When you lowered your why, you gained speed. But it's much more precise than that. Instead of saying vaguely you lose and gain one half. Mv squared is the part connected with the speed at mg. Why is the part connected with height and that some does not change with time. So let's go back to the mass in spring system. In the case of mass and spring system, if you have a mass connected to his spring, then we say here, one half Mv Square plus one half k x square equal to e is a constant. That means find it at any initial time, one fighter that any final time to add these two numbers, that portal will not change.

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       So let me put that to work. Let me use that. Uh, let me use that in a, in a calculation. So I say, here's the spring, here's where it to be. I'm going to pull it to a new location. A X equals zero is where the spring likes to be. I'm going to pull it by an amount a and I'm going to let it go. And I want to know how fast the guy is moving when it comes back to say x equals zero. If you go back to Newton's laws, it's a pretty complicated problem. You've got to think about why it's a complicated problem because you start with a mass at rest. If you pull it by an amount, a a force acting on it, it'd be minus k times a that'll produce his tiny accelerate will produce an acceleration right k over them, which will give it a new velocity by the time it comes here, but once it comes to the new location, little later, a different forces acting on it because the x is now different, so the acceleration and during this interval is different and the gain in velocity that interval will be different from that in the first interval.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       You've got to add all these changes to find the velocity here. That's a difficult proposition, but with the law of conservation of energy, you do that in one second. In fact, let's do with not just to be at the midpoint here, but at any point x measured from equilibrium because we will say initially one half Mv, one square plus one half k x one square is equal to one half m B two square plus one half k x two square. This is the truth. This is a constant, does not change with time. Now to get some mileage out of this, you got to know what the constant value is. Well, we know what it is in the beginning because when we pulled this guy or that instant, we knew it had no velocity and we knew it was sitting at the point a so we know one half k square.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       That is the total energy of this mass and spring system. That's not going to change with time. We like to say that at the initial time, all the energies, potential energy, there is no kinetic energy because there was no motion on any subsequent time. This number has to be equal to what you get. Let me drop the subscript two there. Let the Stanford some generic instant in the future. This much we know now do you see that we can solve for the velocity on any location x, you pick the x. If you want x to be zero, that's very easy. You kill that term. You balance these two, you cancel the half and you can see there's a formula for v Square. The square is going to be k is where over and that is going to be the velocity when their swings by this midpoint.

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       But you can pick any x you like if they x was not zero but 0.1 we'll put the 0.1, take it to the other side and solve for v this one example of the law of conservation of energy. So the part of the law of conservation of energy. If you knew the initial energy, you don't have to go through Newton's laws and you will find an all the problem sets and many exams when a problem has given to you and you're told find the velocity of something you should try whenever possible to use the law of conservation of energy rather than going to Newton's laws. So if you want to know what have we done, how come finding the velocity seem so difficult when I described it earlier than Dendrite, we have done it. The answer to this, if you tell me the force of the spring is a function of x. I have done that integral in the work energy theater them once and for all. The integral of the spring force has been integrated once and for all, and that's what the potential energy is doing. Potential energy comes from integrating that force.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       All right, so now let's take another problem where there are two forces. Act. Yes, I, let me see here at the bottom of here. Is it just me going to be integration? Yeah, for the spring, I think we said here, if the force is x, the potential energy is a g is equal x squared over two you will be minus x squared over to serve the forces minus Kx. Then you have to find the you so that minus the UDX is equal to minus Kx and the answer that is used cake squared over two. So if you knew the force or you just find the function you by asking who's derivative gives me the minus sign, then you are done. That's a potential energy for that problem. Now let's take another problem. A masters hanging from the ceiling.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Ben has got two kinds of potential energy. One is just the gravitational potential energy and others, the spring potential energy that's going to come because k two minus k one will be the integral of f of X. Dx. I'm sorry. Let's call it the why. Why the why from y one two white too. And this f of why you will have two parts. The force of gravity, I'm tired of writing the limits. Then the force of the spring from one to two, from one to two, right? There are two forces acting on it. This one will be mg white, two minus AMG. Why One? This one will be one half k y two square minus one half k y one square. So every force acting on the body will turn into a potential because the force, Newton's law says work energy theater. I'm applies to the total force. The Tour de force is two parts and you can do to integrate those eaten tegretol is an upper limit minus lower limit of some function. And this is what you get. Oh, I think I made one mistake here. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       I think they should give me, yes, this is overall sinus Ron. In these equations. Really that's a minus in that minus, in that, in other words, the work done by the force. There's only one force acting. It's really you. One. Mine is youtube. You see why I got the sign wrong? When you do the integral in calculus, integral of FSG to minus g one but g and you are minuses of each other, so integral of force of give you you initially minus, you finally said it should really be plus MTY one minus m g white too, so the law of conservation of energy for this object will be that one half MV squared plus m g y plus one half k white square is the total energy and will not change this mask and bump up and down and go back and forth. If you knew the turtle up these three numbers at one instant, you know the value at any other instance.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       For example, if you pulled it from his equilibrium by 0.2 centimeters and they released it and you say, what's the speed? When it's 0.1 centimeters away, it's been easy because you know the initial energy was all spring energy and gravitational energy or any later time. If you knew the why, if you knew the position, you know the potential in it. That's the whole point. Potential energy depends on where you are. Kennedy, Kennedy depends on how fast you're moving and some combination of value water and how fast you're moving is invariant does not change with time. So if you're telling me where you are, I will tell you how fast you're moving. By the way, uh, I remember the kinetic energy enters as v Square. You can imagine when you solve for we, you're always going to get two answers. Why is that? Does it make any sense? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       You're going to have the same energy with your oscillating [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       If a spring is going back and forth, are they given point x? You can have two velocities because you could be going away from the center or you can be going back towards the center. So this tells you the velocity on those two will be donated by a minus sign, right? If you pull the spring this way when you go through the audit and you say, watch my velocity, I'll get two answers because I could be going to the origin, I could go the other way. And on the way back again past the origin. So every x you will get two velocities and that agrees well with the fact that we squared is what you will for and because it's quite radic, you will get two answers and you should get two answers. You should be expecting that. Okay, now we're going to find one bad boy, bad girl, bad person, which is going to ruin this whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       That is,

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       you know what I'm talking about here? Yes. So friction is a force acting on a body. So what's the thing I should try to do? Let's take a body with the only friction acting on it. Let's not worry about anything else or maybe friction at the spring. So I try as usual to get a law of conservation of energy and friction is acting and you will see that I will not succeed and it looks like everything here is watertight, right? Everything looks good. You'll tell me the force acting on a body. I integrate the force from start to finish and I call that the difference or potential energies. Then I've got my results. Try to follow this logic with care. Two minus Kevin has integrated the force. Integral is GX two minors, dx one or which is UX one minus UX too. You can rearrange it to get care to plus you to escape and plus you want, it looks like you can always get la conservation of energy and we want to know why that fails when there is friction.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       Why does it fail when there's friction? So when there is friction, let me try to do it again. Can't two minus k one is the force due to the spring with this whatever, minus k x. Let me do that. Integral plus the force of friction. DX from x one, two x two. This one is from x one, two x two and we saw what this is. Let me write it one more time. One half k x one square is one half k excuse squared. If you didn't have friction, you are done because you can get kinetic plus potential for spraying is Kennedy plus potential. Why don't we just integrate the force of friction

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       and then

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       turn that into a u and then we're done. What's going to be the problem? Let me, let me just give some, anybody else want? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       Uh, there would be always we change direction.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       Okay. What does your

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       can associate a potential function? Friction. Because it depends on the path that will lead the initial position in the final vehicle. He considers the final and the additional

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       right, but let's suppose I'm somewhere and I'm pulling a block and there is some friction that is a force F at the location. That's my f. Why don't they just use the value of f?

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       Yes. Pardon me.

Speaker 1:          00:47:25       I know, but see you are saying something else which is speaking. I head into into the book but right now what's the problem with integrating the force of friction? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       I was just going to say [inaudible] the one in the system.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       No, but you're all telling me why that is a loss of mechanical energy, but I'm just a mathematician. I'm saying give me a force. Find Integrity. What's the problem? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       All right. Is it because the function for the course?

Speaker 1:          00:47:53       Yes. I think somebody else said that earlier. Also, the force of friction is not a function of x. You might say, what do you mean I'm pushing this guy. I know how hard is pushing me back, but I'm telling you not push it the opposite way than you'd find. The force of friction at the very same location is pointing in a different direction. Where does the force of his spring is? The force of the spring. It's minus k x. Whether they are going towards the spring are going away from the spring. Right? Think about that. Same with gravity. Gravity is pulling you down with the force minus mg and it doesn't care whether the chalk is going up or coming down on the way up. It's pulling it down on the way down is also pulling it down because at the given location that is a fixed force, so the problem is not the force Beatty's with x or y, but the force is a function only affects, but if the function of x and velocity then you also have to know the velocity and no one's giving you then definite value for the velocity because of the vibrating mass in spring velocity can have either signed, therefore we do this integral but we don't do this.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       Even though I write it this way, mathematically is wrong because the force of friction is it really a function of x? I'll tell you in what limited since it is a function and what technical sensitive spot, let's defer that for now. Take all these guys to the left hand side, so this is Cape too. This'll become youtube so you will get kid too. Plus you two minus k one plus one is equal to this last thing. Then by friction the x from x one two x two and the question is can I do the integral? The answer is if you just tell me x one and x two that no, that's the point you're making. I cannot just do an integral because I will have to know the whole story, but in limited cases I can do this. Suppose I pulled the mass by an emote a and I let it go, but now that is friction.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       I think we all know that if it can be at the center, it won't be going quite as fast and we also know when it overshoots the other side, it will not go back to minus say normally it would go back to minus eight. Everyone knows why it goes back to minus a right. When you go to the other extremity without friction, you're energy is all potential. If there's one half k's square to begin with, it's got to be one half k squared at the end except ache and become minus day without changing the answer. That's why you go from a two minus minuses, but when you got friction cannot say the energy at equal cause I got do this integral for this part of the journey from here to here. During that part, the journey, the force is a well defined function. Namely it is a constant value minus mew times mg and it is acting this way so but this part of the trip I can do the integrators very easy to find out what it is. It's minus M g times music, kinetic times the distance traveled.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       Of course there's a little more complicated. Now you have to tell me where you want your velocity's. You might say find the velocity at x equal to zero if you want me to do that. The distance is travels is the original displacement. That's what is the stuff on that site and here cape to is one half Mv Square, which is what I'm trying to find. I am on the origin so it's one half kid times zero square, no potential energy initially that it was no candidate energy but that was potential energy. One half k square.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       You follow that logic. Now this is the difference in energies due to the conserved forces that are conserved energies, but the difference e two minus e one is no longer zero but is given by this number so I can calculate it for this part. I can even ask. This is one of the homework problems. I think you are asked, how far does it go to the left? Well what do you do? Let's call the place where it goes to, to the leftmost extremity as a prime. Then we don't know. So there when you go to the k two plus you two minus k one plus you one you will go back to this formula. First of all, the distance that the force of friction acts on is how much is a distance a to come here and another day prime to go to the left. A prime is a magnitude of how far do you go to the left and likewise on the left hand side you've got to have the throat candidate plus potential miners. Kinetic plus potential are the end of the day. You only have potential energy. One half k n Prime Square, no candidate in initially. Again, you only had potential energy, one half k square.

Speaker 1:          00:52:56       You will see that a prime now satisfies a quadratic equation. They can solve it,

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       but what is the point? The point is you cannot do this integral once and for all and say the answer depends on the on the end points in this particular problem. If you're told me you're doing this part of the journey during that part of the journey, because for the entire trip, the velocity had a particular sign, namely to the left force. The friction had a definite and magnitude and sign namely to the right. And then of course it's as good as any legitimate function and you can do the integral. In fact, the force is a constant. You can pull it out of the integral and integral dx is just the distance travel. Okay, so work done by friction and they will always come out negative and you should keep track of that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       Okay, so the final bottom line for law of conservation of energy that you guys should remember is the following. You take all the forces acting on a body, so let's do it one more time in our head so you know where everything comes from. Everything comes from this result. K Two minus k one which is the work done is the integral of all the forces, the forces into forces that depend on location only and not on anything else like velocity. Let me just divide them into two forces. One is the good force at Dx and one is a force of friction. Yes, this guy will turn into potential energy difference. Let me just take one good force and the force of friction if he had to eat will generate its own potential. When you do the integral, then we made then say e two minus e one effect the same as k two plus two minus k one plus one is equal to the work done by friction work done by friction is the shorthand for that integral, which you can do only you must divide the motion involved into pieces.

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       For example, if you have a massive swing to the left, then turns it on, goes back to the right. Of course. Again, it won't come back to the original AEL company, smaller number. That's because there's more loss of energy on the return trip. For the return trip. You must do the problem separately on on the return trip. You start from this a prime that you found that started moving to the right, no friction will act to the left soon as Dubai, the Morson at the segments during each segment, the force should have a definite direction and magnitude so you can do the integral. The point is there is no universal formula for ffx due to friction, so in one dimension, that's all it is. Between the good and bad forces, those which lead to potential, those were don't the differences. The good forces are functions of x bad forces at functions of x and something else so that are they given x.

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       It's possible to have two values for that function. Bathymetrically we don't call it a function. That's why you cannot do the integral once and for all. So this is the law of conservation of energy. Okay? All right. Now what I have to do here for the remaining time is a little more of some mathematical preparation for what I'm going to do next. What I'm going to do next is to go to higher dimensions and we got to make sure we all know some of the mathematical ideas connected with higher dimensions. So I'm going to start off with some things and this is like a mathematical interlude. Again, I told you if you're not strong on some of these things, you should read this math book I mentioned to you on basic training. We'll certainly cover these topics, but you don't have to have that. I'm going to tell you now how to do it. So the math idea that I'm going to use this really a mathematical digression to make sure everybody knows. They're very simple things, but we do it all the time in physics. So I want to make sure you guys can also do that. So let's take some function ffx that looks like this. This is f of x,

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       this is x.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       And let's say you start here at some point x and I'm going to go to the nearby point x Plus Delta X. Delta x is exaggerated so you can see it, so it's actually in the end going to be a very small number.

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       The question is what is the change in the function in going from here to here so we all know what it is that is a change in the function.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       We are going to need approximations to the change of the function.

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       Useful approximation is to say, let's put it on the function as a straight line and keeps going with the slope it had to begin with.

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       You can see that if the function is not curving up or down two months, you almost got the right change in f and what does that change in f? That change in f is the derivative of the functions at the point x times the change in x.

Speaker 3:          00:58:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:58:31       but it is not an equality is not inequality because that is this little guy on the top that you have missed because the function is not following the same slope that you have to begin with. It's curving up. So let's take a concrete example. Suppose ffx is equal to x squared, then F of x Plus Delta x is x squared plus two x Delta x plus Delta x squared. Therefore the change in after you got to take her to the other side, pain change your Naf is two x Delta x plus Delta x squared, two x Delta Act two x is of course what you realize is the delivery. We have to function at that point and that's giving you this part, but that's a tiny portion on the top which is delta x squared that you're not getting the function as x cube at x to the fourth that hyperbolic Karsh affects. That'll be more editors, but the point is the change in the function has the leading piece that's proportional delta x. Then the correction that we say mathematically are of higher order in Delta x,

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       so you've dealt, the x is made very small but not zero. Then it a bit of useful formula to know that the change in function and going from one point to another point is this rate of change times to change. I don't think anything could be more natural than that, but we should be comfortable by saying, uh, it's natively. People say, well, you should do that because in calculus you're canceling this delta x with that dx. That's not what we're really doing. We all know that the Stanford a certain limit, but the limit stance literally for the slope, which is at that point, so he functions had only one slope and they never changed the slope and he knew that slope. Then if you know the value to begin with, you can find the value of miles away from where you are because it's going at the same clip. But most functions, of course we'll change the slope and for that reason the Fed will be an error in the formula you get if you use this. But if delta x is very, very small and it's your end, is your intention in the end to make very, very tiny delta axes, then we say we will use this approximate.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       That's pretty simple, but it's very useful to know. So let's take a example of this function. Have this rule because I'm going to use it all the time. So one example is f of x is equal to one plus x

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       to the N.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       Well f one

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       it's just one.

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       Suppose you go to a nearby point which is x away from the 0.1. So this x is really like your delta x. Then the change of the function, we be DF DX at the 0.1 times the change in x. Yes, I'm sorry. Ah, okay. That's right. F of zero if you like. If x is equal to zero, the function as a value one.

Speaker 3:          01:02:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       Then if you go to the neighboring point, so here's what I'm saying, function. There's something, it's a value. Here is one and I wanted to go to a nearby point, which I'm calling x. Then dfds do you know is n times one plus x to the n minus one same sex, but do you have to evaluate it at x equals zero so this goes away. Then you get an x. So the tangent, the function, this function as you move off x equals zero is annex. So what we're saying then is one plus x raised to the n is one plus n x plus tiny numbers. If x is small, that is the videos for the zone. If something looked like one plus x raised to a power, and if you're not going too far from the 0.1, namely Fedex is very small, then don't bother with doing the whole one plus x times one plus x and times it's approximately equal to one plus annex.

Speaker 3:          01:03:14       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       So let me give you one example. You will, we'll use this later on. According to relativity, a master for particle is given by this.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       It's a body sitting still. It has certain mass, Newtonian mechanics. We say the mass is the mass and left at the end of the activity. You don't have to know the audits in of this. That will be taught to you in due course, but it just says particle to the velocity have a mass different from when they are at addressed and this is the velocity and sees the velocity of light. This is the exact formula. No, most of the time you don't care about it because we oversee maybe 10 to the minus 10 and a square of that standard. The minus 20 and one minus certain number is negligible and be just put it as one. Suppose you want an answer that's good too. Some accuracy. I will write this as follows. This m zero times one minus B squared overseas square to the power minus one half. You agree that's what a squid or in the bottom is. It's this power upstairs. Now we can write it as fall asm zero. This is one plus x to the N. Okay, so the x that we use is minus B squared overseas square and the end that we use is minus a half.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       that's what I'm using in this formula x is minus B squared overseas square and n, which is the power to with embracing is minus half. Therefore, this is equal to one plus B squared over two c square plus corrections with a negligible if v squared over c squared is very small. This is a bit useful result. It tells you the mass variation is that it's the mass at rest plus m zero be square or two squares. A very useful formula. Sometimes this formula is much more friendly to use than the formula. You cannot beat the exact formula. It's the exact truth. But if you're interested in that exact function for small values of v Oversee, it's much more useful to you as this approximation.

Speaker 3:          01:05:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       and you will have lot of problems like this in your homework now or later everywhere else. So if I'm going to use it all the time, I should tell you what is this. So let me summarize what I've told you so far. First result is if a function is known at a certain point and you want an orange value at a nearby point, what are you supposed to do that's not so hard to guess, right? For example, their tuition costs are so much this year at Yale and we know how much is going up every year. You can make a guess on what there'll be a year from now. Of course, in reality it will be higher than that because there are these other terms, but that's the best guests you would make. That's how we predict the future by looking at past rates of chains. That's pretty normal. The point is that you can predict the tuition a year from now, maybe, but maybe not five years from now or 10 years from now because there's inflation on top of inflation.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       That's like saying the rate of change itself has a rate of change. The slope here is not the same as a slope dead. That's what the higher derivatives of the function do for you. So I will conclude by telling you one last result, which I'm not going to prove in this course and you guys should uh, learn from the math department the following result. That is some crazy function. Okay, listen ffx I want to know what it is at the point x, I know what it is at the origin. If I know nothing else, how do I predict the future value of x? Meaning for other wrecks, I don't know my best guesses. Well, this the number I knew that's what is going to do, but if I knew its rate of change here, you know it's slow slope here. The next guest is the of it to of f at the origin time. Sex. That just what I did earlier. Instead of Delta X, I'm calling it x. If x is small enough, it'll work, but of course x need not be small. If it gets bigger, it turns out you can do a little better by adding this is the second derivative of the function or the origin times x square and you can go on adding more and more terms. I'll just add one more term, which is three factorial times d cubed, x f over D, x cubed times x cubed. This goes on forever

Speaker 1:          01:07:52       and it says that if you knew every deliver to where the function or the origin, you can reconstruct the function, not just infinitesimally close to it, but as far as you want to go that are some mathematical restrictions on this because there are infinite number of terms in this thing. When you add them all up, you may get infinity, which would be nonsense, so he's really sum up this infinite number of terms. If they add to finite number and if they do that, we'll give you the function here. What we have done is to just use the first two terms as an approximation or what what I'm telling you, there's is something called the Taylor expansion of a function that allows you to know the function. Even here macroscopically far from here, if you knew all the date of it is and if you put those data natives here and if the some added up to something finite, that finite thing is the value of the function or the new point.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       Here's an example. You guys can take ffx equals e to the x. Why don't you go home and work out the cities for Ffx at all points? You've got to remember that either the x has the beauty that it did have it. It was either the exit itself and its value or the origin of every delivered with simply one, so this just becomes one plus x plus x squared over two factorial. That is in fact the expression for these are the x and it turns out that no matter how big xs the some in fact adds up to find that number that we call e to the x in particular. What is he itself? He itself is either the one he is either the one support x equaled one. You get one plus one plus one square over two factorial plus one cubed over three factorial. You do all that, you get two point something, something, right? That's e. So this is a very powerful notion. If you knew all the derivatives of a function, you can predict there's value in not only the tiny neighborhood put over the big distance. If you knew the first derivative and you were not very ambitious, look, the logic is very simple. If x is a tiny number, x squared is even Tinier at Xq blood. Even tiny. We got no respect for these terms. We disrupt them and we stop here.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       Okay, I'll have something more to say about this later on, but for now, these ideas will be useful for what we're doing next time.
