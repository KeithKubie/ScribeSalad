00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.880
A powerful category of connector are arbitrators.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.220
These are primarily responsible for facilitation services, but

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.300
because they can redirect control there's also a coordination service they

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.820
provide. You might be able to use them to negotiate service levels.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.590
That is how much resources are being devoted to a particular problem.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.200
Hence they support reliability and atomicity, scheduling and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.020
load balancing, trapping of faults and even synchronization.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.790
Some of the variations for arbitrator connectors include how they handle faults.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.250
Typically with a simple arbitrator scheme, there's a single decision made but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.290
more complex systems might involve a voting scheme. That is if there are three

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.520
arbitrators around, they would have to vote on the course of action and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.560
the majority would rule. How concurrency is dealt with. The mechanism is it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.880
semi fours, a rendezvous, monitors, locks there's lots of approaches to this.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.900
And whether it's a light weight approach or a heavy weight approach.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.230
Variations involved with transactions such as whether they're simple or

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.246
they're nested. Whether the arbitrator is there if you need it or is required.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:20.300
And whether the arbitrator supports reads, writes, or both. And

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.760
then a major category of, of capabilities and variation of arbitrators involves

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.600
security. Authentication, authorization, screening, durability that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.860
is how long the particular decision last. Is it a single session, or

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.860
is it a multi session? And then the scheduling of the arbitrator activities.
