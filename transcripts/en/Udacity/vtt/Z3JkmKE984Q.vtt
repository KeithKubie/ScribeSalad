00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's look at another attack called the DNS

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.300
amplification attack. This attack exploits the asymmetry in

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.010
size between DNS queries and their responses. So

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.650
an attacker might send a DNS query for a

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.320
particular domain, and that query might only be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.230
60 bytes. In sending the query, however, the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.820
attacker might indicate that the source. For this

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.320
query is some victim IP address. Thus the resolver

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.640
might send a reply which is nearly two

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.860
orders of magnitude larger to a victim. So the

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.510
name of the attack amplification comes from the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.050
fact that the query is only 60 bytes and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.180
a reply is considerably larger. So, by simply

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.750
generating a small amount of initial traffic, the attacker

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.030
can cause the DNS resolver. To generate a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.370
significantly larger amount of attack traffic. If we start

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.110
adding other attackers, all of which specify

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.000
the victim as the source, then all of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.330
these giant replies start heading towards the victim,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.450
and we have a denial of service attack

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.080
on the victim. Two possible defenses against

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.770
this attack are to prevent IP address spoofing

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.550
in the first place using, for example, the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.630
appropriate filtering rule or to disable the ability

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.450
for a DNS resolver to resolve queries from arbitrary locations on the Internet.
