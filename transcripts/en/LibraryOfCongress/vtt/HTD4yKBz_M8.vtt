&gt;&gt; Marcelo Magnou: It is
my great honor and pleasure

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.330
to introduce Dr. Roberto Canessa

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.260
and Pablo Vierci's book
"I Had to Survive."

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.340
I'm also especially
pleased to note that we have

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.030
with us Roberto Canessa's wife
Lauri and his eldest son, Hilario,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.180 position:56%
Pablo Vierci's wife, Sandra, friends
and former classmates of Roberto

who have come all the
way from South America

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.360
to accompany him this afternoon.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.020
I would like to thank
the organizers,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590
especially Marie Arana

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.430

support and the volunteers

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.450
who make this book
festival possible.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.560
This book is very special
and has touched our hearts.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.350
This tells about the
ultimate value of life.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.670
And how Dr. Roberto
Canessa fight for survival

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.690
in the Andes had made him a fighter
for his most precious patients,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.290
his unborn and newborn
infant with congenital

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.910
and life threatening heart
conditions and the struggle

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.270
to save those precious lives and
to accompany them through time.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.570
It also reveal how the cooperation
between doctors around the world

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.180
and hospitals in the United
States and in Uruguay organize

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.360
to save them, fighting
against all odds.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.260
I forgot how many times
I have bought this book

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.490
since its publication last March.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.840 position:56%
First, I bought it for myself, but
then also for friends and to members

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.360
of the press and to teachers
who wanted to share this story

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.700
with their students,
which is without doubt,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.910
our one of the most
incredible in human history.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.730
Later on, with my friends' feedback
and story of sleepless nights

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.070
and sorrowful crying, I
realized that my relationship

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.590
with my friends grew stronger and
that thanks to this wonderful book,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.870 position:56%
my friends got to know the
Uruguayan spirit, of always fighting

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.340
to the end, of never giving
up, of solidarity and humanism,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.710
that can be seen in our soccer,
but also in the dedication

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.530
of our UN peacekeepers, and
our commitment in the defense

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.480
and promotion of human
rights and democracy.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.570
This book has become my dearest
friend and my favorite gift.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.510
I hope it would become the gift
you can give to your family members

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.930
and your friends, and
share this moving story.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.730
I feel it can help to
enliven our communities,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.240
promoting mutual help
and social harmony.

that the protein in the corpses

this was an enormously famous

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.890
of those scenes from the

after all this time,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.010
why did you decide to
write this book now?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.750
Which is more than the incident
and the rescue but the nonetheless.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.320
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Because I feel that this was

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.640
like an experimenting
thing about behavior.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.340 position:56%

once all the sadness is gone

and all the feelings are gone,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.460
I believe that some
malicious hand decided to,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.520
instead of putting guinea
pigs, put human beings

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.970
that don't know the snow because
in their way there are no snow.

see they are so machos and so tough.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.330
may God bless their souls
and see what happens.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.540
What's the bottom line of this
is what happened, who survives,

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.750
who fails is-- doesn't survive--

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.010

person that have will to leave.

The people that enjoy life and
have attitude everyday to survive.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.560
And there are 16 survivors,
so there are 16 formulas,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.270
we are a little different,
we have some things in common

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.170
but we have different things.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.510
And I think that this is a
legacy for human behavior

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.620
because until our plane crashes,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.220
we don't realize what
is important in life.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.080
We don't realize what we
really care, we don't realize

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.010

the things we get in life and yeah.

&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: But your story
has been told many times,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.500
why did you decided--
decide to tell it now?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.780
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Because
when speaking with Pablo Vierci

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.560
and Pablo has the studies
of psychology,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.710
he was telling me Roberto, aren't
you seeing that still you're going

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.230
through the line of life and
death, that you're still going

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.190
with patients, there are
newborns that they want to survive

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.680
and that you are devoted
to life and to death.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.700
Oh come on Pablo, this is my life.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.090
No, no, no, no, there's
something hidden there.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.620
You are looking at the window, the
fuselage to life and you're looking

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.340
at the screen of the echo machine
and your time to make survive,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.310
kids that never survive in Uruguay.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.250
I say, hmm, there's
something going in there.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.650
I think Pablo, you should interview
the mothers of the patients,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.590
but I shouldn't be there.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.690
So he says, this is an
incredible information

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.500
that should be written,
should be testimony.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.050
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You remind
me that the structure

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.090
of the book is interesting because
it begins in detail with the crash

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:30.080
and the fact that you and your
companions were there for 70 days

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:39.110
in the High Valley in the Andes and
then you and one other walked out

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:45.880
and eventually got the rest
of the survivors rescued.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.200
You see, you go through that
but then you go back and forth

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.920 position:56%
with the reactions, what your father
was going through at that time

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.440
that you were gone,
or your wife to be.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:06.870
And then you eventually go to
some of your patients and some

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.240
of the officers who have to--

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.710
who were trying to
rescue you at that time.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.800
Why did you decide to
structure the book that way,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.580
instead of just going, you know,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.130
straight autobiography,
this is my life.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.590
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Because as
they were speaking with my son

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.830
and he said, daddy, your
Catholic education is the chapel,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.080
this is the cross, you
go straight in the line

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.990
of time and there's the altar.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.590
But the other religions where
their churches are round,

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.250
and I think that life goes
round and I think that I was

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.830 position:56%
in the Andes survivors, I was in
the plane crash, I was touching down

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.940
and then I go back to suffering,
to life and death and to patients.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.720
I believe that although
times goes bye,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.710
you go always to your inner feeling

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.940
and your identification
toward in life.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:02.940
I think you're like a
potentiation of how you are.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.750
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You have and
have had a full rich life,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:15.360
how a part of your life-- I mean
how often do you think of this?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.530
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: As long
as people ask me about it.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.480
I mean I feel like Frank Sinatra,
I think singing New York, New York

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.040 position:56%
or Mercedes Sosa Thank you for Life.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.160 position:56%
And I like-- I mean I remember
about the people in the audience get

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.220
to cry so I think this is
something I can transmit to people

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.840 position:56%
and makes them good for their heart.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.070
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: So I'll remind
you, you wrote the book, so--

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:43.390
so you clearly-- so they're going
to keep asking you about it,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.730
like we are talking--
like we're talking now.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.080
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yes, yes.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.560
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Do you think-- do
you still think of the incident?

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.940
I mean you have a wonderful
family and a wonderful practice

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.070
and you have a as I said,
a full life otherwise.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:06.010
How much did this define
what came after?

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.220
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Well, I
learned that your plane might crash

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.900
and in life, there
have many crashes.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.010
Every time a patient of mine
dies, I feel the same thing

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.460
as my friends were dying
in the mountain, you know.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.450 position:56%
And many times that they survive and
they-- my patients come and hug me,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.070
I feel I'm hugging the survivors
when we reach the shepherd

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.050
because we did it on ourselves.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:37.010
And this selfness of teamwork is a
delicious sensation you might have.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.260
We human beings must get
together into medical team works,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.320
into family team works and
then the joy would be bigger

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.450
because we all share
the feeling of trying

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.400
to get things better
out of our lives.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.150
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: It sounds like
this has form pretty much--

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.400
and why wouldn't it
form your view of life.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, of course.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.440
One day I was dying and
there was a shepherd

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.770
that he wouldn't left his
cattle even in his birthday

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.400
because the pumas might
eat his-- their calf.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.210
And he just left everything
to help a person

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.200
that he never saw in your life.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.170
And we live in this
civilized society,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.940
that if someone drops dead
nearby you, you push the side

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.280
in case that he might touch you.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.810
So there are lots of things that
you-- we must rethink as a society.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.450
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: The shepherd being
the person who came to your--

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.920
the first person you saw.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.740
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: The person we
got in touch after 72 days of no--

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.480
of not seeing any human beings.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You sort of
touched on it in there the most sort

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:54.500
of famous part of this whole thing
was the necessity to consume--

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.490
to eat parts of those who had died.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:03.060
It was a necessity.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.360
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yes, yes.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.850
I mean I think there are two--

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.510
another fascinating aspects is we
have to create a different society

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.870
in the mountains, a society
where you have to make your own--

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:18.370
your own clothe, your own warmth,
your own water and your own food.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.230
And I love the simplistic approach
of people that were not there

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.630
and say, oh guys, you are
the ones that were saved

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.100
because you-- you ate
the dead people.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.820
And after eating our dead friends--

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.700
was a terrible problem
and a terrible step ahead

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.200
and something, we only bought time.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.890
And let me tell you, it became
part of our everyday society.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.790
And no one would-- at the beginning
yes, it was like first actual--

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.370
sexual relation that this thing
that the world is going to stop

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.690
and then life goes on and
sense of humor was very,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.730
very important ingredient
in this experiment.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.380
And I remember very vividly
a friend that said, if I die

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.750
and you don't eat me, I'll come
back and step in your head.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.660
And I say, no one is
going to eat you

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.440
because we don't want
to get poisoned.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.010
Imagine eating you guy.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.600
[ Laughter ]

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.770
So, and this is something
I learned in the mountains

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.390
to treat huge things with
a very simple attitude

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.720
because at sometimes, too much
pressures makes you ineffective.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.860
But really in this story, my
son when he was 4 years old,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.770
another body came around
and said, yeah,

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.030
because your daddy ate his friends.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.110
Yeah, didn't you know about it?

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.270
Yeah, the muscles of my father
were getting weak and the muscles

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.380
of the ones that dead, they didn't
need them and they were strong

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.390
so he had the muscles in order
that he could get, that's it.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.420
And I believe, we make
our life too much complex.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.750
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Can you-- so
right, this was very simple--

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.490
difficult but simple decision
to make because you have to.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.790
Since then, I'm curious
as to whether it has taken

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.890
on a deeper meaning for you as a--

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:06.410
I don't know, as a almost
a sacrament I guess or a--

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.280
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: The deeper
feeling is that I wanted

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.980
to ring the bell of the families
of the boys that were left

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.120
in the mountain and
tell them the truth.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.230
I want to say face to
face what had happened.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.090
They had the right not to judge me
because they're considered as dead.

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.530
So what [inaudible]
consider you were dead.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.480
But I had to go to their families

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.410
and the toughest thing were this
Nicola [assumed spelling] boys,

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.030
four boys, they were left in
school, their parents had died.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.750
And this kid thought me, Roberto,
if I would have been there,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.420
I would have walked with you.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.100
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Would you say
they thought you were dead,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.400
that was so long that you
were gone that they had--

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.280
that nobody thought
you were still alive.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.100
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Well at 10
days, we had our little radio,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.010
that search had been called off.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.780
So society had declared us dead
and then I had a very brave friend

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.000
that he said, Roberto, I have good
news, the decision and the dilemma

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.110
of waiting to be rescued or
going for a rescue is over.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.920
If we don't get up
ourselves, we will be dead.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.930
And from that on, I
learned that in life,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.140
you shouldn't wait
for the helicopters.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.930
We had to go walking to
tell them the helicopters

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:22.620
where our friends were.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:28.050
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Very few people
who are in a plane crash survive,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:34.450 position:56%
much less survive the length of time
after and yet you have been back

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:40.340
to the site six times, I mean
some people would have, you know,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.310
never wanted to see it again and
you've taken your children back.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.610
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.910
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Why?

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.850
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: It took me some
time, and I said, well I'm here.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.840
And then I saw the people
in the concentration camps,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.500
that they would go back to
the place we were and I have

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.960
to overcome the suffering.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.970
And then when I was there with
my sons, I felt the survivor,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.340
the people that had died were
laughing at me and saying, hey,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.650
Roberto, what a belly
you have grown,

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.530
you look like an old man,
you don't have no shame.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.590
And I would tell them, yes,
but I have my sons here

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.080
that they want them to meet you.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.070
And then my daughter said, daddy,
this is a very sad place but has

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.050
such a tremendous energy
and it's true,

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.830
it's a place that had
a very strong energy.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.130
Miracles happen there.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.510 position:56%
I have seen New York lawyers crying.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.860
You think--

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.900
[ Laughter ]

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.100
-- a lawyer can cry?

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.460
They were crying there.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.510
[ Laughter ]

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.010
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Why would you
take a New York lawyer there?

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.310
[ Laughter ]

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.420
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: He was there.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.790
He went by himself.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.170
He went by himself.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.390
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: OK.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.900
What's-- so you became-- you were
a medical student at that time.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.200
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.970
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: And you became
a pediatric cardiologist.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.270
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Mm-hmm.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.040
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Why did
you decide on that route?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.050
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Well, my father
was a professor in cardiology

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.530
and I was doing cardiac
catheterization

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.550
and there was another physician
doing a newborn heart diseases

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.480
and I was very attracted by these

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.340
because in newborns are
wrongly assembled from life

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.830
and elder people have
rotten coronary arteries

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.690
because they're small, they
are fat, all the things I do

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.640
and this newborns, you
could change some part

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.040
of their heart and
they were set off.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.230
So I thought that was a
great challenge at that time,

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.570
the 3-dimension electrocardiography
came out,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.980
and I could see their hearts and I
could see the hearts in their wombs

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.990
of the mother and this
kind of fascinated me.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Is there a
connection for you in what you chose

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.370
to do and what happened to you?

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.670
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: I thought there
wasn't but apparently, the life

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.950
and death line is something
I want to challenge.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.250
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Interesting.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.000
Do you believe in-- I'm
asking you a deep question.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.160
Do you believe in fate
or do you believe

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.850
in chance or something in between?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.570
Why did some people
survived, why not others,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.580
why are some of your patients
surviving and not others?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.880
What is your outlook?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.370
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: I don't in
life, what matters are chances,

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.720
what matters are choices.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.470
It's what you choose, not what
happens to you and I believe

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.560 position:56%
that some parents made an incredible
effort to go and get their surgery

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.980
down abroad in the states
and their-- get their life.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.610 position:56%
And someone didn't have the money or
didn't have the strength to do that

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.950
and their kids died in Uruguay.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.260
So we have our heart
foundation there in Uruguay

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.300
which we are helping and
trying to race the level.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.470
Probably in school,
we learned very soon

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.550
when the Christian brothers
told that the in rugby,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.140
the referee is always right.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.460
And I said, that's unfair and he
told me, who told you life is fair?

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.270
We must take life as it comes
and we must take these realities

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.320
and handle them that way.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.120
Yeah, probably you're
right, it's fate.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.420
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Do you think?

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.950
I mean from here in your
answer, I get the sense

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.390
that what you're saying
is there are circumstances

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.010
and then there are what
we do with circumstances.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.980
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, there's
a certain leverage that you can do

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.650
and while there's life,
there's hope.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.210
And this is something that the
society of the snow we used.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.240
Where there's life is
hope and maybe tomorrow.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.720
Though things don't make sense
in this everyday life and we are

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.240
so powerful and we have the car and
see the CR condition is very bad

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.430
and I believe that all this matter
realism makes us spiritually

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.730
very poor.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.750 position:56%
This is-- separate us from spiritual
life, all this material burden

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:55.130
which we are immersed and we
cannot see the real lights.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:01.890
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: And you called
the group the society of the snow?

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.190
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: The
brothers of the Andes.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.490
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: The
brothers of the Andes.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.790
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.090
But we got very contaminated,
you know.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.930
We came seeing what is
going to tell our society,

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.390
what is going to tell the pope
and then oh guys, you're heroes.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.670
No, we are just dirty people
and no two months, no--

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.630
washing each other,
eating each other.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.490
No, no, you're heroes,
you're heroes.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.750
Yeah, do you think
so, we are heroes.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.430
Oh yeah, maybe we are
the heroes of the Andes.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.490
But that's better hero
than you are hero.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.080
No, no, we are all heroes.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.390
So it was completely contaminated
the story of us but the version

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.460
of society, so I think
we just should keep pure

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.600
when a man is fate
to death and to fate.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.630
And that real-- the tools

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.580
of the Andes are the
things I want to transmit.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.270
What do you resource and
what you should learn in--

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.750
and the force of life is not
how you do things but why.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.170
The real force is why.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.600
When you have a reason for doing
something then you will find how

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.900
to do it.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.350
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Speaking of
how the world looks at this,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.620
so what do you think of the-- this
was originally made most famous

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.650
by the book Alive and then the
movie that was made from it.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.520
What do you think of it?

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.820
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: At the
beginning, we're complaining

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.410
because the book didn't
transmit what were there.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.640
And then we had to learn than a
book never transmits what happened.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.620
And then what is the reality,
when you thought you were there,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.580
what your friend thought
was happening there

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.120
and then I realize this is
like the story of the Titanic

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.720
that there are many windows to look
at it, there's a window version,

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.220 position:56%
there's an author version, there's--
there are the many ways of looking

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.700
to this human experiment
behavior that was our tragedy.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.500
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Did anything
pleased you about the book in movie

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.660
or anything that made you
anything in particular or anything

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.550
that make you particularly angry?

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.130
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: No, I think
that everything adds to the story

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.520
and gives you a sight
of what happened.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.940
I would the say the Disney
film is like a documentary

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.670
of the feelings we
had on the mountain.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.640
I would say that Piers Paul Read,
the book Alive is a documentary

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.980
of what happened, of the narration
of what happened and besides that,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.800
every new book has the chances
of getting all the results

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.450
of previous books, you know.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.380
It's like an upgrade.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.350
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: What--
you also have--

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.410
you also have a reunion every year.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.710
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah,
we have a gathering,

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.500
the first one with the
girlfriends where we're like 32.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.140
And last year, we're 180 with
all the grandsons and everything

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.210
so the society of Andes
procreated very happily.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.050
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: I was going to
ask you how things have changed,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:47.000
where you sort of told me over
the years, have things mellowed

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.270
like in anything, your
attitudes toward what happened

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.350
or is it still fresh in your mind.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.850
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Oh, I know that
your plane might crash any moment

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.090
and then we should be more
thankful and that we receive

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.770
from life are lots
more than what we need

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.780
and we do lots less in what we can.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.830
And we don't know what
is really horrible.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.890
I mean for me, jail is
lot better than the Andes.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.110
While you're in jail, you
have water, you had food.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.260 position:56%
And then there was-- telling that
the people in jail that they weren't

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.970
that bad and that's something
I learn in the mountain.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.890
I mean we're struggling
there, having horrible time,

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.870
we couldn't think that
we could be worst

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.970
and then avalanche came
in and even more died.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.560
Then I learned that until you're
dead, you can always get worst

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.090
but you can always get better.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.700
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: And then
you went into politics.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.330
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.650
[ Laughter ]

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:42.950
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Porque?

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.250
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Well, because I said if--

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.980
I said there are known politicians,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.240
they are [inaudible] well I put my
being known person at the service

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.810
of politics and see if we can get a
place in the senate and everything.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.730 position:56%
So and the people were
complaining but why ask him to join.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.730
And they say, well, you
know, this is horrible.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.550
I'm a good friend of this
congressman and I cannot fail to--

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.610
so I think the people's
speech is really perverted.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.850
They say something but
they act in some way else.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.840
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You're
talking about politician?

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.710
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: No,
no I'm talking about--

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.510
politicians are the
reflection of the voters.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.210
And we are the worst, the
voters and we blame them

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.910 position:56%
and then change the vote and then we
are just sitting seeing the match.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.950 position:56%
Hey, why did you tackle him, why did
you kill the ball but it's different

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.460
when you're in the field.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:41.090
And in that sense, and in politics,
I learned a lot, I learned a lot.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.690
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You learned
a lot but you didn't stay on.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:48.700
You decided to stick
more with your--

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.020
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Well, I had one
of my greatest chances in my life

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.260
because my wife said, if you
continue politics, I will divorce.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.190
So I had to choose then, then
you have to put lots of money

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:03.430
in the campaign and people
are asking you for money

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.860
to open a new club there
and it's a different world

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.340
and thing from outside.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.280
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You
know, I know we're--

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.050
we want to live a good
10 minutes for questions.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.270
Are we getting close or
we still get some time?

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.570
Hmm? Oh, OK.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.870
So just a few more.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.380
All right.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.440
You-- one of things that--

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.680
so my experience reading the
book was I got really engrossed

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.520
in the crash and the survival
and everything and then you sort

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.160
of brought, like I said,
you broadened it out

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:48.240 position:56%
and wove everybody else together and
then by the time you sort of end up,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.020
you are trying to-- you say that
you-- that there are common threads

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.690
and common moments in your life.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.760
Would you share some of those?

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.060
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yes.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.140
I think there's like a
titanium and steel link

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.590
with the patients, you know.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.360
And a family you never saw
in your life and comes to you

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.950
with a purest thing that
is a disease of their kids,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.110
and then you're on the boat
trying to give them home

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.550
and to realize what's going on
and that's a link of knowing

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.340
that some things are apparently
impossible, they are not.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.160
And that you can achieve results
and then you're struggling here

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:36.070
with these kids and they begin to
succeed and to grow and to tell you

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.410
that they-- that their mother
should put their faces in the book

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.920
because the mother
to protect the kids,

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.510
they would say I don't
want your face in your book

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.110
and then their kids which is 12
years old, there's the mother,

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.370
how couldn't I be in
Roberto's book, mommy.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.980
He saved my life.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.840
And then I get to learn
about these kids.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.890
And say, you know, mommy
doesn't let me read the book

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.910
but I steal from her.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.220
And why do you like the book?

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.520
This is a book for grownups.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.820
No Roberto, this book
teaches me to be brave.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.910
And then I find that
that was right--

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.590
a 12-year-old that got
six surgeries there

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.170
in Boston [inaudible]
best one in the world.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.040
The doctor was saying we
must cross our fingers.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.920
And the mother was calling me, we
didn't come to cross the fingers,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.050
we come here to get the child cure.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.550
Well, I mean there are limits.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.900
Medicine is not magic.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.870
And then she comes around and
hugs me and it's delicious.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.170
It's great.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.820
I knew I was doing the right thing.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.500
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: You did the--
you interviewed the patients?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.800
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: No, not at all.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.100
Pablo didn't allow me, he said,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.590
this is going to be very
sweet and very sticky.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.250
We don't want something like that
with something that is objective.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.900
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: So you
interviewed the patients?

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:56.610
Ah, OK. And what about your wife
and your kids and your father,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.060
who interviewed them for the book.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.360
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Pablo.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.660
So and it's great because you know

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.690
that your sons are your
principal detractors, you know.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.540 position:56%
The other first ones and telling you
what you are not doing correctly.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.640
They will copy from you all
the defects, they won't copy

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.420
that you wake up at 6 o'clock
in the morning until they need

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.590
to do it because they have sons.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.220
So, and I think it was good.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.990
In that time my parents died,

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.530
so we had the chance of
processing that part.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.160
And so this human experiment when
they do in the Andes guinea pig

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:34.070
and in life then how children look
at him, then how your parents died.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:39.030
And I'm very proud of what Pablo
and I performed in this book.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.910
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: So you thin Pablo
got more of the truth out of your--

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.210
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: History.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.510
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: History.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.810
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: History.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.110
There are many truth--

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.410
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Very good.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.710
Very good.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.010
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: There's a difference
between the truth and the fact.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.610
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.910
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Yes.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.210
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.510
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Anything
funny that--

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.310
because the moments of humor
in this situation seemed

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.300
to be few and far between.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Well, there were
colds in the Andes, on the society

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.870
of the snow that if you
have something sad to say,

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.920
you wouldn't say it
and you would hook

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.520
in to the dreams of other person.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.030
When we will go back,
will make a restaurant

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.790
and we'll-- back with many things.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:25.170
Another thing is that irritation
and fighting each other is a cost,

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.630
a price cost when you are
performing great things,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.300
successful things always
have friction.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.830
You must know that good sense
of humor consider a friction

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.440
as an operative cost in life, these
are the great lessons in the--

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.990 position:56%
from the mountain, don't look at the
mountain, look at your next step.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.890
If you look at the mountain,
you will be intimidated.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.850
I mean there are lots of things
and my favorite one is when I look

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:56.810
to myself to the mirror and I
said the same jerk as always.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:01.090
Don't ever buy that you are
millimeter better than anyone.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.170
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: So,
it's times for questions

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.260
but I have one last quick one.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.100 position:56%
What food were you thinking of most?

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.800
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Sweet, sweet food.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:15.210
Dulce de leche is something which
in Uruguay and the discussion was--

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:20.390
it was dulce de leche ice cream
or dulce de leche by the spoon

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.450
because the ice cream was better

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.220
because you could feel the
ice cream falling in the side

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.320
of your mouth as you have too much.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.750
That was a dream and I
use to dream that I was

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.640
in a pastry sweetness there
and then I couldn't go

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.020
in because there was a glass.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.510
I mean it's horrible, horrible.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:45.210
[ Laughter ]

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.240
You go--

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.540
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.840
Thank you so much for coming.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:55.050
Of the survivors of the crash,
in the end, 16 made it off.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.640
And one of the older ones,
much older was Javier Methol.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.170
And I was checking for
researchers trying to determine,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.950
is he still with us and are the
other 14 also all still with us

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.600
and how many make their reunion?

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.380
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Javier died last year--

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.680
&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sorry.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.980
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: -- of cancer.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.720
And there are still 15 alive.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.320
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: You're welcome.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.080
&gt;&gt; As we hear you talk about--

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.330
this wasn't an experience
that should be seen as heroism

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.600
and your extract these
meanings out, I wonder though

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.120 position:56%
if the alternative were for you have
led a very safe and sanitized life

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.830 position:56%
in gated community or not experience
any adversity or challenge.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.410
Would that have made
you a different person?

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.870
Are there gifts that came
out of the adversity,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.950
the shared experience that you had?

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.640
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yes, this tells
you that your plane might crash.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.530
I think there were some lessons.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.380
The price was too high to
pay to live in a graveyard

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:59.590
for two months was terrible, but I
learned just not to get into crisis

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.040
and not to get so stressed
when really,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.750
the circumstances are
not worthy for it, yeah.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.210
And to care for the
simple things of life

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.250
that are most important
ones and we forget.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.190
I was missing my house,
the smells of my house,

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.000
those are the most precious

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.330
and we don't realize
them until we lose them.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.180
Yeah.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.090
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for
the candid explanation

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.710
on the strength shown back there.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.200
I have a question, when you are
actually initiating the trip

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.240
across the Andes, the-- with the
three people, I think you mentioned

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.560
that you get to the top of the
mountain and you saw on one side

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.070 position:56%
to the east side, the Argentina side
that you saw like a line that looked

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:43.150
like a road, and but still you
decided to actually go across.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.610
What made you guys
decide to actually go

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.860
through the other way rather
than the shorter way to the east.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.940
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Because to the
Argentinian side was uncertain.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.910
This was [inaudible] and we worry--

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.740
in the fuselage, there was a
mountain but as we climb higher,

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.290
you could see the two roads there.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.340
And Nando said, Roberto,
we are not going

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.080
to go back, this is very tough.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.060
And on the other hand,
it was more certain

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.310
that in 60 kilometers,
there was a railroad.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.620 position:56%
And we know this-- that the sun sets
to the west and to the west is Chile

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.710
and that means a 100,000
steps and this is more certain

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.730
than the other think which was
more vague and maybe there were--

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.770
there are desertic parts in
Mendoza and maybe we could get

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.480
into this desert parts
and maybe not have water.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.610
There was the idea of taking
something very sure and instead

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.920 position:56%
of something that would look easier.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.290
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.300
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about the pilot sir.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.070
Having 40 years, past 40 years
about-- from the accident,

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.530
is it different in your opinion
that haven't done now what is now

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.390
with them was-- because
it was a human mistake.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:57.000 position:56%
I mean what is your vision nowadays?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.310
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa:
Well, the vision is

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.850
that after we have the plane
crash, we went to the pilot

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:04.460
to ask him where were we.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.210
And he said, we passed Curico.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.420
And if you look to Chile,
there was a huge mountain

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.680
on that side, so he was wrong.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.100
So I learned that some time, very
specialized people make mistakes

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.110
so that you shouldn't
follow them especially

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.110
when they made a mistake before.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:25.400
This is what I learned that experts
sometimes cannot be so truthful.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.950
And then I met some of his
family and old people there

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.590
and this was a terrible mistake and
there is association of mistakes

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.230
that land to an accident.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.530
It's not only one thing.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.880
It's many things.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you sir.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.480
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: You're welcome.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.190
&gt;&gt; I wanted to share something.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.490
I move to this country from
Chile when I was 7 years old.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:52.370 position:56%
And I remember the front page of the
Washington Post with the accident.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:57.220
I was young but my uncle
was one of the doctors,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.610
he was doing his residency in San
Fernando and I brought a picture

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:06.750
of Eduardo [inaudible] who went up
and took your vitals and so I've--

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.050
he's always-- he goes
to your reunions.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.460
And I see-- I haven't seen him in
three years but whenever I travel

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.990
to Chile and I see the Andes, I
think of you, I wonder how you did

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:25.850
that and it keeps me from trying
to complain too much about things

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.790
but I also brought some
calugas from Chile.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.590
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Thank
you very much, thank you.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:36.510
[ Applause ]

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:43.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.060
Thank you very much.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.600
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Wonderful.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.900
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.200
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Anybody else?

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.670
&gt;&gt; Yes. One of my favorite parts
of the book was when you spoke of

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.400
or you wrote about
your father in the taxi

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.630
and when he found out
you were alive.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.120
And I'm just wondering since
the publication of the book,

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.270
has the identity of the taxi
driver ever come to fruition?

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.530
Have you ever been able to figure
out who that taxi driver was?

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, it's
mystery and we never saw him before.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.140
Maybe, we should try and get him
or maybe he's not around anymore.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.050
I mean it's 44 years.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.570
But it's incredible the
story of that accident.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.470
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: Do
you want to explain?

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.770
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.760
When they went on the search,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.190
when C-47 which is a Second
World War plane and the plane--

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.870
one of the engines was always
stopping and nearly crashing,

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:39.240
so my father was coming back to
Uruguay and they landed in Mendoza.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.030
And he took a bus to
go back to Buenos Aires

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.110
and the bus broke [inaudible]
in Buenos Aires.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.930
And my father said, how
a man can be so unlucky.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.040
I don't find my son.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.710
It's going to be Christmas.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.360
He's going to be missing.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.040 position:56%
My mother was telling he's alive,
he's alive, you should look for him,

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.640
you should look for our son.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.940
I feel him alive.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.110
And I was telling mommy that you
believe in that trust of telepathy,

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.250 position:56%
I'm alive, look for me, look for me.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.110
And my father was coming
with his hands and tired.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.890
And on the morning in Buenos
Aires, he goes into a taxi.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.830
And the taxi driver
says, have you heard

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.770
that there are survivors
from that plane crash?

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.070
What do you mean?

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.370
No, we are on the search.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.430 position:56%
No, no, no, there are two
survivors in-- from the plane crash.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:28.730
But my son is there.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.540
Did you ever heard--
heard the names?

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.900
What's the name of your son?

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.290
He's one of them, he's one of them.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.080
Look at all the radios are
there and he puts on the radio

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.420
and he hear there are
lots of survivor.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.280
He begins hugging and
kissing the taxi driver.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.500
And then he didn't want
to charge him the trip.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.630
And he went to my cousin's house
and nearly put down their door

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.970 position:56%
but he was in the wrong in apartment

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.600
so he was pushing the
door of another person.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.900
Are you crazy?

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.970
Yes, I'm crazy man,
I'm really crazy.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.500
My son is alive.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.070
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: And then he
realized and tried to go back

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.610
and find the taxi driver and--

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.540
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yeah, he
was-- he would like to see--

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.270
&gt;&gt; Ted Robbins: -- he
wanted to see-- yeah.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.120
That's the genesis of the story.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.420
We have two minutes left.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.560
Any other-- any other questions?

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:21.800
What did-- you know,
people in extreme situations

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.040
and you actually have chosen to
put yourself in extreme situations

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.960
for other people by being
a surgeon, very often,

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.370
they find meaning to go on.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:40.960
That is-- that's the usually the
common thread is those who go on

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.990
and find meaning but what
meaning have you taken from this

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:49.300
and what meaning did you
have that helped you go

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.360
on and then helps you now?

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.060
&gt;&gt; Roberto Canessa: Yes,
many people tell me, why?

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.410
Why you go on that?

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.720
And then I say, why not?

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.780
Why not save this child?

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.360
Why not get him alive and get
a real chance in survival.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.770 position:56%
Isn't it life the best thing that
can happen to anyone and to a family

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.600
that have a newborn child?

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.990
So this is I think what it--

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.190
why we should commit our self into
really important things and forget

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.590
about all the stupidity
