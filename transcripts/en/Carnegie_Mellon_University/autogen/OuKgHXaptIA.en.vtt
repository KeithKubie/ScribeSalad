little bit more background about the
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.120
little bit more background about the
idea of the gigapan community and so I'm

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
idea of the gigapan community and so I'm
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.440
idea of the gigapan community and so I'm
going to make this brief because your

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450
going to make this brief because your
 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.890
going to make this brief because your
your workshops start again at 130 and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900
your workshops start again at 130 and
 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.180
your workshops start again at 130 and
i'll try and make it informal and i'll

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190
i'll try and make it informal and i'll
 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.980
i'll try and make it informal and i'll
attempt to leave room for questions and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
attempt to leave room for questions and
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810
attempt to leave room for questions and
we'll see if i can fit all of those

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
we'll see if i can fit all of those
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.730

pretty awesome so I think they're having
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720
pretty awesome so I think they're having
fun out there and maybe they're having

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
fun out there and maybe they're having
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.010
fun out there and maybe they're having
more fun than we're having but we eating

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
more fun than we're having but we eating
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.040
more fun than we're having but we eating
and that's something first of all I want

of course and computer scientists of
course but then we have people who work

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
course but then we have people who work
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210
course but then we have people who work
on firmware and they're really their

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
on firmware and they're really their
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.180

and then making them become reality the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190
and then making them become reality the
 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.800
and then making them become reality the
fundamental goal that the create lab has

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
fundamental goal that the create lab has
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.649
fundamental goal that the create lab has
in all of its projects is to pick a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
in all of its projects is to pick a
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420
in all of its projects is to pick a
community of practice and then invent

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
community of practice and then invent
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190
community of practice and then invent
the technology for that community that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
the technology for that community that
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.920
the technology for that community that
empowers them and the general litmus

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
empowers them and the general litmus
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510
empowers them and the general litmus
test we use is can we invent a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
test we use is can we invent a
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.980
test we use is can we invent a
technology that we can produce in

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
technology that we can produce in
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050
technology that we can produce in
reasonable quantities right 202,000

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
reasonable quantities right 202,000
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.020
reasonable quantities right 202,000
20,000 deploy into a community do

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
20,000 deploy into a community do
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.840
20,000 deploy into a community do
training and will the community in turn

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
training and will the community in turn
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
training and will the community in turn
feel empowered to influence the future

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010
feel empowered to influence the future
 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.770
feel empowered to influence the future
of their community and the future of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
of their community and the future of
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.969
of their community and the future of
technology and its use in their

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
technology and its use in their
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.210
technology and its use in their
community so we evaluate and study that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
community so we evaluate and study that
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.820
community so we evaluate and study that
after effects and of course we have to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830
after effects and of course we have to
 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.609
after effects and of course we have to
study the process of innovation to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
study the process of innovation to
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.929
study the process of innovation to
create the technology that will find use

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
create the technology that will find use
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.580
create the technology that will find use
in that community we have specific

who are to use gigapixel imagery so this

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
who are to use gigapixel imagery so this
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.110
who are to use gigapixel imagery so this
is one of a number of projects we have

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
is one of a number of projects we have
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.580
is one of a number of projects we have
about 12 hot projects right now in the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
about 12 hot projects right now in the
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.830
about 12 hot projects right now in the
lab and so in fact the people that you

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
lab and so in fact the people that you
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.690
lab and so in fact the people that you
know that you've met that are from the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
know that you've met that are from the
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.060
know that you've met that are from the
create lab all juggle and so for

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
create lab all juggle and so for
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.490
create lab all juggle and so for
instance Randy sergeant or anybody else

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500
instance Randy sergeant or anybody else
 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470
instance Randy sergeant or anybody else
that you've met oh hi Ron or others all

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
that you've met oh hi Ron or others all
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.030
that you've met oh hi Ron or others all
of them were involved in a number of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
of them were involved in a number of
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.980
of them were involved in a number of
projects and so that's something I think

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990
projects and so that's something I think
 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.300
projects and so that's something I think
is impressive these people are juggling

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
is impressive these people are juggling
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.070
is impressive these people are juggling
between many many projects all of which

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080
between many many projects all of which
 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.480
between many many projects all of which
have community outreach components and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490
have community outreach components and
 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.280
have community outreach components and
you're seeing them with one hat on but

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290
you're seeing them with one hat on but
 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.750
you're seeing them with one hat on but
have a discussion with them about their

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
have a discussion with them about their
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.800
have a discussion with them about their
other projects and I think you'll enjoy

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
other projects and I think you'll enjoy
 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.410
other projects and I think you'll enjoy
learning more about their other projects

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420
learning more about their other projects

to think about when we were playing with

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420
to think about when we were playing with
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.390
to think about when we were playing with

question that we had asked following the
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.740
question that we had asked following the
Mars rover pictures and this is the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
Mars rover pictures and this is the
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.180

question that really randy asked first

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
question that really randy asked first
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.330
question that really randy asked first
was how can we get people on earth to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
was how can we get people on earth to
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.370
was how can we get people on earth to
better understand one another to cross

boundaries if you will and to better
 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.630
boundaries if you will and to better
understand the earth itself and that's a

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410
wrote back to us and Anna cold email we
 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.230
wrote back to us and Anna cold email we
sent an email to the head of online at

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240
sent an email to the head of online at
 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.210
sent an email to the head of online at
National Geographic and incredibly she

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220

a koala and Google wrote back and we got

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750
a koala and Google wrote back and we got
 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.450
a koala and Google wrote back and we got
them all in the same room so that was

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460
them all in the same room so that was
 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.950
them all in the same room so that was
indeed how it started and one of the

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960
indeed how it started and one of the
 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.240
indeed how it started and one of the
first projects we did was to create a

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250
first projects we did was to create a
 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.760
first projects we did was to create a
layer on Google Earth but it required

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770
layer on Google Earth but it required
 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.470
layer on Google Earth but it required
massive detective work what we had to do

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480
massive detective work what we had to do
 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.780
massive detective work what we had to do
was get all sorts of images and articles

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790
was get all sorts of images and articles
 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.880
was get all sorts of images and articles
from National Geographic then we had to

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890
from National Geographic then we had to
 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.460
from National Geographic then we had to
hire an army of undergraduates here to

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470
hire an army of undergraduates here to
 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.860
hire an army of undergraduates here to
go and call photographers do research

where where those pictures were taken
these were not geotagged so we had to

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470
these were not geotagged so we had to
 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.050
these were not geotagged so we had to
come up with the geo tags and I'll give

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060
come up with the geo tags and I'll give
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.000
come up with the geo tags and I'll give
you one example there was a picture

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010
you one example there was a picture

you one example there was a picture
taken through a subway window we had to

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220
taken through a subway window we had to
 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.890
taken through a subway window we had to
figure out we knew what city was and we

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900
figure out we knew what city was and we
 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.960
figure out we knew what city was and we
had to figure out the half of the street

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970
had to figure out the half of the street
 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.270
had to figure out the half of the street

through a subway window at all the

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670
through a subway window at all the
 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.210
through a subway window at all the
subway stops in that city and we figured

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220
subway stops in that city and we figured
 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.740
subway stops in that city and we figured
it out and he attacked it that way so we

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
it out and he attacked it that way so we
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.140
it out and he attacked it that way so we
had investigators here essentially doing

look at a scatterplot this is really

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:18.890
look at a scatterplot this is really
 

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.590
look at a scatterplot this is really
cool when you consider that the left

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600
cool when you consider that the left
 

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.420

axis the vertical axis is on a log scale

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.430
axis the vertical axis is on a log scale
 

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.490
axis the vertical axis is on a log scale
so on a log scale the thing is going

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:27.500
so on a log scale the thing is going
 

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.120
so on a log scale the thing is going
superlinear which is really cool that

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.130
superlinear which is really cool that
 

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.550
superlinear which is really cool that
means it's growing very very quickly

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:32.560
means it's growing very very quickly
