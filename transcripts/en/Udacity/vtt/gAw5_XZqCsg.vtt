00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.591
Hello and welcome to Lesson 6. We're going to talk about loops. But more

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.090
importantly, you're going to learn something that you probably want to know.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.818
Namely, how you can become a millionaire, even though if you think about it

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:15.258
right now, interest rates. Rates are very low. Get a measly 1% on your bank

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:19.520
account. And I don't know about you, but I don't have a lot of money right now.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.300
All I have to invest is $100. But, I have a plan. Here's my plan. I'm going to

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.702
set my time machine to that specific point when my bank account has a million

00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:33.080
dollars in it. Or maybe if I can't find my time machine, I'll just let myself

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.650
be cryogenically frozen and tell them to wake me up at that moment. All I

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.456
need to know now is to which date in the future to set my time machine. So,

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:44.186
that's what we're going to be writing a program for and that program's going to

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:48.057
be using loops. Because it has to keep on adding that interest to the bank

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:52.205
account until it reaches $1 million. How long do you think it's going to take?

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:58.090
100 years, 1,000 years, 10,000 years, or almost a million years? Let's take a guess.
