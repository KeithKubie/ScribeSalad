but by taking a pattern from your source

and applying it to a target the answer

comparisons like this these puzzles are

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360
comparisons like this these puzzles are
 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.899
comparisons like this these puzzles are
called analogies more specifically this

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909
called analogies more specifically this
 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.230
called analogies more specifically this
is a proportional analogy and it tests

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240
is a proportional analogy and it tests

how good we are at abstracting the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280
how good we are at abstracting the
 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.160
how good we are at abstracting the
meaning of one pair of words and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
meaning of one pair of words and
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.669
meaning of one pair of words and
applying it to the second pair but

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679
applying it to the second pair but
 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.249

analogies like this might have even more

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259
analogies like this might have even more
 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.550
analogies like this might have even more
to teach us about language and thought

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
to teach us about language and thought
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.559

think about it doesn't the schhwaff

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
think about it doesn't the schhwaff
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.470

schhwaff thing work a little like one of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
schhwaff thing work a little like one of
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.610
schhwaff thing work a little like one of
these analogies if so just how far can

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
these analogies if so just how far can
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.250
these analogies if so just how far can
we take analogies in our quest to learn

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260
we take analogies in our quest to learn

and think and create you'll see this

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
and think and create you'll see this
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.059

pattern and applying that abstraction to
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.500
pattern and applying that abstraction to
a new instance over and over again oh we

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
a new instance over and over again oh we
 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.690
a new instance over and over again oh we
might even call this a pattern of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700
might even call this a pattern of
 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.110
might even call this a pattern of
analogies but how do we abstract that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
analogies but how do we abstract that
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.730
analogies but how do we abstract that
and analogize those abstractions

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
and analogize those abstractions
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.890
and analogize those abstractions
