00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.450
All we have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given us, but why is that so

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.450
hard to do?

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.280
Why do we feel like there’s never enough
time?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.050
Hey procrastinators, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.070
Have you ever wondered why you will happily
do nothing on a beach for hours on end but

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.090
won’t wait in line for just a few minutes?

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.710
Well, science is on the case!

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.810
Two recent papers published in Journal of
Consumer Research looked into how we experience

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
time.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.990
One paper identified factors that make consumers
experience time in wonky ways.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.929
The researchers examined five elements that
need to be “in tune”. “ technology,

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.030
consumers' skill, their plans and moods, rules
and regulations, and cultural understanding”

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.449
need to all align to make time pass at “just
the right” speed.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.339
To look at real world examples of when the
elements are “in tune” the researchers

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.260
studied athletes of extreme sports, like free
skiing.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.620
Skiiers aren’t impatient waiting for their
next jump.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.319
They understand that it’s all part of the
experience and use that time to their advantage.

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.519
Where most of us get impatient in line at
the post office, social decorum makes us wait.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.780
Yet we are already thinking of what else we
have to do.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.680
Those five elements are out of alignment,
and time seems to drag on.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.350
Speaking of, thinking of all the stuff we
have to do can also make us feel the strain

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.560
of time.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
Research published in the same journal found
that people feel busier when they are close

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469
to reaching a goal.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.250
In several studies, the researchers found
that people tolerate interruptions less the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.469
closer they are to finishing a task.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:25.790
Think of a big goal you have.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.509
Like going on a trip to London.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.460
That big goal is made up of smaller goals,
which the researchers called “sub-goals”

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.340
like getting a taxi to the airport, checking
in, going through security, arriving at a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.960
gate, taking a train to the terminal.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.070
You get the idea.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
In one of the studies they asked people in
airports to fill out a survey.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
Some people were waiting for the train to
the terminal while others had just arrived

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.850
at the gate.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.850
The people waiting for the train were less
likely to fill out the survey and when they

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.850
did they said they had less time.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.259
The people who just arrived at the gate were
more likely to take the survey, even though

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.130
they actually had less time till take off,
but they were further from completing one

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
of their smaller goals so they felt like they
had more time.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.689
The people waiting for the train were so close
to getting on that train, which would check

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.460
off a “subgoal” that they felt they had
less time than they actually did!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.210
The researchers think one of the reasons we
feel so busy and will put off other things

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.440
that might be important is because we are
so wrapped up in smaller, trivial, “subgoals”.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.370
Another study published in the Journal of
Marketing Research has another idea of why

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.730
we feel so busy.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.000
The researchers asked participants to list
certain tasks in order and to find if any

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.060
were in competition for time or money.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.950
The researchers found that when participants
felt like tasks were in conflict for time

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.250
they felt more stressed.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.420
Which isn’t all that surprising.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.660
But they also found that even when tasks didn’t
compete for time, but competed for things

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.310
like money or emotional resources, people
were just as anxious and that made them feel

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.360
pressed for time.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.090
They called this a “false sense of anxiety”,
that it’s all about perception, you might

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.540
not be actually pressed for time, you just
THINK you are because of stress or anxiety.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
But have no fear!

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.340
There are ways to manage this feeling.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.090
The researchers suggest deep breathing to
reduce immediate feelings of anxiety, and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.960
to reframe that emotion as positive, like
psych yourself up, tell yourself you’re

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960
excited!

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960
And prioritize!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.130
I know it’s hard.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.870
But that feeling of “oh my god how am I
gonna get this all done” will ease if you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.650
just breathe and start on one task at a time.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.860
All you have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given to you.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.860
GUYS GUYS GUYS.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.860
Did you know?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.670
That scientists can SLOW DOWN TIME!?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.730
FOR REAL!

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:31.180
Trace will tell you all about it in this video.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.820
how do you deal with time management?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:41.070
Let us know…
