00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a look at Euler's formula again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What we're going to do is prove by induction that this holds.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can build any planar graph by iteratively adding nodes and edges.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's start off with the simplest thing, which is just a single node. Ta-da!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can start off with just the simplest graph of all--just a node sitting on the plane all by itself,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a lonely point, and we've got one node, no edges, and one giant region around it,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and 1 - 0 + 1 is indeed 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's our base case.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now we proceed by induction.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Given that we're doing a proof by induction, we're going to assume that we have

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
some planar graph and that Euler's formula holds for that graph.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have already that n - m + r = 2.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we're going to do is we're going to add to this graph so that it's still planar

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and see what happens to this formula.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There are two different ways that we can add to this graph.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We can add a node and an edge together, or we can add an edge between two exiting nodes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's consider this first case where we had a new node and an edge between them,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and it's still a planar graph. What happens to m, n, and r?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, we have one new node and one new edge but the number of regions hasn't changed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're just jutting into some region inside or outside,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but it doesn't change the total number of regions--(n + 1) - (m + 1)--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
these ones cancel, and we get n - m + r,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which by our inductive hypothesis we said is 2.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In that case, the formula still holds.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What about the case where we just add an edge.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
One way we can add an edge is inside of some other region,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and let's look what happens in that case.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The number of nodes is unchanged. The number of edges has gone up by one.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But the number of regions has gone up by one as well.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This used to be one giant region, and it's now been split in to two regions.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Once again, these ones cancel.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Our formula still holds.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's just double-check what happens if we do something on the outside,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
sort of breaking into the huge vast region around it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Connect, say, these two nodes, what have we done?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We still have the vast region around it, but we created a new region here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Again, the number of regions has gone up by 1.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Similarly, if we click this over the number of regions has gone up by 1.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If we add an edge without a corresponding node, the number of regions goes up by 1.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If we add an edge and a node together, the region stays the same,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but the number of nodes goes up by 1.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No matter what you do, this formula keeps holding. Pretty cool.
