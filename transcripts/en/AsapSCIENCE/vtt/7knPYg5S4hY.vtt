00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.040
There are currently 7.5 billion people alive on Earth,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.860
of which 323 million live in the United States of America

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.280
As a global powerhouse, many have an opinion on the American Lifestyle.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.400
But what do the statistics say,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.900
and what would actually happen if we all lived like Americans?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.000
First off you would be having more sex.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.220
Surveys indicate that Americans have sex 138 times per year on average

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.960
which is the second highest in the world behind France.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.780
Porn would also be even more abundant as 73 percent of the world's porn is produced in America.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.460
Americans drive thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy-six (13,476) miles per year,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
which is the most in the world.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.040
This explains why they have the highest rates of vehicle collisions worldwide

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.960
and number of meals eaten in a car.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.769
Seriously. Statistics show that twenty percent of American meals are consumed in a vehicle.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560
Americans eat eight ounces of meat per day on average

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920
which is almost double the world average.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.580
This leads to Americans killing and eating 10 billion animals annually,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.360
which is 15 percent of the world's total consumption.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.500
The average American also drinks 403 Coca Cola products per year

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.740
compared to the world's average which is 92.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.460
This all contributes to the U.S. having the highest total caloric intake,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.480
sugar intake, and fat intake

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.220
compared to all of the other 16 wealthiest countries.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.620
But consumption is similar in one category: fruit and vegetable consumption.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.940
And all of this eating contributes to trash.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.720
Americans throw out 1.6 billion pens and 220 million car tires per year.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.200
An individual American produces 729 kilogrammes of garbage per year

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.520
of which 544 kilograms is organic waste.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580
This means that the population of America

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.780
which is roughly 5% of the world,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380
generates 40% of the world's waste.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.420
For most of the world, the American Lifestyle would mean living longer.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.480
The U.S. life expectancy is 82.1 years for women, and 77.5 for men.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.260
But it still only ranked 42nd in the world behind other industrialized nations like Australia and Canada.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.560
This is likely because these countries have better publicly funded health care.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.420
The median age in the United States is 37.9

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.080
meaning if you divided the whole population of America into two equal groups,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.740
half of the people would be younger that 37.9,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.340
and half of the people would be older.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.240
America is defined as having an ageing population

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.600
in that the world's median age is lower at 30.1.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.000
Niger has the lowest median age at 15.3 years old,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.340
compared to Japan, where the ageing population could become an issue

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.880
as their median age is 46.9.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.400
The lifestyle of an American requires about ten liters of oil per day.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900
But some other developed countries consume even more on average, like Canadians,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.880
who use 10.2 litres per day,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.680
while some of the lowest consumers of oil are Bangladeshis

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.240
who only use 0.1 litres per day.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240
A direct way of measuring the impact of the world

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.100
switching to an American lifestyle is using the global hectare.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
This measurement looks at how much land, sea and other natural resources are needed to produce

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.280
what each person consumes per year.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.080
For example: the rice they eat, the shelving unit they buy, or the clothes they wear.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.040
The average person in the world uses 2.7 global hectares per year.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.000
The highest is the lifestyle of those in Kuwait who use 8.9 global hectares annually,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.820
with the U.S. trailing slightly behind with 6.8 global hectares per year.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.840
With the amount of CO2 released from this,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.300
studies show that we would need another half of an Earth

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.280
in order to absorb it at a safe rate.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.500
Although other studies suggests that these are underestimations.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.940
So you can imagine if we were all living like Americans,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.800
it would be catastrophic.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.660
In fact we would need 4.1 Earths in order to sustain everyone living like an American.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479

If you've ever wanted to understand your own DNA,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.280
and see which regions of the world your ancestors come from,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.320
or how your DNA influences physical traits and health

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.740
then check out 23andMe/asap

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.840
We've tried it ourselves and found out that Gregg has a lot of neanderthal DNA,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.480
while Mitch found out why he loves pizza so much.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.060
All you have to do is spit in a tube,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.560
and they'll analyse your 23 pairs of chromosomes

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.280
which is where the name comes from.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.440
