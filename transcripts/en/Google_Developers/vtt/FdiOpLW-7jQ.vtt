[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540
JASON TITUS: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.600
I'm Jason, and I lead
the Developer Product

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.320
Group at Google.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
I'm so excited to be
here with all of you

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.340
at Google Developer Days Europe.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.910
This region is an amazing
one for technology,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.180
with startup hubs blossoming
across the continent,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.159
from London to Paris
to Berlin and Warsaw.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.250
The talent here is incredible.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.630
In fact, a few years
ago, when I was

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.550
the CTO at Shazam
in London, we would

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.160
hire from across the continent.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.070
Some of our best
developers came from Spain

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.230
and Greece and Germany
and Lithuania and Poland.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.140
And fast forward to
today, and Europe

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.400
has more developers than
the United States and Canada

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.270
combined.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.252
AUDIENCE: [CHEERS]

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.707
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:08.340
JASON TITUS: Which is
why it's really exciting

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.620
to have Google
Developer Days here

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.460
so that we can meet and
work with all of you.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.040
We want to give
you what you need

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.010
to turn your ideas into
reality, whether you're

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.760
building a mobile app or
using new technologies like AR

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.860
or machine learning.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.320
We want to enable you
to focus on the problems

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.050
you're trying to solve
and minimize the pain

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.610
points of building a product.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.880
And in addition to building
products to help you succeed,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.550
we're also working on
building out trainings

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.050
to deepen your technical
capabilities year round.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.680
Today, I'm happy to share that
we've opened our mobile web

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.605
certification that will enable
you to further expand your web

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:51.105
skills.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
And on the ground, our team is
working in over 130 countries.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
And within Europe, we've
reached over 185,000 developers

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.630
just this year through
local events and programs.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
We have in Europe over 200
developer experts, many of whom

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.060
are in this room today, who
are sharing their expertise.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.500
And we're continuing to
expand the developer ecosystem

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
through programs such as
Women Techmakers, the Google

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.740
Developer Agency Program, and
our Google Developer groups.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.510
Last year, we started our
Launchpad Accelerator program,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.080
which connects top
startups with mentors

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.970
and brings them
to Silicon Valley

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.000
to meet with Google
product leads.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.870
In our fourth class, we had
our first startup from Poland.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.140
These three entrepreneurs
recognized the need

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.670
to provide therapy at scale
for autistic children.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.060
In response, they
created DrOmnibus,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.920
an app-based learning
platform that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.120
provides games for children
with special education needs.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.730
The game allows students
to learn behavior patterns

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.706
and responses to
real-life scenarios.

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:10.080
And their teachers
and therapists

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.820
can review their progress.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.580
The best part is that
students can play these games

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.420
on their own, allowing them
to get therapy every day,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.520
rather than once a
week, which makes

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.760
an incredible impact long term.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.510
This is just one of many stories
of how the European development

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.964
community is making
a big impact.

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:33.880
Now I'd like to bring
up some of my colleagues

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240
to share updates across
our developer platforms.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.850
And let's start with how we're
making the Android development

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.170
process easier.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.640
Please welcome Dan.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.830
DANIEL GALPIN: Thank you, Jason.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.740
It is the best time ever
to be an Android developer.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.600
Now I've been developing for
Android for almost nine years,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.980
and I've spent seven of
those years at Google.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.120
But I've never seen anything
like what we have now--

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.100
this incredible confluence of
meaningful developer changes.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.300
We're seeing ever more powerful
tooling, a clear path forward

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.810
for app design, a new
programming language,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.350
and fundamental improvements
to the distribution model.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.830
And much of this change derives
from listening to all of you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.830
in the developer community.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.320
And all of this is happening
amidst the incredible momentum

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.060
that Android continues to have.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.530
I mean, we're seeing 2 billion
active devices on Android

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.770
and 82 billion apps
installed from Play.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.340
And what's even more amazing
is how this momentum is making

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.010
so many developers successful.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.010
The number of developers
with over a million installs

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.165
grew 35% in the past year.

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:55.540
Now to leverage
this distribution

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.360
to build great businesses, we
expanded direct-carrier billing

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.880
to reach 900 million devices
with over 140 operators.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.270
And altogether, the number
of people buying on Play

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.560
grew by almost 30%
this past year.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400
But that's not enough.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.880
We know that we can make
distribution even better

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.250
by removing the friction
from app installs

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.890
and making the entire
experience more dynamic.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.250
So Instant Apps is
one of our big bets

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.110
in bringing more
users to your apps,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.240
and our early partners
are seeing great results.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.690
Onefootball, based
in Berlin, saw

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.330
that the number of users who
read news and shared content

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.650
increased 55% in
their Instant App,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.430
while Vimeo increased their
session durations by 130%.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.450
Jet found that the conversion
rate in their shopping app

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.760
increased by 27%.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.730
And there are many more
stories like these.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.760
At I/O, we opened up
Android Instant Apps

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.240
to all Android developers,
which means anyone can now build

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.760
and publish an Instant App.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.640
Since then, we've made Instant
Apps available to more than 500

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.590
million Android devices
across countries

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.360
where Google Play operates.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.210
Your Instant App is downloaded
as needed, feature by feature.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.340
And you enable this by
organizing your project

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.840
into feature modules.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.660
And then you can use that exact
same code in both your Instant

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.660
App and your installable app.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.790
We're easing the process
of refactoring your app

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.730
into these feature modules
by using the new Modularize

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.140
refactoring action.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.710
And Modularize helps you
move code and resources

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.360
between modules.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.270
We've also included
optimization tools,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.430
from space-shaving
shared libraries

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.840
to more efficient
asset delivery,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.340
to on-the-wire compression.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.850
So when you're ready, you just
upload your Instant App APKs,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.490
together with your installable
APK into Play Console.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.550
To get started building
in Instant App today,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.040
visit g.co/instantapps.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.010
All right, so since you're
here, you probably heard

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.050
our exciting news from
I/O. And that, of course,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.010
is that we're now offering
first-class support

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.530
for the Kotlin programming
language in Android.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.531
And Kotlin support is now
built into Android Studio.

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:07.030
So--

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.120
So obviously, I don't have to
tell you this-- why Kotlin?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.140
And that's because the
community really wanted it.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.240
Kotlin is a mature production
lab-ready language that's

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.640
been around for five years.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.440
And so we investigated.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.600
And people at investigating
became Kotlin champions.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.240
As developers,
languages are the tools

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.860
that we use to
express our thoughts.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.190
And with Kotlin, there's just
so much less syntactic noise

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.250
between what I want to
say and how I say it.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.500
And since our announcement
at Google I/O,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.840
Kotlin has been
growing like crazy.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.820
It's really a fantastic
programming language,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.460
and it's great to see so many
of you out there adopting it.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.980
But to be clear, we
have added Kotlin

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.060
as an additional language.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.451
We're not replacing the Java
programming language or C++.

00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.450
And we support building
apps with as much Kotlin

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.180
as you want, from 0% to 100%.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.300
And in fact, it operates 100%
with the Java programming

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.170
language.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.242
That means you can
keep every line of code

00:08:09.242 --> 00:08:10.950
that you have in your
existing code base.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.470
And you can seamlessly call
from Kotlin into the Java

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.099
programming language and back.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:16.890
And you can get started
by adding as little

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.050
as a single Kotlin class.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.790
And JetBrains, who
we've partnered with

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.620
to provide Kotlin
support for Android,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.330
are here and giving a
talk on Kotlin today.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.070
So please swing by to learn
more if you haven't already.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.456
Now minimizing install
friction with Instant Apps

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:33.539
and the support of the
Kotlin programming language

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.164
are just two of the
ways in which we've

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:36.870
listened to your feedback.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.600
We've also learned you want
faster, easier development,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.460
with better tools and libraries.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.590
So Android Studio
is our official IDE,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.940
purpose-built for Android.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.980
And we keep increasing
our investment.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.730
At Google I/O, we launched the
preview for Android Studio 3.0,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.360
focusing on speed and
smarts and platform support,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.890
plus new libraries
for app architecture.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.220
And this is going to migrate
to stable release soon.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.260
[CHUCKLES] And based
on your feedback,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.150
you can see all the
speed and smarts updates

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.340
we've made to Android
Studio behind me.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.650
But I do want to call out
one thing in particular.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.830
Your feedback has
made driving down sync

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.390
and build time our
number one priority.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.150
So benchmarking with a
real-life 100-module project,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.760
since 2.2, build config
time dropped from 3 minutes

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.260
to 2 seconds.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.350
And we're continuing to
work on build performance.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.170
And for me super exciting,
on the emulators,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.350
we added the Play Store
for end-to-end testing.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.100
So next, we'll talk about
Android platform support.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.710
We recently unveiled our latest
dessert name for Android.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.850
And you'll find awesome features
for Android Oreo in Android

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.760
Studio, like end-to-end
Instant App support,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.240
Oreo system images,
improve profilers, and tons

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.010
of Oreo helper
tools, like a tool

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.900
to make building
adaptive icons easy.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.110
And to download Android
dependencies for your build,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.630
you don't have to go through
the SDK manager any more.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.560
We're now distributing through
our own Maven repository.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.280
Finally, you've asked us to
make Android Frameworks easier,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.100
like providing an opinionated
guide for best practices

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.390
and a better solution
for life cycles.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.010
So at I/O, we launched a
preview of new Architecture

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.050
Components-- libraries
for common tasks.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.660
And this starts with libraries
with a view model pattern,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.870
data storage, and managing
activity and fragment life

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.680
cycles.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.310
And soon, we'll be announcing
support for paging, which

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.280
will make it easier
to use Recycler View,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.720
(WHISPERING) which is awesome.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.000
App-- yeah.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.460
Very excited about that.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.280
So app quality is
an essential piece

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.990
to growing a
successful business.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.490
And we took a sample
of apps, and we

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.040
analyzed the correlation
between app quality and business

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.867
success.

00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:45.950
And what we learned is
when apps move from average

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.370
to good quality, we see a
sixfold increase in spend

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.000
and a seven-fold
increase in retention.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.730
Quality is queen.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.340
Now your app
quality might differ

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.340
depending on the type of
device it's running on.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.673
So to help you ensure that
you're targeting devices that

00:11:01.673 --> 00:11:05.360
work best for your app, you
can now target specific devices

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.980
in the Play Console.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.630
You can browse a
detailed device--

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.560
yeah, isn't this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.101
It's awesome.

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:10.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.260
We've been waiting
for that forever.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.984
You can browse a
detailed device catalog,

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:15.650
and if you need a
certain amount of RAM,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.160
or if you have issues with a
particular system on System

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.990
Chip, you can set tarting
rules to address this as well.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.090
And prior to
excluding devices, you

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.030
can even see your installs,
your ratings, and your revenue

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.370
details per device.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.247
Now we've got Android Vitals
Dashboards in the Play Console.

00:11:31.247 --> 00:11:33.080
So you can see aggregate
data about your map

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.960
to help you pinpoint common
issues, like excessive crash

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.590
rates, ANR rates, frozen
frames, slow rendering,

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.430
excessive wake-ups, and more.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.400
And these are enhanced
by improved profilers

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.250
in Android Studio and
new instrumentation

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.764
in the platform.

00:11:47.764 --> 00:11:48.590
Whew.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.040
Speaking of the platform,
Android O ads so much

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.460
for developers, such as
vastly improved font support,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.700
an auto-sizing text view,
notification channels,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.620
and a new native pro-audio API.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.810
We've made massive
improvements in the runtime,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.760
including a concurrent
copying collector

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.340
and a series of optimizations
to make your apps run smoother

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.360
than ever.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.730
We've introduced adaptive
icons to improve the Launcher

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.460
experience and continued
to harden Android security,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.680
with Google Play
Protect now enabled

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.879
on every device
with Google Play.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.670
We've improved
accessibility, added support

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.345
for Autofill and
SmarTech Selection,

00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:22.970
added support for a
wide gamut of color

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.790
and extra long screens, and
improved multi-display support.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.190
And I'll be diving into
all of this and much more

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.030
in detail later today.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.790
But let's talk about
some of the ways

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.490
we're extending the
Android platform.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:41.030
Last week, we announced
and launched ARCore.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.290
Now--

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.610
--ARCore is a platform for
building augmented-reality apps

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.240
on Android.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.460
And it uses three
key technologies

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.950
to integrate virtual
content with the real world,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.911
as seen through
your phone's camera.

00:12:55.911 --> 00:12:57.910
So you've got motion
tracking to allow the phone

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.368
to understand and track its
position relative to the world.

00:13:00.368 --> 00:13:02.052
We've got environmental
understanding,

00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:03.760
which allows the phone
to detect the size

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.710
and location of flat
or long services,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.870
like the ground
or a coffee table.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.820
And light estimation
allows the phone

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.880
to estimate the environment's
current lighting conditions.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.920
Now this is being offered
as an early preview.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.740
So you can start experimenting
with and building new AR

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.520
experiences.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.860
And this is also an
opportunity for you

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.740
to get feedback on an
early version of the API.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.360
And this preview
is the first step

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.150
in a journey to
enabling AR capabilities

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.490
across the entire
Android ecosystem.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.500
So check out the Documentation
pages to learn more.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.850
All right, switch gears,
literally, to Android Auto.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.850
It's still early days, but
we're seeing incredible growth.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.720
We continue to expand the number
of Android Auto-compatible cars

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.520
through great partnerships
with over 50 car brands.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.880
And there are over 300
Android Auto-compatible models

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.800
and aftermarket systems
available today.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.110
And that's triple the
number from one year ago.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.420
And it's well on its way to
becoming a standard feature

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.730
in every new car.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.620
And we've also made Android Auto
available to all Android users

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.230
with a standalone phone
app, opening up the platform

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.210
and ecosystem to many
millions of drivers,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.040
no matter what kind of
car they're driving.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.290
Whether you're looking to
stay connected with WhatsApp

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.200
or Allo, pass the time
with a Player.fm podcast

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.480
or the latest album
releases on Spotify,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.360
we've got great apps
on Android Auto.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.110
And it's usage is
growing rapidly as well,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.270
but this is just the beginning.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.240
We're working with
two European partners

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.330
in automotive electronics
infotainment, Audi and Volvo,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.510
on vehicle infotainment
systems powered by Android.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.460
And we're really excited
to partner with them

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.460
to usher in the future
of connected cars.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.051
Now voice input is critical
in the car for safety reasons.

00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:37.550
And the Google
Assistant can provide

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.000
that intelligent and
conversational voice

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.540
as we move from a mobile first
world to an AI first world.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.100
And we want it to
be the best copilot

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.700
for the user in the car.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.240
So on your road, your assistant
can tell you about traffic

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.440
ahead, or show you gas
stations along the way,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.806
or play your favorite song.

00:14:53.806 --> 00:14:55.180
And many of these
experiences are

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.370
only possible because
developers like you

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.690
are implementing the right API.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.180
So thank you for helping
us create a great user

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.550
experience on Android Auto.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.290
All right, let's go
to the living room.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.500
Android TV is seeing
amazing device growth.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.560
Our strong partnerships with
pay-TV operators and hardware

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.450
manufacturers allowed
us to double the number

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.120
of activated devices in 2016.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.440
And we expect that trend to
continue and further increase.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.570
We're seeing this both across
partners in the set-top box

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.880
and in the smart-TV
form factors, including

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.484
the many European solutions
powered by Android TV.

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:30.400
And we've expanded our
international footprint

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.920
to 70 countries.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.760
And there are now
more than 3,000 apps

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.890
in the Android TV Play Store.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.080
But the real Android
TV story is the way

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.390
we've redefined the experience.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.240
This new homescreen is
channel-based and content

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.340
first.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.560
It's divided into channel rows,
each created by a media app

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.860
to display a window of program
content relevant to you.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.360
And selecting that
program takes you

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.860
right into that
content in the app.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.600
You can see what
On Demand shows you

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.270
need to finish binge
watching, what's on your DVR,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.630
and what movies you might want
to rent, On in the same view.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.430
We've also updated
the set-up experience

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.800
to allow you to easily
transition media apps

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.810
from other Android devices.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.570
And we've made big updates
to the Leanback Library,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.490
such as the Playback
element, which

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.680
adds detailed Seek thumbnails.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.050
And of course, we've integrated
the Google Assistant,

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.010
which allows you to search,
launch video content,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.200
and then dim the lights
when you want to watch,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.720
all using your voice.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.440
All right, let's switch to
something a little bit closer--

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.550
Android Wear.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.330
During the holiday period
last year, Android Wear

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.450
saw 72% growth.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.290
And that was before we
launched Android Wear 2.0.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.510
The number of brands
supporting Android Wear

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.630
doubled from 12 last year to 24.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.880
And the choice of
Android Wear watches

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.880
doubled from 23 last year to 46.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.250
And Wear is enabling
fashionable watches

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.040
from European partners such
as the Connected Modular

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.910
45 from Tag Heuer, the Montblanc
Summit, and the Louis Vuitton

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.030
Tambour Horizon, and along
with a multitude of styles,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.376
like from partners across
many price points and brands.

00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:06.250
And apps are taking
advantage of Android Wear

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.490
2.0 and its standalone
functionality.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.108
So this app from our
partner Telegram,

00:17:11.108 --> 00:17:13.108
works the same if you're
connected to an Android

00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:15.730
phone or an iPhone, or if your
watch has a cellular connection

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.930
without the phone at all.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.242
Sending stickers to your
friends has never been easier.

00:17:20.242 --> 00:17:21.910
Another feature we
added to Android Wear

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.848
2.0, Complications,
allows watch faces

00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:28.060
to display extra information
without needing code

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.599
for getting the underlying data.

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:31.390
Users select the watch
face that they want,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.870
with the most
important information

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.900
they really care about.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.400
And it's available at a
glance throughout the day.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.560
So here, Robinhood, the
financial investment app,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.091
is showing you your
overall portfolio's value.

00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:43.090
Tapping on it then takes
you to your watch list.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.460
And you can tap on individual
stocks to see their values.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.150
Finally, as part of the
Android Wear 2.0 launch,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.060
we announced the Google
Assistant is now on your wrist,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.400
enhancing [INAUDIBLE]
voice capabilities.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.420
So going forward, apart from
Notifications, Watch Faces,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.310
and Native Apps, you
will have another option

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.600
to bring this service
to Android Wear

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.550
when we enable Actions
on Google for Wear.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.636
And we're excited about the new
capabilities this will bring.

00:18:07.636 --> 00:18:10.420
All right, with so
many ways for people

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.120
to interact with Android,
the strong communities that

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.120
are supporting Android
development, the improvements

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.720
that we've made in the
platform, tooling, language,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.120
and in the distribution
of Google Play,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.530
it really is the best time ever
to be an Android developer.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.530
So please check out the
sessions, the trainings,

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.410
and the code labs here to learn
how we're helping developers

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.420
make Android great.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.340
Now all of the
Android form factors

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.490
are tapping into the power
of the Google Assistant.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.820
So it's my pleasure to welcome
my colleague Tilke to the stage

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.600
to talk about what the Google
Assistant means to developers.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.100
Thank you.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.084
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:51.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.460
TILKE JUDD: Thanks, Dan.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.560
Hi, everyone.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.720
As you just heard,
the Google Assistant

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.620
is now available across many
devices, from your phone,

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.950
to your car, to
your watch, and TV.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.410
It is also available
on Google Home

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:20.500
and all of the devices powered
by the Google Assistant SDK.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.560
Tomorrow, you'll hear more
about these from my colleague

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.220
Behshad, who will talk about the
improvements on the Assistant

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.020
on these devices.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.970
But today, I want to focus
on what you as developers can

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:39.670
do to bring the power of the
Assistant to your own apps.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.370
With the Assistant now
available across devices,

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.310
you have the opportunity to grow
your user base in a new way.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.790
But more importantly,
you can build

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.840
apps for entirely new
assistive use cases.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.790
Things that previously
weren't suited

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.450
for the Voice Only
interface of Google Home,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.500
like shopping for
clothes or ordering food

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.860
from a lengthy menu
With UI elements,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.520
like image carousels,
lists, and suggestion tips,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.830
users can see more details.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.720
They can also
seamlessly transition

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.670
between voice, typing, or
taps in a single conversation

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.140
to easily get things
done with your app.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.660
We also want to help
you grow your business

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.600
by making it easy to complete
purchases through the Google

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.920
Assistant.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.110
We designed the
Transactions experience

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.640
to be easy and lightweight for
users and developers alike.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.760
For Payments, available
in Europe soon,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.980
you can choose
Google-facilitated payments.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.800
They are easy to integrate and
allow you to leverage cards

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.700
that users have already
stored with Google for free.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.640
Or you can use a payment
method the user has already

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.060
provided you.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.420
You can use seamless
account linking

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.810
to enable users to sign
into an existing account

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:06.050
or even create a new
account with just two taps.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.080
But a transaction isn't
over when the user pays.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.810
The users may want
to check on, modify,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.560
or reorder an item, which they
can do from the Transaction

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.410
History view, accessible
in the Google Assistant.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.140
Finally, we built a new
Order Updates feature

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.060
that we're currently
testing in the US

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.690
to make it easier for users
to reengage with your app.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.570
You'll be able to send
status updates to users

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.190
asynchronously, like when a
car arrives to pick them up

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.270
or their food is delivered.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.250
But none of this really
matters if people

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.370
can't discover your app.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.480
At I/O, we began
rolling out a new app

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.370
directory that will
come to Europe, along

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.990
with the Google Assistant.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.170
Accessible from
within the Assistant,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.180
it not only has categories
and user ratings,

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.300
it also allows users to
try your app directly

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.260
from the Directory page.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.620
Users can create a shortcut
for your app for an easy way

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.390
to invoke it.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.990
For example, instead
of saying, OK,

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.140
Google, ask
Forecaster Joe what's

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.510
the surf report for
the Outer Banks,

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:19.080
you can just say, OK,
Google, is the surf up?

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.450
And to make finding
your app easier,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.150
the Assistant is also
learning from the directory

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.140
and from the information
provided by you, the developer.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.480
Thanks to these signals,
the Assistant can often

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.530
respond to general requests,
like "play a game,"

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.270
with a few different
options from third parties.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.180
Improving discovery is
very important for us.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.440
So you can expect ongoing
investment and improvements

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.220
in this area.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.330
It is also important to us
that the developer process

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.720
is smooth.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.760
That's why at I/O, we launched
a new developer console.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.450
The Actions console
helps you work as a team

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.960
and collect data on your
app's usage, performance,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.190
and user discovery patterns.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.800
It is integrated
with the Firebase

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.350
and Google Cloud consoles
so that you can share

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.050
your data within your apps.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.520
In addition to
the console, we're

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.790
also providing you with
access to developer tools

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.920
that allow you to
quickly and easily build

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.230
apps for the Assistant.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.790
Since the launch
of our platform,

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.000
we've worked with an expanding
number of developer tool

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.340
companies to make
their solutions

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.030
compatible with
Actions on Google.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.770
We've also expanded
the capabilities

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.600
of api.ai, our own
conversation building tool,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.980
launching new features
such as follow-up

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:49.770
intense, pre-built agents,
and in-dialogue analytics.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.100
While we are still in the
early days of the platform,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.070
we are focused on
making it more robust

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.810
and expanding its reach
and its capabilities.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.350
We recently launched in
UK and Australian English.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.870
And we'll launch the
platform in French, German,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.550
and other languages
following this year.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.190
We're super excited
for the road ahead.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.810
And we want more
of you to join us

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.390
by developing for the platform.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.750
With an addressable audience of
more than 100 million devices,

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.820
new capabilities
like transactions,

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.110
and an improved
developer experience,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.820
we think this is an incredible
opportunity for all of us.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.430
Now the magic of
the Assistant is

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.860
enabled by Google's deep
investment in AI and the Cloud.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.420
So to tell you more about how
you can use it directly, please

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.920
welcome Sara.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.914
SARA ROBINSON: Thanks, Tilke.

00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:55.330
I'm incredibly
excited to tell you

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.340
everything we're working on
related to machine learning.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.870
My name is Sara Robinson.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.790
I'm a developer advocate on
Google's Cloud Platform team,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.770
focused on big data
and machine learning.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.370
In today's world, any time we
see the words "ML" on a slide,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.530
it always gets a lot
of people's attention.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.480
But before we dive
into the details,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.430
I want to talk about what
machine learning actually is.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.320
At a high level,
machine learning

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.080
involves teaching computers
to recognize patterns

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.270
in the same way
that our brains do.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.110
Over time, as machine learning
models are given more examples

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.600
and experience, they
can improve and start

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.050
to generalize on examples
that they haven't seen before.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.640
With more data, they're able
to generate better predictions.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.447
Does anybody remember how they
learned their first language?

00:25:41.447 --> 00:25:43.530
Your parents probably
didn't give you a dictionary

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.000
and a bunch of grammar books.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.140
That would be weird.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.780
Instead, you learned
over time, after being

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.890
exposed to many examples.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.220
So for example, if you
had pierogies for dinner--

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.660
since we're in Poland--

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.220
you saw them on your plate.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.480
You heard your
parents identify them.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.860
And over time, this strengthened
certain pathways in your brain

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.792
so that the next time
you had them for dinner,

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.250
it triggered the
part of your brain

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.160
that told you, that's a pierogi.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.316
And that's roughly how
machine learning works, too.

00:26:11.316 --> 00:26:15.220
To summarize, machine
learning is loosely based

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.730
on how the human brain learns,
with mathematical neurons that

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.920
mimic the neurons in our brain.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.350
These neurons take
a vector as input,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.250
transform those values,
and then output new values.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.100
And machine learning models
let you solve problems

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.950
without requiring you to know
exactly what the solution might

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.130
be.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.870
And again, as I
mentioned before,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.930
with more and more
data, these systems

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.072
are able to generate
better predictions.

00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:44.030
Now many people see the
term "machine learning"

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.270
and immediately think it's
something solely for experts.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.730
If we take a look
back 60 years ago,

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.410
this was definitely the case.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.400
This is a picture
of the Perceptron,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.810
the first neural network,
invented in 1957.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.540
It was an electronic device
that demonstrated the ability

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.610
to identify shapes.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.280
Back then, if you wanted to
work on machine learning,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.070
you needed access to extensive
academic and computing

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.510
resources.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.550
Let's fast forward to today.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.640
At Google, even just
since 2012, the number

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.740
of products using
machine learning

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.632
has grown dramatically.

00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:21.840
But at Google, we don't
think machine learning should

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.760
be something just for experts.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.160
We want to put machine learning
into the hands of every

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.220
developer and data scientist--
that's all of you--

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.320
with a computer and a
machine learning problem

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.190
they want to solve.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.410
On Google Cloud Platform,
we've got two ways

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.350
to help you integrate ML
into your own applications.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.810
First, if you're new
to machine learning,

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.120
we have six pre-trained
APIs to give you

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.760
access to machine learning
models with a single REST API

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.020
request.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.900
And second, if you want
to use your own data

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.210
to build and train a
model from scratch,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.610
we have a variety of tools
to help you do that as well.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.650
Let's start with these
pre-trained APIs.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.570
We have a growing
number of models

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.760
that have already been
trained and are continuously

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.570
being updated using Google's own
domain expertise and data sets.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.280
For example, the Speech API
lets developers implement

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.560
speech-to-text
transcription functionality

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.162
into their own applications,
similar to OK Google.

00:28:20.162 --> 00:28:21.870
I'm going to talk
about all of these APIs

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.420
in detail later today
during my breakout session.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.840
So for now, I want to give you
a demo of just one of them.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.590
I'm going to pick one at random.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.170
I'm going to go with the Vision
API, which lets developers

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.755
better understand their images.

00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:37.130
You can try out all of our
machine learning APIs directly

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.250
in the browser using your own
images, text, or video content.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.010
So here, I can upload
an image and see

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.930
what the Vision API responds.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.280
So if I click on this, I'm
going to choose a selfie that I

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.760
took yesterday in Krakow.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.050
It's a little silly.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.380
We're going to see what
the Vision API responds.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.040
So we can see that it's
able to identify landmarks.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.695
Landmark detection is one of
the features of the Vision API.

00:28:59.695 --> 00:29:01.070
It knows the name
of the building

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.110
I'm standing in
front of, and it also

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.870
is able to identify
Main Market Square.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.090
The face detection
endpoint identifies my face

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:10.990
in the image.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:15.250
And it's also able to identify
the emotions joy and surprise.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.032
I won't go over all of the
response types in the browser.

00:29:19.032 --> 00:29:21.490
But you can all try this out
with your own images if you go

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:27.544
to cloud.google.com/vision.

00:29:27.544 --> 00:29:28.960
So we've seen the
machine learning

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.390
APIs used across a
variety of industries

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.820
to accomplish common
machine learning tasks,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.190
like classifying
images, identifying

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.370
inappropriate content,
extracting subjects from a text

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.590
document, and more.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.390
But many of you
may have use cases

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.800
that go beyond these common
machine learning tasks.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.410
If you want to build ML models
trained on your own data

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.780
to perform custom tasks,
we've got products

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.820
to help you do that as well.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.610
We know that data is at the
core of any machine learning

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.490
problem.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.530
And you need a foundation
of good data to get started.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.850
So in order to help
you prepare your data,

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:08.230
we have tools to help ingest,
transform, clean, and store

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.510
your data on Google
Cloud Platform.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.140
Once your data is ready, you
can train, deploy, and serve

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.820
your models at scale on
managed Google infrastructure.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.160
In addition to all of
this, the Google Brain team

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.226
has provided an open source
library called TensorFlow.

00:30:26.226 --> 00:30:28.100
&gt;From the beginning, we
wanted to let everyone

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.270
in the industry benefit.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.600
So we made TensorFlow an open
source project on GitHub.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.540
And the uptake has
been phenomenal.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.750
TensorFlow is the most
popular ML project on GitHub,

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.390
with over 68,000 GitHub
stars and contributions

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.619
coming from many different
companies, not just Google.

00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:46.910
To give you a taste of what's
possible with TensorFlow,

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.911
I want to show you
TensorFlow Playground,

00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:51.035
a visualization of a neural
network in the browser.

00:30:54.546 --> 00:30:56.170
So the data set we're
working with here

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.719
is called Double Spiral.

00:30:57.719 --> 00:30:59.510
And the data here could
really be anything.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.060
We're just classifying it
into one of two categories.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.330
So let's say here we're
working with email data

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.490
that we're classifying as
either spam or not spam.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.250
So the orange dots
would indicate spam.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.070
The blue dots would
indicate not spam.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.080
And as humans, if we
take a new data point--

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.180
let's say we have a
data point right here--

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.820
we can almost immediately
classify that as spam,

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.380
as an orange dot.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.570
But it's much more difficult
to teach a computer

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.250
these underlying patterns.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.010
And before we start training,
our neural networks predictions

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.480
don't make too much sense.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.980
The background
color here indicates

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.230
the output or the
prediction of the network.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.360
So we can see here
that most orange dots

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.370
are being classified as blue.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.830
So if we start training, we
can see that slowly, our loss--

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.270
or error of our model--

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.680
is decreasing.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.840
And it's able to identify
some complex patterns

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.530
in our dataset.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.355
If we look at each
individual neuron,

00:31:49.355 --> 00:31:51.730
we see that they're performing
very simple classification

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.810
tasks.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.460
But as we move
through the network,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.130
it's slowly able to
identify complex patterns

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.270
in our dataset.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.070
And with more and
more training, we

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.500
can see that it's able to
identify this double spiral

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.700
pattern.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.980
So we see that as we
went through training,

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.480
our loss decreased.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.761
The accuracy of our
model increased.

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:12.010
And now it's able to classify
almost all of the points

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.287
in our data set correctly.

00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:15.870
I encourage all of
you to try this out

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.750
at playground.tensorflow.org.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.910
And in addition to being
a powerful framework,

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.760
TensorFlow is designed to
be able to run anywhere.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.460
You can not only run
TensorFlow models

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.020
on our fully managed
Cloud ML Engine,

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.970
you can run them on
your own servers,

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.840
in your own data centers, on
VMs and other cloud providers.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.109
And you can even compile
them down to ARM code

00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:39.400
and run them on mobile devices.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.110
If you want to utilize
Google's infrastructure

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.480
to ingest data,
train your model,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.600
and run predictions at scale,
we have Cloud Machine Learning

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.050
Engine.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.290
To use it, all you need to do
is prepare your training data

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.720
in Google Cloud
Storage or BigQuery,

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.360
write your TensorFlow
code locally, and then use

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.030
the Google Cloud CLI to
run training and prediction

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.480
jobs on ML Engine.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.500
And for compute-expensive
tasks like training a model,

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.680
ML Engine supports
GPUs, which lets

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.870
you significantly accelerate
your machine learning

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.480
workloads.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.970
You can go to this URL to
learn more about ML Engine.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.960
And there's one more thing
I'd like to share with you.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.790
One thing we know
to be true at Google

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.280
is that great software shines
brightest with great hardware

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.199
underneath.

00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:30.490
That's why we started a
project at Google several years

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.800
ago to see what we could
accomplish with our own custom

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.260
accelerators for machine
learning applications.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.710
And the result was a Tensor
Processing Unit, or TPU, which

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.370
we announced earlier
this year at Google I/O.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.900
The TPU is a custom chip
we built specifically

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.380
for machine learning and
tailored for TensorFlow.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.600
We've been running TPUs
inside our data centers

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.430
for more than a
year, and we've found

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.980
them to deliver an order of
magnitude better performance

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.630
per watt for machine learning.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.082
TPUs are currently in alpha.

00:34:00.082 --> 00:34:01.790
If you want to sign
up, you can head over

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.370
to cloud.google.com/tpu.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.290
And finally, if you
remember just one thing

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.230
from this presentation, remember
that our goal on Google Cloud

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.290
Platform is to democratize
machine learning.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.230
We want to make it accessible
not only to ML experts

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.449
but to developers
and data scientists.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.860
That's all of you.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.572
Thank you.

00:34:21.572 --> 00:34:23.030
Now I'd like to
hand it over to Tal

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.199
to talk about the
latest in mobile web.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.179
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.010
TAL OPPENHEIMER: Thanks, Sara.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.070
Hi, everyone.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.866
My name is Tal, from
the Chrome team.

00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:39.449
And I'm excited to
tell you about some

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.949
of the great
improvements we've made

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.530
on the web over the last year.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.120
The web is big.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.909
With over 2 billion
instances of Chrome,

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:51.030
we know that the web
has tremendous reach.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.190
But one of the true
strengths of the web

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.310
is that it's bigger
than a single browser.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.140
So regardless of
whether a device

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:01.920
is a smartphone or a
laptop or a desktop,

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.170
they all have a browser.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.800
So any web-based experience
is available on these billions

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.270
of devices today.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.320
And we've seen this have a
real impact on how many users

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.330
web apps are reaching.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.600
We've all seen how quickly
mobile has been growing.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.310
And native apps
have been growing

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.280
at an incredible pace with it.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.240
But what's really remarkable
is that even with the web's

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.720
large initial reach, we've
seen the average monthly web

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.980
audience growing even faster.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.710
And because of
this growth, we're

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.290
seeing the web expand
into new areas,

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.840
with experiences
like web VR being

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.970
built on the web platform.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.840
And the web continues to pop
up in more and more places,

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.120
even some you might not expect.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.200
We now see the web popping up on
watches, TVs, or even fridges.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.560
So with the web pretty
much everywhere,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.020
we're constantly trying
to push the boundaries

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.150
on what it can actually do.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.070
Over the past
year, we've shipped

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:08.690
hundreds of additional APIs that
cover a range of capabilities,

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.630
from making it easy to
integrate payments into your web

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.030
experience to making
it possible to build

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:17.480
fully capable offline
media experiences directly

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.010
on the web.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.110
And with all of these
new experiences,

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:25.040
we've seen a massive growth in
experiences built on the web.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.680
Accelerated Mobile
Pages, or AMP,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.300
allows publishers to easily
create fast articles.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.960
And since launch, we've seen
this grow to over 2 billion AMP

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.810
pages across 900,000 domains.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.720
And beyond AMP pages,
the modern mobile web

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.770
also allows developers to
build rich mobile experiences

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:52.520
with something that we call
Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.880
PWAs are about helping
web developers leverage

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.550
the web's reach with
new capabilities

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.410
to build high-class,
immersive experiences.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:03.790
They can load quickly.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.960
They work offline.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.870
And they can even send
notifications to users.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.180
And we've seen a number of
amazing experiences taking

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.490
advantage of these
new capabilities.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.040
As just one example,
Twitter recently

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.760
launched a new web experience.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.880
Here, they have a polished,
fast, immersive experience

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.170
that works on any connection and
can send users notifications.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.690
And since it's built
completely on the web platform,

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.029
it's already accessible
on billions of devices.

00:37:32.029 --> 00:37:33.820
And with an immersive
experience like this,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.250
we also want to make sure that
it's really easy for users

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.160
to get back to it.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.320
Add to Homescreen has
existed for some time

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.800
and allows users to add any
experience to their Android

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.980
home screen.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.630
But with our improved
Add to Homescreen

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.690
flow, when you add a
PWA to your homescreen,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.210
it's fully integrated
into the platform

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.850
so that to users it feels
just like any other app

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.100
experience on their device.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.990
It'll appear in the
Android Launcher

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.450
alongside your other
apps, and it'll even

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.060
appear in Android Settings.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.750
But since it's a PWA,
it's inherently small.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.660
So users are able to get
an immersive experience

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.070
without requiring
additional storage space.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.270
And this fast,
integrated, improved Add

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.250
to Homescreen experience
is available now.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.900
With all of these
new capabilities,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.460
we've also been
working to make sure

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.590
that it's super easy
for web developers

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.630
to build these experiences.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.480
We'll be going into a lot
more detail about PWAs

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.240
throughout the web track
over the next two days,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.750
but no matter how you're
building your web app,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.650
Lighthouse is a tool
that can show you

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.970
how to improve your experience.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.960
Lighthouse is a Chrome
extension and command line

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.540
tool that quickly
audits your site

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.000
to identify how you
can improve your app's

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.010
performance, accessibility,
and progressive web appiness.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.060
And we're excited to announce
that as of M60, Lighthouse

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.220
is now integrated
into Chrome DevTools.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.100
So now, you can quickly see
how your website is doing

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.690
and what to do next
directly in Chrome.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.760
With all of these
tools, we've seen just

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.649
how easy it can be
for companies to take

00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.690
advantage of these new
capabilities for their web

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.980
experience.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.130
To give one example, there's
Trivago, a popular hotel

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.120
comparison site that recently
built a very polished PWA.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.340
It's an experience built
directly on the web,

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.400
so users can get to it easily.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.310
And with our new Add
to Homescreen flow,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.530
it can be easily accessed from
the App Launcher or the Android

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.780
homescreen.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.470
And when you open it, you
get a high-class, immersive

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.250
experience that can even
work if you're offline and is

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.010
built to be resilient against
different network conditions.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.800
So you get a seamless experience
when you go back online.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.580
But what's really incredible is
that this entire PWA experience

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.800
was built by three
core engineers

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.900
in just a couple of months.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.540
And this is just
one example of many.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.820
Leveraging the modern
mobile web is now

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.960
the norm around the world.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.500
Whether you're building
a PWA from scratch

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.510
or leveraging the
latest capabilities

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.480
on your existing web
experience, companies everywhere

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.840
are seeing a tangible
impact on their key metrics.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.230
With the modern mobile web,
it's possible to easily build

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.410
immersive, fully
capable experiences that

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.160
can reach billions of people
around the world today.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.050
And now, let's turn
our focus to what

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.090
we're doing to make it
easier to develop apps

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.110
and grow your business.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.300
Please welcome Francis.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.570
FRANCIS MA: Thanks, Tal.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.250
Hi, I'm Francis.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.470
And I lead the
Firebase Product team.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.620
Our mission is to help
developers build a better app

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.630
and grow a successful business.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:49.080
Since I/O 2016, we've
expanded Firebase

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.830
from a set of back-end services
to a broad mobile platform

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.740
to help solve many of
the common problems

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.690
you face across the
lifecycle of an app,

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.960
from helping you build faster
and easier with products

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.570
like real-time database
and Cloud storage,

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.110
to helping you better
understand and grow your app

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.060
with tools like Analytics
and Cloud Messaging.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.710
Whether you're
starting something new

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.140
or looking to extend
an existing app,

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.670
we're here to help
you so that you

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.950
can channel more of
your time and energy

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.950
towards creating
value for your users.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:24.150
And we deliver all of this
in a single, easy-to-use SDK

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.920
available across platforms.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.440
To date, there are over
1 million developers

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.850
using Firebase.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:32.710
And we're humbled
so many of you have

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.900
taken this journey with us.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.850
We're deeply
committed to Firebase,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.560
and we're doubling
down on our efforts

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.420
to help developers succeed.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.835
On that note,
earlier this year, we

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:47.000
were excited to have the
Fabric team join us at Google.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.820
Since launching
Crashlytics at 2011,

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.460
our teams have shared
a very similar mission.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.270
And now, we're working together
to integrate our two platforms

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.750
and bring you the best of
both in a thoughtful way.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.220
One of the first
steps we're taking

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.740
is to bring
Crashlytics to Firebase

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.740
to make that our flagship
crash-reporting product.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.740
If you're an existing customer
of Fabric or Firebase,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.740
we're going to be paving a
smooth transition path for you

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.630
over the coming months.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.090
We've also been working
closely with the Digits team

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.900
to bring the next evolution
of phone-number sign-in

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.280
to Firebase authentication.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.590
With it, you can
extend your app,

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.930
enable users to sign
in with a phone number.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:32.610
They just need to do a one-time
verification, and they're in.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.620
With Firebase Auth,
we also provide

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.920
a headless API so that
you can have full control

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.760
and customize the UI to fit
the look and feel of your app.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.280
In addition to
integrating with Fabric,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.280
we've also made many
updates over the last year.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.380
And I'd like to highlight
a few of these for you.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.470
One of our goals at
Firebase is to save you

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.180
from managing servers
so that you can

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.250
focus on building great apps.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.020
And to help with
this, we've released

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.480
Cloud Functions for Firebase.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.400
With Cloud Functions,
you can deploy

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.910
JavaScript code to
the Cloud and have

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.230
that triggered based
on an HTTP request

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.380
or with other events
happening across Firebase.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.160
For example, you can set up
a function with Firebase Auth

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.040
to automatically send a push
notification through FCM

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.210
when a new user signs
up or, say, set up

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.681
a function with
storage so that you

00:43:23.681 --> 00:43:25.180
can do some
service-side processing,

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.180
like machine learning, when
a new image is uploaded.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.550
Or you can also use
Functions with Hosting

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.460
to create a fully dynamic
website without managing

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.870
any servers.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.940
Functions is a great
way to extend your app

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.444
and enables true
serverless development.

00:43:41.444 --> 00:43:43.200
So we just talked
about how Firebase

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.820
helps you build more easily.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.320
Let's switch gears
to talk about how

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.180
it can help you build
better and really

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.310
focus on your app quality.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.320
Now as developers, we
spend a lot of time

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.760
optimizing and testing our apps.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.550
But when we release
our apps in the wild,

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.730
sometimes end users experience
something entirely different

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.100
based on the diversity of
devices or network conditions.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.650
And when our apps
don't perform well,

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.050
it's frustrating for everyone.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.210
And that's why we've
released Firebase Performance

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.404
Monitoring.

00:44:10.404 --> 00:44:11.820
You can add
Performance Monitoring

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.100
with one line of code,
and it will automatically

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.670
measure your app's startup
time and network latency.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.890
You can then also add
additional custom traces

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.820
to measure the timing across at
different points in your app.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.000
You can drill in
deeper to filter

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.750
your data based on the country,
app version, or device type

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.320
to get a sense of how users are
really experiencing your app

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.750
and not just on
your office Wi-Fi.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:40.080
Performance Monitoring is a
nice compliment to Crashlytics

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.020
and Analytics to help you
better understand and find

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.880
those bottlenecks that
could be impacting

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.630
your user engagement or even
your business bottom line.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.780
Speaking of Analytics, we've
also made a number of updates

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.250
on this front.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.130
Earlier in the year, we
released StreamView to give you

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.830
a real-time view of how
users are interacting

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.590
with your app across the world.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.410
We've also added custom
parameter reporting

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.510
to give you the next
level of insights,

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.670
in addition to the
events that you logged.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.280
For example, let's
say that you log

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.290
the events that are
happening when a user pass

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.490
a round in your game.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.160
Now you can also get reports
to the custom parameters,

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.060
like the type of
game that was played

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.020
or the average number of
coins they were awarded.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.000
We've also worked
with the AdMob team

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.490
to give you insights
to which ad on which

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.240
screen are earning you the most
so that you can really optimize

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.330
both your ad revenue, along
with your user engagement,

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.290
with the broader Analytics
insights that you get.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.420
We've also enhanced
our experience

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.480
with BigQuery, where you
can export your Analytics

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.080
events in raw, join it
with custom data sets,

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.000
and perform ad hoc analysis.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.650
It's super powerful.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.890
With BigQuery, you can
also use it with DataStudio

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.070
to create your own custom
visualizations and reports.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.560
Essentially, you can
build your own analytics

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.760
UI the way you need.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.740
In addition to
building features,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.110
we've also recently
launched a Firebase Alpha

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:10.680
Program that gives access
to unreleased products.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.070
And this is a great opportunity
to provide early feedback

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.840
and help shape Firebase.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.960
Incorporating customer feedback
is a key part of our product

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.560
development process.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.730
And we look forward to hearing
from developers like you.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.380
Just sign up at the URL.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.240
Now we just shared
some of the updates

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.430
we've made since last year.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.160
To learn even more and here
where we've been up to,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.460
we'll be hosting the Firebase
Dev Summit in Amsterdam

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.170
at the end of October.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.710
You can learn more about the
event a firebase.google.com,

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:44.050
and I look forward to
see many of you there.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:45.840
I look forward to
hearing your feedback

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.320
and continue to work hard to
help you build a better app

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.250
and grow a more
successful business.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:51.750
Thank you.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.035
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:54.534 --> 00:46:57.260
And now I'd like to
bring Jason back on.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.110
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.850
JASON TITUS: Thanks, Francis.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.280
As you can see, we're
continuing to work

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.040
hard to improve the developer
experience for Google's

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.600
products.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.220
Tomorrow morning,
you'll hear more

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.380
about the products our
engineering teams at Google

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.460
are building here in
Europe, whether it's

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.510
our Compression
team in Switzerland,

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.140
amazing compiler and
language work in Denmark,

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.920
or our Cloud team in Poland
that's scaling the cloud.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.840
You'll also have the
opportunity to dive

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.640
deep into a number
of our products

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.490
covering Android to
Firebase to the mobile web.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.660
We'll have Sandboxes to help you
experience products firsthand,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.820
instructor-led
trainings and Code Labs

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.970
to get you trained and running
on our latest APIs today.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:54.360
In addition to all of this, we
have a large number of Googlers

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.940
who are available for
one-on-one consultations

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.720
through office hours.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.300
Not only can they help you
understand our products,

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:06.287
but more importantly, they're
here to get your feedback.

00:48:06.287 --> 00:48:08.620
I do have one other thing to
mention before you head out

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.770
to the breakout sessions today.

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:12.990
Last year, we
partnered with Udacity

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.540
to provide 10,000
Android scholarships

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.330
to European developers.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.820
And we were overwhelmed by
the demand for the scholarship

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.010
and were truly amazed by
some of the stories that

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.760
came out of it.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.490
Let's take a look
at Ildiko's story,

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.160
a former literature
teacher turned coder.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.682
Play the video.

00:50:16.955 --> 00:50:19.937
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:24.835 --> 00:50:26.210
JASON TITUS: So
Ildiko's story is

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.300
just one of many that motivates
us to continue programs

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.980
like this.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.370
That's why today I'm excited to
announce that we're extending

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.520
our partnership with Udacity to
begin the Udacity Scholarship

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.540
Challenge, this time with
enough space for 60,000

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.340
aspiring developers
across Europe

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.476
and select parts of AMEA.

00:50:45.476 --> 00:50:48.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.590
And we're also
expanding the scope

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.250
to include both Android
and mobile web development.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.260
So please visit the website
to sign up and learn more.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.230
So as you heard from
the speakers today,

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.530
we're really excited
about the possibilities

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.677
for developers to build
some truly amazing things.

00:51:13.677 --> 00:51:16.260
We're looking forward to getting
to know you over the next two

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.110
days and hear
what's on your mind.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.970
Thank you, and have fun.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:21.870
