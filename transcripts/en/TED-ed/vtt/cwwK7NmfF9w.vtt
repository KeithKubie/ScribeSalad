00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.649
Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.650
because he knows aliens will arrive
to abduct him in one hour.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.602
He knows the aliens are coming because
he has become “unstuck” in time,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:23.843
causing him to experience
events out of chronological order.

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:27.573
Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s 
Slaughterhouse-five,

00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:31.710
he hops back and forth between a childhood
trip to the Grand Canyon,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.443
his life as a middle-aged optometrist,

00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:37.378
his captivity in an intergalactic zoo,

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:42.103
the humiliations he endured
as a war prisoner, and more.

00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:45.444
The title of Slaughterhouse-five and 
much of its source material

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:49.528
came from Vonnegut’s own 
experiences in World War II.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:54.485
As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former
slaughterhouse in Dresden,

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:57.480
where he took refuge in an 
underground meat locker

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.382
while Allied forces bombed the city.

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:03.343
When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged,

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:07.038
they found Dresden utterly demolished.

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.693
After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:14.055
by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology:

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:15.823
the shapes of stories,

00:01:15.823 --> 00:01:21.101
which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.340
To find the shape, he graphed the main 
character’s fortune

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.254
from the beginning to the end of a story.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:32.345
The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:34.986
that echo through many cultures.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:38.821
But this shape can be
the most interesting of all.

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.111
In a story like this,

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:44.590
it’s impossible to distinguish the 
character’s good fortune from the bad.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.487
Vonnegut thought this kind of story 
was the truest to real life,

00:01:48.487 --> 00:01:51.864
in which we are all the victims 
of a series of accidents,

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:55.889
unable to predict how events 
will impact us long term.

00:01:55.889 --> 00:02:01.040
He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.389
and he set out to explore the ambiguity

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.986
between good and bad fortune
in his own work.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:09.329
When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes,

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.707
he also abandoned
straightforward chronology.

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:16.610
Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.019
“All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.”

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.833
Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books,

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.474
see all moments at once.

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.796
They “can see where each star has been
and where it is going,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:38.688
so that the heavens are filled
with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.”

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:40.750
But although they can see all of time,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.936
they don’t try to change 
the course of events.

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:47.891
While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency,

00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:51.825
Vonnegut’s human characters are 
still getting used to it.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:53.580
In The Sirens of Titan,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.218
when they seek the meaning of life
in the vastness of the universe,

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:02.375
they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.”

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:07.388
Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,”

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:12.120
a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.323
but can’t change the course of events.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:18.831
Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:23.931
that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.”

00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:28.405
In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters 
turn to a different source of meaning:

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.669
Bokonism,

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.546
a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies.

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.082
Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies,

00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:40.847
they live their lives by 
these tenets anyway,

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:44.007
and in so doing develop
some genuine hope.

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:48.072
They join together in groups called 
Karasses, which consist of people we

00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:51.686
“find by accident but […] 
stick with by choice”—

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:54.721
cosmically linked around
a shared purpose.

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:57.338
These are not to be confused 
with Granfalloons,

00:03:57.338 --> 00:04:02.380
groups of people who appoint significance
to actually meaningless associations,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.375
like where you grew up, political 
parties, and even entire nations.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:12.553
Though he held a bleak view of the human 
condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:17.719
“we are all here to help each other get
through this thing, whatever it is."

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.781
We might get pooped and demoralized,

00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:22.593
but Vonnegut interspersed 
his grim assessments

00:04:22.593 --> 00:04:25.416
with more than a few morsels of hope.

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:30.136
His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable:

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:34.782
two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:39.416
as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.359
Because of their limited intelligence,

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:46.667
they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.”

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.756
In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around,

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.428
in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence,

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:57.464
Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.652
that we might end up 
making something good.

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:03.750
And if that isn’t nice, what is?
