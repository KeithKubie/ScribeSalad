00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:02.466
In this video I'm going to
work through the exact same

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.421
scenario that we saw in the last video

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.069
but it will be a little bit more mathy.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:07.257
The reason why I'm going to make it

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:08.207
a little bit more mathy

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.599
is so that you see it's a same idea

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.531
it's just going to have a
little bit more cryptic notation

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:12.668
but it allows us to generalize

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:15.966
the ideas that we saw in the last video.

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.131
Let's just assume, instead of saying

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.621
that the marginal propensity to consume

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.739
in our little island is .6,

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.814
let's just say our marginal
propensity to consume is C.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.666
What we want to do is
we want to figure out,

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.645
given some initial change in expenditure

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:34.537
and this guy's change in expenditure

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:35.710
will be this guy's change in income.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.066
That cycle is round and round

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.044
due to the multiplier effect.

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:44.262
What is going to be the
total change in our GDP?

00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:45.463
This is what we care about,

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:51.543
we care about our total change in the GDP.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:55.140
Y could be viewed as expenditure

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.396
or it could be viewed as income

00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:58.460
depending on how you think about things.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.224
Let's say this guy, instead
of saying that's he's going to

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:01.641
spend all in the thousand dollars,

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:05.476
let's just call his incremental
change in expenditure,

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:09.551
let's just call that delta Y nought.

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.992
Delta just means change in,

00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:14.328
and Y, we could view this
as aggregate expenditure.

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:15.596
I'm putting this little zero here.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.326
This is our first iteration,

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:20.220
this is the first time that
we're doing one these deltas.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.725
Then as we keep doing them
we're going to have Y1,

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:26.455
Y2, Y3 and so on and so forth.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.658
If we think about the total change in GDP,

00:01:28.658 --> 00:01:30.265
you're definitely going to have this.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:31.868
In the last example this was $1000.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:33.656
This guy is $1000 expenditures,

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.784
this guy is a $1000 income.

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:38.615
Then you have delta Y nought.

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.116
Then we saw that this guy,

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:43.203
his marginal propensity to consume is C.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.653
He's going to spend of the income he gets,

00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:47.720
he's going to spend C times that.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.055
He's now going to do Delta Y1.

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:55.955
This is the next incremental
bump in our GDP we're seeing

00:01:55.955 --> 00:02:00.389
and that's going to be equal
to C times what he just got.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.613
Now, after doing the zero
iteration in the first iteration

00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:09.423
our total change is going to be ...

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:10.211
Actually let me write it this way,

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:15.382
times delta Y1, and delta Y1,
this is just the same thing

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:19.987
as C x delta Y nought.

00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:21.258
It's fancy notation

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:22.736
but it's just saying
something fairly basic,

00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:25.227
The exact same thing that
we said in the last video.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:26.983
Now this guy, all of a sudden,

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:28.998
above and beyond what he spent
in that zeroth iteration,

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:31.070
he's now getting delta Y1.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.269
He has a marginal propensity to consume,

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.734
we're just assuming of C.

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:36.932
Now he is going to spend C times that.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.669
He's now going to make an expenditure of,

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.666
I'll do this just in the same color,

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.147
he's now going to do delta Y2

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.558
which is equal to C x delta Y1.

00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:51.975
Now we have delta Y2,
this new incremental bump

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:53.477
and they're getting smaller
and smaller and smaller

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.404
but we can go an infinite number of times.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:56.666
Just to remember what this is,

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:01.644
delta Y2 is the same
thing as C x delta Y1.

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:09.199
Delta Y1 is the same thing
as C x delta Y nought.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.225
So this thing right over here,

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:13.736
this whole thing could be written as

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:17.933
C^2 x delta Y nought.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:23.818
This right over here C x delta Y nought.

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.866
This of course is equal to,
this is just delta Y nought.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:29.066
We can just keep going.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:32.133
If this guy would then get this amount

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.401
and he'll spent C times that to the farmer

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:36.139
and so if we had a Y3,

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.466
it would just amount to C times this

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:42.217
which is C^3 x delta Y nought

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:43.866
and we could keep going on and on and on

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:45.137
an infinite number of time

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.001
but each of these terms are
going to smaller and smaller

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.532
because we're going to assume,

00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:50.733
in order for this to actually work,

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:56.067
we're going to assume
that C is between 0 and 1.

00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:57.640
Obviously, when someone gets new income

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.733
and thinking of the simple case,

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:01.539
someone is not going to spend more,

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.556
the marginal propensity to consume,

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:06.402
they can't spend more than they just got.

00:04:06.402 --> 00:04:08.306
In general they're not going
to spend the whole thing.

00:04:08.306 --> 00:04:10.931
So we're going to assume
that it is less than 1.

00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.734
This is exactly the same idea
that we did in the last one

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:14.808
but now it is general

00:04:14.808 --> 00:04:17.003
and we can simplify this a
little bit mathematically.

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:23.040
This is all equal to our
delta Y, our total bump in GDP

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.069
due to that initial spark.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.133
If we factor that initial spark out

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.413
with the delta Y nought.

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:31.470
Actually, let me do
that in different color

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.201
just so the math becomes clear.

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.612
We have the delta Y
nought, delta Y nought,

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:37.952
delta Y nought, delta Y nought.

00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:40.068
When I say nought, I'm talking
about that zero subscript.

00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:45.648
If we factor that our, we
get our total bump in GDP.

00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:47.006
Whether you want to do
this output, expenditure

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:51.468
or income, is equal to, we're
going to factor that out,

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:54.203
the delta Y nought times,

00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:56.133
and then we're just left with,

00:04:56.133 --> 00:05:00.704
you factor the change in
Y nought here you get 1

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:07.064
and then over here, + C + C^2 + C^3

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:09.737
and you go on and on and on.

00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:12.294
In the last video I told you
that this right over here

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:16.935
is going to simplify to 1 over 1 - C.

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:19.954
This is equal to, this
part over here is equal to

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:22.801
1 over 1 - C.

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:24.468
Now, you might have not been satisfied

00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:26.292
and since this is a more mathy video

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.003
it's a good place to actually show you

00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:31.806
that it would sum up to 1 over 1 - C.

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.791
Not to introduce too many variables,

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:36.138
but let's just call this thing X.

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:40.801
Let's just say that X is
equal to this whole thing

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:42.378
right over here.

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:46.627
It's equal 1 + C + C^2 + C^3,

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:49.210
so on and so forth.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.138
Now let's imagine what we would get

00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:53.068
if we multiply X x C.

00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:54.665
What happens if I multiply,

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:56.135
and I'll do this in a different color.

00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:59.206
What happens if I multiply C x X?

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:00.705
Well then, each of these terms

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:02.733
I can multiply by C.

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:08.672
1 x C is C, C x C is C^2, C^2 x C is C^3,

00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:13.265
C^3 x C is C^4, so on and so forth.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.347
Now, what happens if I
subtract this from that?

00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:20.278
If I subtract the left hand sides

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:28.600
I get X - CX on the left hand side.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.925
I'll do that in that pink color.

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:32.787
Where did it go?

00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:34.534
Actually I think I changed
the color on my ...

00:06:34.534 --> 00:06:38.367
I'll just write X - CX and
that's going to be equal to,

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:40.802
if you subtract this stuff
from that stuff over there,

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:43.869
you have a C - C, they'll cancel out.

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.271
Let me do this in yellow.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.364
C^2 - C^2, that will cancel out.

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:49.201
C^3 - C^3, that would cancel out.

00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:51.664
Every term other than 1
is going to cancel out.

00:06:51.664 --> 00:06:53.136
Everything is going to cancel out

00:06:53.136 --> 00:06:54.864
and you're just going to
be left with the 1 here

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:57.531
which is a pretty neat trick in my mind.

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.951
Then we can factor out
the X right over here.

00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:04.334
You get X x 1 - C = 1

00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:06.465
and then you divide both sides by 1 - C,

00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:09.536
you get X = 1 over 1 - C.

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:12.266
X was exactly this thing right over here.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:17.669
This thing is equal to 1 over 1 - C.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.296
This right here, we just showed you

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:23.214
exactly what we told you in the last video

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:26.333
that the total bump in GDP,

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.294
this right over here,

00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:29.376
you could view this as
the total bump in GDP

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:32.069
is going to be equal to
that initial bump in GDP

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:33.999
which we called delta Y nought.

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.714
That was that initial spending

00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:39.871
that that farmer did and
the builders initial income,

00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:41.467
that the total bump is going to be equal

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:44.667
to that initial bump times this expression

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.734
which we view as the multiplier.

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:48.803
This is the multiplier right here

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:52.133
is a function of the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:56.467
This right over here, let me label it all.

00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:57.736
Actually, let me just rewrite it.

00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:01.667
The total bump in our
aggregate expenditure

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:04.138
or output or income

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:07.906
is going to be equal to the initial bump

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:11.532
times the multiplier which
ends up being a function

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.123
of our marginal propensity to consume.

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:20.852
This right over here is our multiplier

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:21.939
and this right over here is,

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:23.679
you could view that as our initial bump.

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:25.133
Just to make sure that it works out

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:26.347
from what we saw in the last video.

00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:28.685
In the last video our
marginal propensity to consume

00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:30.763
was .6.

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:36.091
C was 0.6 and our initial bump,

00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:39.682
our initial expenditure
was equal to 1,000.

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:42.465
If you put .6 in here you will get 2.5

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:44.345
and so you get the exact same multiplier

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:47.013
and you get the exact
same total bump in GDP

00:08:47.013 --> 00:08:48.425
as we got in the last video.

00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:50.067
At least now we have a little general

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:51.932
and you're hopefully a
little bit more comfortable

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.806
with some of these
notation that I'm using.

00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:55.538
Unfortunately, you'll
see different notation

00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:57.408
almost every economics textbook.

00:08:57.408 --> 00:08:58.432
I just want to make sure

00:08:58.432 --> 00:09:02.000
that this makes reasonable sense to you.
