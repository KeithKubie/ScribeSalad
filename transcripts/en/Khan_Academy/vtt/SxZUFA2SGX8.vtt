00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
Welcome to the presentation
on adding decimals.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's do some problems.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:21.840
So let's say I had 0.008--
that's an 8-- 5 plus-- and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:33.260
I'm writing it side by
side on purpose-- 1.799.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.250
So at first you're like,
these decimals, they

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.110
confuse me, I give up.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.750
But I'm going to show you
that it's actually very

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080
straightforward and it's
actually no more difficult

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.200
than doing normal addition.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.340
And there's only one thing
you have to think about

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.630
when you do decimals.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.350
You have to line up
the decimal points.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.465
So let's start with the first
number and let's rewrite it so

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:54.750
that we can actually
do the math.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.740
0.0085.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.050
Now for the second number let's
put the decimal point right

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.120
below where that first decimal
is on the top number, and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.110
then rewrite the number.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.920
So it's 1.799.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.050
So all we did is we just
rewrote both numbers with their

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.230
decimal points lined up.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.320
And we could've
flipped them around.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.570
We could've written the 1.799
first and the 0.0085 below it.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.860
What's key-- and if you get
this point and you already know

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.810
how to do addition, you've
already figured out how to do

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.350
adding decimals-- is that you
line up the decimal points.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.810
So once we line up the
decimal points we're

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.990
ready to start adding.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.440
But hey Sal, there's
something very strange

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.600
here you might say.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.540
How can I add this
5 to a nothing?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.960
Well there's a very
easy solution to that.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870
Let's just put a 0 right here.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.160
And how can I do that?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.440
How can I just randomly
augment a number with a 0?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.840
Well, I don't know if I've
already shown you in another

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.930
module, but when you add
trailing 0's to decimals, it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.230
doesn't really change the
value of the decimal.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.500
And I think that
make sense to you.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.570
If I said 1.10 that that's
the same thing as 1.1.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.120
Which is the same
thing as 1.100.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.720
It's all 1 and 1/10.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.820
And these 0's just kind of add
extra digits of precision,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.570
which actually, don't
change the actual value.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.510
And maybe later when I'm
teaching computer programming

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.110
and computation, the
precision might matter.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.140
But for now, it doesn't.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.210
It's just the value.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480
So I added this 0 here and
you can always do that.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.600
You can add trailing 0's
without actually changing

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.850
the value of the number.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.880
And now we're really
ready to add.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.380
5 plus 0 is 5.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.375
8 plus 9 is 17.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.730
1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.020
Carry the 1.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.110
1 plus 0 plus 7 is 8.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.690
And then bring down
this 1 because there's

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.830
nothing to add it to.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.350
And we could have even
added a leading zero

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.630
here if you wanted to.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.680
My wife's a doctor and she says
it's key that you always add

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.740
that leading 0 so that no one
gives someone the wrong

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.355
amount of medicine.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:07.850
But anyway, so now
we are almost done.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.730
We've done the addition and now
we just have to figure out

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.470
where to put the decimal point.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.496
Well, the decimal point
just drops straight down.

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.020
And we're able to do that
because we already lined

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.870
up the decimal points.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.160
So the answer to this
problem is 1.8075.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.150
It seems complicated, but all
you have to do, line up the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.115
decimal points, add 0's
where appropriate, and add.

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:31.900
And if you know how to add you
already know how to do this.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.760
Let's do another problem.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:49.360
58.75 plus 0.028.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.240
Now if you saw a problem like
this written in this format,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.250
your temptation might be to
immediately start adding.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.550
Add the 5 to the 8, the 7
to the 2, the 8 to the 0.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.090
And then just bring down the 5
or something of that nature.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.750
And you would be wrong.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.410
And I think you realize
why you'd be wrong.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.970
Because you forgot
the first step.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.360
The first step is line
up the decimal points.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.930
When you're doing addition with
decimals, the number one step

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.740
is line up the decimal points.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.220
So let's line up the
decimal points.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.010
So we can just rewrite
that top number again.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.350
58.75.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.180
And now let's rewrite the
bottom number so that the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.700
decimal points line up.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.300
So we'll put the decimal
points right below it.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.270
And it's 0.028.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.570
And now we can add.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.280
And just like before you
might say, how can I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.610
add nothing to this 8?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.150
We can add a trailing 0 to this
top number because it really

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.280
doesn't change the value of
the number and now it kind of

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.340
gives us a sense of security.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.840
We have something
to add to the 8.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.900
So let's do that.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.910
0 plus 8 is 8.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.370
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.280
7 plus 0 is 7.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.970
8 plus blank space is 8.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.720
And we could have added a 0
there and it would've been the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.290
same thing, had the leading 0.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.550
We wouldn't have given someone
the wrong about of medicine.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.150
5 plus blank space is 5.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.990
And we just drop down that
decimal point, and we're done.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.410
It's that straightforward.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.320
You line up the decimal points,
add any 0's that might make you

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.510
feel more comfortable because
it's often more comfortable to

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.720
add to a 0 than to add
to a blank space.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.610
And then you do your addition
and then you drop down

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.260
the decimal point.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.370
The answer is 58.778.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.920
And it's always good to kind
of do a reality check.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.060
To say, well, does my
answer make sense?

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.680
I have 58.75, so
roughly 58, almost 59.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.750
58 and 3/4.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.030
And I'm adding a very
small number to it.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.140
I'm adding 0.028.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.900
So my answer shouldn't
change much I guess is the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.600
way you could view it.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.890
It should still be around 58
something because I'm only

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.650
adding a very small amount.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.640
If you had done it this way and
you had just started adding

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.680
immediately, you would
have gotten 59.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.140
something.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.500
And you're like, boy, but I
only added 0.028 not 0.28.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.710
And you would've been a little
bit suspicious of your answer.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.690
I hope I didn't confuse you,
but it's really healthy to

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.800
always think about the
magnitude of your numbers and

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.770
get a feel for just what you
are adding and not always

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.810
do it purely mechanical.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.200
Although sometimes it is fun
just to chug through things.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.880
Now let's do one more problem
just for good measure.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.605
I have some time
left on the video.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:48.070
102.1 plus 2.56.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.360
So once again, think
about magnitude.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.020
102.1 plus 2.56, that
should be like 104.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.720
something.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.580
I won't do it in my head.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.640
We'll do it on paper.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.460
So first thing, we line
up the decimal points.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:08.630
102.1 plus-- line up the
decimal points-- 2.56.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.170
Now we could add a trailing 0
here and we're ready to add.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.510
0 plus 6 is 6.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.760
1 plus 5 is 6.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.260
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.000
0 plus nothing is 0.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.380
1 plus nothing is 1.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.120
Bring down that decimal point.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.330
104.66.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.400
It was that easy.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.050
Hopefully it's easy.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.480
I don't want to make you think
that it's easy if you're

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.360
finding it hard because
it actually is hard the

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.510
first time you do it.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.390
But anyway, I think you're
ready now to try the module

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.500
on adding decimals.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.470
I hope you have fun.
