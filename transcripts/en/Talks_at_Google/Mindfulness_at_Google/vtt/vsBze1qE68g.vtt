[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.750
EARL J. WAGNER: We'll be talking
about a recent innovation

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.670
of an action course online.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.460
And so just to give a little
bit of background for you,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.940
Thom, that you had
worked as an engineer

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.800
in environmental engineering
and had worked in the '80s,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.150
bringing your crew
there, doing trainings

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.180
for Fortune 500 companies.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.630
And then, I guess it
was about early 2000s,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.590
you discovered the
Approach the Practices

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.720
promoted by Marshall Rosenberg.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.310
So nonviolent communication.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.880
And it led to a big shift in
your career and your work.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.590
So maybe we can start there.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.661
THOM BOND: Yeah, it was right
around the turn of the century.

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:54.320
I read a book called
"Non-Violent Communication--

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.340
A Language of Life."

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.344
By the time I finished reading
chapter 1, it kind of hit me.

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:07.336
I'd found what I
was looking for.

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:12.280
And what I was looking
for was like a skill set,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880
a set of concepts,
ideas, that we

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.670
could use to actually get
along better, frankly,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.538
just to be able to
move through conflict.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.817
And I'd been looking
for a long time

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.150
and hadn't found anything
that really resonated with me.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.150
And then I read this book, and
kind of the rest was history.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.120
When I read the
book, I was involved

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.954
in actually alternative energy.

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:35.870
And we were applying--

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.560
I had an energy
services company.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.380
And we would apply technology
to buildings, basically.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.790
And so when I saw this,
actually I sold my company,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.430
because I thought this was
really exciting that I could

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
apply this new
technology that we call

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.480
nonviolent communication
or it's also called

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.220
compassionate communication.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.350
So I was really excited about
using this new technology,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.770
which is obviously
more human-oriented

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.286
as opposed to building-oriented.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.910
EARL J. WAGNER: Sure,
so kind of seeing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.080
some of the same approaches
in terms of thinking

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680
of engineering in
terms of buildings

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.870
or like creating
artifacts in the world,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.953
and then actually noticing
some of the connections

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.950
or noticing some of the
patterns or approaches

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.590
that you were discovering
with and we see.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.370
Is that right?

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.340
THOM BOND: Yeah.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.010
It was very specific.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.830
And really what
Marshall Rosenberg,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610
the guy who wrote that
book, had discovered it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.820
over a 30 year period.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.020
He had been studying
what connects people

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.770
and what disconnects people.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.890
And so he had really
just kind of sussed

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.790
out that when we can
pay attention to,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.040
what we can bring our focus to
our needs, which are universal,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.634
our universal human needs,
that when we do that,

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:05.424
we're way more likely to be
able to understand one another.

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:07.340
EARL J. WAGNER: That's
helpful to actually get

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.480
to the core of this approach.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.290
And so we do actually
have some needs over here.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.880
And maybe you can
share more about

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.970
what's that all about for people
who aren't familiar with this.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.410
THOM BOND: Well
one of the things

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.100
we do is we define
needs very specifically.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.450
And it's not like I need a
car or I need a house or a I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.510
need a spouse.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.134
It's really, what is it
that motivates us to do--

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.300
actually you could look at
this as what motivates us

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.560
to do every single thing we do.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.724
In other words, we can
look at all human behavior

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:45.280
from a perspective of need.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.840
And in other words
no matter what

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.840
you're doing, whether
it's scratching your head

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.650
or bombing a building,
the idea is that we're

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.720
in pursuit of our needs.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.180
We're trying to
fulfill our needs.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.910
And what's so
important about that is

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.650
that it is universally human.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.680
It's not cultural.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.800
Needs are not cultural.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.600
We are born with them.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.700
And so as you can see, we look
at these words, none of these

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.579
are the ways we meet needs.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.050
They're actually the
needs themselves.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.649
And so when we start
looking at our behavior

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.946
from this perspective,
I can relate to you

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:29.700
no matter what you've done,
because we have the same needs.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.240
So it created a
common ground for us

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.402
to be able to begin the
process of conflict resolution.

00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:40.110
EARL J. WAGNER: And
so going back to kind

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.651
of your own history,
that's something

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:43.280
that you found so
transformative.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.430
You mentioned having your
alternative energy business,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.980
selling that, and
really diving in--

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.250
can you speak to you, were
there any stories or any times

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.160
that really sort
of opened your eyes

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.180
and really kind of
gave you this clarity?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.290
THOM BOND: Well yes.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.510
I mean in particular--

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.300
well first I'd like to
say, this technology

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.340
operates wherever
there are humans.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.970
So all of the different levels
of relationship that we have,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.800
this applies to, whether
we're nation to nation,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.180
tribe to tribe,
person in person.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.330
And so my first
experience of this

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.970
that was really moving for
me was actually my father--

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:35.610
we have a long history--
who is also an engineer.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.070
And we have this long history of
conversing in such a way that--

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.237
well, you know, it would be
like, "Thom, how's it going?",

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:46.191
my father would say.

00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:48.099
And I would say,
"Well, we're fine.

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.053
We're doing this.

00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:50.007
We're doing that."

00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:54.090
And in particular we
had just started NYCNVC

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.227
and I had this
conversation with him where

00:05:58.227 --> 00:05:59.310
he said, "How's it going?"

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.500
I said, "Well,
it's going great."

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.600
It's true, we had
a lot of activity.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.460
People were getting interested.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.080
And so he came back, as
he would normally do,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.140
and he'd say, "Well
Tom, that's great.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.120
But do you have
a business plan?"

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.815
And so I was like, "Yes, we
do have a business plan."

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:28.040
And he was like, "Oh, that's
great, because you know,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.010
you've got to have
a business plan.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.770
Is it in writing?"

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.960
So we had had this conversation
for decades, literally decades.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.960
So I would tell him
what I was doing.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.960
He would tell me what
I was doing wrong.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.612
And so this went on.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.876
So I was like, "Yes, we
have a business plan.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:47.750
And it's in writing."

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.700
He says, "Well that's good.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.005
Does your business plan
have a Gantt chart?

00:06:52.005 --> 00:06:54.450
Because it's got to
have a Gantt chart."

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.880
And so I was just swimming
in this old conversation

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.208
that we'd had over and
over and over again.

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:07.430
And at one point I was
eyeing the exits of the room.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.580
So the conversation continued.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.741
And finally he said,
"Well Tom, it's great

00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.990
that you have a business plan.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.698
It's great that you've
got a Gantt chart.

00:07:18.698 --> 00:07:21.845
But none of that matters.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.470
None of that matters
because you really

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.420
have to get your act together.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.390
You know, you really
can't just talk about this

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.556
or even just write about it.

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:32.640
You have to get out
there and do it."

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.240
And so I was [GROANS].

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.280
Really I was just so tense.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.320
And then I remembered
this phrase

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.140
that we have in
nonviolent communication

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.370
which is everything we
do, we do to meet a need.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.680
And so somehow that got
into my head, luckily.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.470
And I was thinking,
OK, everything we do,

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.650
we do to meet a need.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.260
What need could he possibly
be trying to meet here

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.550
by beating me up like this?

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.120
And it was an amazing
moment in my life

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.326
because I actually thought
about it for a minute.

00:08:11.326 --> 00:08:14.658
And then it hit me.

00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:19.620
I was like, "Dad, so
is it that you'd really

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.900
like me to do well
out there and you'd

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.340
love it if I benefited
from your experience?"

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.980
So I'm thinking, what
is he trying to do here?

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.550
And so I asked him that.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.622
Just want me to benefit
from your experience.

00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:42.362
And he was like, yes.

00:08:42.362 --> 00:08:45.310
And it was just an
amazing moment for me,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.440
because what happened,
from my perspective,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.530
from my experience,
was he went from being

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.280
this kind of
didactic know it all

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.000
to this other guy who
just simply wanted

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.440
to contribute to me.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.860
And I have children,
so I get that.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.460
I understand, we all want to
contribute to our children.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.290
And this was how he knew how.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.110
He was a world renowned
troubleshooter.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.520
And so he was
troubleshooting me.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.200
And although on the
outside, at first glance

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.780
it felt terrible, for the first
40 years it felt pretty wicked.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.122
But then from that moment
on, I had a perspective

00:09:30.122 --> 00:09:34.514
that allowed me to
see him differently.

00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:38.010
It was what I call a
transformative moment,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.580
because it was an
instantaneous change for me.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.240
And the thing that
I noticed about it

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.220
was that he didn't
have to change.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.310
I mean, he's still
who he is and he still

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.910
talks to me in the same way.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.550
The thing is I get to
hear him different.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.500
And so what's the difference?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.170
Well, I hear him for his needs.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.220
And when that happens,
you can have that shift.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.980
And right after
that I was hooked.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.941
It's like, this, I
have to do more of.

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:08.940
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah, it
sounds really powerful,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.580
that what had been such
a struggle for you,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.857
like the troubleshooting,
and for you

00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:16.440
being able to actually
look underneath

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.430
to see this kind of
fundamental humanity

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.859
that was connecting both of
you, in terms of his needs.

00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:25.650
That's something that
you noticed early on.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.000
And that kind of fed you,
give momentum to the work

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.100
that you're doing.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.960
Can you share more about--

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.130
we'll kind of continue on.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.530
So you were building up NYCNVC.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.410
It was more of a focus
on in-person trainings.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.770
Can you share more about--

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.580
THOM BOND: Well that's kind of
all there was, back in the day.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.636
So we did a lot in the
room kind of training

00:10:54.636 --> 00:11:00.103
for small groups and your
typical workshop environment.

00:11:00.103 --> 00:11:04.079
So that's where I really
got my education originally.

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:09.480
And so I guess over time--

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.070
and we do also, at NYCNVC,
we do live workshops.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.320
I think that's still
an important aspect.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.580
The thing is, live
workshops are expensive.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.732
And you can only fit so
many people in a room.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.830
I was frustrated
because I just find

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.120
this to be such an
incredible body of knowledge

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.060
that I wanted to
do what I could,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.020
just constantly trying to figure
out ways that we could get

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.184
more of this out there further.

00:11:44.184 --> 00:11:46.775
That's when we came
up with this idea,

00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:51.368
or I came up with the idea of
the compassion course, which

00:11:51.368 --> 00:11:53.196
is an online course.

00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:55.370
And it's relatively simple.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.980
In a way, I mean,
it just started out

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.360
as emails sent out
on a regular basis.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.842
And around that we
created a community.

00:12:06.842 --> 00:12:10.730
And we did that
with online forum.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.610
We did it with a Facebook page.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.620
And so we were able to
get everybody out there,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.342
like eventually now
with thousands of people

00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:22.490
out there, doing
it individually.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.675
But yet each one of those people
is affecting their environment.

00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:33.142
So it worked.

00:12:33.142 --> 00:12:36.140
The format that we
chose was pretty simple.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.790
It was just, here's a concept.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:46.812
And then here is a story
that illustrates that.

00:12:46.812 --> 00:12:50.900
And the third portion would
be, here are exercises that I

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.190
can do to integrate that.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.780
So one is, I got
to see what it was.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.020
And stories are kind of-- we're
very geared toward learning

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.835
through stories.

00:13:01.835 --> 00:13:05.300
And the feedback that
I got was, I just

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.316
can't wait to get to the story.

00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:09.780
And the thing that
I like about that

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.840
is, particularly
nonviolent communication,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.110
we are introducing
unusual concepts,

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.410
things that are not going
to stick in your mind

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.800
very readily.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.400
And so the idea of story
was, well, wait a minute,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.050
I can remember a story.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.230
So what we did was we started
embedding the concepts

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.830
in stories.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.640
And then that would allow people
to have better integration.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.160
EARL J. WAGNER: Noticing how
the way that you presented it

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.480
evolved as you were kind of
going through year by year.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.480
And just to give
some of the context,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.920
so the format is a
year long course.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.480
It begins in the
summer, begins in--

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.400
THOM BOND: The first
Wednesday in the summer,

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.150
or the winter if
you're in Australia.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.550
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:00.540
And everyone is actually taking
it in a synchronized way.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.530
THOM BOND: Yeah.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.860
And I like that idea as opposed
to a book, where a lot of folks

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.320
buy a book and then it
sits there on your table

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.130
and you'll read it
every now and again.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.280
This had more of a--

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.130
because of the
community aspect--

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.450
and it's funny, I wrote
it the way I like to read,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.760
which is nice little
bedtime stories,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.110
like three, four page chapters.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:30.670
So it's 52 of these
little chapters.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.930
And it caught on.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.790
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah, how did
you-- maybe how did you know--

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.050
what were the first indicators
that it was actually

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.164
starting to take off?

00:14:40.164 --> 00:14:41.830
THOM BOND: Well the
first year I did it,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.740
we decided we were not going
to charge any money at all,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.530
because I don't expect people
to pay for something that they

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.050
don't know what it is, right?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.178
So the first year we decided
to just put it out there.

00:14:55.178 --> 00:14:59.090
And we got 550 folks.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.970
And I actually hadn't
even written it yet.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.110
So a lot of what
it was to me also

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.350
was what they call
in Ireland throwing

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.310
your hat over the wall.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.870
I said, by the world, we are
having this amazing course.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.260
And so I had to create it.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.010
So I had some kind
of selfish motives

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.415
there too to do it in that form.

00:15:26.415 --> 00:15:27.790
EARL J. WAGNER:
[INAUDIBLE] start

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.299
where we talk about actually
validating the idea,

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:33.340
putting it out there,
putting the idea out there,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.750
seeing if actually
it grabs people.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.090
THOM BOND: And it did.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.400
550 people is a lot more--

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.240
I mean, the most I'd
ever had in a workshop

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.710
was maybe 60 or 70 people.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.902
So the idea of being
able to reach 550 people

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:48.850
was pretty exciting.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.880
So we really didn't
know how it was

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.980
going to grow or not grow from
there until the second year.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.600
And the second year
we monetized, kind of.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.250
And the idea was,
we picked $1 a week.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.146
It was kind of a random
thing, but we thought, $52.

00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:17.550
And then we gave
people the option

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:24.358
of taking a 50% scholarship
or a 100% scholarship, or pay

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.810
double.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.400
And it was an
experiment, really.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.690
And it turned out that
our average registration

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.300
was coming-- dollars per
registration ended up

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.380
being kind of feasible,
which was like in the $20s.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.280
And what I loved
about that was it

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.380
was really working in terms
of getting it out there.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.947
But yet it was bringing
us some support

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:53.690
that we could continue our work.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.558
So there was no
actual profit margin

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.920
that we trying to
pay attention to.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.590
We were just hoping the
numbers would all add up.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.859
The other thing is that
we were able to accomplish

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:10.825
a lot with just a few people,
thanks to the internet.

00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:13.200
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah, say more
about that, because that's

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.030
definitely something that--

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.280
you were talking about
sort of the older approach

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.980
or the traditional approach
of the in-person trainings

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.629
and then leveraging technology.

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:23.670
So can you share more
about what that looks like?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.640
THOM BOND: Well the
idea was keep it high

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.150
touch even though it's
somewhat high tech.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:38.840
And so I think where we really
started to see it was important

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.190
was in the forum.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.097
And the other thing that we
did was we conference calls

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.710
in the beginning, once a month.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.710
And then last year we
decided to switch over.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.625
And we're always
trying to think, OK,

00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:55.934
how can we make this better?

00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:57.100
How can we make this better?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.080
And so last year
we decided we were

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.040
going to move into video,
not just a phone conference

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.505
but to move to a video
format, and phone.

00:18:06.505 --> 00:18:07.990
We did both.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:16.410
I think what was important
about this for me was the reach,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.930
and the scalability slash reach.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.480
It didn't matter
if I was sending--

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.240
whether it said 550
on there or 5,000.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.450
I mean, it was just you push
the button and away it went.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.620
And so it was like we
got the printing press.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.630
And so we have our
own printing press.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.550
And it could go anywhere.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.800
And the idea behind the
scale of the pricing

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.630
was, there are so many
places on this planet--

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.650
I mean, to be in the
1% on the planet you

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.770
need to earn $30,000 a year.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:56.450
So if you start
realizing how finances

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.360
or how the economy
runs on a global level,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.790
there is no way you would ever--

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:08.380
it would be unconscionable to
pay for a workshop as opposed

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.830
to feeding your children.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.600
So I just wanted to break that.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.380
And so the way it turned
out was the folks who

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.440
were paying full price
or even double were

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.500
funding all these other folks.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.980
So more than half of the
participants in the course

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.240
are on scholarship.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.310
And now that's what starts
bringing us into Africa.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.870
That's what starts bringing us
into India, or just into places

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.655
where folks don't have
money to spend on workshops.

00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:47.150
That had always just kind of
been an upper class thing.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.544
And so we were able
to make that move

00:19:49.544 --> 00:19:52.630
and make it available to
anybody who had a computer.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:58.590
And also this year we
paid special attention

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.410
to having a responsive site.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.700
Because as it turns
out, when we're

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.320
going into underdeveloped
or less developed countries,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.330
it's all about the phone.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.280
And so we were
able to really make

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.642
it usable this year by phone.

00:20:15.642 --> 00:20:18.480
Even our conference
call or the video

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.005
call you can still [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:22.005 --> 00:20:23.380
EARL J. WAGNER:
And along the way

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.250
you've been translating
the material

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.064
into different languages.

00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:28.730
THOM BOND: Yeah.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.190
Well I think another
really important thing

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.896
that we paid attention to was
to make the course good enough

00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:38.370
that people would tell
their friends about it.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.380
Because we figured
we're never going

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.170
to be able to market this
thing into the world.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.390
It had to market
itself into the world.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.270
And so if our
participants weren't

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.540
out there telling
everybody, we would not

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.763
be anywhere close
to where we are.

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:58.762
I found out about
it from a friend

00:20:58.762 --> 00:21:05.095
is our overwhelming largest
source of registration.

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:08.050
And so that was really
important for us to see,

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.560
because that's
super efficient when

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.880
it comes to marketing, because
all of our participants

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.870
were marketing for us.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.200
EARL J. WAGNER: Getting
the strong word of mouth.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.033
So earlier you mentioned
how to make it high

00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:24.550
touch while still being high
tech, which [? it ?] eventually

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.780
is.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.025
Can you speak more like--

00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:31.840
because one of the challenges,
the theme of this discussion

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.360
is teaching compassion at scale.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.581
And so much of it is--

00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:39.130
well, so I'm curious, what
are the ways that you're

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.410
seeing that people are
not just kind of learning

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.410
it but actually experiencing and
having a transformative change?

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.630
THOM BOND: I would
say every two days

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.700
I get an email or a
phone call or something

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.680
from somebody saying, thank
you for changing my life.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.260
So the feedback was just coming.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.390
So we knew it was working.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.980
And the other feedback is,
if people tell their friends

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.830
about it, then you know it
had to have an effect on them,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.230
otherwise they wouldn't do that.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.494
And so that was
really important to us

00:22:13.494 --> 00:22:17.955
to see that we were making it so
that the course was enjoyable,

00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:23.324
that it has enough impact that
it would spread itself, really.

00:22:23.324 --> 00:22:26.768
We don't have the resources
to market to the entire world.

00:22:26.768 --> 00:22:28.244
We need the world to help us.

00:22:28.244 --> 00:22:30.704
And that's exactly
what's happening.

00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:34.050
And in terms of
other languages, what

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.345
was another great
piece of feedback

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:40.090
is that people would start
calling up and saying,

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.090
can we translate
your course please?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:50.894
And so we've accomplished
that in German and Arabic

00:22:50.894 --> 00:22:52.384
and in Spanish
now for this year.

00:22:52.384 --> 00:22:54.800
We're going to be offering
Spanish-- oh yeah, and English.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.205
And we have projects
now where we have folks

00:23:02.205 --> 00:23:07.155
that-- we have a Russian project
right now and a Finnish project

00:23:07.155 --> 00:23:08.640
right now.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.925
And there's a French project
that's half done right now.

00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:13.300
EARL J. WAGNER:
So it also sounds

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.160
a lot like the open source world
where software is developed

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.010
in a collaborative
way internationally

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.629
through the internet.

00:23:22.629 --> 00:23:24.670
The question that I want
to come back to you then

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.490
is, if people are
volunteering, helping

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.460
with doing the
translation, supporting

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.460
the class in these
ways, how do you

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.830
ensure that there's the quality
that you're looking for?

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.232
How do you ensure integrity?

00:23:38.232 --> 00:23:39.670
THOM BOND: That's
funny, that was

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.628
about the next thing I
was going to talk about,

00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:44.500
which is relationships.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.040
And particularly
the work that we do

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.100
is we play with
words a lot as a way

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.570
of developing a consciousness.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.850
We use the word needs or
we use the word feelings.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.580
And we define them and then
pursue that understanding.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.360
So it's really important
to find somebody

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.040
who understands not
just the other language,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.690
but also understands the work.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:13.500
Which is why, for example, it
was four years in the making

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:20.520
before the German course, and
likewise for the Arabic course.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.720
So what I'm looking for
is not just somebody

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.080
to translate but somebody
who understands the work.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.610
And I develop those people.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.080
When they come to me, I
will help develop them.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.380
We haven't actually
recruited at all.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.310
And the idea behind that was,
when somebody comes to us,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.500
we know they are premotivated.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:49.420
And the group that I work
with is completely motivated.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.248
There's no having to
push, pull, or anything.

00:24:53.248 --> 00:24:58.000
And so we would work
together for years

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.390
before I was ready to
let it out of the oven,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:10.460
because you need to really know
your stuff in order to teach

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.512
this at a very beginning level.

00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:14.720
EARL J. WAGNER: That sounds
kind of counterintuitive.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.990
Can share more?

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.750
THOM BOND: Well I
mean, think about it.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.510
When you introduce
something, everything

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.920
is open for question.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.630
And I love it when people
try to kick the tires.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.910
But you never know what
that's going to look like.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.280
So you have to
have every answer.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.740
And the way you have
every answer in this work

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.350
is by really
understanding the concept.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.350
So you don't have to know
what they're going to ask you.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.230
You just have to understand
the concepts deeply enough

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.990
so that when that question
comes, you apply that,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:52.040
and then you come
up with the answer.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.740
So it was that
level that we needed

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.350
to get to in order for this
to really be successful.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.640
And so we're very carefully
developing at least one person.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.162
The other thing is when
you do translations,

00:26:06.162 --> 00:26:10.810
it's important to have readers
who don't really know the work.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.440
So in each language
we also had readers

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.200
who would be like a test case.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.550
EARL J. WAGNER: Sure,
it is understandable.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.080
THOM BOND: Right, for a
civilian, not just for somebody

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.835
who really practices this work.

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.210
EARL J. WAGNER: So you mentioned
the course starting off,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.800
I think, around 2010,
2011, with around 500,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.980
and then actually increasing
about a thousand per year,

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.244
increasing to the point where
so far over 12,000 people have--

00:26:42.244 --> 00:26:43.410
THOM BOND: Taken the course.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.110
EARL J. WAGNER: --have
taken the course.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.900
And then it's growing each year.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.380
THOM BOND: Yes.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.230
And at this rate--

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.730
well, we're going into our
seventh year right now.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.730
And it looks like our
growth rate is increasing.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.392
So that's kind of exciting.

00:27:00.392 --> 00:27:02.350
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah,
the kind of word of mouth

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.780
continues to accelerate.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.640
THOM BOND: And I
also believe, just

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.920
in the spiral dynamics
of life, that the planet

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.198
is more open to this right now
than it was seven years ago.

00:27:16.198 --> 00:27:18.000
So there's a couple
of things going on.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.526
I think there's like a
spiritual, cultural shift

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:23.160
happening on the
planet which has

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.680
people leaning towards this.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.700
The other thing is that
we've developed now--

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.210
you know, originally we were
just our own kind of-- we

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.030
didn't work with anybody else.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.750
But over the years we've
developed partners.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.230
So we work with
Charter for Compassion

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.860
or we work with TNVC, which
is an international NVC

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.210
organization.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.770
So I suspect what's happening
is as this work becomes more

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.926
acceptable in common
culture, we're

00:27:53.926 --> 00:27:57.220
going to have more and more
organizations that already

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.030
exist in common culture shifting
into being ready for this.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:07.210
So one of those areas
is clergy for example.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:12.940
We have a lot of success
because every religion around

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.640
has a compassionate
component to it.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.880
In Arabic, it's
called [ARABIC], which

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.155
is one of the names of God,
which is the compassionate god.

00:28:25.155 --> 00:28:28.170
In Germany it's [GERMAN].

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.736
So yeah, we pay attention
to that as well.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.490
EARL J. WAGNER: I also
do want to open it up

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.390
for questions from the
audience based on-- let's see,

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.662
so we had a chance to talk about
your experience, how you first

00:28:46.662 --> 00:28:48.120
learned about this,
your experience

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.360
with building NYCNVC, more
recently the Compassion Course

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:52.860
Online.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.710
One thing I'm curious about is,
what do you envision for this?

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.182
You mentioned a little bit about
this change for the future.

00:29:04.182 --> 00:29:05.640
So we're also
interested in hearing

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.020
where you envision this going.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.920
So maybe we want to hear
that, and then we'll

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.584
go to questions
from the audience.

00:29:13.584 --> 00:29:16.450
THOM BOND: I'm a
very patient man.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.730
And I think that's
probably important for me

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.390
because a lot of folks
when they find out

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.110
about something like this,
say, wow, this is great.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:30.490
Let's do it in all the
schools and let's bring it out

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.560
to all the corporations.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.080
And the thing is when you look
at it, at least the way I'm

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.960
approaching this is that
this particular shift

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.080
in consciousness is
an individual affair.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.860
And so the idea of going
out and saying, well, we're

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.080
going to teach our whole school
to change its consciousness

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.680
is tricky business.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.000
And so the way I look
at this is it's like,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.430
I just want to change one person
5,000 times, 10,000 times.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.040
And so that's the
approach we're taking.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.580
And that's very different than
doing an institutional approach

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.320
or an organizational approach.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.880
It's really just an
individual approach.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.170
And so my thinking is, my hope
is that one day somebody says,

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.350
oh well, so-and-so,
wouldn't it be great

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.637
if the president of the
United States has this?

00:30:27.637 --> 00:30:29.970
And I suspect one day the
president of the United States

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:30.594
will have this.

00:30:30.594 --> 00:30:33.490
But it's not going to be
because they took it in a course

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.580
at the White House.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.950
It's because they learned
it when they were children.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.830
EARL J. WAGNER:
Interesting, just

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.700
that it becomes this kind
of lifelong kind of learning

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.850
and application.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.320
THOM BOND: It's a massive shift.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.630
I mean, it's a huge shift in
how it is we are doing business

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:52.830
as a human being.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:57.870
I mean, for thousands
and thousands

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.455
of years we've been operating
on who's right, who's wrong.

00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:06.950
And what we're
asking people to do

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.910
is understand that who's
right and who's wrong

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.400
was useful and
has a certain use,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.450
but it's not the end all be all.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.650
The end all be all is, how
can we make things better?

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.260
That's kind of how I look at it.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.790
And so yeah, sometimes
who's right and wrong

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.290
is important in how to
make something better--

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.330
but not that much.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:33.860
And so what kind of
seems to have happened

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.990
is that who's right
and who's wrong

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.840
is more important than
making things better.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.480
And what NVC does, what
nonviolent communication does

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.270
is it helps to understand
that who's right

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.430
and who's wrong only
matters to the extent

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.330
that we want to
make things better.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.140
And so the idea
behind using the words

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.691
and using the consciousness
is to help bring us

00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:57.197
to kind of that mindset.

00:31:57.197 --> 00:31:58.780
EARL J. WAGNER: Why
isn't it something

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.720
that somebody could just
take a class or in a day?

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.260
You mentioned kind of
institutional approach, which

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:09.130
the way that a lot of learning
or teaching is done, maybe

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.304
like a day long or
like a week long.

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.220
But you don't see that
that's something that--

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.320
or can you share more?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:14.986
THOM BOND: Yeah.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.060
It's not information.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.250
This isn't just information.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.980
This is a way to
reorganize how you

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.292
use your mind, and
your body really,

00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:28.000
for that matter, the
whole human package.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.460
So that takes time.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.620
In fact, you know,
we had a saying,

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.270
we treat nonviolent
communication

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:45.120
like brain surgery,
that serious.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.030
It's like, we really want
to be that good at it.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.790
It's that important.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.480
So that means it takes time.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.220
And I think one of the
things that could really

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.970
be harmful in terms
of the spread of this

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.150
is to have somebody get
the impression that this

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.427
could be learned in a
weekend or in a week.

00:33:05.427 --> 00:33:09.090
You can learn about it,
but it's very difficult

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.510
to integrate in a week or so.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.520
You can know that
it's ahead of you.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.440
You can see what is to be done.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:23.460
Although in terms of the
actual integration of it,

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.910
our poor little brains
really have a hard time.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:31.440
Because like I said, it's
such a shift in perspective

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.740
that our brains are like,
what are you talking about?

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.990
Our brains want to go to
who's right and who's wrong.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:42.150
And I talk about our brain
being EPRAM, Electronically

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.850
Programmable Random Access
Memory, which it kind of is.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.672
And so a lot of our brains
have a program of who's right

00:33:49.672 --> 00:33:52.090
and who's wrong
burned into them.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.130
And so what this is
is it's a new program.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.560
So the only way we're
going to reprogram

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:05.640
is by repeatedly burning
in the new paradigm.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.279
And that just simply
takes time, because we

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.560
have hundreds of
thousands if not millions

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.469
of these neural pathways
set up for right or wrong.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.199
And so now what I'm
asking you to do

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.584
is set up a neural pathway for,
how can I make things better?

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.889
EARL J. WAGNER: And then
kind of shifting from--

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:29.090
like actually maybe learning
new habits or new ways of being.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.610
THOM BOND: Yeah.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:36.730
And that's why, right, it
takes just years often,

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.440
because it is just simply
having enough rehearsal

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.445
to be able to overcome what
I call the habitual mind.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.330
EARL J. WAGNER: So
also coming back

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.760
to the theme around teaching
compassion at scale,

00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:01.670
I'm curious if you have for
somebody else engaging in--

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.660
also kind of sharing these
teachings or another approach

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.870
in this space, any kind
of insights or wisdom

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.330
that you've developed,
lessons learned maybe,

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.490
or best practices in the time
that you've been doing this?

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.380
THOM BOND: Make sure
it has an impact.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.050
And that was where we
just kept going back

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.970
to make sure we had a
product that had an impact.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:30.820
And as long as you have that,
it kind of goes downhill.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.384
It's easy from there.

00:35:32.384 --> 00:35:35.306
It's no longer a struggle.

00:35:35.306 --> 00:35:39.202
It's just a matter of
keeping up with the growth.

00:35:39.202 --> 00:35:41.180
But that means that
you really have

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.188
to do a great job
in the beginning.

00:35:44.188 --> 00:35:45.891
You have to go to
the drawing board

00:35:45.891 --> 00:35:48.390
and you have to make sure you
have an amazing product that's

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.810
going to have an
impact on people,

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.810
and then the rest just happens.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.726
It's kind of like the lazy
way to do it in a way.

00:35:55.726 --> 00:35:57.100
EARL J. WAGNER:
Just starting off

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.160
with something that has impact,
that works, and then building.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.170
THOM BOND: Right.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.069
So it manages--
it markets itself.

00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:08.001
So that was one of the thing.

00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:14.940
And every year we work on making
the course a little better.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.100
EARL J. WAGNER:
It's continuously

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.870
iterating and improvement.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:24.570
THOM BOND: And that could be
a technological improvement

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.975
like this year when we went
to video and cell phones.

00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:31.440
Or it could be an
editing improvement

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.420
in the actual
content of the course

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.875
to make it just a little
crisper or a little more

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:40.850
understandable.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.940
EARL J. WAGNER: Yeah, so
we're coming to the end.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.802
Let's actually check the time.

00:36:46.802 --> 00:36:49.010
So we have a few minutes
left, but we do want open it

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.990
up for questions from the
audience about anything

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.280
that we've covered so far.

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:03.957
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:03.957 --> 00:37:06.290
EARL J. WAGNER: So I'll go
ahead and repeat the question

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.260
for the recording, that for
somebody who's just learning

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.450
this, it seems so simple.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:13.790
But then actually putting it
into practice can be hard.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.305
And when can you actually--

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:16.430
you can be kind of awkward.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.850
And when can you actually see--

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.410
when do you see that
shift happening?

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.290
THOM BOND: So it is
simple and hard, right?

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.980
I liken it to picking
up a 500 pound barbell.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.270
Really simple action, right?

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.970
You bend down, you
pick it up, no biggie.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.080
That said, it's hard.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.010
And so I really do see
nonviolent communication

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.760
that way.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.420
So why is it hard?

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.360
And it goes back to what
we were just talking about,

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.300
right, the habitual mind.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.337
It's already got a program in
there like, leave me alone.

00:37:48.337 --> 00:37:48.920
I've got this.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.390
It's working just fine.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.070
Leave me alone.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:56.150
And so when we start to
get to the other shore

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.430
is when we hang in
there long enough

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.480
to get an experience,
like I had with my father.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.735
And it was like,
this stuff works.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.590
And so there's this period
before we get there,

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.850
before we can pick
that thing up,

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.820
where it seems
relatively frustrating,

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.000
which is why community is such
an important aspect of what

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.930
we do.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.870
Because I want you to understand
that this is for real.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.280
And that's the other reason
we tell stories in the course.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.100
Because even when I read
the course I'm like,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.550
that concept seems
kind of strange.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.760
I don't quite get it.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.480
And I'm writing it.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.950
But then when you
read the story,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.100
you're like, oh,
that's how that works.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:52.340
And so what happens is one day
you're going to have a story.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.764
Something's going to happen.

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:56.180
And you're going to
go, oh, it works.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.870
And then you're naturally going
to be attracted to doing it.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:05.150
So it's getting past
that place where

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.080
it doesn't work until we get to
the place where it does work.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.320
And again, I think
it's so important.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.570
I'm just such a big
fan of this work.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.132
And I knew Marshall
when he was alive

00:39:20.132 --> 00:39:22.890
and I made a personal
commitment to him

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.570
that I would carry the torch.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.180
And so I'm really
passionate about this.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.920
And so my job is to
carry you to that place

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.490
where you get that
aha experience, right?

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.790
And then you're going to be
self-motivated from there.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.520
The thing is that's
a pretty big period.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.090
And so I really want to
focus on staying with you.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.640
Because I know for
this work, for example,

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.630
if you don't get
through that stage,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.390
I'm imagining you could think
this very easily yourself.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.160
This doesn't work.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.660
You could go, oh,
this doesn't work.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.660
This hammer doesn't work.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.990
It was because I just didn't
figure out how to use it yet.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:09.740
And so that's my goal,
is to allow you--

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.440
or to support you to get
through that beginning period

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:20.280
where it almost feels like
that formulation period

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.930
where we're putting 10 in
and we're getting one out.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.742
It's that day when you
put one in and get one out

00:40:27.742 --> 00:40:34.120
that you're hooked, where
you go oh, OK, it worked.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.052
And so that's what my
life's all about actually

00:40:37.052 --> 00:40:38.260
is getting you to that place.

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.480
I didn't realize that
in the beginning.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.340
I thought, oh, we'll
just teach this stuff

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.770
and everybody will get it.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.620
But the problem is
there's community

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.200
for the right-wrong thinking.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.590
There's plenty of
community for judgment.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.060
So we needed to have
another community to help us

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:06.002
as social creatures
be ourselves.

00:41:06.002 --> 00:41:08.460
EARL J. WAGNER: What do you
see as the differences in terms

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.270
of supporting and
fostering community

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.620
for this kind of
work, like in person,

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.950
locally within the New
York versus internationally

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.118
and across different
languages and cultures?

00:41:20.118 --> 00:41:23.604
THOM BOND: Well, the
way we're doing it,

00:41:23.604 --> 00:41:25.098
I mean, we're doing it online.

00:41:25.098 --> 00:41:30.990
We have a regular old
fashioned forum, message forum.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.800
And then we also have a
number of Facebook page

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.820
where people can go and connect.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.370
And often in the
course that's part

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.430
of it is when you do an
exercise and then you

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.350
go share your results.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.400
The other part is
the conference calls.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.240
That's a really big piece.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.880
EARL J. WAGNER: So
just for both of those,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.480
you mentioned doing an exercise
and sharing their results.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.480
So tell us about
the impact of that.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.035
Why that in particular?

00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:02.410
THOM BOND: Well
it's so important

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.470
to understand that
somebody could have--

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.570
you know, how did
you make this work?

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:08.290
What did you do?

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.770
What was the result
that you had?

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:14.610
And then that helps
pave the way for others.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.210
So the more folks
we have in the mix,

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.400
the more
cross-pollination we get,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.505
and the more inspiration
we get, and therefore

00:42:23.505 --> 00:42:27.267
the more results we get.

00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:28.350
EARL J. WAGNER: Wow, yeah.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.397
So actually kind of people
sharing their own experiences

00:42:31.397 --> 00:42:33.480
like you had with your
father, sharing the stories

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.200
that they're
noticing, the shifts

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.700
in perspective with
their experience

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.800
and creating kind
of more momentum.

00:42:41.815 --> 00:42:42.940
Great.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.170
Another question?

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.914
Any other questions?

00:42:46.914 --> 00:42:47.861
Yeah?

00:42:47.861 --> 00:42:48.402
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:48.402 --> 00:42:52.074
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:52.074 --> 00:42:53.990
EARL J. WAGNER: Yes,
I'll repeat the question.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.573
When you're learning
this, how can you

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:58.617
be putting this into practice
in a world where you were saying

00:42:58.617 --> 00:43:00.200
before, like the
right-wrong thinking,

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.670
people are talking to you
using the right-wrong violent

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.980
versus the nonviolent approach.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.480
THOM BOND: Well
so the first part

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.600
is to have it living inside me.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.860
And then I have the opportunity
once I have that awareness

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.440
and once I have what I
call needs awareness,

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.680
then I can share that
perspective with someone.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.330
I can share my
consciousness with them.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.530
For example, my father--

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.060
if I said, well what are
you needing right now,

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.250
he would say, I need you
to get your act together.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.540
But instead, I put it in a
way that he could connect to.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:46.210
And so that's one of the
things we can do as we express.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.580
In terms of when
somebody is kind

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:54.720
of heaving some judgment in
our way, in our direction,

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.960
the other practice
is internal, which

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.710
is to empathize first
with ourselves as

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.680
to how I'm really not
doing this and what

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.490
I would like to be achieving.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.390
And then once I have that
self-empathy part done--

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.136
which I did with
my father, right?

00:44:11.136 --> 00:44:13.080
I was like, what do
I want right now?

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.820
I want to connect with this guy.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.930
So when we get to
that place when

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.050
we're what we call
self-empathized

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.570
and we're grounded
in our needs, then I

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.550
can start to listen to other
people who are in judgement.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.400
Now the basic
operating principle

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.140
of nonviolent
communication is everything

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.700
we do we do to meet a need,
including judging people.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.450
And so if somebody
is judging me,

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.070
if I want to go into
the old paradigm,

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.370
I'd be like that's wrong,
and I could judge the judger.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.980
But in the new paradigm
what I do is I say wow,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.420
they must be in pain.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.390
There's some unmet need
that they have that

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.820
has them speaking this way.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.640
And so for example, if
you said Thom, you know,

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.830
you're just such a loud mouth.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.060
I can't stand it anymore.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.730
Instead of going no I'm not,
instead I could [? wonder, ?]

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.850
well what is it
that you're needing?

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.070
And so I can address
that or I could even

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.770
ask you about it and say, well,
would it be better for you

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.130
if we had more mutuality or
more partnership right now?

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.480
Would that help?

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.270
And so what I do is
I kind of suss out

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.460
what the need beneath
the judgement is.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.632
And that helps me connect to
people who are using judgement.

00:45:23.568 --> 00:45:27.012
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:30.905 --> 00:45:31.530
THOM BOND: Yes.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.030
EARL J. WAGNER:
Yeah, making guesses

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.140
but can't figure out what
the person is needing.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:40.020
THOM BOND: Well, that's
where the practice comes in.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.430
I call it the parallel
universe of needs.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:47.870
It's running the show right now.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.210
Everything that's happening
in this room, everything

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:55.070
that's happening on this
campus is the result of needs.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:57.500
And look, I'm not saying
that's actually the truth.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.220
But when I act like
that's the truth,

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.020
that's the important
part for me.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.250
I was a philosophy major.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.141
I spent a lot of
money to find out

00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:07.640
that I don't know
what the truth is.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.420
But what I do know is
when I act like this

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.090
is the truth, when I
see the world this way,

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.860
that it changes my experience.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.820
So the trick for me is
to just learn to see.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.370
And this is the very
first part of this.

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:30.360
First we need to see
that parallel universe.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.320
And that's part of the work
that we do in the workshops

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.110
and in the course is
to really point out

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.880
how that is really there.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.680
Just like with my father, right?

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.100
He was being motivated
by his love for me.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.985
And so that's what
we want to first see.

00:46:45.985 --> 00:46:48.680
So then the next
part is, we want

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.830
to learn to articulate that
so that we can share it

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:53.960
with those around us.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.720
The next part is,
this is where we

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:03.080
bump into our habitual
mind, where we're just not

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.320
accustomed to thinking this way.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.080
And so another part
of it is, how do we

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:14.540
make that journey from the old
paradigm to the new paradigm.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.940
In other words if we say,
well that's the old paradigm,

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.850
trash it, and just start
the new one, it won't work.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:25.160
And in fact, a lot of
work around compassion

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.800
is just basically people saying,
look, just be compassionate.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.390
You know, it's the
right thing to do.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:33.910
And what I'm trying to do is
say, here is how you can do it.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:39.960
We can break it down into steps
so that you can achieve it.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.936
So that's really what I want
to bring, that understanding.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.240
That allows me to work--

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.460
well, eventually it will help me
work with other people, right?

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.170
But the homework
for me is to learn

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.320
to see the parallel
universe first.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.030
And it's weird.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.230
It's like we're not
accustomed to that.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.420
So it does take
practice and rehearsal.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.640
And it's so much fun for me,
like in a workshop, to say,

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640
do you see it yet?

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.620
And they're like,
well, not really.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.180
Do you see it now?

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.120
And there are different
exercises that we do.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.150
Like I would tell
you, for example,

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:29.640
I'll say, well OK, what do I do
to meet my need for communion?

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.260
And so I'll say, so I go
for a walk in the woods.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.980
Now you have to guess my needs.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.055
This is like an
exercise that we do.

00:48:38.055 --> 00:48:41.550
And so what happens is
eventually with guessing right,

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:46.020
with enough hit and miss,
you'll develop that vision

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.080
of the parallel universe.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.260
So that's the short
answer to your question

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.130
is that you just develop it.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.750
It's actually just a skill.

00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:00.248
EARL J. WAGNER: Other questions?

00:49:00.248 --> 00:49:01.712
Yeah, in the back.

00:49:01.712 --> 00:49:05.128
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:10.774 --> 00:49:11.690
EARL J. WAGNER: Great.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:15.950
Practicing snapping
out of the judgements.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.890
THOM BOND: I don't snap.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.320
But what I do is transform.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.720
So the first part
is to get curious,

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.520
and to get curious about what?

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.860
Well first we have
to understand that--

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.590
and it's kind of an intellectual
understanding at first,

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:34.920
that if I'm in judgment,
that I have an unmet need,

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.030
and that I'm using my judgment
as a way to respond to it.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:45.250
And so what we do is learn
to translate judgments.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.740
In other words, we're
not saying stop judging

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.670
and start doing this.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:51.740
We're saying, when
we're judging,

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.480
let's take a look
at that judgment

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.940
and see what the need is there.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.640
So for example, everything we do
we do to [INAUDIBLE], including

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.140
judgment.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.490
But imagine if I said to
everybody in this room,

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.710
said, so how many folks
here would like to talk

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:09.900
about how stupid you are--

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.402
nobody.

00:50:11.402 --> 00:50:13.110
But if I said how many
folks in this room

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:17.250
would be interested in talking
about how we could have

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.350
more flow and connection
and understanding,

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.865
anybody interested in
that conversation--

00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:23.740
just about everybody.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.960
I see a lot of heads
going like this.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.600
And so that is the difference.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.770
We start out, the
needs beneath stupid

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.170
are flow, connection,
and understanding.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:37.930
So what this work does is
when I'm in that judgement

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:41.050
I go oh, here's a great
opportunity for me to figure

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:42.920
out what my needs are.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.660
And so we learn to translate
those judgments into the needs.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.600
And again, that's a
practice that we do.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.970
It's a skill that we develop.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:54.250
And so we're not
saying don't judge.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.340
We're saying translate
judgment, because judgments

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.290
are trying to do something.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.950
It's just that they're doing
it in a way that disconnects.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.540
And so when we can look at
that judgment, figure out,

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.343
well, what's the
yummy part of that,

00:51:08.343 --> 00:51:12.962
then we can just focus on that.

00:51:12.962 --> 00:51:14.420
EARL J. WAGNER: I
want to follow up

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.020
on that, because
you mentioned it

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.240
can be this long term
learning process.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.650
You mentioned how
you're shifting

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:23.225
these judgments
around your father

00:51:23.225 --> 00:51:27.100
early on, that there were
other times along the way.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.062
I'm curious for you
most recently-- it's

00:51:29.062 --> 00:51:30.520
maybe kind of a
personal question--

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.760
but what are some of the
most more recent kind of ahas

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.150
that you've had for
shifting out a judgment

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:37.778
that you've experienced?

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.260
THOM BOND: I'm
constantly empathizing

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.710
with terrorists it seems.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.470
EARL J. WAGNER:
Pretty heavy, yeah.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:58.668
THOM BOND: I'm constantly asking
myself, why would you do that?

00:51:58.668 --> 00:52:04.980
And I even remember back
around 9/11, I was like--

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.440
I for one don't believe
that there are evil people.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.730
I think that there are
things that don't work

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:16.560
and people who are in a whole
lot of pain who do things

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.097
that are really destructive.

00:52:18.097 --> 00:52:19.680
And so whenever I
see something that's

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.178
really destructive, at
this point my interest is,

00:52:24.178 --> 00:52:28.130
what kind of pain are they in?

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.490
Probably the one that was one
of the hardest ones for me

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:37.182
was there a series
of knockout attacks.

00:52:37.182 --> 00:52:42.220
They're called knockout attacks
where somebody will just

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.580
pick a total stranger
and hit them so hard

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.570
that they knock them out
and they fall to the ground.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:51.480
And I remember when I first
heard about that I was like,

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.840
we've got to round all these
people up and put him in jail.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.830
And then I was like, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.500
What is that?

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.054
And then I was to
able to just go, why?

00:53:04.054 --> 00:53:07.281
Why would I ever do that?

00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:11.140
What level of pain
would I have to be in,

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.410
and what would that pain be
about to have that happen?

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:19.856
And so instead of thinking
about how wrong they are,

00:53:19.856 --> 00:53:26.250
I was thinking, well what
if you had a life where

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.224
you had absolutely
no empowerment

00:53:29.224 --> 00:53:34.120
whatsoever, no choice,
no power in your life?

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.410
And it's something that we
all so desperately desire.

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.700
Imagine 16 years of
that, 17 years of that.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.950
And so now a knockout attack
doesn't look like somebody

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.660
doing something evil to me.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.630
It looks like somebody who's
in a tremendous amount of pain

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.120
acting that out.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.590
Which doesn't mean that I
believe in knockout attacks,

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.570
although it does give
me a way to relate

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:05.820
to somebody who did something
that I absolutely abhor.

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:12.000
And I think that's the real
important part of this.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.670
And that is that
this work allows

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.370
us to connect to people who have
done things that we absolutely

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.010
can't stand.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:24.390
And if we can't do that, how
are we ever going to get back

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.400
on track as a globe?

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.350
Because somebody is
always doing something.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.330
I'm doing things
that I don't like.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.790
So somebody is always doing
something I don't like.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.530
So if that's going
to stop us from being

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:37.410
able to relate to one another,
I think we're in trouble.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:41.112
So this work allows us
to make a connection,

00:54:41.112 --> 00:54:43.320
even though somebody's doing
something we don't like,

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.750
or even something we abhor.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.150
EARL J. WAGNER: I mean,
one of the real challenges

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:50.910
like in political
discussion, somebody

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.410
might say-- people
will often say,

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.050
well, you know, this person
who's doing knockout attacks,

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:57.300
terrorists, they don't
deserve to be related to.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.485
They don't deserve empathy.

00:54:58.485 --> 00:54:59.610
How do you respond to that?

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:04.950
THOM BOND: Wow, I don't
think I've heard that yet.

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:09.750
Although if somebody
said that, I

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:13.940
would empathize with them,
the person who is saying that.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.790
Because in order for
them to say that,

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:18.220
they've got their
own package of pain

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.164
that they're carrying around.

00:55:20.164 --> 00:55:22.108
So I wouldn't argue with that.

00:55:22.108 --> 00:55:24.002
I would empathize with that.

00:55:24.002 --> 00:55:25.710
EARL J. WAGNER: Making
guesses about what

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:26.715
they might be needing.

00:55:26.715 --> 00:55:30.435
THOM BOND: Right, and valuing.

00:55:30.435 --> 00:55:32.300
EARL J. WAGNER: Thanks.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.903
Other questions?

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.140
I think so we're looking at--

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.810
I think we're right up against--

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.250
actually, yeah, we're
right up on the hour.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:48.390
So I want to thank you.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:51.360
So just to provide
some more information,

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.180
I've been Earl J.
Wagner presenting--

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.800
actually interviewing here
Thom Bond from NYCNVC.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.180
If you want to find out more
about the Compassion Course

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.340
Online, they can go to
compassionatecourse.org.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.370
THOM BOND: Correct.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:08.160
EARL J. WAGNER: And remind us
when that's starting for 2017.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.304
THOM BOND: June 21, right,
first day of-- yeah,

00:56:11.304 --> 00:56:13.544
I think it's the first
day of summer, or winter.

00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:14.460
EARL J. WAGNER: Great.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.220
And so for folks here
within the Google community,

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.560
if you're wanting to
participate in a local group,

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.360
you can go to go
compassion-course, compassion

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.060
dash course.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.210
And Thom, I want to
thank you for joining us

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:27.030
for the discussion.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.980
[APPLAUSE]
