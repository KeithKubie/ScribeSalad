and what kinds of things can we do to
 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.130
and what kinds of things can we do to

that iced also started doing at Voyager
 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.910
that iced also started doing at Voyager
and the first one I did was something

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920
and the first one I did was something
 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.370
and the first one I did was something
called a passion for art and I think the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380
called a passion for art and I think the
 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.449
called a passion for art and I think the
problem that I felt with a lot of

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459
problem that I felt with a lot of
 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.190
problem that I felt with a lot of
cd-roms at that time is that they didn't

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
cd-roms at that time is that they didn't
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.229
cd-roms at that time is that they didn't
really do very much in terms of it was

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239
really do very much in terms of it was
 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.479
really do very much in terms of it was
all about the quantitative nature of the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489
all about the quantitative nature of the
 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.699
all about the quantitative nature of the
information and I felt narrative was

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709
information and I felt narrative was
 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.229
information and I felt narrative was
really really important and so one of

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.239
really really important and so one of
 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.910
really really important and so one of
the things we did with this cd-rom is we

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920
the things we did with this cd-rom is we
 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.490
the things we did with this cd-rom is we
had a whole series of narratives from

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500
had a whole series of narratives from

of art and that's sort of the narrative
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.350
of art and that's sort of the narrative
but underneath the narrative there's

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
but underneath the narrative there's
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.760
but underneath the narrative there's
this important missing layer that

went to corbis

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
went to corbis
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.050
went to corbis
so we tried to do these is always start

in terms of there's an introduction

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460
in terms of there's an introduction
 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.559
in terms of there's an introduction
these narrative the stories and then

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:22.569
these narrative the stories and then
 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:23.879
these narrative the stories and then
there's contextual explorations where

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889
there's contextual explorations where
 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.619
there's contextual explorations where
you can actually go inside those

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629
you can actually go inside those
 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.089
you can actually go inside those
buildings and unfortunately don't think

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099
buildings and unfortunately don't think
 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:31.709
buildings and unfortunately don't think
we have enough time to do that either

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:31.719
we have enough time to do that either
 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.739
we have enough time to do that either
but we'll keep going and so another

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:34.749
but we'll keep going and so another
 

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.719
but we'll keep going and so another
experiment we did was with American

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729
experiment we did was with American
 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:41.999
experiment we did was with American
experience in 1998 thinking about how

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:42.009
experience in 1998 thinking about how
 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:44.219
experience in 1998 thinking about how
you can generate related information to

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:44.229
you can generate related information to
 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:45.719
you can generate related information to
a television broadcast and one of the

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:45.729
a television broadcast and one of the
 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.339
a television broadcast and one of the
things we tried to do was use the closed

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:47.349
things we tried to do was use the closed
 

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:49.890
things we tried to do was use the closed
caption information and have that drive

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900
caption information and have that drive
 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.040
caption information and have that drive
links to source information underneath

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050
links to source information underneath
 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.320
links to source information underneath
and that might be an encyclopedia might

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.330
and that might be an encyclopedia might
 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.999
and that might be an encyclopedia might
be an atlas and might be other thing so

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:57.009
be an atlas and might be other thing so
 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.159
be an atlas and might be other thing so
this was an experiment in that and

00:07:59.159 --> 00:07:59.169
this was an experiment in that and
 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.959
this was an experiment in that and
actually we learned quite a bit from

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:00.969
actually we learned quite a bit from
 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:06.589
actually we learned quite a bit from
doing this I think I'll skip it for work

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599
doing this I think I'll skip it for work
 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:09.269
doing this I think I'll skip it for work
so through the process of these

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:09.279
so through the process of these
 

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:11.760
so through the process of these
experiments we've sort of come down to

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.770
experiments we've sort of come down to
 

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.869
experiments we've sort of come down to
what I'm calling to the layered

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879
what I'm calling to the layered
 

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.149
what I'm calling to the layered
contextual narrative which is bringing

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:15.159
contextual narrative which is bringing
 

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:19.619
contextual narrative which is bringing
finding out a way to build up taught

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:19.629
finding out a way to build up taught
 

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:21.360
finding out a way to build up taught
links between the narrative layer and

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
links between the narrative layer and
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.619
links between the narrative layer and
this contextual layer which is

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:22.629
this contextual layer which is
 

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:24.990
this contextual layer which is
exploration and simulation so that you

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000
exploration and simulation so that you
 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.029
exploration and simulation so that you
can explore a narrative find something

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039
can explore a narrative find something
 

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.860
can explore a narrative find something
interesting go down deep into the

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:28.870
interesting go down deep into the
 

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.260
interesting go down deep into the
exploration area through association

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.270
exploration area through association
 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.459
exploration area through association
find other things you're interested and

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:32.469
find other things you're interested and
 

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.500
find other things you're interested and
come back up into another part of the

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:34.510
come back up into another part of the
 

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.029
come back up into another part of the
narrative related to that or else go

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039
narrative related to that or else go
 

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.040
narrative related to that or else go
down deeper into source information and

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.050
down deeper into source information and
 

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.589
down deeper into source information and
so the first application we were

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599
so the first application we were
 

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.899
so the first application we were
thinking about doing this with was

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:42.909
thinking about doing this with was
 

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:46.800
thinking about doing this with was
thinking about sort of interactive

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:46.810
thinking about sort of interactive
 

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.300
thinking about sort of interactive
television and this was the year two

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.310
television and this was the year two
 

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.189
television and this was the year two
thousand seven years ago and at that

00:08:50.189 --> 00:08:50.199
thousand seven years ago and at that
 

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:52.110
thousand seven years ago and at that
time most of interactive television was

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120
time most of interactive television was
 

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.600
time most of interactive television was
pretty much been strained to set top box

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.610
pretty much been strained to set top box
 

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.009
pretty much been strained to set top box
deployments which were fairly small a

00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:56.019
deployments which were fairly small a
 

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:58.470
deployments which were fairly small a
number and we really never knew if there

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480
number and we really never knew if there
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.090
number and we really never knew if there
was a big enough audience in terms of

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.100
was a big enough audience in terms of
 

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.680
was a big enough audience in terms of
the content whether things were working

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.690
the content whether things were working
 

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.540
the content whether things were working
or not and so we felt the broadband

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:03.550
or not and so we felt the broadband
 

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.160
or not and so we felt the broadband
internet was really sort of the future

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.170
internet was really sort of the future
 

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.710
internet was really sort of the future
of television and so in collaboration

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720
of television and so in collaboration
 

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.960
of television and so in collaboration
with Howard Cutler and Mike Sullivan is

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:09.970
with Howard Cutler and Mike Sullivan is
 

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.060
with Howard Cutler and Mike Sullivan is
part of the front line team we picked

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.070
part of the front line team we picked
 

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.699
part of the front line team we picked
commanding heights which because we

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:14.709
commanding heights which because we
 

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.439
commanding heights which because we
wanted it to be broadband we wanted a

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:16.449
wanted it to be broadband we wanted a
 

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:19.110
wanted it to be broadband we wanted a
program that would people could get at

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120
program that would people could get at
 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.460
program that would people could get at
that time and pretty much only higher

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.470
that time and pretty much only higher
 

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.180
that time and pretty much only higher
read and business had broadband

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.190
read and business had broadband
 

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.760
read and business had broadband
year two thousand and so commanding

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:24.770
year two thousand and so commanding
 

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.770
year two thousand and so commanding
heights is a six hour television series

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:26.780
heights is a six hour television series
 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.680
heights is a six hour television series
that we streamed entirely online in

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.690
that we streamed entirely online in
 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.220
that we streamed entirely online in
terms of three nights and the program

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:33.230
terms of three nights and the program
 

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.290
terms of three nights and the program
was created from its conception as

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.300
was created from its conception as
 

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.790
was created from its conception as
something that live on television as

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800
something that live on television as
 

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.760
something that live on television as
well as live on the web and that the

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:39.770
well as live on the web and that the
 

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.260
well as live on the web and that the
television essentially would be the

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.270
television essentially would be the
 

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.940
television essentially would be the
spine of the experience but that would

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:42.950
spine of the experience but that would
 

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.310
spine of the experience but that would
be just the beginning in terms of its

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320
be just the beginning in terms of its
 

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.490
be just the beginning in terms of its
links to deeper information and the

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500
links to deeper information and the
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.780
links to deeper information and the
other constraints about traditional

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.790
other constraints about traditional
 

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.880
other constraints about traditional
linear television are you're constrained

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:51.890
linear television are you're constrained
 

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.340
linear television are you're constrained
by not only the duration of your of the

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.350
by not only the duration of your of the
 

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.890
by not only the duration of your of the
film but also maintaining continuity of

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:56.900
film but also maintaining continuity of
 

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.240
film but also maintaining continuity of
the narrative arcs that you're trying to

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.250
the narrative arcs that you're trying to
 

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.370
the narrative arcs that you're trying to
create and what and through the process

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380
create and what and through the process
 

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.750
create and what and through the process
of shooting commanding heights they knew

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760
of shooting commanding heights they knew
 

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.060
of shooting commanding heights they knew
a lot of this was also going to live on

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.070
a lot of this was also going to live on
 

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.650
a lot of this was also going to live on
the web so we could tell stories online

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:05.660
the web so we could tell stories online
 

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.780
the web so we could tell stories online
in a way that couldn't necessarily be

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:07.790
in a way that couldn't necessarily be
 

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.100
in a way that couldn't necessarily be
done within the constraints of even a

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.110
done within the constraints of even a
 

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.700
done within the constraints of even a
six hour television series so this is

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:14.710
six hour television series so this is
 

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.600
six hour television series so this is
commanding heights I'll see if I can

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:16.610
commanding heights I'll see if I can
 

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.020
commanding heights I'll see if I can
pull it up here so this is it commanding

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030
pull it up here so this is it commanding
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.690
pull it up here so this is it commanding
heights aired in 2002 and it aired

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:25.700
heights aired in 2002 and it aired
 

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.720
heights aired in 2002 and it aired
briefly I think during pledge drive at

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:28.730
briefly I think during pledge drive at
 

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.280
briefly I think during pledge drive at
the end of the year and it has been on

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.290
the end of the year and it has been on
 

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.530
the end of the year and it has been on
since so this is the site so the number

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.540
since so this is the site so the number
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.240
since so this is the site so the number
of components are storyline which is

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.250
of components are storyline which is
 

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.030
of components are storyline which is
essentially the entire television

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040
essentially the entire television
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.190
essentially the entire television
program online there's an interactive

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200
program online there's an interactive
 

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.980
program online there's an interactive
time Atlas individual country reports

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:44.990
time Atlas individual country reports
 

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.900
time Atlas individual country reports
and then information about people and

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:46.910
and then information about people and
 

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.600
and then information about people and
ideas that are brought up in the show so

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.610
ideas that are brought up in the show so
 

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.580
ideas that are brought up in the show so
you can look at the second night and

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:51.590
you can look at the second night and
 

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.220
you can look at the second night and
there are different chapters and call up

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:54.230
there are different chapters and call up
 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.660
there are different chapters and call up
say this chapter with Jeffrey Sachs

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:00.670
say this chapter with Jeffrey Sachs
 

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:12.130
say this chapter with Jeffrey Sachs

thing about this program is that the

thing about this program is that the
 

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.619
thing about this program is that the

here is can you turn the lights on under

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720
here is can you turn the lights on under
 

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.170
here is can you turn the lights on under
30 anybody can see this so you're

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.180
30 anybody can see this so you're
 

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.290
30 anybody can see this so you're
looking at the Milky Way I mean the Big

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.300
looking at the Milky Way I mean the Big
 

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.630
looking at the Milky Way I mean the Big
Dipper and I will get dark here in a

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:18.640
Dipper and I will get dark here in a
 

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.780
Dipper and I will get dark here in a
second okay so here's the the Big Dipper

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:21.790
second okay so here's the the Big Dipper
 

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.810
second okay so here's the the Big Dipper
and we'll go in and

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820
and we'll go in and
 

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.880
and we'll go in and
just in an area perhaps below the Big

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:25.890
just in an area perhaps below the Big
 

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:30.110
just in an area perhaps below the Big
Dipper and we'll transition from this to

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120
Dipper and we'll transition from this to
 

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.740
Dipper and we'll transition from this to
a fuzzy patch in the center and if I

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:33.750
a fuzzy patch in the center and if I
 

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.500
a fuzzy patch in the center and if I
continue to go into a fuzzy patch this

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:36.510
continue to go into a fuzzy patch this
 

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.730
continue to go into a fuzzy patch this
is where make the transition from

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740
is where make the transition from
 

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.930
is where make the transition from
ground-based observation to space-based

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:40.940
ground-based observation to space-based
 

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.310
ground-based observation to space-based
imagery which is from the Hubble and

what you're looking at is two galaxies

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300
what you're looking at is two galaxies
 

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.180
what you're looking at is two galaxies
that are actually colliding and Tom

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.190
that are actually colliding and Tom
 

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.390
that are actually colliding and Tom
mentioned before about gravitational

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:49.400
mentioned before about gravitational
 

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.890
mentioned before about gravitational
aggregation of hydrogen and causing star

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:51.900
aggregation of hydrogen and causing star
 

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.240
aggregation of hydrogen and causing star
formation that's essentially what's

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.250
formation that's essentially what's
 

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:59.780
formation that's essentially what's
going on right here yeah if you you look

00:16:59.780 --> 00:16:59.790
going on right here yeah if you you look
 

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.610
going on right here yeah if you you look
at another part of the area below the

notice that there's seems to be galaxies

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380
notice that there's seems to be galaxies
 

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.980
notice that there's seems to be galaxies
everywhere all these little fuzzy

it's m81 so this particular galaxy is

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540
it's m81 so this particular galaxy is
 

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.530
it's m81 so this particular galaxy is
about a hundred thousand light-years and

you can sort of see this what looks like

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:36.870
you can sort of see this what looks like
 

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.670
you can sort of see this what looks like
a very round yellow bubble but if you

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:40.680
a very round yellow bubble but if you
 

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.770
a very round yellow bubble but if you
look at this in x-ray or infrared

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780
look at this in x-ray or infrared
 

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.800
look at this in x-ray or infrared
there's quite a bit of activity that

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:45.810
there's quite a bit of activity that
 

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.930
there's quite a bit of activity that
comes outside of the center and if you

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940
comes outside of the center and if you
 

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.750
comes outside of the center and if you
look here on the spiral arms this area

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760
look here on the spiral arms this area
 

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.210
look here on the spiral arms this area
here in this area down here what's also

here in this area down here what's also
 

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.820
here in this area down here what's also
happening there is that's also an area

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:55.830
happening there is that's also an area
 

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.800
happening there is that's also an area
where gravitational wave compressing the

these objects you can also then connect
 

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.210
these objects you can also then connect
to other related information from a

release this sometime this fall what the
 

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.190
release this sometime this fall what the
process that we're in right now is we're

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200
process that we're in right now is we're
 

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.160
process that we're in right now is we're
creating a number exemplar narratives

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.170
creating a number exemplar narratives
 

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.870
creating a number exemplar narratives
and this is what the UI will look like

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880
and this is what the UI will look like
 

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.090
and this is what the UI will look like
when we're done and we'll have

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100
when we're done and we'll have
 

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.220
when we're done and we'll have
simulations embedded within objects and

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:37.230
simulations embedded within objects and
 

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.620
simulations embedded within objects and
the ability to author and create

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:39.630
the ability to author and create
 

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.110
the ability to author and create
experiences within this virtual space so
