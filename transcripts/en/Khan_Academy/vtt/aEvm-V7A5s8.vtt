00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.850
All right, this is a fun
problem, so it'll get a video

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.850
on its own.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.730
I started in the last video,
but I'm going to start over

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.970
just so we get it
all in one take.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.480
So they say, in the figure
above, arc SBT is 1/4 of a

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.620
circle with center
R and radius 6.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.590
And they actually tell-- they
draw this distance, which is

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.160
the radius.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.490
This distance is 6, right?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.725
So this distance would
also be 6, right?

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.580
If the length plus the width
of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.300
this is ABCR.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.440
So the length plus
the width is 8.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.640
So let's call this
L and this is W.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.660
Actually, this should be-- well,
it doesn't matter, this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.150
should be height,
but whatever.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.160
We know that these two
sides are equal to 8.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.040
So we know that L plus
W is equal to 8.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.940
Fair enough.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.750
Then the perimeter of the shaded
region is-- that's this

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.590
perimeter right here, so there's
a lot of pieces to it.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.490
So let's start with
what I would call

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.080
the low hanging fruit.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.320
So the low hanging fruit,
in my opinion, is the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.780
length of this arc.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.030
Arc SBT.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.420
What's the length of that?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.140
Well, it's going to be 1/4 the
circumference of the entire

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.600
circle, right?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.840
Because this arc represents--
what we drew is 1/4 of the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.450
circle, so this length is
going to be 1/4 of the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.600
circumference.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.270
So the length of the
circumference-- so the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.690
circumference of, let me see,
the circumference of the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.510
circle, is what?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.710
It's 2 pi r.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.760
r is 6, right?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.760
So 2 pi times 6, is
equal to 12 pi.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.920
If the circumference of the
circle is 12 pi, then we could

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.070
call the length of the arc,
right-- let's call this LA--

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.270
the length of the arc
is going to be what?

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.370
It's going to be 1/4
the circumference

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.350
of the whole circle.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
1/4 times 12 pi is
equal to 3 pi.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.680
Good enough.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040
Now what else can we
try to figure out?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.390
Well, the second lowest hanging
fruit is actually the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.640
length of this line.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.820
Which you're probably saying,
well, they give me no

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.920
information, maybe I have to
use the Pythagorean theorem

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.810
with W and L, but it's really
just a visual trick, because

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.770
I'll tell you that you could
actually just look at this

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.000
graph and figure out what the
length from A to C is.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.510
And I'll give you a hint.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.860
What is the length
from R to B?

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.780
What is that length?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.480
Well isn't R to B a radius
of the circle?

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.710
Right?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.780
It's going from the center
to the edge of

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.070
circle, so it's a radius.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.560
So RB has length 6.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.590
And RB is a diagonal of this
rectangle just like AC is, so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.490
they're symmetric, so this is
also going to be equal to 6.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.530
And you could look at it a bunch
of different ways, you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.030
could say that W squared
plus L squared is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.290
equal to this, AC squared.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.660
Well, W squared, this is W as
well, right, you could also

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.570
say that W squared plus
L squared is equal

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.790
to this side squared.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.290
So that's why they're
equal to each other.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.660
So we know length of AC is
equal to 6, as well.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.250
Right?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.120
We figured out that.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.160
So we have two pieces left.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.150
We just have that piece,
and that piece.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.750
What's the length
of this piece?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.760
Well, this whole
distance is 6.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.110
We figured that out because
that's a radius.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.260
And this piece is L, right?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.830
That's L.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.150
So that piece is 6 minus L.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.810
Similarly, what's this piece?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.440
By the same logic, that's
6 minus W, right?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740
This is W, the whole
thing is 6, so this

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.040
leftover is 6 minus W.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.680
So if we want the perimeter of
this entire shaded region,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.150
it's this perimeter of this
brown arc, which is 3 pi.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.010
So let me say, perimeter
is equal to 3 pi.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.040
Plus the length of AC, plus 6.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.240
Plus this piece,
plus 6 minus L.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.200
Plus this piece,
plus 6 minus W.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.030
And let's simplify that a bit.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.020
So let's see, that equals 3
pi, and then we have three

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.690
6's, so plus 18, minus
L, minus W.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:41.190
And this is the same thing as
3 pi plus 18 minus L plus W.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.440
Fascinating.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.470
And really, I kind of just
bumbled my way here.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.620
You know the problem is
solvable, and that's better

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.430
than most mathematicians have
going for them, and so you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.660
just kind of have to bumble away
with whatever information

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.940
they give you.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.820
The real trick here, I think, is
recognizing that AC is the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.490
same length as RB.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.380
But once you get to this point,
you have to now employ

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.970
the second trick.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.270
You have to realize that minus
L minus W, well that looks a

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.850
lot like this L plus
W up here.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.000
And this is really kind of what
separates the adults from

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.910
the children, I guess.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.830
So we know that L plus W is 8,
so just substitute here, 8.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.980
So the perimeter is 3 pi,
plus 18, minus 8.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.090
That equals 3 pi plus 10,
and that is choice B.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.960
That was exciting.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.940
I'll see you in the
next section.
