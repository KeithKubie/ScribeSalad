00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
 - piano music - 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.860
 I'll be spark if you're going to be the torch 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.620
 Start an insurmountable reaction 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.320
 Balance your acidity (pH) by sharing two bases 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 I'll be your star if you're going to be a spaceman 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.000
 Because there is no distance I will not go 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.320
 Through space and time, the wormhole will materialize to the edge of the world (the wormhole is an imaginary wormhole located within the black holes) 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.380
 I'll be you G if you will be C or I can be A if you will be T 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.260
 If there is a boom you will fix every rule 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 I will work as zinc zinc zincide (allows zinc finger nuclei to target a unique or specific genetic sequence of content) 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.460
 Just like an atom 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.880
 Do not tear us apart 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 Unless you want a big explosion! 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.720
 in my heart. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.480
 We can take it fast, or very slowly. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 But we can not know exactly where we will go from. 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 If at first we did not succeed, we will try two more times 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.340
 So our failure is a statistically significant attempt 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.260
 Like an equation, everything works out 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.580
 If we weigh the two sides there is no need to doubt 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.920
 This is your scientific love song 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.140
 Place to start our chemical association 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.400
 With my research effort 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.940
 We can write the conclusion together 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.600
 Just like movies I would steal your heart 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.460
 But if you do that you'll die ... so I will not do that. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.020
 If we break up, I will not be there anymore 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.780
 I will give the water to sulfuric acid (when adding water to sulfuric acid - not the opposite - an interaction that could cause the explosion) 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.020
 If they take away gravity, I'll stay stuck for you 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.800
 I share your last electronic in a covalent bond for two 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.780
 Because you are like an angel (corner), cute and intelligent (Angle has eyes) 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.820
 Your lab coat and your protective glasses go directly to my heart 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.960
 Except for that lie, because the heart does not feel 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.860
 When it comes to love the brain seals the deal 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.880
 This is the song of your scientific love 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.020
 Place to start a chemical bond between us 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.940
 With the research effort, we can write the conclusion together 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.040
 With the research effort, we can write the conclusion together 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.840
 With the research effort, we can write the conclusion together 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.860
 With twenty footnotes and index 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 Because you are important to me (matter or important matter) 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.960
 thanks for watching 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.900
