00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.850
Find the slope of
the line that goes

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.450
through the ordered pairs
4 comma 2 and negative 3

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.640
comma 16.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.270
So just as a reminder, slope
is defined as rise over run.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.700
Or, you could view that rise
is just change in y and run

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.520
is just change in x.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920
The triangles here,
that's the delta symbol.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.810
It literally means "change in."

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.097
Or another way, and you
might see this formula,

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:30.680
and it tends to be
really complicated.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.310
But just remember it's just
these two things over here.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.740
Sometimes, slope will be
specified with the variable m.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.099
And they'll say that
m is the same thing--

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.140
and this is really the
same thing as change in y.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.520
They'll write y2 minus
y1 over x2 minus x1.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.180
And this notation tends
to be kind of complicated,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.290
but all this means
is, is you take

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.180
the y-value of your endpoint
and subtract from it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.010
the y-value of your
starting point.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.430
That will essentially
give you your change in y.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.840
And it says take the
x-value of your endpoint

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.140
and subtract from that the
x-value of your starting point.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.620
And that'll give
you change in x.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.210
So whatever of
these work for you,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.970
let's actually figure out
the slope of the line that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.360
goes through these two points.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.484
So we're starting
at-- and actually, we

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:19.400
could do it both ways.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.260
We could start at this
point and go to that point

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.551
and calculate the slope or
we could start at this point

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.950
and go to that point
and calculate the slope.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350
So let's do it both ways.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.230
So let's say that our starting
point is the point 4 comma 2.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.980
And let's say that our endpoint
is negative 3 comma 16.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.160
So what is the change
in x over here?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.750
What is the change in
x in this scenario?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.620
So we're going from
4 to negative 3.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.550
If something goes
from 4 to negative 3,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.850
what was it's change?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.740
You have to go
down 4 to get to 0,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.650
and then you have to go down
another 3 to get to negative 3.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.460
So our change in x
here is negative 7.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.850
Actually, let me
write it this way.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.030
Our change in x is equal
to negative 3 minus 4,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.280
which is equal to negative 7.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.570
If I'm going from 4 to
negative 3, I went down by 7.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.370
Our change in x is negative 7.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.680
Let's do the same thing
for the change in y.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.110
And notice, I implicitly
use this formula over here.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.160
Our change in x was this value,
our endpoint, our end x-value

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.790
minus our starting x-value.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.490
Let's do the same thing
for our change in y.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.510
Our change in y.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.390
If we're starting at
2 and we go to 16,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.681
that means we moved up 14.

00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.180
Or another way you
could say it, you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.110
could take your ending
y-value and subtract from that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.530
your starting y-value
and you get 14.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.490
So what is the slope over here?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.200
Well, the slope is just
change in y over change in x.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.310
So the slope over
here is change in y

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.590
over change in x, which
is-- our change in y is 14.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.990
And our change in
x is negative 7.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.540
And then if we want to simplify
this, 14 divided by negative 7

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.302
is negative 2.

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.760
Now, what I want
to show you is, is

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.760
that we could have done
it the other way around.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.740
We could have made
this the starting point

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.000
and this the endpoint.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.390
And what we would have
gotten is the negative values

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.598
of each of these, but then
they would've canceled out

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:34.290
and we would still
get negative 2.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960
Let's try it out.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.990
So let's say that our start
point was negative 3 comma 16.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.170
And let's say that our
endpoint is the 4 comma 2.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.700
4 comma 2.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.700
So in this situation,
what is our change in x?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.670
Our change in x.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.370
If I start at negative
3 and I go to 4,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.990
that means I went up 7.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.720
Or if you want to
just calculate that,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.450
you would do 4 minus negative 3.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.730
4 minus negative 3.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.760
But needless to say,
we just went up 7.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.010
And what is our change in y?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.280
Our change in y over here,
or we could say our rise.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.720
If we start at 16 and we end at
2, that means we went down 14.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.140
Or you could just say 2
minus 16 is negative 14.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.570
We went down by 14.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.900
This was our run.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.180
So if you say rise
over run, which

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.350
is the same thing as change
in y over change in x,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.385
our rise is negative 14
and our run here is 7.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.010
So notice, these are
just the negatives

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.870
of these values from
when we swapped them.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.560
So once again, this is
equal to negative 2.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.820
And let's just visualize this.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.810
Let me do a quick
graph here just

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.560
to show you what a downward
slope would look like.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.410
So let me draw our two points.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.620
So this is my x-axis.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620
That is my y-axis.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.310
So this point over
here, 4 comma 2.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.910
So let me graph it.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.690
So we're going to go
all the way up to 16.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.981
So let me save some space here.

00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:08.030
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.970
It's 4 comma-- 1, 2.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.950
So 4 comma 2 is right over here.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.750
4 comma 2.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.421
Then we have the point
negative 3 comma 16.

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:18.670
So let me draw that over here.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.170
So we have negative 1, 2, 3.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.790
And we have to go up 16.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:30.630
So this is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.690
So it goes right over here.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.660
So this is negative 3 comma 16.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.890
Negative 3 comma 16.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.610
So the line that
goes between them

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.020
is going to look
something like this.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.120
Try my best to draw a
relatively straight line.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.300
That line will keep going.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.260
So the line will keep going.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.820
So that's my best attempt.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.000
And now notice, it's
downward sloping.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.980
As you increase an x-value,
the line goes down.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.800
It's going from the top
left to the bottom right.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.430
As x gets bigger,
y gets smaller.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.100
That's what a downward-sloping
line looks like.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.650
And just to visualize our
change in x's and our change

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.630
in y's that we dealt with
here, when we started at 4

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.200
and we ended at-- or when
we started at 4 comma 2

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.660
and ended at
negative 3 comma 16,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.810
that was analogous to starting
here and ending over there.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.420
And we said our change
in x was negative 7.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.790
We had to move back.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.680
Our run we had to move in
the left direction by 7.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.720
That's why it was a negative 7.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.750
And then we had to move
in the y-direction.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.550
We had to move in the
y-direction positive 14.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.860
So that's why our
rise was positive.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.470
So it's 14 over negative
7, or negative 2.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.880
When we did it the other way,
we started at this point.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.330
We started at this point,
and then ended at this point.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.410
Started at negative 3, 16
and ended at that point.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.450
So in that situation,
our run was positive 7.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.980
And now we have to go
down in the y-direction

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.980
since we switched the
starting and the endpoint.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.880
And now we had to
go down negative 14.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.900
Our run is now positive 7 and
our rise is now negative 14.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.204
Either way, we got
the same slope.
