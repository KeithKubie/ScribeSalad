there's something called a discount rate

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260
there's something called a discount rate

there's something called a discount rate
if you take a dollar today and spend it

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870
if you take a dollar today and spend it
 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.170
if you take a dollar today and spend it
on something or you spend it a hundred

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
on something or you spend it a hundred
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.380
on something or you spend it a hundred
years from today it would be your the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390
years from today it would be your the
 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.990
years from today it would be your the
dollar would grow and your economy would

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000
dollar would grow and your economy would
 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.580
dollar would grow and your economy would
be stronger and you would have more to

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590
be stronger and you would have more to
 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.090
be stronger and you would have more to
spend and so the issue is what discount

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100
spend and so the issue is what discount
 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.040

years there is no experience that goes
beyond one century and so this is the

beyond one century and so this is the
 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.970
beyond one century and so this is the
fundamental problem that if you're

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980
fundamental problem that if you're
 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.850

price on carbon so I think there is a

00:18:23.649 --> 00:18:23.659
price on carbon so I think there is a
 

00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:27.560
price on carbon so I think there is a
you know a sense of inevitability of a

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:27.570
you know a sense of inevitability of a
 

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.990
you know a sense of inevitability of a
transition towards a decarbonized future

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000
transition towards a decarbonized future
 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.700
transition towards a decarbonized future
it's just the question will we do it

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:31.710
it's just the question will we do it
 

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.430
it's just the question will we do it
fast enough and I think that is quite

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
fast enough and I think that is quite
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.409
fast enough and I think that is quite
promising I think that when Volkswagen

00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419
promising I think that when Volkswagen
 

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:38.960

it sees an end date on the combustion

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:41.370
it sees an end date on the combustion
 

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.070
it sees an end date on the combustion

combustion engine cars from 2040 a bit

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:45.750
combustion engine cars from 2040 a bit
 

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.070

it's of course a reaction on a deep

00:18:50.659 --> 00:18:50.669
it's of course a reaction on a deep
 

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:52.730
it's of course a reaction on a deep
crisis but it tells you that we have

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740
crisis but it tells you that we have
 

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.430
crisis but it tells you that we have
really reached the beginning of the end

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440
really reached the beginning of the end
 

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.940
really reached the beginning of the end
of the fossil fuel era and what we know

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:58.950
of the fossil fuel era and what we know
 

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.470
of the fossil fuel era and what we know
which is Stevens point which is so

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480
which is Stevens point which is so
 

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.810
which is Stevens point which is so
important is that we're coming to this

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820
important is that we're coming to this
 

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.519
important is that we're coming to this
beginning of the end not based on an

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:04.529
beginning of the end not based on an
 

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:06.980
beginning of the end not based on an
environmental problem but based on an

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:06.990
environmental problem but based on an
 

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.320
environmental problem but based on an
innovation pathway which means that we

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.330
innovation pathway which means that we
 

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.730
innovation pathway which means that we
see more and more evidence that this can

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740
see more and more evidence that this can
 

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.340
see more and more evidence that this can
actually be a self propelling exercise

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:13.350
actually be a self propelling exercise
 

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.200
actually be a self propelling exercise
just like the Moore's law basically

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.210
just like the Moore's law basically
 

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.899
just like the Moore's law basically
because we can make money along the way

00:19:17.899 --> 00:19:17.909
because we can make money along the way
 

00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:19.730
because we can make money along the way
and we can have better outcomes for

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740
and we can have better outcomes for
 

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.370
and we can have better outcomes for
society so I think there's a there is

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380
society so I think there's a there is
 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.200
society so I think there's a there is
hope in that sense the question is just

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.210
hope in that sense the question is just
 

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.129
hope in that sense the question is just
will we be able to scale and I think

00:19:28.129 --> 00:19:28.139
will we be able to scale and I think
 

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:31.039
will we be able to scale and I think
education is just such an important

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:31.049
education is just such an important
 

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:33.500
education is just such an important
thing and might my observation having

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.510
thing and might my observation having
 

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.710
thing and might my observation having
taught students for for 40 odd years is

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720
taught students for for 40 odd years is
 

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.630
taught students for for 40 odd years is
that the students who are coming through

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640
that the students who are coming through
 

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.340
that the students who are coming through
today are very much more aware than

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:40.350
today are very much more aware than
 

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.910
today are very much more aware than
previous generations of the problems

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:42.920
previous generations of the problems
 

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.500
previous generations of the problems
that there are and actually are

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:45.510
that there are and actually are
 

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.210
that there are and actually are
demonstrating a very strong willingness

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220
demonstrating a very strong willingness
 

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.520
demonstrating a very strong willingness
to address those problems and I think

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:49.530
to address those problems and I think
 

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.040
to address those problems and I think
younger people are in a way our hope in

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.050
younger people are in a way our hope in
 

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.440
younger people are in a way our hope in
part because they carry the message yeah

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:54.450
part because they carry the message yeah
 

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.210
part because they carry the message yeah
I think today we see really kids

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220
I think today we see really kids
 

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.520
I think today we see really kids
stepping up there and and demanding a

there and we're eating less and less
 

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.040

meat for sure it's difficult to get to

and I suppose you know the reason we do
 

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.370
and I suppose you know the reason we do
it is because we think it's important

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380
it is because we think it's important
 

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.180
it is because we think it's important
enough to try and understand change and

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.190
enough to try and understand change and
 

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.040

indeed importantly the rates of change

other way to do it I mean that that's a

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:43.710
other way to do it I mean that that's a
 

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.669
other way to do it I mean that that's a
very good question and

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679
very good question and
 

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.440
very good question and

so actually if you accelerate wealth

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220
so actually if you accelerate wealth

actually you have to bend that curve and

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:45.570
actually you have to bend that curve and
 

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.169
actually you have to bend that curve and
you have to bend it and then the

00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179
you have to bend it and then the
 

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:49.940
you have to bend it and then the
economists have to think of economic

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:49.950
economists have to think of economic
 

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.990
economists have to think of economic
models which is not dependent on

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000

model is is you just consume more you

00:24:59.840 --> 00:24:59.850
model is is you just consume more you
 

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.840
model is is you just consume more you
make more you do some more stuff and

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:02.850
make more you do some more stuff and
 

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.560
make more you do some more stuff and
this is not a sustainable model clearly

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:06.570
this is not a sustainable model clearly
 

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.960
this is not a sustainable model clearly
but yet there's no economists willing to

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:08.970
but yet there's no economists willing to
 

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.940
but yet there's no economists willing to
say no no no we've got to get it so that

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:10.950
say no no no we've got to get it so that
 

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.890
say no no no we've got to get it so that
you can actually have a higher standard

you can actually have a higher standard
of living with a shrinking population so

00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659
of living with a shrinking population so
 

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:19.370
of living with a shrinking population so
but it's very real with more education

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380
but it's very real with more education
 

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.220
