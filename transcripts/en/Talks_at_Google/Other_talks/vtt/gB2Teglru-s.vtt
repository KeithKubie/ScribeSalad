DAVE MARKS: Welcome
to Talks At Google.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.866
My name's Dave Marks, and
we have a phenomenal event

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.050
planned for you today.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.730
We are lucky enough to
have a capella legend Deke

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.200
Sharon with us today.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.340
Deke is, in my opinion,
the most prolific member

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.931
of the a capella
community today.

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.180
I mean, from his thousands
of arrangements to his work

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.304
on NBC's "Sing-Off" and
the "Pitch Perfect" movies,

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.390
to his influence over the sound
of modern a capella and all

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.849
the a capella music
you hear today,

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.598
this is really the man
who started it all.

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:36.490
So please join me in
welcoming Deke Sharon.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.010
DEKE SHARON: Thank you, guys.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.019
Can you hear me OK?

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.310
Am I coming through the stream?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.580
Hello, people sitting at your
desks, pretending to work.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.190
Anyway, I thought
I'd come down here

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.180
today, partially just because
I want to hang out with you

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.055
and get a free lunch.

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:54.930
But also partially
because, in fact,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.390
my brother is working over
at Google X. So hi, Phil.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.750
If you're there in Alameda
and working on something,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.541
you can't tell me or
you'd have to kill me.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.410
I understand that.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.640
And also because over the
course of the past 25 years

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.040
when I've been so deeply
involved in the a capella

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.480
community, I've learned so
much about life and business

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.900
and interaction that I thought
I'd come down here and talk

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.250
to you guys about
the different lessons

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.640
that a capella has to share with
the world of business at large.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.110
And in fact, special
guest here today,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.815
Googapella, are my
hosts and friends.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.940
And you'll hear a little
bit from them a little bit

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.700
later on.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.310
But before that, I want us to
just put this into context.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.136
So when I say a capella,
now, a lot of you guys

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:42.010
probably think, well,
that's just some people

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.700
singing pop a capella, right?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.950
Yeah, just getting together,
jamming on awesome tunes.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.100
Fact of the matter is a
capella is the oldest music.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800
In fact, it's the
oldest creative form

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.220
as far as we can tell
because it's existed way

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.840
back into prehistoric times.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.902
And if you think about
it, since we are animals,

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:02.110
you look at the animal
kingdom, and you've got whales

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.510
and you've got crickets
and you've got birds.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.040
And they all sing together.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.362
They create music
for mating rituals

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:12.800
and all of the other
reasons we, too, sing.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.830
But then something happened
through time, through history.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.240
100 years ago, John Philip
Sousa made a statement

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.630
that people laughed
at at the time.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.020
When recorded music
came into predominance,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.464
he said, this is
going to ruin music.

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.130
And people thought,
oh, you old Luddite.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.744
That's ridiculous.

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.660
I'm sure you guys are
saying "you old Luddite"

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.400
all the time here at Google.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.560
But the fact of the matter
he was in fact prophetic

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.830
because it changed people's
relation the music.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.405
It used to be if you wanted
to hear music, you made music.

00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:44.640
And you think about all
those great classic novels,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.160
after dinner, people get
together in the sitting room

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.590
and they sing.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.490
And they made music.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.430
And in fact,
Christmas carols-- it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.730
used to be a community event.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.229
You wanted to hear
Christmas carols,

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.560
you made Christmas carols.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.530
But then, recorded
music came around.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.850
And all of a sudden, you
didn't have to do that anymore.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.516
You could put on music
in the background

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.480
and fewer people
sang, fewer people

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.180
studied music, fewer people had
music as a part of their lives.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.240
And then music started to slip
down the tier of importance

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.220
in education.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.050
Pythagoras had it as one of the
five major subjects that people

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.060
should study.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.830
And throughout most
of history, music

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.420
was a central part of education.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.020
People understood the
importance and the strengthening

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.440
of the brain that happened as
a result of studying music.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.450
But it's now a third,
a fourth rate subject.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.430
And it's being slashed
in music budgets

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.361
and has been over
the past 20 years--

00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:34.610
not just here in California,
but all around the world.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.570
And then you get
television shows

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.180
like "American Idol"
that openly mock people

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.510
that aren't great at singing.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.400
And the end result
is many people

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.380
that I talk to say like,
ah, I'd love to sing.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.410
But I can't sing.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.400
I'm like, what do you
mean you can't sing?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.770
You can talk, you can sing.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.890
No, no, no I'm tone deaf.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.410
I'm like no you're
not tone deaf.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.587
Tone deaf means you cannot
differentiate any pitches.

00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:56.420
So someone who is tone
deaf talks like this.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.090
And they'll ask a question,
"are you done with that?"

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.530
Like they can't actually
raise their voice

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.620
at the end of a sentence.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.260
Every one you've ever
met is not tone deaf.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.524
It's just a matter
of matching pitch.

00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:09.690
So you think about it from
a basketball perspective.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.314
If you've never seen
a basketball hoop,

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:14.110
never picked up a basketball
and shot a free throw,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.300
what do you expect your
percentage would be?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.519
Your vocal cords
are just a muscle.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.590
And hitting those notes is
just a matter of repetition.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.180
All of us are able to do it.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.184
But why would you want to do it,
besides the fact that it's fun?

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:29.600
The fact of the matter is there
are many different lessons

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.630
that we as individuals have and
take from a capella music that

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.770
are really important.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.290
And realize that a capella
is not just singing,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.040
it's singing together.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.400
And I think the singing
together part is really

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.720
at the crux of the value of
what I want to talk about today.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.810
So listening.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.330
If you talk to a
marriage counselor,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.300
if you talk to a
therapist, if you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.850
talk to negotiators, people who
focus on conflict resolution,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.330
they all make it very clear the
number one skill that you need

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.900
is to be able to listen.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.700
And if you think about it
from our educational system,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.890
what class did you really
learn how to listen in?

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.380
I don't know.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.860
I mean you have to be
able to hear when you're

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.410
taking lectures or whatever.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.830
But the process of listening,
and one that's active,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.010
is so central to what
we have to be able to do

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.241
when we're discussing things.

00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:28.990
Once you're singing
in an a capella group,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.700
everything that you do exists
in context of everyone else.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.310
If you sing in perfect
rhythm and in perfect tune

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.210
but the rest of the
group has moved,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.142
you're the one that's wrong.

00:05:39.142 --> 00:05:40.350
It's a lesson that you learn.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.630
It's endemic to-- Googapella
is laughing over here.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.245
They're like "ha ha
ha, ha ha ha ha."

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:44.744
Yes.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.142
[LAUGHING]

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.920
That's the bottom line--
who you are, where you are,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.120
what you're doing,
are you right?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.170
It exists within a
context of other people,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.230
within a sociological context,
within a business framework.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.480
Being able to interact
with other people

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.920
requires your knowing where
they are, what they're doing.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.210
And that requires
listening, active listening.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.490
A capella teaches that better
than any other creative form,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.870
better than any other
participatory sport

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.120
or whatever that you
can possibly find.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.150
And I just used the
word "teamwork."

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.910
And teamwork is absolutely
essential as well.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.630
Individuals are
incredibly powerful.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.470
And we love the story of the
hero, be it Indiana Jones.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.600
Or you watch "American Idol"
and that's the great singer.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.760
But the bottom line is
there's strength in numbers.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.040
And the sum is greater
than the individual parts.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.260
And I'm standing here
on the Google campus.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.670
Corporations exist because
bringing people together

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.620
to work on a common cause is
more effective than having

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.450
everybody working on their own.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.040
So when you're in
an a capella group,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.650
you begin to understand
the value of teamwork.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.700
You realize how you
guys can work together,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.330
how you fit into this
overall component.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.410
And one of the great
lessons also from a capella

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.370
is that if you do it right--
if you do music right,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.880
everyone wins.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.380
So if you think about a
participatory sport, most

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.640
of the time, you're
going to lose.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.353
And I say most of
the time because I've

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.686
got a good friend in the
Barbershop Harmony Society, who

00:07:18.686 --> 00:07:21.890
above his desk has a sign that
says "competitions are mostly

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.957
for losers."

00:07:22.957 --> 00:07:24.540
Because if you think
about it, I don't

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.445
care if it's baseball, if it's
hockey, if it's soccer-- not

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:30.320
basketball, because
Golden State Warriors are

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.528
going to win the whole thing.

00:07:31.528 --> 00:07:35.230
But in any other sport,
you realize only one person

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.106
wins the Super Bowl.

00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:37.480
So even if you do
well and you're

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.530
above average during
the season, you're

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.710
eventually going to lose.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.900
Music's not about losing.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.440
And life is not
necessarily about losing,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.490
or it shouldn't be.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.480
How do you win and win
alongside other people,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.070
alongside your teammates,
alongside your community?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.150
How can you build that
"do no evil" ethos?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.910
A capella is an
amazing way to do this.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.750
And it's incredibly fun
while you're doing it.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.620
So let's see what
else we have here.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.250
There's so much
attention that's been

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.010
given to the word diversity
over the past few years--

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.840
several years-- in educational
circles, in business circles.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.320
But what does that really mean?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.810
What's the real
value of diversity?

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.540
When you sing in an a
capella group, you live it.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.452
The more homogeneous your
group is, the less interesting

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:25.160
they are and the less
they're able to do.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.280
If everybody sings
the same voice part,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.110
you've got a very
narrow bandwidth

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.100
within which you're
able to do anything.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.919
When you've got high
tenors and low basses,

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.900
when you've got a beat
boxer, when you've

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.490
got gorgeous ballad
singing sopranos

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.620
and raspy soulful
altos, you've got

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.760
an incredible a capella group.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.790
The diversity is what creates
the boundaries within which

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.740
you're able to do anything.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.539
And that's something
that you live.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.580
One of my favorite things
about college a capella

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.410
is that a college
a capella group

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.800
is the most diverse gathering
of people on a college campus.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.130
You've got your sports teams.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.695
You've got your
sci-fi nerd clubs.

00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:04.420
You've got your fraternities.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.060
But in a college
a capella group,

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.100
people are drawn from all
of those different circles--

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.490
and the theater person, and
the goth, et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.370
You end up with--
you're laughing.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.510
You've got your own goths
in Googapella as well.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.010
But you end up with an
incredibly diverse selection

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.530
of people.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.196
And when I sang in
the Tufts Beelzebubs,

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:23.855
I made lifelong
friends with people

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.182
that I would've passed
in four years of college

00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:27.390
and never even said hello to.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.139
I never would have
crossed paths with them

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:31.860
possibly, except maybe
in the dining hall.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.162
That bringing together
of different people--

00:09:34.162 --> 00:09:35.620
learning how to
interact with them,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.670
learning how to listen
with them, from them,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.750
and create alongside them--
is incredibly valuable.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.140
And then you never have to ask
the question, why diversity?

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.020
Why do I care that I would want
someone different from myself?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.770
Because you realize
you need them.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.470
And that you are
stronger for them.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.120
And your own strengths
are amplified with them

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.600
right there beside you.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.558
So let's see what else.

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:05.820
A capella is just people.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.450
So when you go see
a rock concert,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.880
you've got these flame pots
and giant screens and people

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.990
are playing electric
guitars and synthesizers,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.820
and there's computer banks.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.240
When it's a capella, it's
just you and your friends.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.870
And everything that happens--
every emotion, every mood,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.220
every sound, every
movement, every feeling

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.410
that the audience feels
comes entirely from you.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.940
There's this incredible
sense of self-reliance.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.730
And obviously, I know
you guys down here,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.022
you start new initiatives.

00:10:35.022 --> 00:10:36.980
Like how are we going to
make something happen?

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.489
Like it's just
we've got this idea

00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:39.780
and where do you go from there?

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.160
A capella is all
about that every time.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.660
We've got this song
we want to sing.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.990
What are we going to do?

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.080
You have to do it yourselves.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.410
Learning how to rely
entirely upon yourselves

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.699
is one of the great lessons
you learn from a capella.

00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:55.490
And it's a beautiful
thing when you finally

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.752
bring a song to life with just
yourself and your friends.

00:10:58.752 --> 00:10:59.960
And you could do it anywhere.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.959
You can do on the radio.

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.587
You could do it at midnight
at a friend's birthday party.

00:11:03.587 --> 00:11:04.420
It's a good feeling.

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.250
So how many of you
guys have heard

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.990
of the Dunning-Kruger effect?

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.610
Nice.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.140
You're all
over-educated down here.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.890
I love it.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.010
Well, I hope I don't
get this wrong.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.540
But a good deal of research
has been done of late

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.670
to try to figure out where is
that line between competence

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.200
and incompetence.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.090
And it seems as
though we're learning

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.710
that people who are
incompetent don't actually

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.510
know that they're incompetent.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.560
And people can take a test
with a bunch of other people,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.710
and the vast majority of
them believe that they

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.850
are in the upper tier.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.760
It's definitely the case
with driving, right?

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.970
I came down from
San Francisco today.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.270
And I'll guarantee you that
most people on that road

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.800
were sure that they were one
of the best drivers on them.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.150
And not all of them were.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.684
Mathematically, it's impossible.

00:11:51.684 --> 00:11:53.600
And I could tell you the
license plate numbers

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.891
of the ones who were the worst.

00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:55.624
[LAUGHING]

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.420
The bottom line is, people need
constant, immediate feedback

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.670
in a positive way to
begin to realize how

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.660
they exist in this framework.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.256
And I can even think
of certain people

00:12:09.256 --> 00:12:11.255
who were in different
fields that effect us all,

00:12:11.255 --> 00:12:13.520
such as politics, who
would have benefited

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.180
from a lifetime of
hearing from other people

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.830
ways in which
they're not actually

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.260
doing a good job at
the things they think

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.850
they're doing a good job at.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.650
This feedback loop exists
within an a capella rehearsal

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.767
constantly.

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:28.600
You're in a section,
and you hear your part.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.730
Am I in tune with
the other people?

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.110
Am I out of tune?

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.240
Am I in rhythm with them?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.070
Am I out of rhythm?

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.319
You're getting this feedback
from the music director--

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:36.910
speed this up, slow it down,
tune this down a little bit.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.520
A lot of it is not just
knowing that you need

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.770
to change these little things.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.460
It's realizing that
it's OK to be imprecise.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.700
The only way you get better is
through that constant feedback

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.230
loop.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.250
And so often in
businesses, my wife,

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.840
who is a business consultant
and works within human resources

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.776
and making better teams and
training high-level management

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:59.390
to be great at
what they're doing,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.990
so often she talks to leaders
who are stuck in a position

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.899
to have to fire somebody
who's incompetent.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.190
And they've been in the job
for three and a half years.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.773
And no one has ever
actually told them

00:13:08.773 --> 00:13:10.920
that they weren't
doing a good job.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.600
That's doesn't happen
in a capella, right?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.100
You know you're not doing a
good job in the first 30 seconds

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.565
of rehearsal.

00:13:17.565 --> 00:13:21.040
And I say it with a smile on
my face because in a capella,

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.054
it's OK.

00:13:22.054 --> 00:13:23.970
You're going to be making
mistakes constantly.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.940
The human voice is a
fretless instrument.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.679
You're able to slide
all over the map.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:28.470
You have good days.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.710
You have bad days.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.620
And all of you together are used
to making mistakes together,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.410
and to learning how to be
better at all of the thing

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.660
that you need to be better at.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.720
And here, you're great at
this and you're usually great.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.178
But today, you're
having a bad day.

00:13:41.178 --> 00:13:43.240
Down here, you're
usually struggling,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.960
and you're making big strides.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.700
That feedback loop is one
of the most powerful things

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.300
that people can learn, which is
one of the reasons why I feel

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.960
like we need to continue to
have this kind of vocal music

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.400
in schools so students
can learn what it's

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.520
like to be with others,
to make mistakes,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.450
and get that immediate feedback.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.130
Let's see what else.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.970
So all of this has
been about the group.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.750
But what about you?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.181
When you're in an
a capella group,

00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:12.180
you start to get a clear
picture of who you are.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.930
What's your role?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.930
What are your strengths?

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.310
What are you able to do well?

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.050
And people often ask me,
well, what solo could I sing?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:20.764
How do I fit in?

00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:22.930
There are all these great
other people in the group.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:23.800
Where's my voice?

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.520
There is a great song
for everyone to sing.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.000
The Randy Newmans in the
world and the Tom Waits

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.720
and the Bob Dylans, right?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.990
Even the guys with
this voice, right?

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.980
There's a great song
for you out there.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.930
There's an incredible
body of work

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.470
that's been created
throughout humankind.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.220
And you have something
inside of you

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.960
that's incredibly beautiful.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.057
You have a song to sing.

00:14:48.057 --> 00:14:50.640
And when you're in an a capella
group, you learn what that is.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.950
And that's a great feeling.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.316
We all have value.

00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:56.190
And I know this feels
like a very '70s thing.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.700
Yeah, I'm a child of the '70s,
northern California hippie.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.350
But that's an important lesson.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.690
Maybe the millennials that
are getting teased too

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.210
often learned the lesson
that everybody's great.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.750
Not everybody's
great at everything.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.310
That's a lesson
that is absolutely

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.020
detrimental to society.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.980
But finding out how you're great
and what you can give-- that's

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.610
the real gift.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.860
And that's one of the things
that a capella definitely

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.730
can give you.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.120
And then there are just
straightforward things

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.110
that we all need in life.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.130
We need health.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.370
We need happiness.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.630
We need friends.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.650
We need endorphins and oxytocin
and all the great chemicals

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.180
that our bodies
produce for us when

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.540
we have positive experiences.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.105
There has been study after
study by Chorus America

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:47.190
and the American Choral
Directors Association

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.430
and our educational
circles that show

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.440
how we, when we're
creating something

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.030
alongside other
people, feel happiness.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.520
When we sing, we feel happiness.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.390
The natural rhythms of our body
in alignment with other people,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.950
it lowers our stress level.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.010
It brings joy into our lives.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.160
And this is something
that's very clear.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.500
You can read articles out
there by Brian Eno who

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.242
has a life of creating music.

00:16:14.242 --> 00:16:16.450
And what he decided he needed
more than anything else

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.960
in his life is to join a choir.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.890
Because when he sings
alongside other people,

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.510
it brings him more joy than
any other creative pursuit

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.030
that he's done.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.580
So that's another
important part of it.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.790
And then there are
social benefits as well.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.880
There's so many people who
are sitting in their cubicle--

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.180
like you guys right
now watching this--

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.859
who are working, in many cases,
alone or on a small team.

00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:41.400
And they don't feel
as though they're

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.050
interacting with other
people, particularly

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.040
people who are very
different from themselves.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.123
And the great thing about
a group like Googapella,

00:16:47.123 --> 00:16:49.450
here at this
wonderful company, is

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.900
that you have people across
all strata of the organization,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.740
right?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.390
Including one of the members
who's the massage therapist,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.170
is that right?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:58.840
Still?

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.580
DEKE SHARON: Yes, exactly!

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.369
But what I'm saying is
you sing in this group,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.910
you get to understand and make
friends with and spend time

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.240
with people across the entirety
of this enormous organization--

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.119
not just your little team.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.930
And you'll make
friends, fall in love,

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.055
make little Google a capella
babies-- I don't know.

00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:22.640
You guys-- that's
the next step, there.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.849
And I'm sure they'll
be wonderful and bright

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.460
and have four-colored
little baby jumper

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.240
outfits, and the whole thing.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.484
But the social benefits
are very clear from singing

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:33.400
in an a capella group.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.570
And again, like I said, if you
do it right, you'll always win.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.470
So that's all nice.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.536
But then what's the
value to the business?

00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:44.536
People are working hard.

00:17:44.536 --> 00:17:45.660
There are long hours.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.020
People are drained.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.020
But Googapella's not drained.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.430
You guys go to rehearsal
of your own volition.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.800
You want to spend more time
with other people here.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.730
This recharges your
batteries, right?

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.480
There's a joy that you
feel when you sing.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.710
And then you're recharged.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.530
My daughter goes to a performing
arts school called Adda

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.171
Clevenger up in San Francisco.

00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:07.420
And their educational model's
very different from what

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.461
I've found anywhere else.

00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.319
And she loves it.

00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:10.860
What happens is they
all get together

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.640
at the beginning of the day
and they all sing music.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.107
And then they break
up each grade.

00:18:14.107 --> 00:18:15.690
And they have math,
they have English,

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.230
and then you have theater.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.440
And then you've got science.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.260
And then you've got history.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.180
And then you've got dance.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.330
Then you've got
creative expression.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.960
And by going back and exercising
different parts of your body

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.780
and your mind and your creative
spirit throughout the day,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.790
this kind of cross
training as it were

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.067
allows for a much
greater experience.

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:34.150
And then you're refreshed.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.510
You're not sitting in a desk the
whole day doing the same thing.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.654
So join Googapella, OK?

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.070
I know they've got
a waiting list.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.180
They need tenors, though,
is my understanding.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.531
Tenors.

00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:46.030
No?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.570
You've got your tenors?

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.357
They're all set.

00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:49.190
They don't want you.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.110
Stay in your seat.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.690
They're fine.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.010
Start another group.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.820
Oogapella.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.296
I think you could be part
two of the whole thing.

00:18:58.296 --> 00:19:00.170
But there are definite
benefits to a company.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.865
And I hope that other companies
find out and learn about this.

00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:05.240
Obviously, the
Techapella concert

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.840
with eight different groups
this past November was amazing.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.549
And now there are a
bunch of other groups

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:11.006
that have gotten
started, that want

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:12.460
to join the Techapella concert.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.650
And they gotta get on
that list, don't they?

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.240
Yeah.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.800
We'll see if there's room
for you this next year.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.725
But this is beautiful thing.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:22.350
One of my mottos for life is to
spread harmony through harmony.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.280
And another one is to
sing through your life.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.910
And people sing through
school and they sing

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.715
in college a capella groups.

00:19:26.715 --> 00:19:27.600
And they love it.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.350
And then it just ends for them.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.030
And that's the end of
their creative expression.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.260
Having this be a part
of a company that's

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.080
so much a part of
your lives reinforces

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.950
the power and the strength,
the value that a company can

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.479
have beyond just a paycheck.

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:43.520
It's a circle of friends.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.430
It's an opportunity for
creative expression.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.047
And it's a family in a real way.

00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:49.880
And they're nodding.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.790
Yes it's a family.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.380
It's not like, Yeah, we know
we're supposed to nod now.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.370
No, it changes your relationship
with what's going on.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.100
And there's great value to a
business to have that there.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.530
So my vision is that these
kind of casual a capella groups

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.514
will start to spring up
in companies all around.

00:20:09.514 --> 00:20:11.180
100 years ago, people
would get together

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.138
with their company,
General Motors or whatever,

00:20:13.138 --> 00:20:14.140
and sing company songs.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.470
And I mean it was
a kind of a thing.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.805
And people would be
employed by the same company

00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:19.680
for their whole life.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.870
And there was a lot less
stress in society back then.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.703
You were a company man
and you felt like you

00:20:23.703 --> 00:20:25.220
were a part of this company.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.290
Obviously our
society has changed.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.980
But with more groups like
this within businesses,

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.460
the different values and
the different benefits

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.067
that can come from a capella can
belong to that company as well.

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:38.900
And the members of the
group will definitely

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.730
feel more valued and
more connected to what's

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.590
going on within the business.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.100
And once again, guys here
at Google, you get to say,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.905
we did it first.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.880
So that's that.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.440
Sing.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.731
That's what I'm telling you do.

00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:57.121
And hopefully some
of you guys out

00:20:57.121 --> 00:20:58.370
there will take this to heart.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.036
And if there's anything
I can do to help

00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:02.140
you do that, dekesharon.com.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.151
I will get you singing.

00:21:03.151 --> 00:21:03.650
Thank you.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.558
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.440
DAVE MARKS: So Deke, to start.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.484
I mean as of now, you are an
a capella legend and really

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.650
a standard of the community.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.220
But you kind of have carved
this role for yourself.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.511
For people who aren't as
familiar with your background,

00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:24.660
can you tell them about
how this opportunity

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.110
came to be and your growth
since the Beezlebubs?

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.860
DEKE SHARON: Yeah.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.850
Well it wasn't an opportunity.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.979
It was just a crazy dream.

00:21:30.979 --> 00:21:33.020
Basically, when I was
music director of the Tufts

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.320
Beezlebubs, I wanted to
sing the kind of music

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.420
that was on the radio.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.170
So long story short,
I started integrating

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.295
beat boxing and different
vocal instrumental sounds

00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:42.680
and turned what was very
much a four-part harmony

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.187
style into a 14 person group
who would do 14-part harmony.

00:21:47.187 --> 00:21:48.770
And you'd sing the
kind of crazy songs

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.680
on the radio that back then
were impossible to do--

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.126
Peter Gabriel and Led Zeppelin
and U2 and Pink Floyd.

00:21:56.126 --> 00:21:58.500
I mean, back then, it was all
shooby doo wop, Billy Joel,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.708
and Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:03.550
All great, but there was
a thing to be unlocked.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.490
And when you look
at music history,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.350
throughout music
history, there's

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.030
been a capella-- sea shanties,
and madrigals, and barbershop,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.530
and doo-wop.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.460
So what we're doing now
isn't different fundamentally

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.900
from a cultural standpoint.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.345
It's just different,
technically.

00:22:18.345 --> 00:22:19.720
So when I graduated,
I was like I

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.345
feel like I have
lightning in a bottle.

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:23.950
If people only knew what
this was, they would love it.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.150
And everyone, including my
high school choral director,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:27.810
laughed at me.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.380
He likened it to tiddlywinks.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.387
He literally told
people, this guy

00:22:31.387 --> 00:22:33.720
wants to create a career of
this college a capella thing

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.640
that he's doing.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.260
And he's like, I want to
create a career of tiddlywinks.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.670
Like we'll have tiddlywink
networks and tiddlywink

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.740
societies and
tiddlywink competitions.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.120
He's like I feel bad for him.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.550
And now he's like,
OK, you were wrong.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.540
It worked out.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.360
So yeah.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.500
It's just been a lifetime of
following this crazy dream

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.270
and wanting to help more
people sing and spread

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.187
this kind of music,
both from the bottom up

00:22:56.187 --> 00:22:58.270
and create more groups,
and also from the top down

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.490
through the media.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.490
Get more people singing
the way the has happened

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.912
throughout human history.

00:23:02.912 --> 00:23:05.495
DAVE MARKS: And getting back to
that modern sound of a capella

00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:07.694
because people who haven't
listened to old a capella

00:23:07.694 --> 00:23:09.360
might not realize
that it doesn't always

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.563
sound like we hear it on "Pitch
Perfect," like it does today.

00:23:11.563 --> 00:23:12.770
And you were a big
influence in that.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.210
Can you tell me
about the evolution

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.584
from the doo-wop,
shooby doo wops

00:23:15.584 --> 00:23:17.890
into the amazing [INAUDIBLE]
voice as instruments.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.440
DEKE SHARON: So when I was
in the Tufts Beezlebubs,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.720
I just wanted every
woman in the audience

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.990
to love us-- and
particularly me.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.420
Because that's
really what college

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.160
a capella is all about it.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.740
It's a giant, campus-wide
mating ritual.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.470
And at Tufts, the
Beezlebubs were

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.721
like rock stars on the campus.

00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:40.261
So like, you already felt there
was an importance to what you

00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:40.830
were doing.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.550
And I was, at the same time,
at New England Conservatory

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.750
of Music in Boston.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.560
And I went by Tower Records back
and forth several times a week.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.720
And I would stop
at Tower Records

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.325
when the new
billboard charts wall

00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:54.050
was posted because I
wanted to sing a song that

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.970
was going up the charts.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.140
So I'd stop by on Tuesday,
find out what that song was,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.680
arrange it, teach it
to the group Wednesday

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.580
and Thursday night.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.530
And then Friday and
Saturday night, we'd

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.940
sing it that weekend.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.537
And I know, I was crazy.

00:24:07.537 --> 00:24:08.120
Yeah, totally.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.280
I went to class sometimes,
too-- underlined sometimes.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.770
I like to say I went to
Beezlebubs University.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.110
Anyway, there were so
many songs that you just

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.825
couldn't make work
like Duran Duran

00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:19.690
that people were
loving and listening

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.112
to all the time on college
rock radio stations.

00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:24.070
And yet everything was
still "The Longest Time"

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.694
and shooby doo wop,
as you were saying.

00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:30.550
So there was a song in a movie,
boom box above John Cusack's

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.630
head.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.370
And I was like this--
every woman in the audience

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.940
will melt if we could possibly
sing "In Your Eyes" by Peter

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.780
Gabriel.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.080
So I went back to my dorm room.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.720
And I started listening to it.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.344
And I heard all these talking
drums like, do do do do,

00:24:45.344 --> 00:24:46.510
all these shakers and stuff.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.730
And I was like you
can't shooby doo

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.310
wop your way through this song.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.435
So I took out a big piece
of orchestral music paper

00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:54.560
and I just started jotting
down the different parts

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.120
that I heard.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.703
And I ended up
bringing an arrangement

00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:59.600
into the group that was like
12 different vocal parts.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.807
And they looked at me
like, dude, what is this?

00:25:01.807 --> 00:25:02.890
I was like, just trust me.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.092
Just make these sounds
and do this thing.

00:25:05.092 --> 00:25:06.800
And they're like, you
get a half an hour.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.595
That's it.

00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:09.970
Anyway, by the end of rehearsal,
they're like, all right.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.905
We'll try it this
weekend at the concert.

00:25:13.905 --> 00:25:15.400
I think it was up in Maine.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.900
And it was one of
those moments when

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.981
we were done singing
the song that-- it's

00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:19.980
like the end of a movie.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.340
There's this silence
from the audience.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.420
And then all of a sudden-- rah!

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.350
This giant wave
of energy came up.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.962
And I realized like, whoa!

00:25:28.962 --> 00:25:30.420
So I started dabbling
in this more.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.920
And we were trying
to figure out how

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.850
to do vocal percussion
with our voices

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.440
and use the voices
as instruments,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.271
and just really repositioning
what collegiate a capella could

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:39.770
be.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.295
And yeah.

00:25:41.295 --> 00:25:42.220
It was a crazy year.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.402
And from there,
I was like, yeah,

00:25:44.402 --> 00:25:45.860
I'm going to keep
doing this thing.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.026
And even the guys I graduated
with, were like, dude,

00:25:48.026 --> 00:25:48.785
you're nuts.

00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:50.879
That's never going to happen.

00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:53.420
And back then, there were maybe
200 college a capella groups.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.410
Now we've got 3,000.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.850
And I wanted to create a
March Madness of a capella

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.440
so people would know about this.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.950
So I created the NCCA,
the National Championship

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.690
of College A Capella,
which is now international.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.250
So it's the ICCA.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.960
And that's a real competition.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.880
And then it's in
"Pitch Perfect."

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.680
So yeah.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.347
There's a lot a luck involved
for anybody who's wondering.

00:26:14.347 --> 00:26:16.930
DAVE MARKS: So if someone were
to do the same exercise you did

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.971
it, of look for a song
that was rising the charts

00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:21.520
and try to arrange it
by the weekend, in 2016,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.630
they might find it full of
electronic dance music or maybe

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.877
some trap rap type things.

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:30.460
What kind of impact do you think
that'll make on the a capella

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.430
community?

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.554
DEKE SHARON: So if you look
at all the other styles

00:26:33.554 --> 00:26:34.980
of a capella, think
about doo-wop,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.130
think about barbershop--
these were very popular

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.520
for a period of time.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.980
And then they disappeared.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.180
My great hope for the
future of a capella

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.210
is that these high
school and college

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.930
groups are doing exactly
what you're talking about.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.340
Pentatonix, biggest a capella
group out there right now.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.720
When they were on
the "Sing-Off,"

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.030
they were developing
their own sound.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.655
And it was working
with them each week.

00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:58.190
And they started to
integrate dubstep and EDM,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:03.027
electronic dance music
sounds, and dropping the bass,

00:27:03.027 --> 00:27:04.610
and all this kind
of stuff that really

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.280
wasn't happening in a capella.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.310
And now it's a full
part of their sound.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.914
And they're super cutting edge.

00:27:09.914 --> 00:27:11.830
And three years from
now, five years from now,

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.276
there'll be some new like
reggae with laser blasts in it.

00:27:15.276 --> 00:27:18.330
Or some sound that we
don't know what it is.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.734
But there's going to be an
eager music director who's

00:27:20.734 --> 00:27:22.900
going to take and figure
out how to do that vocally,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.130
weave it into their sound.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.299
And hopefully,
unlike in the past,

00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:29.340
the style and the sound
of contemporary a capella

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.470
will continue to remain
on the cutting edge.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.530
And people will still
have classical music

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.980
and barbershop and doo-wop and
the sound that we have now.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.330
It'll all continue
and co-exist, which

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.110
is why I call it
contemporary a capella.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.470
Because it's all being
done at the same time, now.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.970
DAVE MARKS: So I'd
like to jump over

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.110
to your involvement
in the "Pitch Perfect"

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.640
movies a little bit.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.776
So you served as music director
for the "Pitch Perfect" movies,

00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:48.900
right?

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.170
DEKE SHARON: Yeah.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.669
Actually, my understanding is
the Directors Guild of America

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.570
controls the word "director."

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.890
So you can't have a music
director on a movie.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.090
So I am technically
vocal producer.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.590
Yeah.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.645
And I taught the
arrangements, the actresses,

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:01.770
and all that kind of stuff.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.980
DAVE MARKS: Could you walk
us through a little bit more

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.740
of your responsibilities on
the project, what a day at work

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.941
looked like?

00:28:06.941 --> 00:28:07.690
DEKE SHARON: Yeah.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.190
Yeah.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.600
Well there was a lot a lost
sleep the first time around.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.335
Because it was like,
these actresses

00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:15.260
have never sung a capella.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.320
Are we going to actually
be able to have a movie?

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.640
But basically, what happens
is early on in the process,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.170
we have something called
a capella boot camp, which

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.934
every day, they all get together
and I do big group rehearsals

00:28:25.934 --> 00:28:28.100
as well as one-on-one
rehearsals with all the actors

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:28.970
and actresses.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.910
And they're also in
choreographic rehearsal

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.330
with AJ, who is an
amazing choreographer,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.497
works with Usher, et cetera.

00:28:34.497 --> 00:28:36.663
And they basically sing and
dance and sing and dance

00:28:36.663 --> 00:28:38.430
and sing and dance
till they're really

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.890
able to do this on their own.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.950
Once they were able to
sing their part alone,

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.926
for me, pretty much
from memory, I'll

00:28:43.926 --> 00:28:45.300
send them into a
recording studio

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.500
we've built right there
in the production offices.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.450
And they record their own
part all the way through.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.900
And then the reason
they need it memorized

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.420
is they'll be lip syncing
to themselves on set.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.920
So the early part
of the process is

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.410
a lot of sleepless
nights and hard work,

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.770
and let's adjust
this arrangement.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.770
I've got to make sure
she's up to speed on this.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.870
And then the latter
part is a lot

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.460
of sitting outside
in an August night,

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.220
sticky from dusk
till dawn, watching

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.721
a bunch of actresses
lip sync their parts

00:29:14.721 --> 00:29:16.220
over and over while
they're dancing.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.770
And then going up
on stage and saying,

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.545
Brittany, remember you
don't have the melody there.

00:29:19.545 --> 00:29:21.380
You gotta go wah
zing zing zing zing.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.410
She's like, oh,
right, right, right.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.960
Sorry, sorry,
sorry, And then, OK!

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.980
Let's do it again!

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.670
And so yeah.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.170
Yeah.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.670
Sometimes it's like
really creative.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.830
And other times
it's like-- Yeah.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.870
Lip sync patrol.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.110
But whatever it takes
to make the movie.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.610
DAVE MARKS: So I
only have one more.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.370
So if you want to start lining
up for audience questions,

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.330
we're going to pitch
those in a second.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.540
Otherwise, I'll keep making
them up as I go along.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.564
But I'd say, what's
next for Deke Sharon?

00:29:45.564 --> 00:29:46.980
What can we see
coming out of you?

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.990
What are you most excited about?

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.530
DEKE SHARON: Well, I've got
a national theatrical touring

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.900
show called "Vocalosity"
that's going back on the road.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.250
And it'll be coming out
to the west coast, which

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.750
is really great to be in
performing arts centers.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.792
And the thesis of the
show-- although I never say

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:00.333
it and never have
the singer say it--

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:02.720
is to try to convince more
people to bring singing back

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.215
into their own lives.

00:30:04.215 --> 00:30:06.340
There's a great musical
that I did the arrangements

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.450
for called "In Transit" that
was written in part by Christian

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.860
Andersen Lopez, who was half
of the song writing team that

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.390
wrote "Frozen," and her husband
Bobby Lopez who did "Avenue Q"

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.950
and "Book of Mormon."

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.294
They are like royalty
on Broadway, right now.

00:30:21.294 --> 00:30:22.210
So we have everything.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:22.610
We have funding.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.735
We're just waiting for a
house to open on Broadway.

00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:26.340
That's one of the
big challenges.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.110
So Broadway is soon
to be coming next.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.379
And there's a whole
new program I've

00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:32.670
created called the Contemporary
A Capella League, which

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.010
basically is to create
after-work groups,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.450
kind of like Googapella, where
people from an entire community

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.690
can get together and
sing casually once a week

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.030
and make friends
and fall in love

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.690
and keep music a
part of their lives.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.470
DAVE MARKS: Great.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.040
DEKE SHARON: And
the other things,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.460
it's like Google X.
I could tell you,

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.710
but then I'd have to kill you.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.760
DAVE MARKS: Sounds fair.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.560
We'll stay tuned.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.268
DEKE SHARON: Yeah

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.030
DAVE MARKS: Kiana?

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.000
AUDIENCE: It's good
to see you, again.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.890
DEKE SHARON: Hey,
how are you doing?

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.040
AUDIENCE: I'm good,
doing really well.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.120
First, I have to say I totally--
everything you're saying today

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.350
was extremely resonant.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.095
Like I was like, yes, yes.

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:07.160
And I have to say like,
I did college a capella.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.020
And I was in a group called
Talisman out of Stanford.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.230
You might have heard of them.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.730
I think--

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.070
DEKE SHARON: I've gotta
cut you off right there.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.140
Because Stanford
Talisman, in my opinion,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.961
is the single greatest
ICCA set I've ever seen.

00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:19.460
OK.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.370
This is this mid-- Oh no!

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.750
I'm not making this up.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.154
In the mid '90s,
all these groups

00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:26.570
were going out on
the final stage.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.200
And back then, we had
it at Carnegie Hall.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.900
And they went out on the stage,
and they sang and they danced.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.970
They moved around, all
this kind of stuff.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.880
And then Stanford
Talisman came out.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.650
And they stood in a big arc.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.880
And they made everybody
else look like children.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.270
They sang songs from
the African diaspora.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.890
They got the entire
audience just melting.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.760
And there was so much purity,
so much harmony, so much heart

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.429
in their music that they
were runaway favorites.

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:49.970
And there's a little
piece of me that

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.950
hopes that the college
a capella world

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.990
realizes that not everything
needs to be "Glee."

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.590
Not everything needs
to be pop, pop, pop.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.539
But there's a lot
of amazing music

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:00.830
happening all around the world.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.580
And when you draw on
it as an inspiration,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.660
you're able to take things
up to the next level.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.490
So yeah.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.090
So that's Standford Talisman.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.548
AUDIENCE: So when
you saw all that,

00:32:08.548 --> 00:32:10.680
you obviously know how
that has worked in my life

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.680
and what a wonderful privilege
that was to be a part of that.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.149
Like crazy to this day.

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:17.190
We're actually all getting
together next weekend,

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.690
and it's going to be ridiculous.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.130
But I say all that
to say, you spent

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.800
a lot of time talking about
getting people together

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.300
to sing.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.700
And I'd like to ask you, I
know you're with these people

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.370
all the time.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.200
And I know you're singing and
interacting with music all

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.710
the time.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.970
But when do you get to
sing with your friends

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.642
and just be Deke on
the tenor part 1?

00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:38.350
DEKE SHARON: Well,
the fact of the matter

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.470
is, I created a group 25 years
ago called the House Jacks.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.744
And I love being on
stage and performing.

00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:45.160
And we've toured
around the world.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.010
And we were the first group
with the designated beat boxer

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.320
and to push the sound into
the contemporary realm,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.630
into the professional realm.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.664
But last year, because
I'm so busy with movies

00:32:54.664 --> 00:32:56.205
and television, and
I was on Lifetime

00:32:56.205 --> 00:32:59.760
or whatever, I had to hand in
my pitch pipe and basically say,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.660
guys you go on without me.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.510
I'm still getting an
opportunity to perform.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.925
I performed with you
guys at Carnegie Hall

00:33:04.925 --> 00:33:05.758
a couple months ago.

00:33:05.758 --> 00:33:07.360
That was pretty awesome!

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:07.860
Yeah.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.730
And I was just back
a couple days ago

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.600
with Highlands Voices and Stay
Tuned in northern New Jersey

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.100
at a wonderful festival where
I sang a couple songs of them.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.930
So I'm still getting up
on stage and I'm singing.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.030
But I really feel
like what I need

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.470
to do right now is be
that elder statesman

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.720
and get up in front of people.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.928
And sometimes I'm directing
or sometimes I'm talking.

00:33:27.928 --> 00:33:29.840
And I'm not always the
one doing the singing.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.330
But I'll keep singing
through there, too.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.660
Thank you for asking that.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.160
AUDIENCE: So Deke, thanks.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.230
I also sang college a capella
and had the great opportunity

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.132
to sing at the
finals of the ICCA.

00:33:44.132 --> 00:33:45.090
DEKE SHARON: Oh, great!

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:45.984
What group?

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:47.150
AUDIENCE: Cornell Last Call.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:47.810
DEKE SHARON: Nice group.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.130
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:48.290
Great.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.748
AUDIENCE: I won't
say how long ago,

00:33:49.748 --> 00:33:52.740
because I don't want to give
away my age-- way, way too long

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.422
ago.

00:33:54.422 --> 00:33:55.880
So first of all,
thank you so much.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.410
That was one of the incredible
experiences of my life.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.280
And so I want to say, first
of all, thank you for that.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.150
But you also talked a lot about
how basically everyone can find

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.780
a voice and be able to sing.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.469
Given the competitive nature
of a capella and taking it

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.880
to competitions like
the ICCAs, and even

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.469
just the competitive nature
of getting into a group

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.120
to begin with in colleges,
what would be your advice

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.889
and guidance for those who
may not have the opportunity

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.320
to sing with some of
those elite groups

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.150
that go on to do all
the various things?

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.025
DEKE SHARON: Totally.

00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:30.139
Well, the great thing is that
within the collegiate a capella

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.320
world, for instance, there are
3,000 plus groups out there.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.770
Only 300 are doing the ICCA.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.560
So bottom line, you've got
90% of them are not competing.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.400
They're just in the group
to sing and make friends

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.949
and fall in love
and go on road trips

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.130
and do all the great things.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.830
And when I was in the
Beelzebubs, we never competed.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.477
It was actually
part of our mantra.

00:34:49.477 --> 00:34:51.310
We were like, we don't
ever want to compete.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.170
Music shouldn't be
about competition.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.590
And honestly, I didn't start
the ICCA because I wanted people

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.210
to compete.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.800
I did it entirely
for the audience,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.990
to create a March Madness.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.330
And every time I'm backstage,
I go to all the singers,

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.040
and I'm like, guys,
these your friends.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.470
You want them to be great.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.530
We want to spread
all this music.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.180
And you're here,
you already won.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.514
And that's what I told people
on the "Sing Off" as well.

00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:15.846
And the great thing that's
happening on college campuses

00:35:15.846 --> 00:35:17.640
is if these elite
groups are already full,

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.120
more groups are getting started.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.410
And more and more-- I'll bet
you if you went back to Cornell,

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.993
you'd be like, I can't believe
how many a capella groups there

00:35:23.993 --> 00:35:24.590
are now.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.630
And at some schools
like Yale that

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.254
don't have fraternities
and sororities,

00:35:27.254 --> 00:35:29.750
they have like 20
a capella groups.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.590
Yeah, I know, totally.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.757
And people are like, really?

00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:33.256
Yale?

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.350
They're so busy studying.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.850
You guys work at Google and you
have time to sing a capella,

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:37.360
OK.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.570
There's time in your lives.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.735
You can make time for it.

00:35:39.735 --> 00:35:42.140
And it actually makes everything
else easier and more fun

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.690
and recharges your batteries.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.274
So the beautiful thing is
I'd say only a small portion

00:35:46.274 --> 00:35:47.690
of what's going
on in contemporary

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.390
a capella involves competition.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.390
And for most of the people,
it's just happiness and joy

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.796
and love.

00:35:53.796 --> 00:35:54.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.650
DEKE SHARON: Thank you
for that great question.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:56.980
AUDIENCE: Hi, Deke.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.080
Thanks so much for coming.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.510
DEKE SHARON: Of course.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.550
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned earlier

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.070
that a lot of what
drew you to a capella

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.140
is the ability to be completely
creative and innovative

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.230
with your sound.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.910
So would you mind either
demonstrating or perhaps

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.480
teaching the audience
here today one

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.210
of your favorite or most
innovative or creative sounds

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.130
that you've explored?

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.005
DEKE SHARON: Oh, wow.

00:36:19.005 --> 00:36:19.875
OK.

00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:20.750
You want the trumpet?

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:21.990
OK.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.080
OK, I'll teach trumpet.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.580
But first, so that you guys
know what I'm talking about.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.960
So there are so many
different instrumental sounds

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.800
you can make with your voice.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.615
You could do a
regular trumpet like--

00:36:31.615 --> 00:36:33.886
[MAKING A TRUMPET SOUND]

00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:34.530
Like a trombone

[MAKING A TROMBONE SOUND]

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.315
Or a flute

00:36:37.315 --> 00:36:40.834
[MAKING  A FLUTE SOUND]
or like an electric guitar

00:36:40.834 --> 00:36:42.250
[MAKING AN ELECTRIC GUITAR
 SOUND]

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.810
But what they want is--

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.730
[LAUGHING]

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.220
They want the muted-- I know.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.990
It's amazing that it's
a marketable skill, now.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.860
What they want is the
muted trumpet which

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.090
sounds a little like this--

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:02.620
[MAKING A MUTED TRUMPET SOUND]

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.370
--which is both
occasionally useful

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.980
from a musical standpoint, and
also if you're on long drives.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.610
You can get whatever you want
if you're in the backseat.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:10.350
You're just like--

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.170
[MAKING MUTED TRUMPET SOUND]

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.860
OK, fine!

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.900
We'll change the radio.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.900
[LAUGHING]

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.260
So the best way I
can teach this sound

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.910
is actually what I
call Cartman method.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.471
How many of you guys are
familiar with "South Park?"

00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:22.970
right?

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:23.410
OK.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.185
So you know (MIMICKING
CARTMAN FROM "SOUTH PARK")

00:37:24.185 --> 00:37:25.185
Cartman talks like this.

00:37:25.185 --> 00:37:25.910
He down here.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.951
He says like, "hey guys."

00:37:26.951 --> 00:37:27.890
He'll say, "hey guys."

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.470
AUDIENCE: (MIMICKING
CARTMAN) Hey, guys.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.960
DEKE SHARON: He's like,
I want my cheesy poofs.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.934
AUDIENCE: I want
my cheesy poofs.

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:33.151
DEKE SHARON: And then
he gets excited, he's

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:33.882
like (RAISING VOICE
PITCH) oh my God!

00:37:33.882 --> 00:37:34.856

00:37:34.856 --> 00:37:35.830
DEKE SHARON: (RAISING VOICE

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.317
AUDIENCE: Oh my God!

00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:37.195
DEKE SHARON: Aah!

00:37:37.195 --> 00:37:37.778
AUDIENCE: Aah!

00:37:37.778 --> 00:37:38.486
DEKE SHARON: Aah!

00:37:38.486 --> 00:37:39.071
AUDIENCE: Aah!

00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:40.570
DEKE SHARON: So
keep that ugly tone.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.759
And then you take
that "aah" and then

00:37:42.759 --> 00:37:44.550
you're going to close
your mouth around it.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.574
So listen.
[SOUND EFFECT] Try that.

00:37:47.574 --> 00:37:48.750
[AUDIENCE REPEATS NOISE]

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.875
DEKE SHARON: Did you hear
how that just got pretty,

00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:52.085
all you singers over here?

00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:53.172
You were like, aah!

00:37:53.172 --> 00:37:54.755
And then I was like
go [SOUND EFFECT].

00:37:54.755 --> 00:37:56.655
And you went [SOUND EFFECT].

00:37:56.655 --> 00:38:00.070
No, you have to lose all of
the beauty in your voice.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.570
You have to keep
that kind of noise.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.736
So keep the [SOUND EFFECTS].

00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:15.650
DEKE SHARON: You're
getting there.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.900
And I've got a YouTube channel
with all these different

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.910
instrumental sound little
videos et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.010
And if you come up with
an instrumental sound

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.900
and teach me how to do
it-- because it's not

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:33.210
like there's a school you can
go to for annoying vocal noises.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.660
We're deriving this.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.040
This is a new, cutting
edge technology.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.521
So if you want to start a
new team at Google for that,

00:38:40.521 --> 00:38:41.020
let me know.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.966
And I won't tell anyone.

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:42.841
Let's keep it secret.

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:44.570
We'll keep it secret.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.070
Awesome.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.630
Thank you.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.845
AUDIENCE: So you have
someone who isn't a singer

00:38:50.845 --> 00:38:53.070
or isn't a professional
singer and they've

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.780
seen professional
singers or maybe they've

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.260
memorized sort of,
but not really.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.810
And they've never actually
memorized a piece.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.460
They've had the experience over
and over again of thinking,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.680
I couldn't do that
or I can't do that.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.520
How do you take that
person and motivate

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.640
them to reach their next level?

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.920
DEKE SHARON: So I mentioned
a basketball analogy earlier.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.200
And I want to take
it one step further .

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.830
So we watch Steph
Curry and the Warriors

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.940
break records and play
amazing team basketball

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.460
at the next level.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.210
And if you get too focused on
what he's doing, you may think,

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.640
I should never play basketball.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.560
He's too good.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.290
You may watch Prince
sing and be like,

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.240
I got no business doing that.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.070
But that's ridiculous if only
the greatest chefs cooked,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.803
we'd all starve to death.

00:39:39.803 --> 00:39:44.360
So the proficiency of the
experts should in no way

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.630
inform the rest of us as
to our ability to do it.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.180
Moreover, if you're driving
on a Sunday afternoon

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.660
past a high school,
basketball hoops outside,

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.920
and you see some 35,
40-year-old shooting hoops.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.870
You don't think anything of it.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.370
You're like, oh, they're
having a good time.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.745
But you go to the
farmer's market

00:40:01.745 --> 00:40:03.750
and you hear some 35,
40-year-old singing

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.750
and you probably immediately
start judging them.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.089
Ooh, I don't know if that's
so great, or whatever.

00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:09.880
That's something that's
broken our society.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.430
We are too critical of
the arts, particularly

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.247
from a participatory standpoint.

00:40:14.247 --> 00:40:16.830
And part of what I want to do
is change that dialogue we have.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.410
I cannot tell you how I'm
happy I am that "American Idol"

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.460
is off the air.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.080
Because I think they've
done enormous psychic damage

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.440
to people who now only sing
in their car or in the shower

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.770
or maybe once a yea
karaoke when they're drunk.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.170
Like they're
terrified that they're

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.310
going to be called out
for not being great.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.150
So I think we just need
to remind them, everybody,

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.130
that OK, you're
not to be Picasso,

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.150
but that doesn't mean you should
never jot down a line drawing.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.035
And you're never going
to be Thomas Keller,

00:40:44.035 --> 00:40:45.951
so that doesn't mean you
shouldn't cook dinner

00:40:45.951 --> 00:40:48.030
for your friends.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.240
You're not going to be
Pentatonix, but singing is fun.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.802
And you should sing.

00:40:52.802 --> 00:40:53.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.968
DEKE SHARON: And
then if they don't

00:40:54.968 --> 00:40:57.440
do that, punch them and drag
them to your next rehearsal.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.090
And when they wake up you've,
got them chained to the chair.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.520
And they don't get
to leave until they

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.310
sing a perfect major third.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.050
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.470
DEKE SHARON: Good luck.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:07.470
Let me know how it goes.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.000
And I'll testify at
trial, if I need to.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.979
I'm happy to.

00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:11.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, Deke.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:12.936
So I had a question for you.

00:41:12.936 --> 00:41:16.950
Now when you mentioned the
voice is of fretless instrument.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.720
And I was curious,
how much when you're

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.450
doing this kind of
arranging, how much do

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:21.830
you think of the
way chords sound

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.380
like when you're
not forced to have

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.670
equal temperament, for
example, versus what you can

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.930
do with the voice and
the kinds of harmonics

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:33.290
that you can use
effectively in vocal harmony

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.610
DEKE SHARON: I'm about to
get super music theory wonky.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.200
I hope I don't lose
you guys-- especially,

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.530
those of you watching
the Google Tech Talk.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.350
They just went, click.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:39.680
OK.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.290
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry!

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.390
DEKE SHARON: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.890
No.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:42.450
OK.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.170
So basically the bottom
line is the human voice

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:49.980
creates sound that
exists within physics.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.570
And we are able
to sing in better

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:55.060
tune than a piano or a
guitar because they're really

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.780
locked to this well-tempered
tuning system that

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.287
is fundamentally imperfect.

00:41:59.287 --> 00:42:00.870
We made this trade
off so that then we

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.480
could have harmonic changes.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.940
Otherwise, what you get is
like Indian classical music,

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.080
which remains in the same key,
the same mode, the same raga

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:08.904
the whole time.

00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:10.570
And you can have a
melody, but you don't

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.316
have any harmonic changes.

00:42:12.316 --> 00:42:13.440
Those are your two options.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.600
So I think it's a good trade,
but it's still imperfect

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.020
The one thing I really do
think about when I'm arranging

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.570
is keeping the voices
spread very much

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.630
the way that exists in the
physics of sound, the harmonic

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.350
series.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.055
You can look it up
online, Wikipedia.

00:42:28.055 --> 00:42:32.380
I'm sure Google has their own
several pages somewhere online

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.350
of the harmonic
series and the way

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.620
that every note casts a
number of harmonics above it.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.120
To make a long story
short, it means

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.640
keeping your bass notes low and
your other voices closer voiced

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.480
up above.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.004
Because what that does is it
allows you to tune more easily.

00:42:46.004 --> 00:42:47.670
And what I try to do
in my arrangements,

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.330
as much as there's a lot of joy
in them and a lot of complexity

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.250
is to make it easy for people
to do things like tune,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.490
so then they can focus on
connecting with an audience

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.865
and emoting rather than spending
their entire time having

00:42:58.865 --> 00:43:01.060
to worry about the mechanics
of what's going on.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.950
So that's really my go to.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:04.450
Yeah.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.283
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:05.283 --> 00:43:07.397
DEKE SHARON: No problem.

00:43:07.397 --> 00:43:08.480
And you can come back now.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.060
Click.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.650
Unmute.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:10.150
OK, good.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.057
You're back.

00:43:11.057 --> 00:43:13.640
AUDIENCE: It's funny just as an
aside that you mentioned that.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.170
Because in Georgian
singing, their scale

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:18.630
is based on the fifth.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.220
And their octaves are,
therefore, out of tune.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.240
So they can't have deep bases.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.450
They have to keep
everything within about

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.350
an octave and a half, or
else they're out of tune.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.090
DEKE SHARON: Wow.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.191
That's Georgia over in Russia.

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:32.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, not
where the peaches are.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.070
DEKE SHARON: Nah, I called
United Airlines once.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.060
And I needed a
flight to Georgia.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.143
And they're like, it's
going to be very expensive.

00:43:38.143 --> 00:43:41.540
And I was like, no, I want
the one here in the US.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.580
AUDIENCE: Anyway, I've been
directing a community course

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.670
for about 20 years,
focusing mostly

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.550
on world music and
traditional music.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.150
And I liked the comments
you made about Talisman.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.760
And I've just been
thinking about--

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.800
as you were speaking about all
these things-- and the element

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.202
that I really pay a lot of
attention to that was sort

00:44:01.202 --> 00:44:02.910
of missing from what
you're talking about

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.830
was the cultural element.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:08.680
Because I really focus on
music that comes from places.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.240
And I think that in
addition to everything

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.400
you said, one of the
things about doing

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.870
that is that you're
bringing a sense of place

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:20.030
and a sense of culture into
play, into people, and both

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.791
the singers and the audience.

00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:23.290
And I think that's
really important.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.910
And I see-- well,
"American Idol" especially.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:31.580
But a lot of modern music
that's very pop-oriented

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.257
is great in its own ways.

00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:34.840
But we're losing a
little bit of sense

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.480
of that global connectedness.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.490
And groups like Vocal
Sampling and groups

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.220
like what Keith Terry's doing
and lots of those groups

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.390
try to get there.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.260
But it's hard for Americans
to hear that stuff

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.530
and be aware of it.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.400
DEKE SHARON: Well, one of the
great things about a capella

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.430
is once people fall in love with
the sound of the human voice,

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.330
they're much more likely to move
into different styles of music.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.840
In fact, singers are able
to blend styles more easily

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.180
than other styles of music.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.320
So you go to a King's
Singer's concert

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.310
and they start out
singing early music.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.240
And then they go into
20th century classical.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.210
And they may sing some
classical choral music.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.940
And then they go and they
sing some early folk Americana

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.276
and maybe some jazz
and end with some pop.

00:45:13.276 --> 00:45:14.650
No instrumentalist
could do that.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.380
Because they'd need like
early music instruments

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.600
like recorders and sackbuts.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.600
And then they'd need an
entire string orchestra.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.070
And then they'd need some
world music instruments

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.930
and a jazz combo
and a rock band.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.522
Like it's never done.

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:27.230
So you're able to
travel around the world

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.938
more effectively with
your voice than you

00:45:28.938 --> 00:45:31.560
are with any other
style of music--

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.804
or any other instrumentation,
more correctly.

00:45:33.804 --> 00:45:36.220
And the beautiful thing about
what's going on in a capella

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.761
now-- and you may not see this
with Pentatonix or on YouTube.

00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:42.360
But the fact of the matter is
different styles of a capella

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.170
are becoming more popular
based on their local roots.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:48.750
So you go to Taiwan which
has a tremendous tradition

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.100
of a capella singing.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.330
And you get a group
like O-Kai Singers who

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:56.050
are blending Taiwanese pop music
with this traditional Taiwanese

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:56.550
style.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.720
Or when I made the
"Sing-Off" in China,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.350
we were taking Chinese songs
and blending them with popular

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:01.850
idioms.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.500
So you'd get some old
Maoist song with disco beat.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.390
We just had a lot of
fun being really crazy

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.190
and creating a new sound and
style of contemporary Chinese

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.220
a capella.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.510
And for anybody who's
in America thinking

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.590
like, well, but everything's
homogenized here.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.490
There's no real sense of place.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:23.280
I tell you, so little has been
done and so much still exists.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.400
First of all, where's the
great Hawaiian a capella group?

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.080
Where's the great Cajun
a capella group, right?

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.980
We just, on the "Sing-Off,"
created the first ever country

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.010
a capella group with Home Free.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.970
There's a vast--
where's the great Latin

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.350
a capella that's
going to tear up-- I

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.600
was hoping Nota would do that.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.070
And Vocal Sampling
from Cuba's tremendous.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.550
But there's still so
much, so many stones

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.100
we that haven't been uncovered.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.560
Plus you can blend
these different styles.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.160
Take Six took gospel
melodies, jazz harmonies,

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.440
R&amp;B stylings and created a
style that's all their own.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.220
And now they've got dozens
of Grammys as a result of it.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.070
Within a capella, there
are so many frontiers that

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.140
haven't even been bridged yet.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.370
So keep pushing.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.980
And do look for location.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.340
And do listen for to great
Bulgarian women's choir

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.650
tradition that happens over--
the Le Mystere des Voix

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:14.150
Bulgares.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.165
I almost did a
Bulgarian Fulbright

00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:17.540
before I was like,
nah, I'm gonna

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.956
do this pop thing, because I
just love that sound so much.

00:47:19.956 --> 00:47:23.500
And oh, there amazing singing
going on down in Australia

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.350
and Sri Lanka-- like
all around the world.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:26.350
So look for that.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.270
And you'll find it.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.830
Thank you for bringing that up.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.530
DAVE MARKS: All
right, let's hear it

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.030
one more time for Deke Sharon!

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.238
DEKE SHARON: Thank you, guys!

00:47:32.238 --> 00:47:34.080
[APPLAUSE]
