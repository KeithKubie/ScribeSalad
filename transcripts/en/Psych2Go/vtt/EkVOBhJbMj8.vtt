00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.060
Families are supposed to be the people you can lean on during tough times.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.660
At the end of the day, you know you can rely on them,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.040
and that they'll love you even through thick and thin.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.300
But what about those of us who come from dysfunctional families?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.280
And are the signs always clear and obvious

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.340
or can they be subtle and deceiving?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.880
Here are 8 common characteristics of a dysfunctional family.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200
1. Addiction

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.540
Roughly 45% of the U.S. population

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.940
has been exposed to some form of alcoholism

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.080
or alcoholic behavior in their family.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.540
That's as many as 76 million people.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.000
And approximately 26 million of those people are children.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.680
The addiction can be drugs, alcohol, or a combination of both.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.620
Addicted parents can have negative financial, communicative, or connective impacts on the family,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.460
affecting every family member's ability to form close, healthy relationships with others.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.100
2. Perfectionism

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.960
This one can be difficult to spot,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.760
especially if a family looks picture-perfect on the outside.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800
When perfectionism is highly regarded,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.880
and children have to bear their parents' unrealistic expectations,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.420
they may grow up with self-image and self-esteem issues,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.140
believing they'll never be good enough.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.780
They also have a hard time going to their parents when they need emotional support,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.560
so they may learn to close themselves up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.180
and have trouble trusting people.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780
When parents prioritize performance and results,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.160
their children never learn to accept and improve upon their mistakes.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.680
3. Abuse

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.160
Abuse is another common characteristic of a dysfunctional family.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.060
It can be physical, emotional, and/or sexual.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.700
Abuse can occur between parents, parent and child,  or siblings.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.740
People use abuse to punish their families

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.920
for unwanted behavior, and stay in control

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.460
when they believe they've been betrayed.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.000
If you think you're being abused,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.780
we encourage you to call your emergency hotline number.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060
4. Unpredictability and fear

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.880
Unpredictability and fear go hand-in-hand.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.960
It's a pattern often produced from abuse,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.980
but can also stem from a family member's financial or emotional instability.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.240
Children who come from an unpredictable household

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.060
suffer from low self-esteem issues,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.860
and either grow up to become extremely responsible crowd-pleasers

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.360
or end up mirroring their parents' toxic behaviors.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.780
Unpredicability and fear are results of overly rigid or religious upbringings,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.560
when a family doesn't allow family members to form their own beliefs, aspirations, and interests.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.340
5. Conditional love

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.900
In dysfunctional families,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.720
conditional love is exercised by manipulative people.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.320
When a parent or spouse only gives others love when they want something,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.400
they're either insecure or selfish.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
For instance, a selfish mother might show love and support to their child

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.980
just so that when the child reaches adulthood,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.300
they will take care of her.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.520
When love is conditional,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.160
it can make family members feel used or cheated.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.980
6. Lack of boundaries

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.380
When a family doesn't establish healthy boundaries,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.100
members will often feel like they have no privacy, or aren't being respected.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.560
Parent who see their children as trophies or extensions of themselves are narcissistic,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.260
causing children to feel confused about their own identities

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.660
when they aren't properly nurtured or encouraged.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.680
Boundaries are blurred when a parent tries to be controlling or dominant through anger.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.560
And children feel like they have no choice

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.340
but to act or behave in certain ways to please their parent.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.540
As a result, they grow up feeling alienated or lost,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.440
and become overly self-critical.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.260
7. Lack of intimacy

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.300
Dysfunctional families often mistake codependency as intimacy.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.540
In healthy families,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.940
parents teach their children how to be self-efficient.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.900
But if a parent is scared of letting go,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.840
they'll make claims about being able to live without their kids if they grow up and leave.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.560
Likewise,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.240
a spouse who may show excessive clinginess to their partner.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.800
It's important for family members to be with each other

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.180
because they want to, not because they have to.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.380
Ultimately, love is a selfless act,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.580
and should never be pressured or forced.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.260
8. Poor communication

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.560
Family conflicts typically stem from poor communication.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.600
When people can't express themselves due to strained or nonexistant communication,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.620
they feel unheard, invisible, or misunderstood.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.500
Overall, dysfunctional families don't practice healthy communication skills,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.060
so members can be quick to react

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.280
rather than waiting to listen and understand.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.580
The resulting arguments cause daily stress

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.480
and challenges that tear the family apart.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.320
Does your family identify with any of these characteristics?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.940
What methods have you tried to bring the family back together?
