00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.040
NARRATOR: Infidelity, Nazis, and
strippers?

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.380
[gasp]

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.000
These are some of
the most scandalous

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.330
royal marriages in history.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
An estimated 750 million
people worldwide tuned in

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.000
to watch the union of England's
Prince Charles and Lady Diana

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.170
Spencer, which slowly
collapsed under the weight of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.000
tabloid gossip and infidelity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.670
In 1993, British tabloids
leaked the transcript

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.750
of a racy six minute
conversation between Charles

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
and an old flame--

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.920
BRITISH MAN: Oh dear.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.540
NARRATOR: Camilla Parker Bowles.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.380
The scandal was
dubbed Camillagate.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.580
Diana would later
admit to her own affair

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.000
with a British cavalry
officer named James Hewitt.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.580
Charles and Diana
divorced in 1996.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.380
A year later, Diana
was tragically killed

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.080
in a car accident in Paris.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.250
As for Charles and Camilla,
they finally married in 2005.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.710
And in a final nod towards the
controversy of their coupling,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.620
Camilla is referred to as
the Duchess of Cornwall,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.960
not Princess of Wales.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.460
The love story of
Dutch Princess Beatrix

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.460
and her German suitor Claus
Von Amsberg had a rocky start.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.380
When news of their engagement
became public in 1965,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.120
so did Claus's past.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.250
As a teenager, Claus was a
member of the Hitler Youth,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.710
and later served briefly
with the German Army

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.580
during World War II.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.420
Scarred from five years
of Nazi occupation,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.120
the Dutch people bitterly
opposed the union.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.290
But Queen Juliana,
her husband, Prince

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380
Bernard, and Dutch
parliament approved

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.830
of the princess's fiance.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.170
The 1966 wedding went ahead
as planned, sparking a wave

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.000
of violent street protests.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.330
Claus worked hard
to revamp his image.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.670
He denounced the Nazi regime,
learned Dutch, and steered

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.330
clear of controversy.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
He eventually became
the most popular

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.000
member of the Dutch royal
family until his death in 2002.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.920
Edward, Prince of
Wales, officially

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.460
became King Edward VIII when
his father died in 1936.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.620
Just months into
his reign, Edward

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.500
popped the question
to his girlfriend,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.620
a divorced American socialite
named Wallis Simpson.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.330
BRITISH MAN: My word.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.710
NARRATOR: The proposal set
off a major crisis in Britain.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.710
As king, Edward was the head
of the Church of England.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.540
To marry a divorcee
violated church doctrine

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.790
and was considered politically
and socially unacceptable.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.210
BRITISH MAN: Oh heavens.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.880
NARRATOR: With no
hopes of a solution,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.540
Edward decided to give
up the throne for love.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.330
In December of 1936, he
abdicated his royal duties

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.170
to his brother,
the Duke of York,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.120
who became King George VI.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.880
Edward and Wallis married
in 1937, becoming the Duke

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.960
and Duchess of Windsor.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.540
The 1950s wedding of
American actress Grace

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.040
Kelly to Monaco's
Prince Rainier III

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.880
was right out of a fairy tale--

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.250
lavish, elegant, and
very highly publicized.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.750
But their rebellious
daughter, Princess Stephanie,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.420
was another story.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.580
Stephanie was no stranger
to shocking headlines.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.000
She was in the car during
the accident that killed

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.420
her mother, Grace, in 1982.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
In the '90s, she ended up
falling for her bodyguard,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.040
Daniel Ducruet.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.750
His previous girlfriend
was six months pregnant,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.330
but that didn't stop them from
going public with their affair.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.580
The couple lived together and
had two children out of wedlock

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.000
before marrying in 1995.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.750
[wedding march]

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.920
The union was reluctantly
accepted by her father,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.540
Prince Rainier, who
insisted Ducruet

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.540
sign a prenuptial agreement.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.120
It was a smart move.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.420
One year later, just eight
weeks after their first wedding

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.580
anniversary, paparazzi
caught Ducruet cavorting

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.120
in the buff with a stripper
at a private estate

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.960
outside of Monaco.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.880
The couple divorced
shortly after.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.460
The Duchess of Alba
was one of Spain's most

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.790
flamboyant and richest
women, worth as

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.710
much as 3.5 billion euro.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.290
She lived by her own rules.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.580
She loved bullfighting,
flamenco dancing,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.920
and flaunting her unique style.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.290
The 85-year-old
sent tongues wagging

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.960
in 2011 when she walked down the
aisle with a much younger man--

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.620
[gasp]

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.830
Alfonso Diez Carabantes, a
straight-laced civil servant

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.500
24 years her junior.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.000
The romance outraged
her family, who felt

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.670
Diez was only after her money.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.580
To placate her heirs and
prove their love was real,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.670
the Duchess released
her will early,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.120
splitting the bulk of her
fortune among her six children.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.000
When the Duchess died in
2014, Alfonso was left

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.500
with nothing but the memories.
