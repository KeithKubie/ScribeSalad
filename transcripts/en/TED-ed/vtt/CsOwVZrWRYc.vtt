00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:15.714
We all know that there are certain virtues

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:16.922
that are good for us.

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:17.571
Intelligence,

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.197
wisdom,

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:18.994
bravery,

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:19.576
justice,

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:20.300
respect,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.282
responsibility,

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.177
honesty,

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:23.950
unselfishness,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.985
compassion,

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:24.873
patience,

00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:26.326
and perseverance

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.837
always have been and always will be positive virtues.

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.631
Think of some people who have those traits.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.550
Maybe it's Martin Luther King

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.222
or Abraham Lincoln

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:36.928
or George Washington.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:38.837
I bet you know a lot of facts

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:40.885
about these historical figures,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:42.721
but maybe you've never taken the time

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.472
to think about their character.

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.603
Let's talk about Sybil Ludington.

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:49.062
She's a little-known revolutionary figure,

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.020
but boy, was she something!

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.615
She rode 40 miles through the damp, cold night

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.482
of April 26, 1777

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.574
to alert the colonial militia of a British attack.

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:01.824
Her action was similar to that of Paul Revere,

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:03.610
only she rode twice as far

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.601
and was only 16 years old.

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.777
That takes some real guts!

00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:08.944
Beriah Green?

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.956
Anyone ever heard of Beriah Green?

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:13.263
He was president of the first integrated school

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:14.693
in the United States.

00:01:14.693 --> 00:01:16.989
He also spent the majority of his life

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:19.780
fighting for the immediate abolition of slavery.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.995
He used his voice,

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:21.609
pen,

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.469
and good deed to fight slavery.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.703
Beriah Green was fiercely devoted to abolition

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:27.810
before it was popular

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.385
because he believed it was the right thing to do.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.106
And then there's Abraham Lincoln.

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.645
You know he was president during the Civil War.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.778
He wrote the Emancipation Proclaimation

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:39.938
and is credited with freeing the slaves.

00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:42.773
He went to war with the South to save the Union.

00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.192
He helped the country get through

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:46.371
one of its most difficult times.

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.897
He kept the United States united.

00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:50.102
But, above all that,

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:53.233
Abraham Lincoln showed great leadership.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.931
Could any of these people

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.130
have done the deeds they're famous for

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.264
without bravery,

00:01:58.264 --> 00:01:59.296
compassion,

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:00.293
dedication,

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:01.215
or wisdom?

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.175
No!

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:05.145
History can teach us much more than just the facts.

00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:08.027
It's full of examples of how to live better.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:08.896
And for you,

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.851
even if you're not freeing the slaves

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.360
or riding 40 miles on horseback,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.127
bravery and wisdom will help you get an A on that test,

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:18.867
ask out that cute boy,

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:20.909
and get that great job.
