00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:10.575
It starts with a cough,

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:12.051
or a wheeze.

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.374
Soon, your chest feels tight.

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:17.216
Your breathing speeds up
and gets shallower,

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.594
making you feel short of breath.

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:23.385
These are common symptoms
of an asthma attack.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.746
Around the world, more than 300 million
people suffer from asthma,

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:32.423
and around 250,000 people 
die from it each year.

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:37.627
But why do people get asthma
and how can this disease be deadly?

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.904
Asthma affects the respiratory system,

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:42.378
particularly the smaller airways,

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:45.415
such as the bronchi and bronchioles.

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:48.816
These airways have an inner lining
called the mucosa

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.436
that's surrounded 
by a layer of smooth muscle.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:56.366
In people with asthma, the airways
are chronically inflamed,

00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.097
which can make them hyper-responsive
to certain triggers.

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:03.297
Some of the many asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke,

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.425
pollen,

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:05.212
dust,

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:06.137
fragrances,

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:07.066
exercise,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.096
cold weather,

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:09.698
stress,

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:11.476
and even the common cold.

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:14.917
When people with asthma are exposed
to these triggers,

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:19.537
an asthma attack, or exacerbation,
can occur.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:24.608
But how exactly do such everyday factors
lead to an asthma attack?

00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:26.997
If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger,

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:30.967
the smooth rings of muscle that circle
the small airways in their lungs

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.748
contract and become narrow.

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:36.928
Simultaneously, the trigger
worsens inflammation,

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.047
causing the mucosal lining
to become more swollen

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:42.697
and secrete more mucus.

00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:44.188
Under normal conditions,

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:49.498
the body uses this mucus to trap
and clear particles, like pollen or dust,

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:51.233
but during an asthma attack,

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:57.528
it blocks the narrowed airways,
making it even harder to breathe.

00:01:57.528 --> 00:02:00.639
These effects lead 
to this symptoms of asthma.

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.969
Smooth muscle constriction results
in the feeling of chest tightness.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.639
Excess mucus and increased inflammation
can cause coughing.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.050
And the wheezing noise?

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.579
That happens because 
as the airways constrict,

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:18.469
air whistles as it passes through
the narrowed space.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.189
These symptoms may make a person
feel like they're running out of air.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.277
Yet counterintuitively, 
during an asthma attack,

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:29.459
the inflammation can make it harder
to exhale than inhale.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.589
Over time, this leads to an excess
of air in the lungs,

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.339
a phenomenon known as hyperinflation.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.531
The trapping of air inside the lungs
forces the body to work harder

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.283
to move air in and out of them.

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:49.353
Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen
delivery to the body's organs and tissues.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:52.670
Sometimes, in untreated 
severe asthma attacks,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.529
the body can't keep up,

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.099
which can lead to death from
lack of oxygen.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.880
So how do we prevent these uncomfortable
and potentially fatal attacks

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.029
in people who have asthma?

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.388
One way is to reduce the presence
of triggers.

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:10.353
Unfortunately, the world 
is an unpredictable place

00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:13.893
and exposure to triggers can't
always be controlled.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:18.717
This is where inhalers, the primary
treatment for asthma, come in.

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:23.690
These medications help asthmatics both
control and prevent their asthma symptoms.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.419
Inhalers transport medication along
the affected airways

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:33.071
using a liquid mist or fine powder
to treat the problem at its source.

00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.018
They come in two forms.

00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:36.754
There are reliever medications,

00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:40.802
which treat symptoms immediately
and contain beta-agonists.

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:43.911
Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces,

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:50.132
allowing the airways to widen so more air
can travel into and out of the lungs.

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:53.609
The other form of inhalers serve
as preventive medications,

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.363
which treat asthma symptoms
over the long term,

00:03:56.363 --> 00:03:58.572
and contain corticosteroids.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:02.943
Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity
and inflammation,

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.763
so asthma can be kept under control.

00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:08.544
They're also crucial in preventing
long-term damage

00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:10.090
from chronic inflammation,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.272
which can cause scarring of the airways.

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:15.044
Inhalers are known to be very effective,

00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:17.873
and have helped many people
live better lives.

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:20.581
Although we've come a long way
in improving how we treat

00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:22.563
and diagnose asthma,

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:24.770
we still don't know its exact causes.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.402
We currently believe that a combination
of genetic and environmental factors

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.681
play a role,

00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:33.715
potentially acting during early childhood.

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:37.734
Recent research has even linked
poverty to asthma incidents.

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:39.465
This may be due to reasons ranging

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:43.139
from exposure to additional pollutants
and environmental irritants

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.975
to difficulties in obtaining medical care
or treatment.

00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:49.135
As our understanding of asthma improves,

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:53.973
we can continue to find better ways to
keep people's airways happy and healthy.
