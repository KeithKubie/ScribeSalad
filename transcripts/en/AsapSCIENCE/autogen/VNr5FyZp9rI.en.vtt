on your quest to find love and possibly

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
on your quest to find love and possibly
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.640
on your quest to find love and possibly
have offspring many of us cringe at the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
have offspring many of us cringe at the
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.010
have offspring many of us cringe at the
idea of mating with a sibling or any

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
idea of mating with a sibling or any
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.770
idea of mating with a sibling or any
relative really weird but what's the big

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
relative really weird but what's the big
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.629
relative really weird but what's the big
problem with incest in the first place

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
problem with incest in the first place
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089

what actually happens when you in breed

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
what actually happens when you in breed
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799
what actually happens when you in breed
the first thing to understand is how any

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
the first thing to understand is how any
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779
the first thing to understand is how any
trait you have comes about you have your

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
trait you have comes about you have your
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.519
trait you have comes about you have your
biological mom and your dad who each

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
biological mom and your dad who each
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.010
biological mom and your dad who each
have their own unique DNA and basically

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
have their own unique DNA and basically
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840
have their own unique DNA and basically
you get half of your DNA from mom and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
you get half of your DNA from mom and
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.089
you get half of your DNA from mom and
half from dad these DNA pairs define

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
half from dad these DNA pairs define
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429
half from dad these DNA pairs define
everything about you but in some cases

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
everything about you but in some cases
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380
everything about you but in some cases
certain traits are more dominant like

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
certain traits are more dominant like
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.479
certain traits are more dominant like
brown eyes for example if your mom has

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
brown eyes for example if your mom has
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.760
brown eyes for example if your mom has
two pairs of the brown eye allele her

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
two pairs of the brown eye allele her
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740
two pairs of the brown eye allele her
eyes will be brown and if your dad has

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
eyes will be brown and if your dad has
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720
eyes will be brown and if your dad has
two pairs for the blue eyes his will be

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
two pairs for the blue eyes his will be
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700
two pairs for the blue eyes his will be
blue as a result you'll receive one

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
blue as a result you'll receive one
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680
blue as a result you'll receive one
brown gene from mom and one blue gene

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
brown gene from mom and one blue gene
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959
brown gene from mom and one blue gene
from dad but brown eyes just happened to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
from dad but brown eyes just happened to
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029
from dad but brown eyes just happened to
be a dominant trait meaning even though

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
be a dominant trait meaning even though
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770
be a dominant trait meaning even though
you get one brown and one blue from each

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
you get one brown and one blue from each
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810
you get one brown and one blue from each
parent your eye color will actually be

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
parent your eye color will actually be
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910
parent your eye color will actually be
brown it takes having two recessive

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
brown it takes having two recessive
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889
brown it takes having two recessive
alleles to exhibit the other traits in

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
alleles to exhibit the other traits in
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900
alleles to exhibit the other traits in
this case if you got two blue alleles

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
this case if you got two blue alleles
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270
this case if you got two blue alleles
you'd end up having blue eyes so what

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
you'd end up having blue eyes so what
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830
you'd end up having blue eyes so what
does this have to do with incest it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
does this have to do with incest it
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810
does this have to do with incest it
turns out that many specific diseases or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
turns out that many specific diseases or
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.030
turns out that many specific diseases or
disorders are recessive and require you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
disorders are recessive and require you
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590
disorders are recessive and require you
to get the gene from both your mother

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
to get the gene from both your mother
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690
to get the gene from both your mother
and father they can each carry one and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
and father they can each carry one and
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429
and father they can each carry one and

result if your dad has one allele for a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
result if your dad has one allele for a
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100
result if your dad has one allele for a
disorder it's pretty likely that his

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
disorder it's pretty likely that his
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230
disorder it's pretty likely that his
sibling or relative probably has it too

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
sibling or relative probably has it too
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820
sibling or relative probably has it too
because they would have gotten it from

low but if he chooses to copulate with

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
low but if he chooses to copulate with
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.350
low but if he chooses to copulate with
his sister or cousin then your odds of

getting both of the recessive genes are

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
getting both of the recessive genes are
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.090
getting both of the recessive genes are
much higher still not guaranteed but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
much higher still not guaranteed but
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.370
much higher still not guaranteed but
much more likely in that sense it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
much more likely in that sense it's
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.840
much more likely in that sense it's
important to remember that inbreeding

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
important to remember that inbreeding
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910
important to remember that inbreeding
doesn't create genetic mutations or

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
doesn't create genetic mutations or
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.940
doesn't create genetic mutations or
defective offspring itself but instead

defective offspring itself but instead
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.410
defective offspring itself but instead
increases the chance of a rare gene

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
increases the chance of a rare gene
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480
increases the chance of a rare gene
combination in fact even when both

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
combination in fact even when both
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520
combination in fact even when both
parents carry a recessive gene there's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
parents carry a recessive gene there's
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219
parents carry a recessive gene there's
still a 75% chance that they won't both

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
still a 75% chance that they won't both
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.410
still a 75% chance that they won't both
pass on the gene leading to perfectly

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
pass on the gene leading to perfectly
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.760
pass on the gene leading to perfectly
