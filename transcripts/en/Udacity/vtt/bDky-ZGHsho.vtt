00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.370
Bandwidth and latency are the two
networky things that people often mean

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.490
when they refer to speed
of a network connection.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.580
Or rather, low bandwidth and high
latency can both feel like slowness.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.350
This is a map of the world.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.510
Well actually, it's just a map
of the Northern hemisphere.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.300
But that's okay.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.270
It'll do for this example.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.760
Here are a few places around the world.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.660
Here's Alice.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630
Alice lives in California.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.830
Alice clicks a button in your web app.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.490
The app performs a query
to your web server.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.430
But Alice is here.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.420
And your web server's over here
in Riga Latvia, many hops away.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.260
Maybe traffic has to go to Chicago,
to New York,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.160
over the ocean to London,
down into France,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.330
bum around in like the middle of Europe
for a while, eventually get to Latvia.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.010
And then your server itself consults

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
an API server that's
back in let's say Paris.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340
And that takes some time to respond.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.430
By the time the response gets
all the way back to Alice,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.150
it's been a few seconds.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.910
So the app's response to Alice's mouse
click doesn't feel instantaneous.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.890
It feels laggy.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.620
That's high latency.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.920
Now here's Bob.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.030
Bob's computer is from 1997, and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.250
he's using an old dial up
modem to connect to his ISP.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.060
Bob goes to your website.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.940
And his browser starts downloading
your site's logo which is 100

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.460
kilobytes in size.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.550
Over the next 15 seconds, your logo
slowly appears on Bob's screen.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.340
That's low bandwidth.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.740
Now one of the biggest contributors to
latency on the network is just plain

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.990
old distance and number of hops.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.480
Internet signals are bound
by the speed of light.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.930
And the routers that move
them around the globe

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.750
take some time to switch
their signals around.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.670
When you're done with this video,
I suggest you go watch

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.950
Admiral Grace Hopper's video entitled
Nanoseconds, which is on YouTube, to get

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.090
an idea of just how far things can
travel in those short periods of time.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.264
Now depending on what your app does and
how your users use it,

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.530
bandwidth may not matter much at all.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.950
If you're serving big photos or
video, of course it will.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.030
If you're serving mostly text and small
images, your site can be fast even for

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.440
people on very low bandwidth networks.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.480
Today that's less likely to mean old
modems, and more likely to mean maybe

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.880
slow cell phones, which are actually
not all that much faster than dial up.
