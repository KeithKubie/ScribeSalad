00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.160
CARLOS DE LA TORRE: My
name is Carlos de la Torre,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.880
and I am a [? BCTN ?] scholar
with the Malaysia Sustainable

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
Cities Program, a joint
MIT-UTM initiative.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.640
I am a former revenue advisor
with the State Government

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.140
of Madhya Pradesh, India
and with the Ministries

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.410
of Finance of Cambodia
and Indonesia.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.170
During this video, I would
like to talk to you about how

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.450
a complimentary
bottom-up approach may

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.000
improve the rate of
success in energy subsidy

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
reform in Malaysia.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.700
First, let me give you some
background on energy subsidies

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.490
and subsidy reform
initiatives in Malaysia.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.260
Authorities have adopted
fossil fuel energy subsidies

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.730
to provide temporary
or permanent buffer

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540
against changes in
international oil prices,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.200
support a state-owned
energy companies

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.620
as a component of
industrial policy,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.500
and provide access to energy
services to low income groups.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.620
Over time, authorities
have realized

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.140
that energy subsidies have
several unintended consequences

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.340
and costs.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.260
Energy subsidies
have been associated

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.600
with fiscal imbalances,
displaced priority [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.310
spending, and overspending
in road infrastructure,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.530
excessive energy consumption,
and under-investment

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.270
in existing electric utilities
and in renewable energy,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.020
degradation of
local air quality.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.360
An inequity of
subsidies are captured

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.410
by higher income households.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.120
In Malaysia, the cost
of energy subsidies

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.260
have been estimated at 6% of
GDP, or $24.2 billion in 2015.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.080
The estimate would
be conservative,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.950
if it excludes, for example, tax
incentives and government loan

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.760
guarantees to the fossil
fuel industry in Malaysia.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.900
In order to reform
energy subsidies,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.340
authorities have used
executive orders alone,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.900
or executive orders followed by
legislative budget approvals.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.640
This process in both a limited
number of key stakeholders,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.210
such as the Ministry of Finance
and high-ranking executive

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.509
branch officials.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.760
The measures were
developed with the belief

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.130
that this approach was faster
and the information at hand

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.720
was reliable enough.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.110
Unfortunately, the
absence of support

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.250
by key stakeholders
for subsidy reform

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.930
reflects a lack of confidence
in the ability of governments

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.710
to reallocate the
resulting budgetary savings

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.840
to the next best alternative
for the overall benefit

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.090
of the population, concerns
that vulnerable groups would not

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.720
be protected, and an
understanding that subsidies

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.990
are a mechanism to
distribute the benefits

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.900
of natural resource
endowments to the population

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.960
in the absence of
targeted social programs.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.940
Depending on the
context, authorities

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.400
can develop a series
of simple steps

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.270
to incorporate a complimentary
bottom-up approach

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.710
to the prevailing
top-down approach,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.110
so as to improve the
likelihood of success

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.160
in an energy subsidy reform.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
In the first step,
authorities need

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.770
to identify key stakeholders and
how they relate to each other.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.020
Taking the case of electricity
tariff reform in Malaysia,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.240
authorities can identify
as key stakeholders

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.830
the state-owned oil and gas
company providing gas inputs

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.480
to the system, the
Minister of Finance,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.700
the Prime Minister's office,
the consumers of electricity

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.507
services, and the
environment, represented

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:25.965
by the Ministry of
the Environment,

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:28.160
and environmental
groups, or both.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.040
In the second step,
authorities need

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.660
to assess the performance
of the stakeholders

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.350
and society as a whole.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.680
Taking the case of electricity
tariff reform in Malaysia,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.560
authorities realize
that energy subsidies

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.750
have led to more energy
consumption, lower government

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.570
revenues, and potentially
more local air pollution.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.750
In step three, once key
issues are identified

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.740
and rules for respectful
exchange and problem solving

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.000
are agreed upon, key
stakeholders and authorities

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.290
can begin to consider
alternatives.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.810
Taking the case of electricity
tariff reform in Malaysia,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.370
stakeholders and
authorities can consider

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.070
alternatives incorporating
changes in tariff levels,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.390
changes in tax incentives
that will affect

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.120
the cost of capital, a cash
transfer program for low income

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.740
families, or a combination.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.320
Each alternative will
represent a different position

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.470
for each stakeholder and
for the society as a whole.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.490
Two or three
alternatives are then

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.290
selected for a final evaluation
against commonly agreed

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.530
criteria.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.570
In the final step, authorities
and key stakeholders

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.630
select the alternative that
accommodates their interest.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.640
Taking the case of electricity
tariff reform in Malaysia,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000
authorities and
stakeholders select

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.040
the package of tariff rate, tax
incentive, and cash transfer

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.490
program measures that
meet their interests,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.390
and the selection criteria.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.320
Now, the selected package can
incorporate into the budget

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.280
process as a budget proposal.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.110
In summary, a complimentary
bottom-up approach

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.870
helps generate more information,
capacity, and trust,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.860
to implement subsidy reforms.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.900
This approach, alongside
a top-down one,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.920
should improve the rate of
success of energy subsidy

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.840
reforms.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.580
In this presentation,
we have used

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.890
the case of electricity
tariff reform in Malaysia

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.140
to explain in detail
the steps suggested.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.740
However, the same
steps can be tailored

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.270
to the different contexts
faced by authorities

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.870
in other countries.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.620
