1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,770
You are listening to
radio lab, radiolab from

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,620
W and y.

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,790
S. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Gilbert. This is radio lab,

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,010
the podcast pod cast zo today where
you're going to do something a little

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,120
different on the podcast.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,450
We're going to present a story
that you and I ran into uh,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,330
in Chicago and Chicago coast
audio cause he won an award,

9
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,090
this story and it's just
quite wonderful. Really cool.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,280
This is about soccer and it happened
to remind us about a show that we're

11
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:37,700
putting together for the spring on
the topic of symmetry, chemistry,

12
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,990
symmetry submits, symmetry here,
partying, symmetry, all different kinds.

13
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,660
And by the way, but that's later. Yeah.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,980
Oh well I'm sorry you were
about to say the cool part.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,030
It turns out that we get to do this
show not only on the radio but in three

16
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:54,470
fabulous cities in the United States of
live. Yeah, we have shows in New York.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,180
Unfortunately that one's sold out,

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:01,181
but we will be in La March 23rd and
Seattle March 30th and it's going to be

19
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,250
really fun and it'll be about symmetry,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,540
which takes us back to our
subject soccer, which uh,

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,340
at least appears quite symmetrical. Yeah,

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,790
you got two teams and people on each
size, right? You got two coaches,

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,090
two sets of fans yield. However,
there are two people on that field,

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,110
the goalkeepers on either side who are
living in a very different psychological

25
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,840
universe from the rest of the
athletes. And that's the subject,

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,940
the loneliness of the goalkeeper. And
the reporter is hardly obscene coli.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,780
Who is, um, well frizzle he was in his
earlier life, a goalkeeper himself.

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,050
He's a book author and regular presenter
on the BBC and he's talking to a guy

29
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:42,950
named Bob Wilson who's goalkeeper for a
very famous British soccer team arsenal

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,130
that's right in the sixties and
seventies that's the golden age.

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,230
And the piece begins with the following
question. What is it about goalkeepers?

32
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:55,910
All they agreed upon that they only
individual in what is a team game.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,081
In other words,

34
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:01,670
the other 10 guys can make
numerous mistakes in a game.

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,320
Even the star striker,
he can miss five, six,

36
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:11,321
eight chances in a game and scored a
winning goal in the 89th minute of a match

37
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:16,040
and he goes home. The hero on the
reverse situation that is the goalkeeper,

38
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,600
this lonely individual,

39
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:22,580
the only one who's allowed to use his
hands with the purpose of negating the

40
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:27,050
game with the whole purpose of a game of
football is to score goals and the one

41
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:29,870
villain in the piece is the
bloke between the stakes,

42
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:34,250
the goalie and all the other 10 guys
around. You understand that as well.

43
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,720
They do sing. You're crazy.

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,350
You're putting yourself in this
position where for 89 minutes you do the

45
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:39,741
reverse.

46
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:44,741
You play brilliantly and in the 90th
minute you make a positional era.

47
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:49,220
All the ball moves swerves and dips
and it looks as if it's your fault.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,270
I've got this image of goalkeepers
mostly because I was that goalkeeper that

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,980
lapse for that high ball only to see
the ball go into the back of the net and

50
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,400
that that moment. Can you
explain to me that moment

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,671
Bob,

52
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,671
when the rest of the team are walking
back to the halfway line as you're picking

53
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,540
the ball up of the net,

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,810
you're alone. I mean,
I can give you a very,

55
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:15,130
very good example of it playing in an
FAA Cup final and five days earlier we've

56
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,120
gone to White Hart Lane and we've become
champions of England until we've got an

57
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,300
opportunity to become an an as a second
club that center you to win the double.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,250
So we go, we're playing Liverpool,

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,290
everything to play for in the 1971 cup
final and I've had the best season I've

60
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,930
ever had in my career and there's suddenly
Steve Highway cuts in from the left

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,370
wing. I've probably got it
wrong by a yard and a half.

62
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,480
Are we on the edge of the box?

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,833
But

64
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,490
he strikes the goal and it flew in the
back of the net one nil down the doubles

65
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:50,651
out the window and Bob Wilson is suddenly
the guy who is likely to cost arsenal

66
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,510
that does Dave highway next
it one mill politically.

67
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,310
And as I spun around on my pants on
the, on the floor, Frank McClintock,

68
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,190
a captain put his hands on his
hips and actually moused use

69
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:07,990
[inaudible].

70
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,810
It didn't cost us Charlie
George one is the devil.

71
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,410
I finished out being asked and was
player of the year in the double season.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,010
Fantastic. But to my dying day, when
people meet me and they say, Oh,

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,200
what did you do with Steve Highway? Then

74
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,150
Hey, he's always comes up. Not The
million good safes on my to mate.

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,050
It's all those about, oh, you got
your Neopost wrong, didn't you?

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,620
Now here's a challenge
that I've never understood.

77
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,700
If you're a goalkeeper in a
team that isn't very good,

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,440
you're constantly vigilant. The bull's
always coming at you. If, however,

79
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,650
you're Bob Wilson playing behind 10 of
the best players in the world at that

80
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:51,250
time, for 89 minutes of a 90 minute game,

81
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,700
you don't have a great deal to
do. How do you stay focused?

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,070
See,

83
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,560
do you remember the bionic man when the
ball was at the other end of the field?

84
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,710
I imagined that the guy on the
ball, the opponent was Steve Austin,

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,360
so he could turn around any part of the
pitch, 60 yards away, 70 yards away,

86
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:09,570
110 yards away and strike
a ball towards my goal.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,740
Fantastic. Say Bye to Michael
[inaudible] Cross. Here's the chance.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,480
Oh my score doesn't brilliant.

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,410
Say by Basso tips in try age again.

90
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,100
Great Save for the crucial
money is for the post.

91
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,623
[inaudible] [inaudible]

92
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,810
I said challenge

93
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,920
[inaudible].

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Here we go. Sunday morning,
south coast of England,

95
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,710
Brighton and in the background you can
hear some under sixteens 22 of them

96
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,510
chasing a ball around a patch.

97
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:17,170
Well actually technically
speaking it's 20 of them.

98
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,010
There's two goalkeepers either side on
their own with no one to talk to the game

99
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:27,430
to watch the backs of their colleagues
and their face of that opposition.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,600
Almost poetic. Lets me getting
carried away with myself. Mom.

101
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,140
We'll cross the road. I'm here.

102
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,800
I meet a man called gem wall who is an
actor. That was a good, we tackle that.

103
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,040
Sorry. Slightly put off
by great. We tackle now,

104
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,940
Jim is acting in a Peter Flannery
play called the boy's own story,

105
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:49,060
which is all about a goalkeeper.

106
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,750
All right? So we've just kicked off
then we just kicked off, but we're,

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,350
we're about 10 minutes in
the Preston Panthers go down,

108
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,950
I'm afraid was that the goalkeeping
era was not goalkeeping era.

109
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm a fully paid up member
of the goalkeepers union.

110
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,390
So I think even if had
gone through his hands,

111
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,540
I wouldn't have said it's
to keep his foot. Uh,

112
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,760
now it was a very good long range to
them where I'd show up and a very good

113
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,620
midfield pass. So don't lean to the cruel
rope and see that. Go keep her there.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,110
Yeah. Is that all keeper
her or that Chemo there?

115
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,220
Keith and I keep as the quality looking
keeper with the yellow top or a gloves.

116
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,113
See their key.

117
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,820
But that's exactly what I
looked like when I was a boy.

118
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,680
I don't mean to be cruel.

119
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,910
How would those drive in those
slightly lardy slightly Lartey

120
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,010
I don't play and go, but I coached
the goalkeepers down there. Um,

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,990
but I have to say when, when I was a kid,

122
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,600
the idea of going and go
just baffled me. I thought,

123
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,380
why would you want to go there
and go? I've never known,

124
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,750
I've always been fascinated by
the kids who want to come and go.

125
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,300
But later on in my life,
when I became an actor,

126
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,970
I ended up doing a play
about a goalkeeper. So I've
got to meet goalkeepers. Uh,

127
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,410
I even did two days training down here
with Brighton and hove Albion and no, no,

128
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,440
no, no

129
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,280
sacco. Yeah, sorry. That's to nail to
the other team. Look at the cute guy.

130
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,210
He's looking skyward and he won't pick
the book. It will put the ball up.

131
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:15,130
It's gone actually through the next.
Nobody that should have been cleared.

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,690
The cross should never have commended
the goalkeeper got the blame for that.

133
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,030
Yeah. I think I'll keep scout a rough
deal. I mean, when we've been doing,

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,830
during the play, it was very simple
set. It was simply goalpost and net.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,630
Okay. It's a full size and set in
the penalty area of John Mckenna,

136
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,550
the greatest goalkeeper
never to play for England.

137
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,280
So he's asking for the
bull talking, you know,

138
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,430
as far as goalkeepers are
supposed to do to keep this,

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,890
keep themselves mentally alert. And
the thing is he never gets the ball.

140
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,640
They hate him, the team hating and
they will never pass through it.

141
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,270
Good tackle Dave layoff.
Dave, come on Dave.

142
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:55,250
If you need me or I don't
know I apply. Dave. What?

143
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,910
I mean, I'd rather do without
me. I'm the last line of defense.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,320
When I'm called into the game.

145
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:05,250
It means they failed and they
don't like that there. Your lights,

146
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,970
of course, they're glad to
have me here just in case.

147
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,800
Glad it's me throwing myself about glad
it's my head that goes in when the boots

148
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,760
are flying, but they do without
me. If they could wouldn't, yeah,

149
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,180
the object of their
game is to school goals.

150
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,710
The objective of mine is to stop
them. I made a spoil their game.

151
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,470
I can't win again. I can only lose it.

152
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
So how can I be one of them?

153
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Not that I want to be one of them when
to them I'm just a necessary evil.

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,860
Go a kid, have it shot. Let one
go. No, no, no, don't tackle it.

155
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,050
I could have saved that.

156
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,400
Well, what Greg saved the
boat, tipped it up in the air,

157
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,370
but not enough to put it over the bar
and came down behind him and as he went

158
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:51,701
for it,

159
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:56,701
so he was charged by center Ford
Lofthouse into the net goal as well.

160
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,210
I was a young goalkeeper. I played the
St John's primary school in seminars,

161
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,850
poet and keeper, Marie Lachlan, young
keeper in the loosest sense of the word.

162
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,840
We played a local big teams, sort
of Manchester United of the area,

163
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:14,080
which was Amhurst school and
I think they beat a 17 nil.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,610
The scoring of which goal broke
the young Marie, Lachlan Young.

165
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,850
I think it was probably
about five or six nil.

166
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:25,390
When I realized that there was probably
only about 10 minutes of the game gone,

167
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,040
the team had gone from being
encouraging to looking the other way.

168
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,520
How long did it take you
before you went back and goal?

169
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,560
I think about 32 years.

170
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,220
It may just be a coincidence that you
are a poet and a writer and a performer.

171
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,510
Do you think there is a commonality in
that experience of the creative for maybe

172
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,660
for people who think they're
a bit special, perhaps.

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,950
Perhaps it's things to be the ideal
place because as a striker you may can

174
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,390
always be partnered with another striker,

175
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:58,870
but there is only one goalkeeper and he
gets to wear a different strip than the

176
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:03,070
rest of the team and has his
own universe too to operate in

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,400
[inaudible]

178
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,470
that full nails, full nail,

179
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,860
that's not even half time we
have gotten taken apart here.

180
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,270
I wonder how much of his confidence
has gone or not. I better not.

181
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I lucky lights, heads up character

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,650
both hours, other states by or
headed the ball back to the Polish,

183
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,220
go keep up. He goes, Jen,
pick it up. Extraordinary

184
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,460
and I think of how I used to feel
when I let a golden ridiculous,

185
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,890
that feeling of letting everybody down,

186
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,701
oh,

187
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:38,650
I save the Chive is let it go right
through his body and into the back of the

188
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:41,650
net that is in a pooling
gold BB in his face.

189
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,300
I used to go home after a match, a city,
and literally shed tears over a goal.

190
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:51,301
I'd lay him blaming myself for the one
that beat us over and over and over in my

191
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:55,870
head. Why didn't I go for the, why didn't
I see him coming in on the back stick?

192
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,630
Where was my cover? Yeah.
Where was my cover? Oh,

193
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,000
what's the fullback sitting
at home crying his eyes out.

194
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,340
[inaudible]

195
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,690
hello. Paul Robinson.

196
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,740
England goalkeeper was undone
when a back pass came towards him.

197
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:21,620
He aimed to kick at it, missed
the ball, went into the goal.

198
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,010
It wasn't his fault, the
ball bobbled. It was a go.

199
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,210
It was looked comic and looked like
Robinson sport. He knows it wasn't,

200
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,160
and yet it still destroyed him. Chief
sportswriter of the Times, Simon Barnes,

201
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,530
another writer, another man.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,070
He spends his time alone hoping to
make a mark on the world and yes,

203
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,170
another former goalkeeper.
We're everywhere. Let's see,

204
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,630
I think I'm developing a theory here and
Simon's got a role call of loners and

205
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,560
Mavericks to support it.

206
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,160
Yes, the renascence goalkeepers,

207
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,250
it's a fine list and it begins with
Alabama [inaudible] author of the outsider

208
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,200
or go Coupa is by definition a tone Jay.

209
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,180
But Kennedy famously said that all that
I know most surely about morality in the

210
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:11,180
obligations of Man I know from sport.

211
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,270
Others include who you
Yglesias. Uh, Che Guevara.

212
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,410
Che Guevara was a, a goalkeeper out of
necessity because he loved football.

213
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,410
But uh, he had asthma so he would
couldn't cut it as an outfielder. The A,

214
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,080
the late Pope John Paul, the second was a,

215
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,130
also a goalkeeper and Laddie Amir
Nabokov who liked to be seen as sublimely

216
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:38,530
different from the crowd. And
this was well Vladimir Nabokov,

217
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:42,380
a goalkeeper and occasional novelists
wrote about the higher of his two aunts.

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,550
As with folded arms, I lent
against the left goalposts.

219
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,230
I enjoyed the luxury of closing my eyes
and thus I would listen to my heart

220
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,520
knocking and feel the blind drizzle
on my face and hear in the distance,

221
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:57,230
the broken sounds of the game.

222
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,850
And think of myself as other
fabulous exotic. Being in an English.

223
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:05,180
Football is disguise.
Composing my verse in a tongue.

224
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:07,850
Nobody understood about a remote country.

225
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:12,410
Nobody knew small wander. I was
not very popular with my teammates.

226
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,740
I think that's a beautiful
moment of serenity that only
a goalkeeper can know in

227
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,300
the middle of a game of football.
In the bustle of it all,

228
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,590
you have time to yourself,

229
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:26,060
time to reflect time which many
goalkeepers eventually used to destroy

230
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,460
themselves to suddenly to
destroy their sporting nerve.

231
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,590
Now that comment by Simon Che Guevara
pleading goal because of the severe

232
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:34,520
childhood asthma.

233
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,060
Now I've done a bit of research on that
list of Renee small school is and do you

234
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:42,230
know Albert Camou developed
TB as a youngster? Yes.

235
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Vladimir Nabokov nearly died of pneumonia
as a child and then was traumatized by

236
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,420
having a flea revolutionary Russia,

237
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,500
Pope John Paul the second
mother died when he was nine.

238
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,280
Brother three years later makes you think

239
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,780
there is a sense in which, uh,
choosing to play goalkeeper does show.

240
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,190
I'm understanding that one is not as
other people and certainly a grief and

241
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,380
trauma can do that.
Particularly in children.

242
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,980
You may accept that your
position is to be, um,

243
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,690
not to the same as the rest.

244
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,270
And what I consider proof
from the BBC archives,

245
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,740
childhood goalkeeper and solar
violinist, emphasis on the word Solo.

246
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,230
Itzhak Perlman, four years old,

247
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,510
polio. I did football,

248
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,380
I was goalie because I worked with
crutches so I could stop bowls a little

249
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,170
easier than you know, I stuck
with my feet with my crutches.

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,220
The say that again. And
this time you gotten

251
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,850
terrific one say just
painted over the crossbar.

252
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,500
He just fit like a dog of a bow.
That and just deflected that one.

253
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,910
It was very hard for the top,

254
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,490
gone to that all the way and it
was a novelty side by side glove

255
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,880
that was a grand and shot in the grand say

256
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,000
when I see a great goal, it seems
to me an incomplete experience.

257
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,280
You should have a great shot
followed by a great save to be a,

258
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:10,810
a fully complete and rounded experience.

259
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't expect people to
understand that. In fact,

260
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,180
I hope people don't understand it.

261
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:19,510
Being misunderstood is part of
the goalkeeper stocking tray.

262
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,600
You wouldn't be a goalkeeper unless
you wanted to be misunderstood.

263
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,920
How can I not be obsessed
with failure if I succeed?

264
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,820
What have I done? What
have I created? Nothing.

265
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,490
Even the poorest goals go into the
record books. Great saves or forgotten.

266
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,290
This could be a [inaudible]

267
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,923
eternal optimism.

268
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,560
You half the time does get somewhere near
the 18 year old box and Jim's thinking

269
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,630
it could be a goal for Nyla half time.

270
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,240
What's up? Yes, he's in tears.
Preston pump, this keepers in tears,

271
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,250
poor lot gloves are off.

272
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,000
He's crying. Poor boys crying.

273
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,500
It's under sixteens football on a
Sunday morning to go down to you.

274
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,153
Can you hear that?

275
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,180
I tell you what it is the great
goalkeepers when all else fails,

276
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,430
those guys in front of you,

277
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:32,930
those 10 guys need to look round
and say the goalie will savers.

278
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,380
Now that's the difference.
Once you acquire greatness,

279
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,680
true greatness and very few
goalkeepers really acquire that,

280
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:45,210
that aura about them and one
of the greatest love sprays.

281
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,340
Wait, say the bias. Great, brilliant.

282
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,270
That's great. I mean this
just about sums it up.

283
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,970
It doesn't matter that he kept hundreds
of clean sheets to get the cup and

284
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,201
championship successes.

285
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:05,880
Never mind that you saved the blushes of
countless dodgy defenders and there are

286
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,140
plenty of dodgy defenders. The
thing that defines Gary Sprague,

287
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,460
the loneliest of all
lonely keepers is the goal.

288
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,610
He scored against himself in
1967 and he's not even Scottish.

289
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,810
Gone Sell Gary Son,

290
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,490
we were playing live at the one day in
three minutes before half time costumer

291
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,030
cross. I caught the ball ketocal booze
on left wing, he shouted to throw at him.

292
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,840
Jessica was going to throw it to him
and they seen Ian Collagen run to him.

293
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,660
So I changed my mind. I've
done it millions of times,

294
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,600
just brought the ball back to my chest.

295
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:45,601
But on this occasion I miss my chest and
went all my Shorelan and right in front

296
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:50,380
of the cop and gestures walking off
the dgs says, we dedicated this racket.

297
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,910
The Getty guys are calling. It just
made this record. Keller sentence

298
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,520
[inaudible] too. Okay. Yes. The return

299
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,990
[inaudible] stony in the shop and
Robertson spelter it for goodness sake.

300
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Preciado shopper and Carlson.

301
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,070
That's the second half of that to start.
And that's, um, the best pandas keeper.

302
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,580
Walking back to his goal alone, alone,

303
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:40,220
and four girls down. Do you know what

304
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,210
I wish you could say to you that
I didn't know how that felt.

305
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,450
I know how that feels. I remember
now why I stopped being a goalkeeper.

306
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,963
Okay.

307
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,863
[inaudible]

308
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,340
killed

309
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,310
his hands from the Elvis Presley.
Do you think he was a goalie?

310
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,160
He had to have been a goalie. No one
could have captured the tenderness,

311
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:19,030
the loss and the shame as well
as Al Shaman his music. Yeah.

312
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,270
He could have been forged between
those two goalposts. Oh wait.

313
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,510
I am now being told that
was not Elvis. Okay.

314
