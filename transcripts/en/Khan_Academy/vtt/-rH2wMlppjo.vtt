00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.140
Welcome back.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.220
I almost ran out of time in that
last video, so let's just

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.410
start from the beginning for
problem number fourteen.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.660
So I drew the figure, and they
told us that this line is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.790
perpendicular to that line,
and they drew it here.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.340
And that this is perpendicular
to that, and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.420
they drew it there.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.980
They told us this was 125
degrees, this is x.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.870
And then the one piece of
information they tell us, is

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.390
that LN, this line,
is equal to LM.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.870
And I marked it here.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.950
What we said at the end of the
last video was, well if these

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.965
two sides are equal, we also
know from geometry class, that

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:29.900
the base angles are also
going to be equal.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.130
And then let's see what we can
do with that, whether we can

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310
figure out x.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.480
Well the first step we can do,
is we can say, well if this is

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.960
125 degrees, what is this
angle right here?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.960
Well they're going to have to
add up to 180, because they're

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.050
supplementary.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.230
So this is going to be,
what's 180 minus 125?

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.480
Well what's 80 minus 25?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.960
It's 55 degrees.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.450
So if that's 55, then this
is also going to be 55.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.790
And then if these are both 55,
what is this angle up here?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.790
Well they're all in a triangle,
so they have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.380
to add up to 180.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.870
So 55 plus 55 is 110, so this
one has to be 70 degrees.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.790
Or 180 minus 110.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.710
You have to add up
to 180 degrees.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.820
So this is 70 degrees
right here.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.590
And now can we figure out
what this angle is here?

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.980
This is what I call
the angle game.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.920
You just have to keep figuring
out of angles.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.190
Well if this is 70 degrees, this
angle plus this angle,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.490
they're going to be
complementary.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.420
They're going to come out to
90, because this is 90.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.320
So all we have left is
90 degrees here.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.460
So if these two have to
add up to 90 degrees,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.110
then this is 20 degrees.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.690
That says 20.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.720
I know I wrote it really
small, you

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.880
probably can't read it.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.440
We know that this whole thing is
a right angle because this

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.090
is a right angle.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330
So if this is 90, we know that
this whole thing is 90.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.870
So this is 20.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.872
And now finally, I think
we're ready for x.

00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:12.020
Because x plus 90 plus 20 has
to be equal to 180 because

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.780
it's in the same triangle.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.740
So x plus 90 plus 20
is equal to 180.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.660
x plus 110 is equal to 180.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.180
x is equal to 70 degrees.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.820
And we are done.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.070
Next problem.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.230
Problem number fifteen.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.935
A measuring cup contains 1/5
a cup of orange juice.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.800
It is then filled to the 1 cup
mark that is a mixture

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.930
containing equal amounts of
orange, grapefruit and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.680
pineapple juices.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.850
What fraction of the final
mixture is orange juice?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.230
This is interesting.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.610
You have 1/5 already orange
juice, and then the next 4/5

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.230
is going to be equal parts--
because we're going to fill to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.940
the 1 cup mark.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.090
It's going to be equal parts
orange, grapefruit-- I'll just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.875
write grape-- and pineapple.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.410
So the next 4/5 is going to be
split amongst these three, and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.040
it's equally.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.510
So how much more orange juice
are we putting in?

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.705
We took 4/5, and 1/3 of
this 4/5 is going

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:41.620
to be orange juice.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.360
So the amount of orange juice
we're putting in now is 1/3

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.960
times the 4/5.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.380
So we're putting in
4/15 orange juice.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.460
And we already had
1/5 orange juice.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.230
So 1/5 plus 4/15.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.460
That equals 3/15 plus 4/15,
which equals 7/15.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.470
That is the final mixture
of orange juice.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.840
And doesn't that make
sense intuitively?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.970
That makes sense because there's
20% orange juice, and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.050
then we're adding maybe a little
bit less than a 1/4.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.120
So we'll have a little bit less
than 1/2 in the glass.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.540
All right.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.330
Next problem.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.440
I don't know, my cousin's
answer seems a little

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.882
suspicious.

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:37.880
She had marked up this book.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.070
All right.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.320
Problem number sixteen.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:53.470
If a plus 2b is equal
to 125% of 4b.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.110
So that equals 125%.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.340
If you want to write 125%
as a decimal, which I

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.840
like to do, it's 1.25.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.970
125% of 4b, what is the
value of a over b?

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.640
So we want to figure
out a over b.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.820
Let's just solve this thing.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.730
So a plus 2b is equal to,
what's 1.25 times 4?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.820
If you have $1.25 and
you have that 4

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.030
times, it's $5.00, right?

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.356
4 times 1 and then 4 times
a quarter, that's another

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.390
dollar, so that's 5b.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.170
And then subtract 2b
from both sides.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.220
You get a is equal to 3b.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.450
Divide both sides by b,
and you get a over

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.660
b is equal to 3.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.590
And you are done the problem.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.840
Problem number seventeen.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.350
They have a number line.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.670
This number line, let me see
how much I have to draw of

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.370
this number line, to minimize
my drawing.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.970
They say 0 is here, 1 is here.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.060
How many hash marks are there?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 hash marks.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.460
Oh it says there.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.900
On the number line above, there
are 9 equal intervals

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.890
between 0 and 1.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.260
What is the value of x?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:25.750
So there's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.900
I have 9 equal intervals, and
then x is right-- I'm just

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.990
going to make sure I
draw it correctly.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.410
We have 2 marks, and
then we have x.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.530
And actually we have the
square root of x.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.590
So they're 9 equal
intervals, right?

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.260
So we could just do this is 1/9,
this is 2/9, this is 3/9,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.780
4/9, this is 8/9, this is 9/9.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.700
This is 8/9, this is 7/9, this
is 6/9, this is 5/9, because 9

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.670
equal intervals.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.550
So we know that the square root
of x is equal to 6/9.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.650
Square both sides.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.310
What's 6/9?

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.640
That's the same thing as 2/3.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.860
So you square both sides.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.450
You get x is equal to 4/9.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.550
2 squared, 3 squared.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.520
We are done.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.770
Next problem.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.240
Problem eighteen.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.200
In the xy-coordinate plane, the
distance between point B--

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.050
so B is the point 10 comma 18.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.880
The distance between the point
B and the point A-- A is

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.080
point x comma 3.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.800
So the distance is 17 between
these points.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.840
What is one possible
value of x?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.220
So this is the distance formula,
and the distance

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.900
formula is really just the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.390
What we do is we say, well the
distance squared is equal to

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:09.800
the change in x squared, plus
the change in y squared.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.080
And this is really just the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.230
If you haven't learned that yet,
actually I don't think

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.040
I've done a distance formula
video, that's on my to-do

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.960
list. But I'll do that.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.210
It's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.560
The distance squared, so 17
squared, is equal to-- what's

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.070
the change in x?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:35.640
So let's just call that 10 minus
x squared plus-- and

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.530
then we know that change
in y-- so 18 minus 3.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.330
So it's 15 squared.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.410
I know 15 squared is 225.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:09:02.590
This is going to be equal
to x squared minus 20x.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:08.480
It could be plus 100.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.530
What's 17 squared?

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.460
17 times 17?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.120
7 times 7 is 49.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.900
1 times 7 is 7, plus 4 is 11.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.000
0 plus 17.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.580
It is 289.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.190
And so then we can subtract
289 from both sides.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.340
So you get 0 is equal to x
squared minus 20x plus-- add

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.790
these two together--
325 minus 289.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.280
I only have 10 seconds
left, so I'll do

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.110
it in the next video.
