00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.140
If you would have been driving
through the hills of Tennessee

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.310
about 40 miles south of
Nashville on I-65 in the 1990s,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.380
you would have come across
a very curious exit called

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.750
the Saturn Parkway.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.430
And if you would've taken that
exit and gone a little farther,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.150
you would've come across
something called the Donald

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.650
Ephlin Parkway.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.200
That was the entrance to
the Saturn Corporation,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.810
one of the boldest,
most innovative,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.390
new experiments in labor
management relations

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.750
and organizations of
the past 30 years.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.540
So let's take a look at
what Saturn was all about

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.630
and, unfortunately,
why it failed.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.340
Well, Saturn
started in the 1980s

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.410
when a number of innovative
labor and management leaders

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.750
said, we've got to adjust
the way in which we work.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.000
General Motors came
to Donald Ephlin, who

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.330
was the vice president of the
auto workers union, and said,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.510
we can't build a small
car in the United States

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.340
competitively.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.680
We've got to
outsource that work.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.590
Don, in his innovative way,
said, well, wait a minute.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.940
Why don't we take a
look if we couldn't

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.770
take a clean sheet of paper,
give it to some folks,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.810
and see if they can come up
with a new way to do this.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.050
In short, they
created what became

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.740
known as the Committee of 99: 99
people, engineers, accountants,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010
front line workers,
union representatives,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.350
working together.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.460
The goal was to go
out and find out

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
what we could do differently to
build a small car competitively

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.920
in the United States.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.230
They came together, looking for
who is doing the cutting edge,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.230
both from a
technology standpoint

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.570
and from a people standpoint.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.950
They visited Volvo, BMW.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.200
They went to Ford.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.880
They went to Lockheed.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.400
I think they visited
75 different companies

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.150
in the US and abroad.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.090
And through all of this
the overpowering thing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.570
was that there's a different
way of working with people.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.380
They created Saturn as
a new kind of company

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.250
and a new kind of car.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.410
We came up with five
proposals, and all three teams

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.870
have come to a consensus
that they kind of like

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.090
proposal number four.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.140
Saturn was built on the basis
of partnership principles

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.660
from the bottom up.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.070
They said, we'll have teams
that assemble the cars.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.660
We'll have co-management
on the front lines

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.410
at the first lines
of supervision

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.320
with a union and a
management co-leader.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.480
We will do that up through
the manufacturing operations:

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.940
even product development
and strategy decisions

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.760
will be made in a
co-management way.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.770
Well, Saturn had
a lot of critics.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.850
But some of those
critics were silenced

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.280
in the first couple of years.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.030
In fact, only about
two or three years

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.270
after it rolled the first
car off its assembly lines,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.970
Saturn rose to the top of the
customer satisfaction ratings.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.670
It was as satisfying
to customers,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.420
in terms of sales experience
and initial product quality,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.470
as any other car built
in the United States.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.210
You might go as
far as to say that,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.520
down to the levels
of turning the nuts

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.190
and bolts on the car,
that there was passion

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.760
in people for their jobs.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.800
Saturn enjoyed in the '90s a
level of quality performance,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.410
a level of brand loyalty, that
the rest of General Motors

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.220
had not achieved.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.440
But what happened?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.120
The traditionalists
within General Motors

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.270
and within the auto workers
union really didn't like it.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.340
Don Ephlin had
retired from the UAW,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.340
and Steve Yokich
became vice president.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.180
And he was not
philosophically aligned

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.770
with any of these
partnership, joint management

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.040
ideas whatsoever.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.510
You didn't have a lot of deep
support both within the UAW

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.840
or among General Motors
in Detroit for Saturn.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.400
And so Saturn's sales and
productivity began to decline.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.590
Morale of the
workforce declined.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.080
They felt that they weren't
invested in this company

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.280
psychologically.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.880
They weren't going to invest
new products in the company.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.300
I think it's fair to say that
the product was outdated.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.820
The way to kill
any car company is

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.980
to delay the introduction
of a new product

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.706
because the competition
is innovating.

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:25.580
The competition is
bringing out new products.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.020
And without a new
product, Saturn

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.810
was going to lose market share
and began to lose market share.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.970
And basic math rule: If you
have an organization that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.640
maintains employment security
while sales are falling,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.629
your overall costs increase.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.670
You can't do it anything
unless you've got money.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.800
And we were being strangled
by a corporation that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.340
didn't know how to handle us.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.580
We were the outlaws,
if you will.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.580
To make a long story
short, Saturn limped along.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.350
It built a new
vehicle at one point

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.100
called the Saturn
SUV, called the Vue,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.660
which was very successful.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.570
But Saturn could not survive.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.750
And in 2008, General
Motors closed down

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.090
Saturn as part of its
restructuring activities.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.810
So what lessons should we learn?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.430
I think there are
three lessons that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.220
should influence how
we think about bringing

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.650
about innovations and new
ways of working going forward.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.390
First, I want us all to
remember that Committee of 99.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.460
They were an early
form of crowdsourcing.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.650
They said, no
individual could come up

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.930
with this innovative
design, but if we all

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.200
put our heads together,
and we go around the world

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.510
and look at best practices,
we can create something new,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.250
something that no one else could
have imagined in ways that we

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.230
can work together.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.490
And it was successful.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.370
So remember crowdsourcing
as an option.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.790
But expect resistance.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.090
Remember those
traditionalists who said,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.410
this isn't the way we
do things around here.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.690
And once the original
champions left,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.670
the traditionalists took over.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.280
And they slowly, slowly
starved Saturn for resources.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.430
And the end was inevitable.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.430
And then finally, if you're
going to try new ideas,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.820
and you're going to create
new ways of working together

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.500
and new organizations,
build in a strategy

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.270
for sustaining that innovation
right from the beginning

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.060
so that it will have legs
that goes on into the future.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.130
There'll be opportunities to
invent new ways of working.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.160
Again, as you go forward,
remember these three lessons

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.340
from the Saturn Corporation.
