00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.435
Do you enjoy awkward
conversations

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.537
with members of an entrenched
political dynasty,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.838
but you're also very hungry?

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.840
Well, great news.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.709
Now you can enter
to win a dinner

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.344
with distinguished lady Magneto
Hillary Clinton.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.514
-(laughter) -It'll just be like
eating a meal with your mom

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.649
if 54% of America
hated your mom.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.317
-(laughter)
-All you got to do...

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.753
-Well...
-Stop.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:24.991
(applause and cheering)

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.626
(as Clinton):
"What do I want?

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.294
What's your favorite thing?"

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:32.331
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.100
All you need to do is give her
your e-mail address,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.401
so, if you don't want
a free meal,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.070
you'll still get served
some spam.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.939
Comedians, what will they serve
at dinner with Hillary Clinton?

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.541
Bonnie.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.143
-Uh, pants soup.
-HARDWICK: Yes. Perfect.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.378
-(laughter)
-Jim Florentine.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.612
-Bull (bleep) on a stick.
-(laughter)

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.178
HARDWICK:
All right. All right, points.
