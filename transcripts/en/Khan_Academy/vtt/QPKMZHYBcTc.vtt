00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome back.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.020
I don't like to rush too
much on these videos.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.060
I just wanted to continue
the next one.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.170
So what we did, I just wrote out
everything they tell us in

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.040
the problem.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.780
We figured out x is equal to
y, so they must both be

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.520
45-degree angles.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.910
And since y is opposite of this
angle, it must be 45.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.690
And since this angle, this
angle, and this angle are the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.450
same triangle and this one's
45 and this one's 90, this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.410
must also equal 45.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.070
And what I said is we need to
figure out this green line.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.280
And I made the claim, and I
think you'll believe me, that

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.930
this green line is the
same length of the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.410
line that I just drew.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.400
This peach line, right?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.610
And also, what else do we know
about this larger triangle?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.505
Well, its hypotenuse is here.

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:45.480
Its hypotenuse is this magenta
line right there.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.920
And let me redraw it here.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.390
So its hypotenuse is
this magenta line.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.120
What's the length of
the magenta line?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.550
It's 4 plus 8.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.480
They gave us that information.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.510
So it's 12.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.360
And we want to figure
out this peach line.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.720
I'm just re-drawing it so that
you know that we're clear of

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.360
all of the mess, right?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.400
I'm saying this green line is
the same as this peach line,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.620
and I just re-drew this
peach line here.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.010
What do we also know about
this triangle?

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.870
Well, if this angle up here is
45, what's this angle here?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.410
That's also going
to be 45, right?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.590
Because these two lines are
perpendicular, so this is 45.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.870
And we also know that this angle
x is this angle here, so

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.850
that's also 45.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.020
Or you can figure it
out any other way.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.440
So there we go.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.770
We have a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.710
We know its hypotenuse.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.650
Can we figure out the sides?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.500
Well we know the sides are
going to be equal, right?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.860
Because the base angles
are equal.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.175
We also know that in
a 45-45-90 triangle

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:44.610
the sides are equal.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270
In fact, you can even look at
the beginning of the book,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.130
they even define a 45-45-90
triangle.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.540
But we'll work it out just so
you see it worked out without

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.690
having to memorize.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.310
So x squared-- this is just
Pythagorean theorem-- plus x

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.380
squared is equal to
the hypotenuse

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.500
squared is equal to 144.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.290
2x squared is equal to 144.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.410
x squared is equal to 72.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.140
x is equal to the square
root of 72.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530
So what's the square
root of 72?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.780
The square root of 72 is the
square root of 36 times 2,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.440
which is the same thing as the
square root of 36 times the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.320
square root of 2.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.090
And what does that
turn out to be?

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.050
Well, the square root
of 36 is 6, right?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.290
So our answer is 6 square
roots of 2.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.900
So that is choice b.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.150
Next problem.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.660
Problem 8.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.410
The price of ground
coffee bean is d

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.980
dollars for 8 ounces.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.710
So d dollars for 8 ounces.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.810
And each ounce makes c cups
of brewed coffee.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.130
So one ounce makes c cups
of brewed coffee.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:30.920
In terms of c and d, what is the
dollar cost of the ground

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.190
coffee beans required
to make one cup?

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.320
We just want to make one
cup and we say how much

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.950
does that cost us?

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.110
OK.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.470
So let's see how many cups we
can make with d dollars, OK?

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.790
So d dollars, we would
get 8 ounces.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.190
So d dollars, we get 8 ounces.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.320
And then each ounce, you
get c cups, right?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.540
One ounce turns into c cups,
so 8 ounces will

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.020
turn into 8c cups.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.550
But we only want
one cup, right?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:16.279
So we're saying d dollars
is equal to 8c cups.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.060
But we only want one cup, so
let's divide both sides of

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.310
this by 8c.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.870
So what are we left with?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.890
We're left with d over 8c
dollars is equal to one cup.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.010
And that is choice a.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.270
Not too bad, huh?

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.520
Next problem.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.655
Problem number 9.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.250
If 10/a is equal to b/12,
what is the value of ab?

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.220
So this is just straight
cross-multiplication.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.160
a times b is equal to 10 times
12, so ab is equal to 10 times

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.290
12, which equals 120.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.120
We are done.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.670
120 is our answer.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.440
If you haven't learned to
cross-multiply, it's just a

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.880
quick way-- when you see two
fractions equal each other,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.520
you can take the numerator of
the left times the denominator

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.570
of the right.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.710
And that equals the denominator
of the left times

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.880
the numerator of the right.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.820
And how do we know that?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.110
Well, we could do
it step by step.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.680
You can multiply both
sides times a.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.350
That cancels out and you're
left with 10 is

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.060
equal to ab over 12.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.950
And then you multiply both sides
times 12, you get 120 is

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.630
equal to ab.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.350
That just skips one
step right there.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.600
Next problem.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.180
Problem 10.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.360
They give us a little
sequence here.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.990
150, 30, 6, and then
it keeps going.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.730
In the sequence above, each term
after the first term is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.780
1/5 of the preceding term.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.310
What is the fifth term
of the sequence?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.550
So 1/5 of the preceding term.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.260
So the next term is going
to be 1/5 of this.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So that's what, that's
6/5, right?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.040
I just multiplied
1/5 times that.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.100
So the next term is going to be
1/5 times this, so that's

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.900
6/25, right?

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.400
1/5 times 6/5 is
equal to 6/25.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.080
So that is the fifth term.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.220
And you could write it as a
fraction or you could write it

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.020
as a decimal, I think
you'd get 0.24 if

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.370
you do it as a decimal.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.660
Next problem.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.600
I'm suspicious, that
seemed too easy.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.930
Problem 11.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.520
Five points-- a, b, c, d, and
e-- lie on a line, not

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.540
necessarily in that order.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.170
ab has length 24.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.120
Point c is the midpoint of ab.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.590
So let's draw this and
let's see if we can

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.590
avoid messing up.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.450
OK.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.810
So let me draw a and b.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:22.770
So a, b.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.876
This is how I'd do it if
I was taking it, taking

00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:27.230
the test. ab is 24.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.380
Point c is the midpoint of ab.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.620
So point c is right here.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.810
And it's the midpoint.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.140
So this is 12, and this is 12.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.040
So far so good?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.650
And point d is the
midpoint of ac.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.540
So this distance is 6, and this
distance is 6, right?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.330
It's getting smaller.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.910
I should have drawn this bigger,
but I think you get

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.710
what I'm saying.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.380
This is point d here
in yellow.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:02.530
If the distance between d and
e-- so this is d-- and the

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.950
distance between d and e is 5,
what is one possible distance

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.000
between a and e?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.895
So they're essentially saying
where could e be?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.520
So let me blow things
up a little bit.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.160
Let me redraw this.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.180
And let me focus on a and c
because that's the part that

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.980
got all scrunched up.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:38.840
So if this is a, this is c, and
they tell us that d is the

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.090
midpoint of these two.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.970
And we figured out that a to c
was 12 and a to d is 6, right?

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.040
This distance is 6, which is
the same as this distance,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.870
that's also 6.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.270
And then they tell us at the
end, if the distance between d

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.930
and e is 5, what is one
possible distance

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.240
between a and e?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.920
So we know that e is on
this line as well.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.880
So there's two places
where e could be.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.950
e could be 5 in this direction,
it could be here.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:15.650
e could be there or e could be 5
in this direction where this

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.540
is 5 and this is 5.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.390
So if e is here, what is the
distance from a to e?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.810
Well, this distance from
a to e is just

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.240
going to be 1, right?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.160
You go one to e and then 5 to
d, and that adds up to 6.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.260
So one possible distance
for ae is 1.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.880
The other one is you go 6 to
d and then you go 5 to e.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.510
So the other possibility
is 11.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.680
And so, oh, this isn't
multiple choice.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.070
You could fill out either
one of those choices.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.830
See you in the next video.
