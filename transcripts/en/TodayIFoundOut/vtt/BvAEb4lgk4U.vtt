00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.230
Sniffer dogs are a key tool in the arsenal
of law enforcement to do their jobs- trained

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.910
to sniff out everything from drugs to fruit
and boasting a reasonably good success rate

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.780
(with one caveat that we’ll get too shortly).

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.390
As it turns out, though, how these crime-fighting
pooches are typically trained is a very simple

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.590
process anyone can do with a bit of persistence
and patience.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.059
Obviously the first thing you need to train
a sniffer dog is, well, a dog.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.640
While any dog can be trained to sniff for
drugs or illegal material, some have a better

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.420
sense of smell than others.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.829
Popular breeds used by law enforcement include
members of the retriever family, German shepherds

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.830
and beagles, all of whom have an impressive
sense of smell even by dog standards thanks

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.630
to generations of selective breeding.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.729
Once a suitable dog is selected, training
it to sniff out the desired substance is a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.330
simple matter of getting the dog to associate
a favourite toy with its smell.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.080
One popular toy chosen by sniffer dog trainers
is a small white towel, which is easily recognised

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.659
by the dog, can be cleaned to ensure the towel’s
scent is minimized, and in the general case

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.160
dogs love a good game of tug of war with said
towels.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.590
After the dog learns to associate the toy
with getting to have fun, the trainers begin

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.780
to introduce the smell of the desired illicit
substance they’d like the dog to eventually

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.400
seek out, be it drugs, chemicals used to make
bombs, money, or really whatever.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.200
In fact, there are even so-called “porn
sniffing” dogs that are in reality trained

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.570
to sniff out hidden memory cards, hard drives,
and other such devices.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.200
These dogs are used when investigating hackers
or those suspected of being in possession

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.789
of underage pornography or the like.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.510
One such dog, named Bear, was used to help
convict Subway’s former spokesman Jared

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.759
Fogle, when the dog found just such a hidden
flash drive at Fogle’s residence that human

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.759
searchers had missed.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.980
In a nutshell, if the item has a scent, the
dogs can be trained to sniff it out.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.380
As you might have gathered from this, over
time, the dog will learn to seek out whatever

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.150
smell, not for the smell’s sake (as has
been often erroneously suggested by those

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.489
insinuating the dogs are addicted to the drugs),
but rather because they associate finding

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.220
the source of the smell with their favorite
toy and play time.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.340
And if you’re wondering here, yes, the drug
sniffing dogs are technically trained via

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.609
using actual drugs, though the amount needed
here for the dogs to pick up the scent is

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.209
incredibly low thanks to their exceptional
sense of smell.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.799
This ensures no risk to the dog themselves,
at least in training.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.060
The same cannot always be said to be the case
when the dog is on duty.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.241
While rare owing to the fact that the dogs
are being used to find hidden drugs (thus

00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:50.900
likely barriers between the drug and the dog),
it does sometimes happen where the dog may

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.680
be exposed to something so toxic that even
trace amounts pose a risk to them, such as

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.900
relatively recently happened in Broward County,
Florida where sniffer dogs were exposed to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.680
the extremely potent opioid fentanyl.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.090
To get around this problem, the dog’s handler
will keep a vigilant watch and particularly

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
not deploy sniffing dogs at all if there are
any loose drugs present.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.389
For the unseen drugs that nonetheless may
be particularly potent, the handler also might

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.549
carry things like naloxone with them, which
rapidly reverses/blocks the effects of opioids,

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.549
just in case.

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.390
Back to training- once the dog has learned
to successfully seek out the smell when commanded,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.699
the trainer then moves on to only giving the
play reward when the dog does the appropriate

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.419
action when it finds the source.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.549
For example, some drug sniffer dogs are trained
to paw at the spot where the illegal substance

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.650
is located, but this, obviously, isn’t ideal
if the dog is searching for something like

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.760
a bomb.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.699
As a result, sniffer dogs are trained to have
“passive” and “aggressive” responses

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.290
based on the situation.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850
The passive response can, again, be whatever
you like, though most sniffer dogs are trained

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.449
to simply sit down and/or point with their
nose and freeze in these cases.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.829
As one security company who trains sniffer
dogs summarizes:

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.630
During the early stages of training, the sniffer
dog will receive a reward when it displays

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.080
any form of recognition of the target scent.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.290
As the dog’s skills progress, the reward
will only be given when the dog responds with

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.769
the correct reaction (e.g. sit, stand, stare,
down, bark, etc…).

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.259
With these quite simple training methods,
the resulting sniffer dogs are very accurate

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.570
in finding concealed illegal items and generally
are trained well enough to be immune from

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.320
being fooled by strategic placement of treats
or other masking scents like meats.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.080
This all said, in real world use, there does
seem to be a major issue given dogs have also

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.610
long been bred to please their masters and
are exceptionally good at picking up body

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.590
language from said masters.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.090
This is essentially another example of the
Clever Hans Effect.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.669
If you’re unfamiliar, this was a phenomenon
famously observed in a horse named Hans who

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.090
genuinely seemed to be able to do math, including
fractions, multiplication, and even square

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.650
roots, as well as eventually learned to spell
out names, among other remarkable skills.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.849
In the beginning this was widely assumed to
be a hoax, but after an independent commission

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.780
confirmed the horse really could do these
things, it seemed as if mankind had been massively

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.069
underestimating the intelligence of horses.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.500
That is, until psychologist Oskar Pfungst
ran a series of experiments that uncovered

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.430
the fact that if the horse couldn’t see
the questioner or if the questioner didn’t

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.680
know the answer, the horse universally got
the answer wrong.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.530
When the horse could see the questioner and
the questioner knew the answer, however, the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.690
horse had remarkable accuracy in the 80%-90%
range in many tests.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.229
Thus, what was actually happening was the
horse was simply reading very subtle body

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.810
language of the person conducting the experiments
(none of whom were aware they were exhibiting

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.080
any such cues) and so was able to pick the
correct answer to whatever question based

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
on this.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080
(You can read more on this here: The Horse
That Could Do Math)

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.949
As you might imagine, sniffer dogs suffer
from this same phenomenon.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.500
In support of this notion is a double-blind
2011 study published in the journal Animal

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.139
Cognition in which the dogs were tested in
a scenario where there were no drugs, but

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.170
the dog handlers and those observing the handlers
were told there were drugs.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.300
To further attempt to trick the dogs themselves,
certain food/play items were also placed about

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.300
to entice them.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
The results?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.979
The dogs performed well with regards to ignoring
the treats, but were nonetheless uncharacteristically

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.759
wildly inaccurate anyway, particularly around
areas where the humans were led to believe

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.090
drugs were located.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.780
As there were no drugs, the result was simply
a whopping 225 false positives by the dogs

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.249
and the 18 handlers.

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:25.879
In fact, in only 15% of the total 144 runs
did a dog and its handler successfully go

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.389
through the course without indicating they’d
found drugs.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.080
Given the number of studies showing both that
drug sniffing dogs are very difficult to fool

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.340
in controlled tests and other studies like
this one showing they nonetheless become quite

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.080
inaccurate when the handlers are fooled, it’s
generally thought it’s really the humans

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.479
that are the problem here, not the dogs.

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.650
On this note, there have been lawsuits in
the United States alleging that some handlers

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.710
are actually training the dogs to respond
to intentional subtle cues they give so that

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.219
the police can then conduct an otherwise illegal
search any time they please.

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:00.569
In support of this notion, despite in testing
the dogs being extremely accurate, one report

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.200
from the Chicago Tribune noted that over a
three year period the dogs used during traffic

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.099
stops in the suburbs around Chicago reported
false positives a whopping 56% of the time.

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.780
More disturbingly, that false positive rate
rose to 73% when the police had pulled over

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.370
someone of Hispanic descent.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.569
(Although it should also be noted that despite
a three year span, the sample-set the Tribune

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.990
was working with of actual traffic stops where
sniffer dogs were deployed was quite small

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.719
and the data they used was also incomplete.)

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.910
That said, during the previously mentioned
study published in Animal Cognition, the experimenter

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.529
“was informed that three handlers admitted
to overtly cuing their dogs to alert” where

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:41.879
the handler thought there was drugs, implying
that this is something at least some handlers

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:45.500
have trained their dogs to do when the handler
thinks drugs are present.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.490
Nevertheless, while some handlers seem to
be doing this, it’s generally thought that

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.740
in many such false positive cases what’s
actually happening is either trace amounts

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.990
of drugs from past drug presence (potentially
even from years previous) or, perhaps even

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.892
more likely, simply another instance of the
aforementioned Clever Hans Effect, in that

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:02.892
the handlers are unintentionally signaling
the dogs that they think there may be drugs

00:08:02.892 --> 00:08:03.892
or the like in, say, a vehicle.

00:08:03.892 --> 00:08:04.892
The dogs then pick up on this, and so even
though the dogs may not yet be smelling drugs,

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:05.892
they react as if they do, resulting in a disproportionate
number of false positives in these cases,

00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:06.892
and potentially a bit of racial profiling
thanks to the humans’ biases, rather than

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:07.892
the dogs not being good at their job.

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:08.892
It should be noted here that it wouldn’t
be that difficult to train the dogs to ignore

00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:09.892
handler body language when searching.

00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:12.199
The dogs can also be mostly trained to ignore
ultra-low thresholds of detection from drugs

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.199
present in the distant past.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.120
Despite this, to date, this doesn’t appear
to be something implemented in any sniffer

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.240
dog training program we could find.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.689
But in the end, the important thing to note
in all of this is that sniffer dogs generally

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.379
see their work as a game and usually work
hand in hand with their best friend, sometimes

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.430
for years with the same handler.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.100
And regardless of how accurate they are in
any given scenario, each and every one of

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:46.610
them is a very, very good dog.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:09:22.770
ognoscente of 
the profiling problem and potential for

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:38.830
rights

00:09:38.830 --> 00:10:19.850
infringing searches where no such search is
warranted by what the dogs are actually smelling,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:30.620
a 
new tack has been investigated by some agencies

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.250
in the form of switching to using mice.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.770
While less fun to have around than man’s
best friend, mice have the potential to be

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.910
more accurate than drug or bomb sniffing dogs
for sniffing things out.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.590
Another advantage of the mice, according to
one security company that trains mice for

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:49.100
such, is that they don’t need to continually
be motivated when not finding anything.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.570
In contrast, sniffing dogs must be periodically
sent on dummy missions so they don’t become

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.880
bored with the game.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.650
For example, in airports, sniffer dog handlers
sometimes have to ask employees to carry dummy

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.580
packages loaded with drugs or some other illegal
substance through security so that the dog

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.100
can “find” them and be rewarded.The dogs
must also periodically re-trained to keep

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100
their skills sharp.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.150
Mice, on the other hand, are good for about
four hour shifts at a time with a useful lifespan

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.180
of about 18 months, all supposedly without
need to re-train or re-motivate.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.300
Further, the mice are significantly cheaper
and easier to maintain.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.670
They also can be trained much faster and cheaper
than dogs, and in extremely high numbers for

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.890
mass and quick deployment.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.970
As an example of how the mice might be deployed,
the aforementioned security company notes

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.490
small containers with the hidden mice can
be strategically placed at airports in locations

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.890
where passengers walk by or are made to pause
for a moment.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.570
When the hidden mice (possibly large groups
of them) smell whatever they’ve been trained

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.490
to alert for, they press a button alerting
the authorities, all in a much less visible

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:51.380
fashion than dogs, and not prone to reacting
to handler bias or, in this case, even have

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.380
a handler visible to the mice at all.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.500
You may have heard a story about sniffer dogs
in the UK getting into trouble for finding

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.450
sausages instead of contraband, which while
true, isn’t the whole story.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.910
You see, the dogs in question were specifically
trained to search for meat that could pose

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.100
a health hazard or was sourced illegally.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:28.740
The dogs, to their credit, did find a lot
of meat, it’s just that it was mostly sausages.
