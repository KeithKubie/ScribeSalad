MARTIN OMANDER:
Today, I'm joined

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.029
by Waleed Abdulla,
founder of Ninua.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.710
Good to see you here, Waleed.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.200
WALEED ABDULLA:
Thank you, Martin.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.600
MARTIN OMANDER: So you were
here for the last episode.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.540
For viewers who didn't
watch the last episode,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.460
would you give a
brief description

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.546
of what Ninua,
your startup, does?

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:20.420
WALEED ABDULLA: Sure.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.100
So we have two products--
Symphony at symphonytools.com,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.710
which is a social media
dashboard for businesses

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.610
to publish to a lot of social
networks at the same time

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.920
and to listen to what their
customers are saying about them

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.330
on the social networks.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.830
And the second is
NetworkedBlogs,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.030
which is a platform for
bloggers to promote their blog

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.170
and network with other bloggers.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.060
We have about 1.2
million bloggers on it.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.000
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.600
So on the last
episode, we talked

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.690
about how you changed
business models,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.620
and this changing
of business model

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.960
meant that you needed to go
after a different customer

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.747
segment and have a
slightly different product.

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:01.580
WALEED ABDULLA: Mhm.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.840
MARTIN OMANDER: Now, this is
a situation a lot of startups

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.140
face all the time-- that
we need new features to go

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.190
after a new customer segment.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.290
How did you validate
that you were building

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.110
the right features that these
customers needed and liked?

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.800
WALEED ABDULLA: So
basically, we had

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.900
a few insights from
our existing product,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.910
things that we noticed as we
interacted with our users.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.520
And then we took
that, and then we

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.800
want to decided what to do next.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.970
We kind of knew we had to
do something different.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.470
And we had an idea
what that might be,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.282
but there was a lot
of details and a lot

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.060
of possible directions to take.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.700
So we took about
a month to create

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.390
about 25 different
business plans.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.150
For each one, we would
say, what if we do this,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.670
and we go after this market?

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.230
How will that play out?

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.470
What are the options for
finding customers, monetizing

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.190
the product?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.230
What are the options for
getting funding, and so on.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.340
We created 25 of those, and
then we selected the best.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.949
So that was the first step.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.280
And then after that, we
started building a product.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.390
And once we had a
version that was,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.965
let's say, an alpha
version, barely works,

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.590
we started showing
it to people, and we

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.500
started collecting
feedback that way.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.300
We showed it to lot of people--
from friends to random people

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.910
to other potential customers.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.830
We collected a lot
of feedback and kind

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.494
of modified the
vision accordingly.

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:38.827
MARTIN OMANDER: And you had
a pretty structured approach

00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:40.974
of how you did
this user testing.

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:42.640
Could you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.760
WALEED ABDULLA: Right, so
once we started showing it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.545
to people, the first step
was, show it to your friends.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.920
So we have a lot of friends,
and we just kind of bug them

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.580
and say, hey, can you take
a look at this product

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.874
and tell us what you think?

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.040
So that was the first phase.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.630
And we collected a lot of
data and we modified it.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.000
Once we felt comfortable
with the overall feature set,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.880
we went to the next step, which
was to show it to real users.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.990
So we had recruited users
to take a look at it.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.120
And we'll do a screen-sharing
session with them

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.800
for about an hour.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.780
We send them the link.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.820
They take a look at the product,
and they start using it.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.570
And we'll just sit
there and watch

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.640
what they do and take notes.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.710
MARTIN OMANDER: So you're
watching what they do.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.730
Did you have them
come into your office,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.930
or did you do it remotely?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.346
How did these sessions work?

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.220
WALEED ABDULLA: When we
started with friends,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.930
we'll just sit next to them.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.940
But when we started doing
it with other users,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.310
we will do a Skype
screen-sharing session.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.970
So they will share their
screen, and then we

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.810
send them the link
right before the call

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.490
so they don't look at
it before the call.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.530
And we send it to
them, and we just

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.190
ask them to behave as
if we're not there,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.050
and explore the product
and speak their mind.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.610
So they would say,
I'm confused now.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.610
I don't know what to do.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.480
Should I click here?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.354
Should I click there?

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:10.612
And we just listen, and we
don't give them any hints.

00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:12.820
We just kind of take notes
that the user was confused

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.903
at this point, the user
was excited at this point,

00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:15.824
and so on.

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:16.740
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.180
And so now, you're getting
all these great feedback.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.770
How do you integrate that
with your project development?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.660
WALEED ABDULLA: Yeah, so
we did this for 60 days.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.910
We would have one
call every day.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.300
And we'll take
notes, and then we'll

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.480
modify the application
that same day.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.730
MARTIN OMANDER: That same day?

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.220
WALEED ABDULLA: That same day.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.220
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, wow.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.970
WALEED ABDULLA: And then we'll
have a different user next day

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.910
to take a look.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.760
And then we know
whether our changes

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.170
worked, or is the user still
confused about this feature,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.690
and so on.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.670
So we kept doing that
for two full months

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.245
until we felt very
comfortable and we

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:54.344
started getting really
good feedback from users.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.010
MARTIN OMANDER: So
you had lots and lots

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.760
of little very, very tight
feedback cycles it sounds like.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.395
WALEED ABDULLA: Yes,
so at that point,

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:06.660
we were trying to validate that
the product is well-designed,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.240
it's easy to understand,
and that people

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.690
cared about the features.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.900
So we would have
sometimes just fake menus,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.360
and we'll see if someone
would even click on them.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.800
And that will tell
us if someone's

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.020
interested in that thing.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.310
And we will have different
names for the actions,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.680
different names for the
menus, different colors.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.190
And basically, we're testing how
easy and intuitive the app is,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.130
and whether people
can just use it

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.830
without someone helping them.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.050
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.690
You must have made a lot of
changes over those two months.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.986
WALEED ABDULLA: Yes, yes.

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:41.910
It saved us a lot
of time in features

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.665
that we learned that
they were not important.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.040
We had a lot of
features, like we

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.325
thought maybe analytics
will be important.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:50.450
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, really?

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.180
Great.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.405
One would think that, yeah?

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:53.280
WALEED ABDULLA: Yeah.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.910
And we realized that,
OK, very few of our users

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.720
actually cared.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.530
So we decided, OK, let's
not build that right away.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.847
And then that helped us
launch the product sooner.

00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:04.930
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.805
What were some of the
other things you liked,

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:08.919
on the other side--
things that people

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.210
liked that you hadn't expected?

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.970
WALEED ABDULLA: We
had an option to share

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.430
your articles to
social networks.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.380
And we have two different
ways of doing it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.020
So one of them, we
called it crosspost

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.820
and the other one was share.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.690
And there was a little
bit of excitement

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.180
when people see the
word "crosspost."

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.640
And they would say, oh,
I know what that does.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.290
And they immediately
assumed it takes your post

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.290
and crossposts it
all over the place.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.850
And so we though, OK, that
kind of was interesting.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.640
And we started getting the
same feedback every day.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.040
So we start making that feature
more and more prominent,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.620
and we started improving it.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.680
And then now, it's actually one
of the most important features

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.080
in the product, which is
something we discovered

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.940
through these tests that we
wouldn't have known otherwise.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.765
MARTIN OMANDER: Otherwise, it
wouldn't have happened, right.

00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:02.090
WALEED ABDULLA: Probably.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.150
MARTIN OMANDER: And it sounds
like it's a feature that you

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.190
might have built, but
through user testing,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.870
you discovered
that was important,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.040
and how to position
it and name it.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.480
WALEED ABDULLA:
Exactly, exactly.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.220
And that's very
important, especially

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.970
when you're getting the
user seeing your product

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.820
the first time, the
first impression.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.560
You want the application
to be easy to understand,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.460
and you want to
make it intuitive so

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.750
that they don't get
frustrated and having

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.814
to ask you a lot of
questions about it.

00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:30.730
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.720
Well, thank you very much
for sharing your experiences

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.580
with us, Waleed.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.850
WALEED ABDULLA:

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:37.806
useful for your startup here.

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:39.180
