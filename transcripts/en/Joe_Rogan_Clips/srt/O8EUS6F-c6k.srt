1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,160
In the very,
very bad shootouts man,

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:05,730
the Kelvin gassed alum style
bend to fight was a shootout.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,400
Best style of fight from me I've ever,
ever.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,310
It's one of the best fights of
all time has to be. It has to be.

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:15,480
And when you see style than to get
rocked in the first row dropped.

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:20,220
You like Ho Lee Shit. I think he's
the best thing that happened to them.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a good thing. I think it's a good
thing for career wise and going forward.

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,830
It's a good thing you
face a little adversity.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,090
We see that he's not going to get
hit and crumble and you got one.

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,200
You got a special dude in style bender
and how good is Calvin? God Damn,

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,650
he's Tom Faster.
He's so fucking tough.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,330
And even after all that,

13
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:44,130
I mean style bender was teeing off on
him in that fifth round and Calvin is

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,630
finding a way to survive. I'm going
to say great chin, incredible style.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,130
Benders face looked like he
was allergic to shellfish

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,533
face.

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,730
How put fourth round he was
happening then the band,

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,030
he was in a war Kelvin hidden with some
bombs. Man Bombs. Yeah, and it's also,

19
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,310
I think it's good. We saw, we saw a,

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,370
you get hit and getting knocked
down or saw him get taken down.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,590
We saw what happens when he's off
his back. Look pretty fucking do it.

22
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:14,760
He's triangle.
He's in triangle locked up.

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,070
Who knows what the fuck would have
happened if that was early in the fight,

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,600
they were dry. So I think that that fight
for stopped and checked all the boxes,

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,400
but also what's great about this is
Kelvin stock doesn't go down. No.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,320
If anything, I'd watch that guy fight
whenever, whenever, and let's be honest,

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,730
he's really a welterweight.
Correct. He's super small. For me,

28
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:39,610
Deron till can make 170 pounds soaking
Calvin. It's a discipline thing. Yes.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,970
I just think there should be more
weight classes. I don't even think it's,

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,620
I don't think he's a doctor.
Your boy,

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,920
Dana Man isn't one of those 65
you could text him. You don't get,

32
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,460
no one listens to me and I don't
want them to really? Yeah, I do.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,940
I'd rather just stay out here and talk
about it. Yeah. I want it to evolve.

34
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,750
The lap pushed it. I've said, I think
there should be a weight class everyday.

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,530
I gotta get Outta here. We could
dangle the carrot and be like, Yo,

36
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,650
we'll do a fight companion every time
a one 65 or fights and just dangle that

37
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:09,480
carrot. Yeah, he's surprised at one do it.
Probably still wouldn't do it. It's um,

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,690
it's one of those things where like,
I think they'd like it the way it is.

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,510
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Yeah.

40
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,160
But it doesn't make sense because if
you're going to do all these intern belts,

41
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,740
why not do 65? I think they
built on belts, on belts.

42
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,260
Do you think they would
think that it's watered down?

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,260
They have too many weight classes that
people would just be jumping back and

44
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:28,740
forth from weight class, which they would
be talking about chaos, which I love.

45
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,160
But you would also have people that
find a way class where they could be at

46
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,540
their best versus either have to bulk
up or have to drop too much weight and

47
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,780
compromise herself. But her happy
medium for a lot of guys that are not,

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,610
they're not hitting that
happy medium right now.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
We're not getting the best performance.
But here's the thing about,

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,540
so if Calvin should be one seven
year style benders are smaller.

51
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,780
The fiber he weighed in at one 83 up.
He weighed under the weight limit.

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,800
So look at how big some of these
guys are. Oh my God. Brandon Davis,

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,640
two 35 35 he was one 60 dude.
That was Brandon neighbors, right?

54
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,110
Was that,
who said that?

55
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,950
Some of those 80 fibers like you
look at jock gray cat Yoel Romero.

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,000
Joe Ramirez checking antic dude, it
looks like. We'll see what I mean,

57
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,930
it's going to happen.
Think about it.

58
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,710
You'll Ramiro stopping like
y'all remember Jack? Dude,

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,000
it's a big fight style.

60
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:20,900
Benner could probably make one 70 easier
then fucking 85 [inaudible] 80 Pfizer a

61
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,990
big weight classes.
Yeah,

62
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,460
that's why you have you seen
the talk and makes no sense.

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,020
Style bender and Jon Jones. That's
crazy. What are we doing? Who?

64
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,610
Who the fuck's picking up on?
It's just cause they're talking shit.

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,290
W what do you just the last card.
Just a,

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,070
it just says, yeah, he ballooned back up
260 pounds. Yeah, it was Brandon Davis.

67
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,930
Right from 35 it's really talented.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,290
It's crazy when I'm standing next to him
that this guy waiting at 35 cause I'm

69
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,150
looking at him, he looked all of 165
pounds. I was like this, he looks so,

70
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,060
he's five 10 he looks so big for
that one 35 pound weight class.

71
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,510
Like this is crazy.
Well Eve Max at 45 fucking huge.

72
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,180
But the UFC performance institute gave
him the green light to do that. Wow.

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,850
So they must have known what they were
doing. Says David Swipe with cost,

74
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,430
who was a first in the bandwidth division,

75
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,470
said he needed to make serious
sacrifices to get there.

76
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,550
He said he cut out drinking alcohol
on his shit and ran 20 miles per day.

77
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,710
The terroir in order to make the weight.

78
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,970
By the time he stepped into the octagon
to 36 he had ballooned back to me to see

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,550
this dude. He's really, really
like, man, he must be huge.

80
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,240
For the thing is at the,
he was also,

81
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,790
he was not just like tall. He said,
he's like, he's thick. Like you can,

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,510
it's weird how you can lose that much
weight, but why not just fight at 45?

83
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:35,170
Why Kill Yourself? Like why do
I fight at 45 he fought a beat.

84
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,150
Know his last fight. Well, yeah,
as a beat. Magomed Sharapov um,

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,920
it's a beat. Got Him in that
crazy arm bar from the back leg.

86
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,070
Leg locked in the back. Yeah. Which is so
nasty from fail back. Mount fails. Nasty.

87
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,030
There's two that night. I know. It's
crazy. That's a crazy move. Right? Crazy.

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,730
But I think when I think of one 85 years,
think of Luke Rockhold he shoot, man.

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, it's a big ass. He's huge.
But then Whitaker's not like,

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,090
I think freakish a big, I
think Luke's done with 85.
Yeah, he's at two oh five now.

91
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,020
He has a fight lined up already.
But I mean,

92
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,080
is he going to stay there as you
just doing it for one five for sure.

93
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,570
You stay in there.
