00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.150
 How to become the British monarch: 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.390
 Historically, the crown was on your head normally because you have the largest army. When 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.480
 My older ones, my elder, continued with the control of the army and therefore the crown was relocated 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 to his head, although, of course, someone with a larger army could change the political landscape 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 quite abruptly 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.540
 As time went by and the world was less violent in the end in 1701 parliament settled down 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.450
 A set of rules to transfer the crown from one head to the other - fortunately, with less 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.140
 agitation than previously. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 That's how the rules of 1701 worked: 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.770
 First: not being a Catholic. 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.520
 The British monarch is also the head of the Anglican Church, to which the monarch must 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.230
 convert if you are not a member yet. Except that if you are a Catholic, there is no crown for you. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
 The history of the royal family and how this norm was created is a story for another time, 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.780
 but it is enough to say that the dimplacia of the greater army was involved. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.130
 And, by the way, you can not skip this norm by turning yourself from Catholicism to 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.110
 something different and then to Anglicanism. In the eyes of the crown, Catholicism is transitive. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380
 Second: do not be a bastard 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.920
 Sometimes it's good to be the king, but it's never good to be an illegitimate son 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.630
 of the king - who is out of the queue for the crown literally at the time of his conception. 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 If you are related to the monarch but you are a Catholic or a bastard or both, the crown 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.110
 He has the beautiful term 'Death by nature' to refer to you and your lack of right to succession. 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.200
 Third: the spouses do not count. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.799
 While people often think of kings and queens as a couple: it's not how it works here. 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.909
 The wives of the monarch are called royal consorts. Maybe they're called "prince" or "queen," though 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.869
 As for the crown, they are not in the line of the throne, they are only 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.810
 the 23 chromosomes necessary for the creation of the royal heir. 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.900
 Fourth and Last: male progenitor. 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.090
 These are the inheritance algorithm. When the monarch dies, or abdicates, but usually 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.479
 dies, the crown goes to the older child than "death by nature". If there is 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 a big sister, bad luck for her: the child stays the crown. 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.270
 It's pretty simple, but there are cases that are not obvious: take a king with two children: if the greatest 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.520
 He dies before the king, obviously the crown goes to his youngest son (who is now the eldest). 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.710
 But what if the older son had given a grandson to the king before he died? Where is the crown going? 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.420
 then? 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.379
 Well, the crown basically makes you see that everyone (except "dead by nature) is alive: 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.620
 After the king's death the crown goes to the eldest son, who is like the king, 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.029
 but he is dead, therefore the norm goes back to work, and the crown goes 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.560
 to his * son, and NO, as it would seem obvious, to his brother. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.169
 But if this rule of 1701 says that older children get the crown, how has it been 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.529
 queens? Basically, the daughters were the last choice, and this explains why there has been 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.609
 so few 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.840
 To get the crown, the daughter had to be the only daughter of the monarch or the eldest daughter 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.939
 without brothers 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.019
 Pregnant mothers should have put their daughters a little nervous with real aspirations. 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.599
 Branches of family trees sometimes die: either by war, pestilence or anything else 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.650
 And the contingency plan of the crown if it reaches a deadlock is to raise the level, and then 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.239
 Apply the rules again to find a living boss to be over. If there is no luck, 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.859
 up again, and repeat and repeat until you find the royal heir. 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.779
 There will always be an heir. The first king of England is for over a thousand years 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:10.309
 And the mates of human reproduction confined by DNA tests reveal that 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:15.969
 Every European living is distantly related to it. Therefore the crown will find 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:16.519
 the way 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.590
 From the first king to the new millennium, the rules went well, making monarchs, 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.699
 although with a sexist result, for which nobody seemed upset until, 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.109
 In 2013 for any reason in particular, everyone decided that the rules should be updated 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.249
 *Right Now*. 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.620
 The parliament and the monarchy gathered and did some cavis: in particular 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.059
 eliminating the masculine part of the norm no. 4 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:43.279
 As of 2013, the crown sees all royal sons and daughters equally. The only one 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.730
 What matters is the order of birth. 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.510
 Before 2013, the boy between two twins in development could relax 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.999
 sure that the crown would be yours regardless of what happened on the delivery day, but on 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.289
 The 2013 egalitarian world is a race for the "door" to get the crown.
