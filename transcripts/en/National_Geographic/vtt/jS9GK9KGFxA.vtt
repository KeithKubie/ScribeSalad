00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.670
- Thank you all for
coming this evening.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.172
So, I'm gonna talk to
you a little bit about

00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:08.741
photographing darkness.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.910
When I originally got
into cave and caving,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.212
and then a couple of projects,

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.815 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then finally my
most recent assignment

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.550
earlier on this year.

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:19.652 line:0%
So caves.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.322 line:0%
Caves were our first homes.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.491 line:0%
They offered us a canvas

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.660
to create our first artwork

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.596
about 40,000 years ago.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.000
And they also offered us

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.103
a safe place during
the last ice age.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.307
Scientists believe that

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.176
if there is life on Mars,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.710
it's probably underground,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.315
sheltering away from the
harsh atmosphere outside.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.817
In essence, caves,

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.488
we basically evolved from caves.

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:58.691
But I feel like we've
lost that connection

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.559
and I wanted to bring that back.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.362 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that's why I use
social media to do this,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.465
it's a great tool
to bring this back.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.668
Now whenever I speak to
a non-caver about caves,

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.338
the reaction is always the same.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.106 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Oh, I couldn't do that
I'm claustrophobic,

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.874
"and I get, you know, in lifts,

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:18.610
"and I don't like tight spaces.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.780
"Is it not muddy, dirty, dark?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Are there any
monsters down there?"

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.587
Does this look small?

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:32.926
Can you see the four
people in the picture?

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.594
Does this look dark?

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:37.764
Or dirty?

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.701
Okay, there are some monsters

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.337
but they're not that dangerous.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.771
And they're only small.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.509
You got a crab, spider,
silkworm, blind fish.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.078
But they can be fascinating too

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.880
because they've evolved
to live in total darkness

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.783
where there's no light.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's not always plain
sailing, it can be tight.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.093
And it can also
be dirty as well.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.096
These guys are digging
out rocks and boulders

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.297
that are blocking a passage

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.865
and they're trying
to find somewhere new

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.135
where nobody's been before.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.204
It can also be dangerous.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
You imagine being
in this cave passage

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.942
where the water suddenly rises

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.278
and you're gonna be trapped.

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.781
But it can also be spectacular.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.584
Can you see the two people here?

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.319
That person there
in the distance

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.287
is about 300 foot
from the ceiling

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.724
and 300 foot above the floor.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.560
Now in my work as
a photographer,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.061
I'm trying to break
down the borders

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:45.131
between reality and perception,

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.699
what is real.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.867
And I mean real exploration

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.671
where no human being
has ever gone before.

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.207
Conservation and wildlife
photographer Brian Skerry

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.442
once told me that

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
95% of the world's
oceans are unexplored.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.381
That is a staggering statistic.

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.816
But I can't stand
here and tell you

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.584
how many caves are unexplored

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:07.586 align:start size:81% position:19%
because we haven't
found them yet.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.188
We have to actually go there

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
and see them for real
to know that they exist.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:15.395
You can't see them from
satellites in space.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.266 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's bringing images
like this back to the surface

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.634 align:start position:0%
and sharing them with thousands
and thousands of people

00:03:22.634 --> 00:03:24.904
on social media like Instagram,

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.739
that's what drives me.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.810
However, caves don't
always look like this,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.245
I have to be honest.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.812 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's only for a split
second when you set off the

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:37.783 align:start size:97% position:3%
flashes and the lights that
you see them like this.

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.253 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most of the time,
caves look like this.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.954
(laughter)

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:45.091
And it was seeing this space

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.361
underground in a cave in
England about 16 years ago

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.029
that got me hooked.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.864
I was absolutely drawn

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.168 align:start size:88% position:13%
to the environment
where there's no light,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.035
it's an alien world.

00:03:57.035 --> 00:04:00.607
And I was fascinated
with this space and I,

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.475
I wanted to

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:06.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
take pictures in
the caves basically.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.849
This was my first cave
photograph that I took

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.185
16 years ago when I
was studying fine art

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:15.821
at university in Sheffield.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.391
And at the time I wanted
to combine my love of caves

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.326
and caving with my
passion for art.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:22.961 align:start size:88% position:13%
So that's when I
started teaching myself

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.230
cave photography.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
I would practice in a
local cave called Titan.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.939
Using these film cameras that
I borrowed from university.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.374
I wouldn't tell them
where I was taking them

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:37.176
because I don't think
they'd let me take them

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.945
if they knew where
they were going.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.113
(laughter)

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:44.650 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then at weekends I got
involved in a digging project.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.220
So we decided to
sink a mine shaft

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.556
from the surface
through solid rock

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:53.592 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then a tunnel
all the way to Titan.

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:56.395
And we would drill big holes

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.530 align:start size:88% position:13%
with a compressed air
drill like this one here

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.268 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then blow up the
limestone with explosives.

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.635
And then all the
rocks and rubble

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:05.571
we had to cart along the tunnel

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.373
on this railway
that we installed

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.276
and then winch it
to the surface.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.612
It took four years to
complete this project.

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.247
Sinking the shaft
from the surface,

00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:18.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
making the connection
through to Titan.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:20.119
Now at the time,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start size:88% position:13%
like I said, I was
using the film cameras,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.422
so I would draw pictures

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:26.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
of how I imagined the
photograph to look like.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
You can see the
picture on the right,

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.862
it's a bit more technical,

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.797 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's got the angles of the
lenses that I was using

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.233
and the F stops and
the guide numbers,

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.467
of the lights we were using,

00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.104
the distances to the walls.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.840 align:start size:94% position:6%
How reflective the
surface of the walls were.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.577
Trying to build up the
photograph in my mind.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.547
You can see here on
the left a sketch.

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:49.782
This is in Titan,

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.717
on a ledge halfway up.

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:54.520
I wanted to make a picture
looking up to the ceiling.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.088
So I drew the sketch

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:57.823
and then we went into
the cave and tried to

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.791
make the photograph real.

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:02.228
Try and get something similar.

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.031
Now due to the size
and shape of Titan,

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.566
it's very vertical in nature,

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:09.668
it's about 450 feet tall,

00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:12.738 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's the largest
natural shaft in the UK.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:15.241 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I thought the most
impressive picture

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
was from the very top looking
straight down the void,

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:20.779
all the way down to the bottom.

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.015
So we had to climb
up into the roof

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.584
with all my camera
gear and somehow

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:28.721
anchor my tripod to the wall
with the camera fixed solid

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.622
looking straight down.

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:34.693
And you can see here I had to
climb up there using ropes,

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:37.296
sitting on a seat that I'd made.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.764
I had a walkie-talkie radio,

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.933 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I could communicate with
all the people below me

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.435
who had flashguns.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.473 align:start size:97% position:3%
And at the time I was still
using the film cameras.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.709
Now although the pictures
were fairly impressive,

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.846
they were never exactly
what I dreamed about.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I was being
hassled and persuaded

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.919
by my colleagues to
get a digital camera.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.320
So I eventually,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.554
after several attempts,

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:05.124
I succumbed and bought
my first digital camera

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.293
which was a Canon EOS 20D.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.962
And of course,

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.897
with the luxury of being
able to see the photograph

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:13.932
on the back of the camera.

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
We were able to
get that photograph

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.169
that I dreamed about.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.872
And you can see the rope
going all the way down

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:22.875
to the caver in
the bottom there.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.610
And there's still a
big void below that,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start size:84% position:16%
maybe 200 foot below
that black hole.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.680
And at the top of the picture

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.949 align:start size:84% position:16%
you can see the
breakthrough window

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.418
where our surface
shaft and tunnel

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:36.889
which we'd driven through
limestone popped down.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.091
Now unbeknown to me,

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.093 align:start size:84% position:16%
at the time this
was my first attempt

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.995
at documenting a story.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.898
And although these
photographs are like

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.900
10, maybe 12 years old now,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.737
it's great with social
media and Instagram.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
By sort of reinventing
them almost,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.274 align:start size:81% position:19%
you're bringing
them back to life.

00:07:56.274 --> 00:07:59.712
It's not like they're
lost in an archive.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.114
And,

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:04.917
for instance,

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:09.822
I was also invited to take
the photographs for a book,

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:13.159
a French cave called
the Gouffre Berger.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.528
Now at the time when Mount
Everest was being conquered

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:19.198
in 1953, within the same week,

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
a team of French
cavers were exploring

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.436
the then deepest
cave in the world,

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.737
called the Gouffre Berger,

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.540
all within about a
week of each other.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.276
The cave's about
3,500 foot deep.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.413
Here's a picture of our team.

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
And you can see how
much lighting equipment

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.284
and camera equipment we
had to take underground

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.952
for a four day camp.

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:44.957
Now leaving the surface behind

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:47.659
and going on into a cave

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:50.496
for many days is a
very strange feeling.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.064 align:start size:94% position:6%
Knowing that you're
gonna spend all that time

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.566
away from the sun,

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:57.469 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's a little bit
depressing, I must admit.

00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:00.238
But our journey through
the cave was really cool.

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:02.174
We went past this first section

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.777
where there's a wooden platform,

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
which the French
pioneers used to haul

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.947
and lower equipment.

00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:11.183
And it was fascinating to see

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.918
how their experiences of doing

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:15.254 align:start size:94% position:6%
exactly what we were
doing at the time but with

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.857
like more primitive lights

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:20.026
to what we use these days.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.629
It's also very cold,

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.564
it's a very cold cave.

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:28.233 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is a great
technique to stay warm,

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:30.903
by using the warmth of a candle.

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.073 align:start size:84% position:16%
Once you've negotiated
the entrance series

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.407
of the Gouffre Berger,

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:38.977 align:start size:88% position:13%
you then pop out into
this huge trunk passage.

00:09:38.977 --> 00:09:41.746
And you follow it
all the way down

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.548
passing some iconic locations,

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:45.150
this one's called Lake Cadoux,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.686 align:start size:84% position:16%
named after one of the
original explorers.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:48.987
In dry weather conditions,

00:09:48.987 --> 00:09:50.855
this lake completely disappears

00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:53.359
and you can just walk through.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.962 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then the most iconic
location in the cave

00:09:56.962 --> 00:09:59.364
is this place called
Hall of the Thirteen,

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:02.901
named after the 13
French explorers.

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.037 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's also home to one of
the first underground camps,

00:10:06.037 --> 00:10:07.473
there are two camps in the cave,

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.107
this one's the first one.

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:11.143
And at this point,

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.879 align:start position:0%
we make a telephone call
basically back up to the surface

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.048
to get a weather forecast.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:19.785 align:start size:97% position:3%
To make sure it's safe to
continue down into the cave.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.386
Because after the camp,

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:23.088
the nature of the cave changes,

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:25.091
it becomes a lot wetter.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.926
This section's called a cascades

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:30.362 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it's really
important to rig a rope

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:31.597
all the way through the section

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:34.500
just in case the
water levels rise.

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.939
At this point we're about
3,000 feet underground now.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:42.841 align:start size:94% position:6%
Another location where
there's an iconic landmark

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.144
left behind by the
French pioneers.

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:47.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
You imagine carrying
that metal pole

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.115 align:start size:88% position:13%
all the way down through
the entrance series,

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:51.416
across that lake,

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.819
through the cascades.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.922
Would have been very
challenging in 1953.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:11:00.592
And they used it to gain
access to the far wall

00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:02.795 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the cave where they
could rig a ladder

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
to avoid the
waterfall below them.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.335
Nowadays, we use the ropes.

00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:12.038
Again, away from the waterfall,

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.272
making it safe.

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:15.774
And then finally,

00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:17.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
you reach the
bottom of the cave.

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:19.544
Where the water levels
are really, really high

00:11:19.544 --> 00:11:24.149
and you're forced to swim
through the cave passage.

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.484
And it's very low.

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:27.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
And if you haven't made
that telephone call

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.321
earlier to the surface to
get the weather forecast,

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.524
you probably wouldn't wanna
go through this section.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just in case the
water levels did rise

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.695
and it got sealed off.

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:37.896
Now limestone caves,

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:39.331 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're not the only
caves out there,

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.867
there are other caves as well.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.769 align:start position:0%
And I really wanted to
document caves insides glaciers

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:47.005
because they're ever-changing.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.273
And they're under threat

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:51.209
and they're disappearing
due to climate change.

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.978
Now glacier caves or moulins,

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.580
as they're also known,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.582
are formed when
surface meltwater

00:11:57.582 --> 00:12:00.085
disappears down in a
crack through the ice

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:02.721 align:start size:97% position:3%
and winds it way all the
way down through the glacier

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.523
to the bottom.

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:06.792 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they can be very
dangerous things to explore

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.626
during the day,

00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:10.929
when there's a lot of meltwater.

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:13.565
Which is why we tend to
explore them at night.

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:15.501
When hopefully the
cold temperatures

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.670
have frozen all the water.

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.673
However, this does
mean setting an alarm

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.442
at something like 2
a.m. in the morning

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:26.044 align:start size:94% position:6%
and getting up out of your
nice warm sleeping bag

00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:29.281 align:start size:81% position:19%
and making some
kind of breakfast.

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:32.618
I'm not sure if Gareth on
the right there in the red

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:33.986
was half asleep when
I took this picture,

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:36.354
it looks like he's
eating a pan of snow,

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:38.990
as opposed to a pan of porridge.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.459
Knowing Gareth, it
probably is snow.

00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:43.395
Then we'd hike over the glacier

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:46.364 align:start size:94% position:6%
avoiding any crevices
that might be on the way.

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.733
And trying to find those moulins

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:51.137
that we had made GPS
waypoints of before.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.739 align:start size:88% position:13%
When we get to the
entrance of the moulin,

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:55.774 align:start size:97% position:3%
we get out all the equipment
that we're gonna use,

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:58.911 align:start size:84% position:16%
install an ice
screw into the ice.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.312
Trying to make it so that

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.680
when the sun comes
up in the morning,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.015
it's not in direct sunlight,

00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:04.683
so it wouldn't melt.

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:10.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then rappel over the edge
of the glacier downwards,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.825
trying to rig the ropes
away from any gullys

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.761
where the surface
meltwater might

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.429
come in the morning.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.865
And then once underground

00:13:20.865 --> 00:13:22.968
and into the glacier properly,

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.203
most of the moulins that
I've explored in the past

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:27.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
are very much
channeled into the ice

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.309
like slides at a waterpark.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.844
And the surface is really
hard and really slippy,

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:34.479
and without what
we call crampons,

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.115 align:start size:84% position:16%
which are metal
spikes on our boots,

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.718
these things would be
impossible to explore.

00:13:40.618 --> 00:13:42.654
And then sometimes the glacier,

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:45.190 align:start size:97% position:3%
the moulin turns very
vertical inside the glacier

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.893
and you're forced to rig
a rope and abseil again,

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.494
rappel down.

00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:50.996
Other times,

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.065
the water can carve a more
horizontal route through it

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.333
like a canyon.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.868
But we would still
rig a rope through,

00:13:56.868 --> 00:14:01.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
just in case the floor
suddenly gives way.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.941
And like in limestone caves,

00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:04.810
the team are really keen to

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.178
make a survey of the moulin.

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:08.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
And from this they can
monitor the changes

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:09.949
and melting.

00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:13.017
And then if we're lucky,

00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:15.454
we finally reach the
bottom of the glacier

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.922
and we hit bedrock.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:19.892
And these passages can
be absolutely spectacular

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
as you're walking
along on the bedrock

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.662
underneath the glacier.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the water's
carved this amazing

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:27.199
sculpted surface above.

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:34.005
Now here's an example
of the speed at which

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:36.709
these things can change.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.712 align:start size:81% position:19%
We discovered this
moulin in 2012

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.681 align:start size:97% position:3%
on an expedition to the
Gorner Glacier in Switzerland.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.416 align:start size:81% position:19%
And we named it
the Balrog because

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.451
it creaks and groaned,

00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.053
made these really
strange noises.

00:14:49.053 --> 00:14:50.322
And I remember when
we were exploring it,

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.691
I would look up into
the ceiling and see

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:55.460 align:start size:84% position:16%
TV sized rocks
wedged up in the ice,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.563
half out, half in.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.997
Thinking to myself,

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wonder how much protection
my little thin helmet

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:03.001
is gonna offer should one
of these things fall out

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:04.670
and land on my head.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:12.310
Now the end of the
Balrog, the moulin,

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.946
it ended in this pool of water.

00:15:14.946 --> 00:15:18.784
And two of the team that we
were with were cave divers.

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:22.354
So they explore flooded
sections of cave passage

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:24.623
underwater in the UK.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:28.059
And they were really keen
to explore underwater here.

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:29.894
But they didn't have their
diving equipment with them

00:15:29.894 --> 00:15:31.430
at the time.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.665
So we decided that we would
come back the following year

00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:36.568
and dive the pool of water.

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:38.170
Well, we came back
the following year,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.139
and sadly this moulin had
completely disappeared.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:42.374
It melted away and

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.109
just completely gone.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.679
So this was basically like
a one-time only opportunity

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:49.447
to see this natural wonder.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:52.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
After that it
was disappeared.

00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:57.989
So after my moulin and
glacier caves projects,

00:15:57.989 --> 00:15:59.591
my most recent projects,

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:02.193 align:start size:94% position:6%
my most recent assignment
earlier on this year

00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:05.630
was to explore caves in
the quartzite Tepuis,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.234 align:start size:88% position:13%
the table top
mountains in Venezuela.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:13.037
Now these plateaus are
very, very isolated.

00:16:13.037 --> 00:16:16.074
And the caves are
isolated further.

00:16:16.074 --> 00:16:17.208
So the team that we were with

00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:20.312
were biologists and scientists,

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they were
really keen to find

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.682
unique forms of bacteria

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.852
which could well be
unique to science.

00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:31.222
So like I was saying,

00:16:31.222 --> 00:16:34.793
the main reason for the
expedition was to help

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:38.129 align:start size:97% position:3%
the clinical microbiologists
who were on the team,

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:40.732
who studied the micro,

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:43.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
bacterial resistance
into antibiotics.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.073
And I met up with this
guy, Dr Francesco Sauro,

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:51.076 align:start size:88% position:13%
who was a cave scientist
and a cave explorer,

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:53.111
an Italian cave explorer.

00:16:53.111 --> 00:16:57.048
Who won the Rolex Award, the
2014 Rolex Award for Enterprise

00:16:57.048 --> 00:17:00.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
for his work inside
these Venezuelan Tepuis.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.088 align:start size:94% position:6%
And we met up in a
village called Canaracuni,

00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:07.659
which is at the foot
of Sarisarinama Tepui.

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.896
These days I always take
with me a Polaroid camera

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:14.199
because they're a great way
to build up relationships

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.768
with the local villagers.

00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:18.670
And they're great gifts
to give to the people,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.973
the kids love them.

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:22.374 align:start size:81% position:19%
Just like I always
carry a diary,

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.608
a leather bound diary.

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:26.778
And from this I write
up the daily account

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:27.979
of what we've done.

00:17:27.979 --> 00:17:29.815
Make sketches of things,

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:33.218
this is a sketch
of the Auyantepui

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:34.586
with the village of Kavak,

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.588
where we stayed as well.

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:40.258
Now the surface of
Sarisarinama Tepui

00:17:40.258 --> 00:17:42.594
is heavily vegetated.

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:44.930 align:start size:88% position:13%
But on the surface there
are these big holes,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.131
they're called simas.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:49.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
They're basically
collapsed cave chambers

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:52.236 align:start size:81% position:19%
which are now open
to the surface.

00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:53.938
And it's things like
this, these big holes,

00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:57.341 align:start size:84% position:16%
that attract people
like Francesco.

00:17:57.341 --> 00:17:59.811
Now getting on top of a Tepui

00:17:59.811 --> 00:18:01.045
is very difficult.

00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:03.881
Landing a helicopter is
virtually impossible.

00:18:03.881 --> 00:18:05.884
So whilst the helicopter hovered

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:09.188
for maybe a meter, two
meters off the surface

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.422
of the floor.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.158
We had to slowly,
gently get off,

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.559
slide down onto the skids

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.127
without making any
sudden movements,

00:18:16.127 --> 00:18:18.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
not to distract
the pilot too much.

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:20.665
And slide off onto the floor

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.000
because the rotor blades are say

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.369
this far away from the trees

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:28.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then watch him turn
around and fly off.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.541
Pretty scary.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:33.411
Below the trees on Sarisarinama,

00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:37.115
it's very, very thick
with the vegetation.

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.251 align:start size:84% position:16%
But on the other Tepui
that we explored,

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:40.619
the Auyantepui,

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.889 align:start size:97% position:3%
there's hardly any vegetation,
it's very different.

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.524 align:start size:97% position:3%
The wildlife on top of
these Tepuis is fascinating,

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:48.861
you've got things like these

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
fly catching carnivorous
plants on the left,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.267 align:start size:84% position:16%
tree frogs, parrots
flying around.

00:18:58.069 --> 00:19:00.138
This expedition was two-fold,

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:04.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
there was the microbiological
project going on as well

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:08.880
but also second to that
was a laser scanning team

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.947
which had gone into the cave

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:12.917
to make a 3D map of the cave.

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:14.319
And I wanted to hang
out with these guys

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.553
'cause they were gonna spend

00:19:15.553 --> 00:19:18.890
four consecutive
days underground.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.758
We had two camps,

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:21.226
one camp in the cave

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:23.562
and then one camp on the
surface, not that far away.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.098
And I took advantage of the
fact that the surface camp

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.298
was so close.

00:19:27.298 --> 00:19:29.134
So I would set my alarm
a little bit earlier

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.368
than these guys,

00:19:30.368 --> 00:19:32.303
get up, run out
onto the surface.

00:19:32.303 --> 00:19:34.639
Because on the surface
they had a cafetiere

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:35.573
and I had a fresh coffee,

00:19:35.573 --> 00:19:36.808
and I'm a big fan of coffee,

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.678
so these guys just
had Nescafe, so.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.314
(laughter)

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.548
And then I would get back

00:19:43.548 --> 00:19:44.849
and as these guys
are waking up like,

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:46.017
"Where have you been?"

00:19:46.017 --> 00:19:47.285 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I just been outside
for a coffee."

00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:48.719
But there is a serious
point to this as well,

00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:51.690
I could relay messages
back to the surface team

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.825
and then tell them what
we were doing on the day

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:56.227
and then they could like tell
us what they were gonna do.

00:19:56.227 --> 00:20:00.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I was like the
human radio basically.

00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:01.833 align:start size:84% position:16%
These are the laser
scanning team,

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.402
Tommaso on the left,
Umberto in the middle,

00:20:04.402 --> 00:20:06.638
and then Ada on the
right-hand side.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.807
And that right photograph

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:11.643
is a typical scene working
with the laser scanning team

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start size:97% position:3%
because each scan took about
three minutes to perform

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.349
and in that three minute time

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.184
we had to run off and hide

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.685
in order not to be scanned.

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:23.455
Otherwise, we were gonna be
fixed inside the scan as well

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.190
whilst the lasers are
all firing around.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.659
So we had to find these
little nooks and crannies

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.728
to hide from the scanner.

00:20:31.262 --> 00:20:33.698 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now it's because these
caves are so remote

00:20:33.698 --> 00:20:35.166
and so rarely visited

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:38.036
that it was important to
make this accurate map

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.270
of the cave.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.974 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because we might never
return, who knows.

00:20:42.974 --> 00:20:45.409
And at this point in the cave,

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:48.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
the underground world
meets the surface world.

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:50.582
You basically walk out
into one of those simas,

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:54.553 align:start size:84% position:16%
one of those skylights
but from below.

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.988 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's a strange feeling
when you spend so long

00:20:56.988 --> 00:20:59.057
underground in total darkness.

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:00.992
Coming out to something
like this where there's

00:21:00.992 --> 00:21:03.996
vegetation on the rocks
and birds flying around

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.330
above your head.

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:10.969 align:start size:97% position:3%
Makes you realize how
remote and isolated you are.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.038
It's a fascinating place.

00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:16.207 align:start size:84% position:16%
Each time I passed
this part of the cave,

00:21:16.207 --> 00:21:19.277
I was drawn to the shapes and
the patterns in the ceiling

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:21.546
of the cave passage.

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.748
And I was really keen
to take a picture here.

00:21:23.748 --> 00:21:25.817
And finally, towards
the end of the trip,

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.019
Francesco and the team,

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:29.721 align:start size:81% position:19%
they helped me
make this picture.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:33.358 align:start size:97% position:3%
Another part of the cave
that's absolutely spectacular

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.559
is this part of this cave,

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's called Thousand
Column Gallery,

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.530
for obvious reasons.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the laser scanning
team spent a long time here

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.201 align:start size:84% position:16%
working their way
through the columns,

00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:45.570
making a really accurate map.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.038
And it gave me a
great opportunity

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:49.440
to take lots and
lots of pictures.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.609
But not always with
the manpower you need

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:52.944
to take these pictures.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.612
So this is a self portrait of me

00:21:54.612 --> 00:21:56.147
running through the columns

00:21:56.147 --> 00:21:58.417
with Ada in the background.

00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
Another part of the cave
that's really unusual

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.289
is this part with the lake.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.825 align:start size:94% position:6%
But what's spectacular
and unusual about the lake

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
is a fact that on
part of the surface,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.062
there's a skin of bacteria

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:13.164
that's growing on the surface.

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:15.600
And it changes by day
to day where it is,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.534
it's really unusual.

00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:18.303
And from my point of view,

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was unusual because it
reflected light like oil does.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.278
With a really rainbow
colored pattern to it.

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.379
Very strange.

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:30.214
Now, Albert Einstein said that

00:22:30.214 --> 00:22:31.816
if you look deeper into nature,

00:22:31.816 --> 00:22:34.719
you'll understand
everything better.

00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:37.388
And by looking closer
at some of these caves,

00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:38.857
what exists there,

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.692 align:start size:94% position:6%
I can understand what
he's getting at in a way.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like on the left
you've got these cool

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.095
gypsum formations.

00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:45.496
And on the right-hand side,

00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:47.031
the middle photograph.

00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:50.068
That's a moth that's been
eaten from the inside out

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.069
by bacteria.

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.374
Really, really unusual.

00:22:58.743 --> 00:23:00.445
Now just like Francesco,

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:02.914 align:start size:94% position:6%
this guy in the blue,
Hosam Zowawi his name is,

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:03.914
from Saudi Arabia.

00:23:03.914 --> 00:23:06.518
He won the Rolex Award in 2014

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:09.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
for his work as a
clinical microbiologist.

00:23:09.587 --> 00:23:12.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Francesco invited
him to come along

00:23:12.089 --> 00:23:15.326
and help understand basically

00:23:15.326 --> 00:23:17.496
what's going on in the
cave with the bacteria.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.864 align:start size:94% position:6%
So he's taken some samples
back to his university

00:23:19.864 --> 00:23:21.900
in Queensland, in Brisbane,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.437
where he's analyzing the
bacteria in the samples.

00:23:26.437 --> 00:23:28.640
Meanwhile it also gave Francesco

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.075 align:start size:94% position:6%
time to take some samples
again for his work

00:23:31.075 --> 00:23:33.077
that he's doing back in Italy.

00:23:33.077 --> 00:23:35.446
And then on the surface
he created like this

00:23:35.446 --> 00:23:37.848 align:start size:84% position:16%
field laboratory close
to one of the simas

00:23:37.848 --> 00:23:40.519
where he started doing the work.

00:23:42.353 --> 00:23:44.288 align:start size:84% position:16%
Finally, just before
returning home,

00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:46.757
I was invited to take
a short helicopter ride

00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:49.294
onto another Tepui and
explore another cave

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:51.129
called Cueva Fantasma.

00:23:52.296 --> 00:23:53.932
I didn't really know
what we were going to

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.700
and the journey
through the gorge

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.802
in the helicopter was
absolutely fascinating.

00:23:57.802 --> 00:24:00.972 align:start size:94% position:6%
The rotor blades were ever
so close to the cliffs.

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:03.941
And in the distance I could
see that the gorge ended,

00:24:03.941 --> 00:24:05.176
I didn't know where we
were going, like I say,

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:07.678
and we got closer and
closer to the end.

00:24:07.678 --> 00:24:09.648 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the cliffs got closer
to the rotor blades

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
and just when I thought
we were gonna like

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:15.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
crash or something,
the pilot turned right.

00:24:15.152 --> 00:24:16.955
And entered this
huge cave entrance,

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.324
I don't know if you guys can
see the helicopter parked up

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.292
on the floor there.

00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:22.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean I don't know
how high it is,

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:24.062
it's absolutely ginormous.

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:28.233 align:start size:97% position:3%
But it was really spectacular
to spend some time here.

00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:32.170
Now visiting the
Tepuis in Venezuela

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.638
and standing on top of one

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.907
was an absolute privilege.

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:38.042 align:start size:97% position:3%
And exploring the caves
and getting the opportunity

00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:39.277
to photograph them like we did

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.546
was a dream come true.

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
Arthur Conan Doyle wrote
about the lost world

00:24:43.781 --> 00:24:45.183
on top of the Tepuis,

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:48.953 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wonder what he would've
made of the caves.

00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:50.255
And finally, these photographs,

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.756
they don't take themselves

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.826
and they involve a lot of
help from many, many people

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.895
to bring in all the
lighting equipment.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.997 align:start size:81% position:19%
And I've got a
page on my website

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.966 align:start size:94% position:6%
that lists all the people
who's ever helped me.

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:03.968
So, I'd just like to
take this opportunity

00:25:03.968 --> 00:25:06.037
to thank all those people.

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:07.939 align:start size:94% position:6%
And my girlfriend and I
prepared this presentation

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:12.243
for you 'cause she's a cave
scientist herself as well.

00:25:12.243 --> 00:25:15.446
And also a National
Geographic grantee.

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:16.581
And I hope with the presentation

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:17.949
that we've kind of shown you

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:19.917
a little bit about
the world underground

00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:22.954
and tried to break down
some of those borders.

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:25.523 align:start size:88% position:13%
Remember, you don't
have to be an astronaut

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:28.560
or a deep sea diver to
discover something new.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.527
Thank you.

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:31.796
(applause)
