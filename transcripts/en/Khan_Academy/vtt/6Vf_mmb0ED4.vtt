00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.630
- [Narrator] Why does your vote matter?

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.380
- Your vote matters because,
in the most specific case,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.390
there might be a race where you live,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.510
for the House or the Senate
or even the presidency,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.900
where your vote really could
determine who the winner

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.870
of that race is.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.530
We saw in the 2000
presidential election race,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.150
that basically the entire
presidency was determined

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.860
by a difference of 537 votes in Florida.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.720
So that's a special case,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.510
but then also, there are reasons to vote

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.450
that have nothing to do with
the people who are running

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.740
for the national offices.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.020
There are lots of local
offices where laws are

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.770
put on the book that really can
affect your day-to-day life.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.480
There's also referendums in
various states and localities.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.630
There are about 150-odd
referendas on everything

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.740
from whether marijuana should be legalized

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.010
to whether and how poor
people get medical coverage.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.660
Those are also on the
ballet in a lot of places.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.390
And also, when a vote
takes place for somebody

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.680
who is being elected, it's
not just for the policies

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.650
of the day, it's also for the
policies that may yet come.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.380
And if you have a view on the
way things should be handled,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.970
you should exercise your voice

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.890
because it not only, if you are in a place

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.360
where your vote is not
gonna matter in terms

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.260
of directly electing the person you want,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.950
voting sends a message to those lawmakers.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.140
And it sends one of two kinds of messages.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.080
One, it says this number of people

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.700
represents this viewpoint.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.590
And lawmakers should listen
to that kind of message

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.423
from the voters.

00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:30.120
A lot of times, even if
they don't listen to it,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.220
well their opponents will
be able to raise it and say,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.020
Look, this many people believe
in this and you should.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.030
It is a fact that is then
used in public debate.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.630
And that fact can sometimes
be used to persuade people.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.880
Also, there's the case
that lawmakers get nervous.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.220
And they want to get re-elected.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.230
And if they see a lot
of people turning out

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.460
on the other side, even
if it doesn't keep them

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.350
from being elected, well, the next time,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.050
it might keep them from being elected.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.720
So they have to listen.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.330
Finally, it's the spiritual,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.680
kind of American civic religion,
which is America started

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.210
on the idea that we could govern ourselves

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.800
without resorting to fights.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.890
And we've been remarkably successful.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250
Although American history is blotted,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.250
and it is broken in places,
but Americans have always

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.080
transferred power
peacefully to each other,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.530
with the one great
exception of the Civil War.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.810
But the electoral system still survived,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.100
even through that most bloody battle.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.700
And so as Americans, by voting,
we are putting ourselves

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.180
back in touch with this
great original experiment,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.820
that at its time was
unique in American history.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.270
And there are still people
all across the world

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.530
who fight and die for the
simple ability to cast a vote

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.340
so that their voice can be heard.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520
And so not only to we have to keep faith

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.060
with our own history,
but also with the world

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.170
in which it is a human right
in some places to vote.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.770
And so we shouldn't take that
kind of thing for granted,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.890
if we want a world in which
human beings are allowed

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.540
to voice their vote and have
that vote mean something

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.760
in the way the laws are made

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.810
that determine how their lives are lived.
