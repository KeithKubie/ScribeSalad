00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.240
I love astronomy. You may have noticed. But
there’s one really frustrating aspect of

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.429
it: Everything we study is really far away.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.499
Nearly everything we understand about the
Universe comes from light emitted or reflected

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:20.220
by objects. It’d be nice if we could get
actual samples from them; physical specimens

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.949
we could examine in the lab.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.300
Welp, sometimes the Universe can be accommodating,
and allows us to hold it in our hands.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.860
Cambot, can we get this up on still store?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
If you go outside on a clear, dark, moonless
night — and you really should — chances

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.520
are pretty good that within a few minutes
you’ll see a shooting star. It’ll zip

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.870
across the sky, a fiery dot leaving a long
glowing trail behind it. They’re one of

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.500
the most exciting and fun things you’ll
see when you look up, and they always get

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.519
a gasp and a squeal of delight from people
someone who’s stargazing.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.220
What you’re actually seeing is a tiny bit
of interplanetary debris: rock, ice, or metal

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.610
ramming through the Earth’s atmosphere,
heated to incandescence. Most are faint, but

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.170
some can be astonishingly bright; I saw one
once that left an afterimage on my eye!

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.930
Obviously, shooting stars aren’t really
stars. So what do we call them?

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.829
Sometimes it seems like astronomers use different
names for objects to keep things as confusing

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.320
as possible. But really, we do that to separate
out different things. In this case, the actual

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.119
bit of solid stuff coming from space is called
a meteoroid.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.790
The phenomenon of the meteoroid getting hot
and blazing across the sky is called a meteor.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.280
And finally, if it hits the ground, we call
it a meteorite.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.329
I think the second best way to tick off an
astronomer is to mix up meteor and meteorite.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.890
Sometimes astronomers can be pretty pedantic
about such things.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.110
Oh, the best way to tick off an astronomer?
Ask them, “Hey, what’s your sign?”

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.890
Amazingly, a typical meteor that you’ll
see is due to a meteoroid that’s tiny, probably

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.860
smaller than a grain of sand! How can that
be?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.020
It’s because they’re hauling mass. You
heard me.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.899
The meteoroid is orbiting the Sun, probably
at speeds of a few dozen kilometers per second.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.260
As it approaches the Earth, our planet’s
gravity accelerates it an additional 11 kilometers

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.550
per second — Earth’s escape velocity.
And when it enters our atmosphere it’s moving

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.000
incredibly fast, up to 70 km/sec or more.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
The energy of motion is called kinetic energy.
If you want to get something moving, you have

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.900
to give it energy, and if you want it to stop,
you have to take that energy away. This kinetic

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.530
energy depends on the mass of the object and
how fast it’s moving. In fact, it depends

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.320
on the square of the velocity; double its
speed and it’ll have four times the kinetic

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.300
energy.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.510
Meteoroids may usually be small, but they’re
screaming fast, and have a huge amount of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.970
kinetic energy. As they hit our atmosphere
they slow from their ridiculous orbital speed

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.890
to nearly a standstill, and all that energy
has to go somewhere. It gets converted into

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.200
light and heat, and that’s what we see as
a meteor.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.610
A big misconception about meteors is that
they get hot due to friction with air. Actually,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.100
a far bigger contributor to their heat is
compression. One of the most basic laws of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.450
physics is that when you compress a gas it
heats up. And a meteoroid coming in at hypersonic

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.350
speeds compresses the air in front of it a
lot, heating it hugely. The gas can reach

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.750
temperatures of thousands of degrees Celsius
for a few seconds.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.470
The air radiates away this heat, in turn heating
up the meteoroid. The material on the surface

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.860
vaporizes and blows away—a process called
ablation. That ablated material leaves a glowing

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.300
trail behind the meteor, which we call a train.
Sometimes it can glow for several minutes,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.990
getting twisted up in high altitude winds,
leaving behind an eerie, ghost-like persistent

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.010
train. This all happens high above your head,
about 90 – 100 km above the ground.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.330
Typically, from any one location, you can
see a few meteors per hour. It may not seem

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.070
like much, but when you add them up all over
the planet you find the Earth is getting pelted

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.150
to the tune of about 100 tons of material
a day. But again, most of these meteoroids

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.380
are teeny tiny.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.930
Those random meteors are called sporadic meteors.
They tend to be rocky in composition, and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.650
generally come from asteroids. If two asteroids
smack into each other, the collision can eject

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.580
little bits of material that then orbit the
Sun on their own. If their orbit crosses the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.000
Earth, then you have a potential meteor. It
may take a few million years, but at some

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.750
point the Earth and the meteoroid are at the
same place at the same time, and boom.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.280
But sometimes meteoroids travel in packs.
When that happens, we can get meteor showers,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.470
many dozens or even hundreds of meteors per
hour. With one exception, those don’t come

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.160
from asteroids: They come from comets.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.440
When a comet orbits the Sun, the ice on it
turns to gas, dislodging dust and gravel mixed

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.120
in. This material leaves the comet and tends
to stay more or less in the same orbit as

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.780
the comet itself. Over time, that material
gets scattered all along the orbit, creating

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.480
a puffy ribbon of tiny pieces of space debris
around the Sun.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.000
When the Earth plows through that cloud of
debris, we get a meteor shower.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.340
From our viewpoint on Earth we see meteors
shooting across the sky, apparently radiating

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.730
away from a single point. That’s a perspective
effect; it’s like driving through a tunnel

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.940
and seeing the tiles on the wall and ceiling
flying past you, all apparently coming from

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.980
a point ahead of you. The point in the sky
where the meteors come from is called the

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.040
radiant, and the shower is named after the
constellation the radiant’s in. So we have

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.300
the Perseid meteor shower, the Leonids, the
Camelopardalids. Or the Camelopardalids.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.680
And, since the Earth hits a specific comet
stream around the same time every year, the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.610
showers are annual. The Perseids are in August,
and the Leonids in November.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.890
Watching a meteor shower is easy: Just go
outside and look up! Generally, they’re

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.460
better after local midnight. The Earth plows
into the meteoroids, so facing the direction

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.660
of Earth’s orbital motion means more meteors,
just like you get more raindrops on the front

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.720
windshield of your car than than on the back
when driving through a storm. After local

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.430
midnight you’re on the part of the Earth
facing into the orbit, so you see more meteors.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.150
By the way, if you happen to be on the International
Space Station, you have to look down to see

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.110
a meteor. In 2011, astronaut Ron Garan photographed
a Perseid burning up below him! But don’t

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.520
worry: The odds of the Space Station getting
hit are extremely low. Space is big.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.520
Oh, and that one exception I mentioned before?
That’s the annual Geminids shower, which

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.250
occurs in December. That comes from the asteroid
3200 Phaethon, which is on an orbit that takes

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.230
it very close to the Sun. It’s possible
it gets so hot that the rock vaporizes, making

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.460
it act like a comet.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.930
The vast majority of meteoroids are small
and tend to burn up in our atmosphere. But

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.310
they can be bigger. A bolide, or fireball,
is an extremely bright meteor, and those can

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.590
be about the size of a grapefruit. Those happen
pretty often somewhere over the Earth. I’ve

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.889
seen a few myself.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.900
Very rarely, an incoming meteoroid will survive
all the way to the ground and become a meteorite.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.870
Sometimes, the immense pressure of ramming
Earth’s air causes the incoming meteoroid

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.889
to crumble or even explode, raining down dozens
or hundreds of smaller pieces. Typically,

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.230
they slow rapidly after their blaze of glory,
and simply fall the rest of the way to the

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.080
ground. The air up there is cold, and their
interiors are cold from being in space so

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.669
long. So, despite what you might think, meteorites
don’t cause fires when they hit the ground.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.110
In fact, they can be quite chilly!

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.780
Meteorites are classified into three broad
categories: Stony, which are mostly rock;

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.440
iron, which are mostly metal; and stony iron,
which are a mixture of the two. The majority

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.160
of meteorites we find are stony.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.900
The stony meteorites are subdivided into two
kinds: Chondrites, and achondrites. Chondrites

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.660
contain chondrules, small grains of minerals.
These are very primitive, and are thought

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.300
to have condensed out of the original disk
of material that formed the solar system.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.630
Their age can be found by looking at ratios
of elements in them formed from radioactive

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:48.590
decay. The oldest known meteorite formed 4.568
billion years ago: Before the Earth itself

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.130
formed!

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.150
Achondrites don’t have chondrules in them.
Most likely they came from a bigger asteroid,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.340
one that was once molten through, mixing the
minerals. A big collision disrupted the parent

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.090
body, creating the achondritic meteoroids.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.360
Iron meteorites most likely come from the
center of a large asteroid, one big enough

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.889
that metals fell to the center via gravity.
Again, a big impact blew the asteroid up,

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:16.290
scattering its material around the asteroid
belt, and with some on orbits that eventually

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.840
intersected Earth.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.250
Stony irons are the rarest. Some have green
or orange crystals of a mineral called olivine

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.400
embedded in a web of metal. Called pallasites,
they may be the most beautiful of all meteorites.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.310
I actually collect meteorites. It’s fun
but can be a somewhat pricey hobby. If you’re

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.169
interested, make sure you get ‘em from a
licensed dealer. We have links to some in

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:36.820
the dooblydoo.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.440
Of course, on occasion the meteoroid coming
in can be a tad bigger. And when that happens,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.470
well, all hell can break loose.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:50.210
On February 15, 2013, residents of the Russian
city of Chelyabinsk got a rude awakening.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.990
At 9:20 a.m. local time, a rock about 19 meters
across came in at a low angle. It got nearly

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.230
as bright as the Sun as it slammed into the
atmosphere, and the pressure of its passage

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.589
broke it up into several chunks, which broke
up again. In a moment’s time, the sudden

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:09.900
energy released was equivalent to the detonation
of a half million tons of TNT — as much

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.040
as a small atomic bomb!

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.950
While no one was killed, over a thousand people
were injured by flying glass, shattered by

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.500
the explosion. No doubt they were at their
windows gawking at the huge vapor trail in

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.130
the sky when the shock wave hit.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.240
There was no warning for this event; the asteroid
was essentially too small to detect while

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.240
it was out in space. Well, for now at least.
Telescopes are coming online soon that should

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.520
be able to find smaller asteroids and give
us some warning. Astronomers are more worried

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.080
about ones roughly a hundred meters across
or bigger; these can do serious damage on

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.020
a city-wide scale or larger, but at the moment
aren’t easy to spot much in advance.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.320
And what do we do if we do see one headed
our way? As of right now, there’s not much

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.310
we can do. Studies have been done to determine
the best course of action; maybe lobbing a

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.050
nuke at it, or simply ramming it with a spaceprobe
to change the orbit and make sure it misses

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.200
Earth. These ideas look good on paper, but
they haven’t been tested yet. We’re still

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.279
a few years from that.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:08.810
The good news is that objects that size hitting
the Earth are rare; maybe once every century

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.940
or three. But if we do nothing, it will happen
eventually. As science fiction writer Larry

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.620
Niven points out, the dinosaurs went extinct
because they didn’t have a space program.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.610
Hopefully, we’re smarter than they were.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.500
Today you learned that meteors are small bits
of interplanetary debris sloughed off by asteroids

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.640
and comets. When the Earth plows through the
stream emitted by a comet we get a meteor

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.910
shower. Meteors burn up about 100 km above
the Earth, but some survive to hit the ground.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:41.080
Most of these meteorites are rocky, some are
metallic, and a few are a mix of the two.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.529
Very big meteorites can be a very big problem,
but there are plans in the works to prevent

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.870
us from going the way of the dinosaurs.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.670
