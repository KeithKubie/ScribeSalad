The third foundational concept to review is orthogonality. Which is the extent

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.440
to which the features of a system can be varied independently. You would like to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.060
enhance the orthogonality of your system in order to make more options available

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.810
to its users. Orthogonality also clarifies system descriptions and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.450
documentation, and supports automatic generation of system components.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.470
The principle of orthogonality was developed by David McGovern and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.090
Christopher Date.
