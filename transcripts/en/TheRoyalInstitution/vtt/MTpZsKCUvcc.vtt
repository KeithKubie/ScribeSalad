00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.300
What I want to show you now is a development
of that.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.500
Which you may well have read about.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm not sure whether James Bond used one

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.880
but certainly it's one of the favourite weapons
in current espionage stories.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.280
And that is, what we call, the laser eavesdropper.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.840
A device by which it is possible, under good
conditions,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.460
to hear what is going on in a room

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.300
when you've not been able to put a microphone
inside it.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.640
So you've got to work entirely from outside.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.820
And this diagram will give you an idea of
what it is.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.260
There we have a laser.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.120
Pointing in the direction of that little house.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.520
And it goes through the window.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.000
You can work off the window but it's better
to go inside,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.620
and here is a picture frame.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.040
And much exaggerated - the picture frame will
vibrate like that.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.760
In sympathy with any vibrations that fall
on it from people talking in the room.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.180
If you can pick up a reflection off the glass
of the picture frame,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.440
as it bends like that it will move the beam
coming back.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.720
And we now have an optical lever,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.100
equal in length from there, right across to
there.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.940
And it will swing about. It's a tiny amount
of course.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.060
Less than a micron certainly, here.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.900
From one photo cell to the other, and that
will generate currents

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.040
of the same frequency as the vibration in
the picture frame.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.340
And so now if we switch on the...

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.340
We'll pretend here that there is a radio going
in the house

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.060
and we will listen to... [Music plays on radio]

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
Now you'll just be able to, if you're near,
to hear this, but... [Music gets quieter]

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.260
Now.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.480
OK.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.260
[Music comes on loudly from device.] Yes.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.760
[Music cuts out]

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.080
Actually, I think we're listening to New Zealand
[Music is audible again]

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.840
And [Music is silenced] all that sound is
coming along the beam of light.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.340
[Music resumes]

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.260
[Man sings: Tuhituhi taku reta]

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.980
[Audience laughs]

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.260
[Man sings: tuku atu taku rÄ«ng]

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.460
Must let him do that bit again, musn't we?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.380
[Man sings: Whati whati taku pene]

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.900
[Applause]
