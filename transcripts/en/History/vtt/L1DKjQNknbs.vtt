00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.253
- So Steve, tell me about

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.504
this beautiful '66 Cadillac.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.798
- My parents
were original owners.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.508
- Your parents owned this car?
- They did.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.593
They brought this car home
when I was five years old.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:11.845
- Oh, my gosh!

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.888
- And, um, I've been
around this car

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.849
for 50 years.
- What's up, Kev?

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.851
- It was my, uh, car
in high school and college.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.269
- Is that right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.812
- Quite all right.
- No, that's okay.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.313
Ryan, Steve, Steve, Ryan.
This is his beautiful

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.190
'66 Cadillac.
- Yeah!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.067
'66 Cadillac convertible!

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:29.529
- So my wife and I went
to our high school prom,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.905
you know, in this car.
- You're kidding?

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.658
- I started to have it
put back together

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.411
<i>several years ago,
and I would love nothing more</i>

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.038
<i>than for you guys
to finish it up.</i>

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.999
- Well, we appreciate you
bringing it to us,

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.751
'cause we do have
a knack for these.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.544
- Yeah.
- You know, the one thing

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.589
I will tell you is that
when Danny sees this...

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.632
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- You know he's gonna want it.</i>

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.593
- Okay.
[both laughing]

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.095
So the car has a tremendous
amount of history,

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.222
you know, for me,
and such an important project.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.558
<i>- This is great, and it looks
like all the pieces</i>

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.643
<i>and parts are here, too.
- Should be.</i>

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.228
- Whatcha think, sir?

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.107
- At a quick glance, it's...
not perfectly straight,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.234
- Mm-hmm.
- But my biggest pet peeve

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.945
is the paint is a little
blotchy.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.865
I would love to repaint this
thing and make it perfect...

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.408
- Mm-hmm.
- But that definitely

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.785
changes the budget a lot.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.661
- Yeah.
- It really is a beautiful car.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.205
- Thank you very much.
- I'm jealous.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.748
[laughter]
- Danny will be, too.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.416
- Thanks, Ry.
- Thank you.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.753
<i>- Now, do you know,
did they redo the, uh,</i>

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.379
<i>the drive train?
- They did.</i>

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.090
Engine's been rebuilt,
transmission's been rebuilt.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.759
- Wow! Okay...
- Um...

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.845
It did start out
as a frame off restoration.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.806
- Oh!
- So a lot of that

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.433
has already been completed.
Just desperately need your help

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.185
in putting it back together.
- Back together.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.520
And finishing it off.
- Yeah.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.772
- All right.
Well, that's great.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.398
Let's go to the office,

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.108
and, uh, let's work up
some numbers.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.027
<i>- Okay.
- All right. Beautiful car.</i>

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:54.030
<i>Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.</i>
