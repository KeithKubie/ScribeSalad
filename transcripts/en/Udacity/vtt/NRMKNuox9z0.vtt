Wow, that was a lot. We covered scatter

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:06.864
plots, conditional means, and correlation coefficients. Now I want

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:08.517
you to take some time to think about

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:11.364
everything that you learned in this lesson. Capture some

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:13.162
of your ideas and then write them down

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.250
in the text box that will appear right after

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.095
this video. Once you've submitted your thoughts, you can

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:20.869
compare your thoughts to our instructors and the solution.
