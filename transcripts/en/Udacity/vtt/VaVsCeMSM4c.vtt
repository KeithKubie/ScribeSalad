Now that we have
a functioning application,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.300
let's add some API endpoints to it.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.350
The API request should return a JSON
object for a list of all restaurants,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.480
the menu of a specific restaurant,
and a specific menu item,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.580
when a client sends a GET request
to one of these three URLs.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.120
Remember to import jsonify
into your project and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.600
add a serializable property to your
database set up file where needed.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.469
Your JSON request should return pages
like these when you're finished.
