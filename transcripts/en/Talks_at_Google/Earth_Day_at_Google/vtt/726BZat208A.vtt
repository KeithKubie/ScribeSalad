00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:07.240
GEORGE MARSHALL: So
I'd like to start

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.765
with a question, which
is like a challenge.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:16.510
And the question is
this-- why is our response

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.016
to climate change so weird?

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:21.640
I'm not talking here
even about denial,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.359
I'm just saying,
just downright weird.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.650
I mean, take this, for example.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.890
So these were leaflets
that were given out

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.220
by my local supermarket,
a supermarket that

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.094
has a whole sustainability
program-- called Tesco,

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:35.760
it's in Britain.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.600
They wanted to encourage people
to fit low energy light bulbs.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.560
They wanted to incentivize
them by giving them

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.110
something they could really
make them want to do it.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.090
Fine, let's encourage people.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.680
And this is, weirdly,
what they came up with,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.680
that you could save
energy in one area,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.300
and then you can
blow it in another.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.875
I think that counts as weird.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.019
Here's another example.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.019
This is from The Guardian
website, The Guardian,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:11.830
the second most visited
news website in the world.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.700
And I noticed this kind of thing
just lurking in the corner.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.550
[INAUDIBLE] In one
corner it said,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.490
support The Guardian's low
carbon plan for Britain.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.410
Right next to it, it
said, give us your tips,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.535
and win a business class
flight for two to Dubai.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.080
Again, these two things sitting
right next to each other.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.310
And this happens
all of the time.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.970
We're able somehow to separate
climate change, the concern

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.300
about climate change, from
what we need to do about it.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.940
So live a high carbon
lifestyle, whilst

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.400
at the same time being
concerned about it.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.410
Piles of magazines
like this-- this

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.549
is taken from a news agent.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.090
I thought it was
kind of interesting.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.730
Like here is a group of
high carbon, high lifestyle

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.330
magazines, all
nestling around one

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.390
which is talking about
what the implications

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.940
and meaning of that
behavior will be.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.229
Now when we see
things like this,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.650
we know that in our brains we
put little frames around them.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.890
Literally we frame them.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710
We categorize things.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.780
This is part of a
process for us to decide

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.466
what to pay attention to, or
what not to pay attention to.

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.840
And one of the things that's
very important about climate

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.150
change is it's very subject
to these waves of attention

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.030
and disattention.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
Now psychologists
have for a long time

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.390
been really interested
in attention.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.355
What are the things which
make us notice something?

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:40.690
But actually over the
last 10, 20 years,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.200
they've come to realize that
actually disattention is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.720
more important for
our functioning,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.310
more important for our sanity.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.570
If I walk out there and out
front door into New York,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.440
I'm bombarded from all sides by
waves and waves of information.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.610
Not just information, like
data information, like words,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.400
but just buildings, sounds,
noises, people's faces.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.640
And remember, just as
you can do on Facebook,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.110
or on Google, you can
on your smartphone now,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.770
you zoom in on every face
going, ping, ping, ping,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.180
ignoring almost all of them.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.930
There's my friend
walking down the street.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.349
Bang, you can see them.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.890
So there's something
about our brains

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.460
that allows us to disregard
all of those other faces, zap--

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.490
move in on our friend.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
It is that disattention,
the ability

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.990
to disregard and throw
away information,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.430
which is so important for us.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.710
And that's what happens
with climate change.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.370
As I will argue,
climate change is not

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.410
only something that
does not necessarily

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.870
speak to us in terms of the
things we pay attention to,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.090
but it is also very well
set up for being something

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.920
but we actively disattend.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.484
It has a bad combination.

00:03:47.484 --> 00:03:49.150
Let's take these
magazines, for example.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.870
If we see this pile of magazines
sitting in a news agent,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.810
the reality is that
a lot of us, I think,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.550
would probably block out
the one in the middle.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.060
We know it's there.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.160
We'd say, is there something
here about climate change?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.610
In fact, yeah, there.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.332
They know it's there, and
yet they can block it out.

00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:09.790
And similarly, because I happen
to be interested in climate

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.610
change and have no interest
whatsoever in rooftop swimming

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.700
pools, I'm likely to zoom
on the climate change one.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.440
Just as my son,
disconcertingly, could

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.390
look at large movie posters
and just zoom in on the car,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.500
or zoom in on the thing
which interests him,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.760
regardless of whatever
the images were.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.210
So we come in on the
thing which interests us.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.600
This happens a wider sense
of climate change, too.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.562
That when we also people about
climate change-- for example,

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:42.770
like in that pile of magazines,
saying do you see it?

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.950
We say to people, climate
change, what's it about?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.760
They can tell us a lot about it.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.420
We say, is climate
change important?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.170
Well, the majority
of people say yes.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.870
The majority of people,
even in America,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.400
say yes, I'm
concerned about this.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.390
However if we don't draw
attention to this, if we just

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.220
go out into the streets
and say to people,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.281
what are you concerned about?

00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.780
For example, there's
lots of surveys

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.205
that say things like,
what are the issues which

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:12.330
should be on the President's
desk this coming year?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.790
Climate change is
nowhere on that list.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.180
So climate change is
something that people

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.130
know about, something
people continue a great deal

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.369
about in some cases, something
that the majority of people

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.660
are concerned about, and some
people are very concerned

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.160
about.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.770
Yet somehow they can
keep that knowledge

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.390
in one part of their brain,
separate from the part

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.770
of their brain which is involved
with other issues, or just day

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.906
to day life.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.280
And it's this
separation which is

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.340
the key between attention
and disattention.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.900
That's what we talk about.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.720
And we talk about climate
change all kinds of ways.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.180
But what about what
we don't talk about?

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.710
Because just as there is
attention and disattention,

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.905
there's things we say, and
there's things we don't say.

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:04.080
And when it comes
to climate change,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.230
it is not just that we
don't talk about it,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.140
but we actively
don't talk about it.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.030
In the course of
writing my book I

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.465
spoke with many people who
were experts in silence.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.370
And there was this whole
world of fascinating research

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.990
into things that aren't there.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.410
There's research
into non-information,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.074
the information that
scientists do not get.

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:30.740
And there are people
who are researching

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.340
into non-conversations,
the conversations

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.960
that people do not have.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.610
There's a lot of
non-conversations

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.690
about climate change.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.960
And any of you, if you're
interested in experiments,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.440
social experiments,
try it out yourself.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.410
Try going to somebody you know.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.250
Oh, I do it the whole
time with strangers,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.890
people I meet on
trains and buses,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.080
and say, I think
this weird weather

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.380
we're having is climate change.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.750
And just notice how
the conversation dies.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.246
They all stare out the window.

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:06.370
They'll change the subject.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.780
It will go somewhere else.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.760
And I push myself into
there the whole time.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.420
I'm determined to
get this out there.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.599
But most of us know that that
is not a safe place to go.

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.140
There's a social
rule that says, this

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.460
is an inappropriate
subject for conversation.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.974
I'm almost glad when I get
somebody who actively denies

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:23.265
climate change, cause at
least they want to talk about.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:27.030
You know, a third of people
cannot remember the last time

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.630
they had any conversation about
climate change with anyone,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.045
ever, in their lives.

00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:31.840
That's 1/3.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.652
That is a lot of people to be
actively not talking about one

00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:37.110
of the greatest
issues of our time.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.539
Now the rest of the
2/3, very few of them

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.580
have ever had a conversation
about climate change

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.770
with anyone other than
once or twice with friends,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.509
or members of their
immediate family.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.300
And don't be fooled
that just because we've

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.054
had huge demonstrations
in New York,

00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:56.470
and around the world of people
demonstrating about climate

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.715
change, that that
shows that there

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:00.210
is a widespread conversation.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.061
It is certainly
the start of one,

00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.310
but we know that the people
who have gone on the march

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.893
were the ones in
that small number who

00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:07.140
are very actively involved.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.690
The silence is
sometimes deafening.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.400
What I think was
curious to me about this

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.150
was first of all that
the experts on silence

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.860
say that it is remarkably
similar to what

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.115
happens around
human rights abuses.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.282
That just as in countries
with human rights abuses,

00:08:27.282 --> 00:08:29.740
people know that it's a good
idea not to talk about things.

00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:34.164
But I was also very surprised
to find that it is strong,

00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:36.289
in fact, in some ways even
stronger in places which

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.664
have had extreme weather events.

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:40.830
Maybe that's the equivalent
to a human rights abuse.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.932
It's something you
can see, here, now.

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.515
Maybe it's happened
to you personally.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.480
I went and did a
string of interviews

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.754
in two places that have had very
major, climate change related

00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:52.420
weather impacts.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.520
One of them was in the middle
of Texas, a town called Bastrop.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.150
1/3 of a town burnt down in
the most serious wildfires

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.570
in Texan history, 10
times more expensive

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.800
than any previous wildfire.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.080
This was compounded or created
by an exceptional drought.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.760
Again, record breaking in
the terms of Bastrop County.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.730
Nobody in that town could recall
for me a recent conversation

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.910
that they had had
about climate change,

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.390
in regards to the
fire they'd had.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.190
Which I have to say was weird.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.000
Weird because they were talking
about the fires constantly.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.424
Weird because they had a long,
long string of explanations,

00:09:32.424 --> 00:09:34.340
including one person who
even tried to tell me

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.860
that it was a terrorist attack
that had started the fire.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.880
Not a single person
talking about the fact

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.350
that for 20 years the
leading scientists in America

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.850
had been warning
that climate change

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.120
would bring increased
drought and wildfires.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.770
When I spoke with the
editor of a local newspaper,

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.110
she said to me, sure.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.610
Sure we'd cover
climate change if it

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.560
was relevant to the
people of Bastrop County.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.632
I said, well, your
state climatologist

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.840
seems to think it's relevant.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.790
Every scientist I've spoken
to seems to think so.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.220
And she said, we're
just a small town.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.570
We don't deal with these
big, global issues.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.155
OK, that's Republican Texas.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.780
But even in Democrat New Jersey,
when I went there five months

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.400
after Hurricane Sandy--
and we can argue the toss

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.770
about whether Hurricane Sandy
was climate change, or not

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.440
climate change, or how
much was climate change.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.720
That's not the point.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.910
The point was that we know
climate change is going

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.240
to bring extreme storms, and
there was an extreme storm.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.204
Would you not be
thinking about it?

00:10:36.204 --> 00:10:38.370
And once again, people when
I asked them said, yeah.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.990
Climate change, that's serious.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.310
Yeah, maybe the storm
was climate change.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.630
I'd say, tell me about the
last conversation you had.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.235
No one could remember the
last conversation they'd had.

00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:50.610
The conversations they were
having were all positive ones

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.240
about rebuilding
and reconstructing.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.840
There was no room there for this
negative, downer conversation

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.724
about what potentially
might be happening--

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:01.390
least alone the possibility that
they and people like themselves

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.598
might have contributed to it.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.400
One of the people
who I met there

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.670
was the mayor of Seabright
town, a very dynamic leader,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.520
called Dina Long.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.460
Dinah, here with
her sign, "Do," she

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.190
found in the rubble of Donovan's
Bar, one of the beach side

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.690
bars.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.950
The remains of a sign that
used to hang over its door.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.880
Donovan's Bar, just the
first two letters, "Do."

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.230
And do is her talisman.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.890
Do is how she
rallies the people,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.400
saying, we will rebuild, we
will make our town strong again.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.990
So I said, Dina, you're
clearly a very strong leader.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.720
How about you and other mayors
from up and down the Jersey

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.550
seashore, how about that you go
to Washington, how about that

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.290
you go to the Senate, and
you say, we demand action.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.010
We are the front line
on climate change.

00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:55.660
She just laughed.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.897
She said, duh.

00:11:57.897 --> 00:11:58.396
Duh.

00:11:58.396 --> 00:11:59.940
You've gotta be crazy.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.740
And of course climate
change is happening.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.320
Maybe this was climate change.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.160
But I'm not going to go out
with a message like that, when

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.580
I'm trying to
rebuild my community

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.470
and make something strong again.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.090
It's divisive.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.510
Some people wouldn't accept it.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.982
I want us to rebuild.

00:12:13.982 --> 00:12:15.190
And I have to agree with her.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.911
I say that's good,
strong leadership.

00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:18.660
But you know what?

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.880
If the people who are severely
affected by climate change

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.475
aren't talking
about it, the people

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:25.600
who aren't affected at all
aren't talking about it,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600
cause they don't
see the relevance.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.683
And the people in between
aren't talking about it,

00:12:28.683 --> 00:12:31.070
because somehow it's socially
inconvenient or awkward,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.340
or there's some kind of like
negotiated silence around it.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.930
Well, what are going to do?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.299
Because we get caught between
a rock and a hard place.

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:41.590
We're not moving on this issue.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.212
So what is going on?

00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:47.820
Is there something
in our brains which

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.455
is operating, which
makes it possible

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.330
for us to know something,
yet not to know it?

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.680
To accept that something
is a huge problem,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.640
and then yet somehow to
of push it on one side?

00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:01.010
That, I think, is
the key question.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.377
20 years, 30 years, we've
been talking about this.

00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:04.210
We're still talking.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.626
We have more and
more information,

00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:07.890
yet that information
doesn't seem to move people.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.660
Maybe this is why.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.230
We know built into the
architecture of a brain

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.050
are different
processing systems.

00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:17.550
We've known this well,
since the ancient Greeks.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.790
The ancient Greeks
first talked about this,

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.735
about the difference
between mind and feeling.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.750
And in the last 20
years, in particular,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.850
because of the benefits
of brain scanning,

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.737
we can actually see
how decisions get made,

00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:31.320
and thoughts get
moved around a brain.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.810
We know that one side of
this is very, very interested

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.230
in numbers, data,
symbols, logic.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.405
We could call this
analytic reasoning.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.901
It's very good at
evaluating risk.

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:45.650
It's what makes us
think about the future.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.900
It helps us to build strategy.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.202
This is the part that climate
change science speaks to.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.970
This is the culture
of science, too.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.800
But there's another
part of our brains

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.210
which is the dominant part, the
one which ultimately moves us

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.164
forward.

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.205
And that's the emotional
side, what psychologists

00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:06.810
would call affective reasoning.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.830
That is concerned with
what's happening here, now,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.740
drawing on our past experience,
what the people around us

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.240
are doing.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.830
And if you, for example, started
coming at me now with a knife,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.090
immediately that
side of my brain

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.627
would be jumping into action.

00:14:28.627 --> 00:14:30.460
Something is happening
here and now, there's

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.700
somebody who's attacking me.

00:14:32.427 --> 00:14:34.010
Because that's how
we need to survive.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.320
We don't need the
intellectual side going, ooh,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.990
he seems like a nice guy.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.219
I wonder what's going on.

00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:41.010
Is there something
weird they do in Google,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.307
when people come in to speak?

00:14:42.307 --> 00:14:43.765
I'd be immediately,
click-- danger.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.190
That's why we need that
side of our brain to move.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.954
But of course, if we had
just the intellectual side,

00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:55.620
if all of the information
just sits over

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.286
on that scientific
and intellectual side

00:14:57.286 --> 00:15:01.355
and doesn't move outside,
then we're stuck.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.930
One of the key things,
indeed, is not even somebody

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.050
attacking you, but
what happens around us.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.870
If for example, you were to
suddenly start attacking me

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.420
and none of the
rest of you moved,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.909
any of you sitting
there going, I

00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:17.450
wonder if I should
intervene in this,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.180
would not be likely to move.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.810
Because one of the tendencies,
we look for the social signals,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.750
even when someone
is under attack.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.627
Even when there's a
threat directly there.

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:27.460
Even if there's smoke
coming under the door.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.830
We know from experiments,
if people do not

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.350
see others moving, they
do not take action.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.150
Our power of conformity,
to conform to our group,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.499
is so strong that we only
move when I others move.

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:42.540
Unless we're an early
adopter, an early start-up.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.373
There's a small number
of people who are not

00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:47.300
bound by these signals, but most
people look for the signals.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.050
So for climate change we're in a
very difficult situation, which

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.000
is, if no one is moving and
if no one is talking about it,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.660
the primary signal we take
on that side of our brain

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.802
which responds to
those is not to move,

00:15:58.802 --> 00:15:59.760
and not to do anything.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.820
Finally, on this dominant
side, the emotional side,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.670
what really works
more than anything

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.290
is narrative, metaphor,
images, stories.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.200
And stories are fundamental
to the human brain.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.420
They're things that we shape
our world and our life around.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.390
It's not just a little
bit of icing on the cake,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.930
it is the cake.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.421
It is how we make
sense of a world.

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:28.920
So in the course
of writing the book

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.360
I spoke with some of the
top cognitive psychologists

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.202
in world.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.910
One of the people I
had the honor to meet

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.060
was Professor Daniel Kahnemann.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.360
Kahnemann won the Nobel
Prize for his work

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.930
on the way that biases--
our brains are biased

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.220
to prefer some
things over others,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.784
even irrationally, even
against our own interests,

00:16:50.784 --> 00:16:51.950
when we're making decisions.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.250
Professor Kahnemann has
studied several things

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.660
very relevant to climate change.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.590
One thing is he finds
we're very loss averse.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.230
We do not like losses.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.119
We avoid them in
every way possible.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.500
We especially are very
unwilling to lose something now,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.420
even if we are avoiding losing
something in the future.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.420
He also in his
experiments has found

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.780
that we do not like uncertainty.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.630
We avoid uncertainty
whenever it's there.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.217
So if something is uncertain,
we try and avoid that.

00:17:25.217 --> 00:17:27.425
We tried and postpone it
until it achieves certainty.

00:17:28.899 --> 00:17:30.315
And we're also
very bad at dealing

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.398
with things in the future.

00:17:31.398 --> 00:17:33.814
We have what he calls
hyperbolic temporal discounting.

00:17:33.814 --> 00:17:36.230
That literally-- that's a fancy
word for what it literally

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.470
means, is the further things
are away, the less interested

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.970
we are.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.690
Next hour is far more
important than tomorrow.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.930
Tomorrow is more
important than next week.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.510
Next week is more
important than next month.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.730
And quite frankly, once
you get down the far end,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.221
whether something is 30
years or 40 years away,

00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:54.720
really doesn't make
much odds to us,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.390
because it's so far
over the horizon.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.790
Professor Kahnemann said to
me, he said, I'm very sorry.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.710
He was a nice man, he was
very apologetic about it.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.470
I said, nothing personal.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.280
But he said, I'm deeply,
deeply pessimistic about this.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.600
Climate change is for me
the worst kind of problem,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.030
because it contains
everything we're bad at.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.750
I'm not so sure.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.230
I think he's right, we
bad at those problems.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.555
But I think there's something
more to it than that.

00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:32.055
I mean, for example, is climate
change really in the future?

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.220
No.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.011
It's happening now.

00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:37.640
It's been happening for
100 years, 200 years.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.480
Maybe even longer.

00:18:40.522 --> 00:18:42.480
The fact that we decide
to put it in the future

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.060
is an active choice on our part.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.790
In other words, we tell stories,
but put it in the future.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.130
The vast majority of
people in Britain,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.540
85% of people in Britain
think that climate change

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.365
will be a major danger
for future generations.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.190
That is more people than even
believe in climate change.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.710
There are some people out
there, in questionnaires,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.434
who do not believe
in climate change,

00:19:07.434 --> 00:19:09.350
but thinks that it's
going to be a huge threat

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.830
for future generations.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.630
That tells me something
about they way

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.296
that they're constructing
the storyline.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.130
Expensive, uncertain,
requires sacrifice-- around

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.800
the world we have
politicians who

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.700
will demand any level
of expense and sacrifice

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.450
to defend their
countries, for example,

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.340
Against the terrorist threat
of extreme uncertainty.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.450
And what gets interesting
is here in America, say,

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.100
often the people who are
demanding that we spend money

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.660
on defending ourselves against
terrorism are the very same

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.340
ones who say we cannot spend
money on climate change,

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.047
because it's too uncertain.

00:19:44.047 --> 00:19:45.130
And it requires sacrifice.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.780
Clearly what's happening
here is people just arranging

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.370
the arguments
around the decision

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.680
they've already reached.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.921
Which is why I don't think it's
about the information flow,

00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:55.420
either.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.550
There's some people who say,
the thing with climate change

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.490
is that the conservative
interests, or the oil companies

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.089
have corrupted the information.

00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:06.380
And it's true, there is a
major disinformation campaign

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.082
out there that is the distorting
the science of climate change.

00:20:10.082 --> 00:20:10.915
Is that the problem?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.760
No.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.080
Again, I don't think
it's the problem.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.150
I think it's a problem.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.300
But I don't think
it's the problem.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.520
Because it's clear
that what happens

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.410
is that it is not even that
information side of brain which

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.900
motivates us in the first place.

00:20:24.739 --> 00:20:27.030
So therefore what people are
doing is they have reached

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.740
the emotional decision
to oppose climate change,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.910
and then they're drawing from
and finding the scientific ,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.160
arguments or false
scientific arguments,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.400
to justify the decision
that they have already made.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.280
And almost the proof of that
is that when you look at it,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.380
and you ask people
who actually deny

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.780
climate change
about science, you

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.280
find that they are if anything
slightly better science

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.985
educated than the people
who accept climate change.

00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:53.110
This is not from a lack of
scientific understanding

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.400
on their parts-- it's almost
because they're too clever.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.760
They're using their
cleverness to find the reasons

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.110
for not accepting something.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.180
So what is going on?

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.530
Well, what I would say is that
the issue for climate change

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.960
is that it's about social
facts, not scientific facts.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.530
And these social
facts, these cues

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.850
we take from the people
around us, the stories we see

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.560
and that we hear,
are constructed

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.200
around our values,
our worldview,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.290
the way we see the world.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.859
And that these become the potent
and powerful thing for us.

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:24.650
And we don't want to
accept climate change.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.191
Why would we?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.020
It's challenging
it's threatening

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.144
it requires sacrifice.

00:21:30.144 --> 00:21:31.310
All of those things we know.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.150
But unlike terrorism, or
attack, or you coming at me

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.320
with a knife, or
things which really

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.360
speak to us in these
ways, it doesn't

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.355
have the necessary things
demanding our attention.

00:21:45.355 --> 00:21:47.480
At the same time, there's
a lot of things demanding

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.285
our disattention, particularly
the social message

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:51.660
we receive from
people around us,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.805
that this is not a great
thing to talk about.

00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:54.510
Or.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.504
Say in those hurricane
affected communities.

00:21:56.504 --> 00:21:59.170
And people were saying, you know
what, that's a bit of a downer.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.780
We're not going to go there.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.100
So it's got all of the
marks of disattention,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.180
and very few of the
marks of attention.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.930
And because that we shape it
as a story around our values,

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.234
it's about those stories that
then become the issue for us,

00:22:13.234 --> 00:22:13.900
not the science.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.540
That means we're then,
that if we like the story,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.660
we might be inclined
to accept it.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.840
If we don't like the
story, we will reject it.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.250
If it is my story, and the story
of people in my group, I'll go,

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:26.750
Yeah.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.560
I'll go with that, where it is--

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.160
Accepting it or denying it.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.384
Similarly, if an
opposing group-- imagine,

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.550
for example, you're a
conservative, and what you see

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.883
is that all of the liberals
are passionate about climate

00:22:36.883 --> 00:22:37.650
change.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.380
You react to their story.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.347
You go, this doesn't
speak to my values.

00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:42.430
I don't like these people.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.870
I don't like what
they stand for.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.640
And you're liable to pick up
your position in opposition

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.140
to them.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.806
It's not about the science, it's
about the reaction and response

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:50.620
to the stories.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.620
Indeed, for many conservatives
they look around.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.679
What are the main
social cues they get?

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:56.970
The people around them don't
believe in climate change.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.720
Should they believe
in it, or not?

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.980
Let's face it, the major
message they're getting

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.510
is not to pay attention to it.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.290
You know, I was thinking
about all of this a while ago,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.082
and I got a new toy
for me and my son,

00:23:11.082 --> 00:23:12.540
and we were playing
around with it.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.240
I'm thinking in particular about
how our brains form stories,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.170
about how we need information
to make sense of things.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.890
And the toy seemed kind of fun.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.220
But it contains
within it a story.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.650
And we like stories.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.470
It's one of these.

00:23:34.562 --> 00:23:36.770
It says a lot about the way
that our brains function.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.890
One thing it says is that our
brains yearn for completeness.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.770
So when something has a hole
in it, we fill in the hole

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.350
with the information which
makes sense of it, right?

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.260
So the whole point of
this optical illusion

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.810
is that our brains, on literally
the bit between the two points,

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.760
fill in the gap.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.496
And they say, ah, there's a
line there, and a line there.

00:23:57.496 --> 00:23:59.370
There therefore must be
something in between.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.828
I realize this probably works
better if you have more hair.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.080
They really like that.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.080
So that's one aspect of it.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.340
Climate change then is
an incomplete narrative.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.245
It does not give us all of
the information we require,

00:24:12.245 --> 00:24:13.994
and so we're very,
very tempted to fill it

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:16.280
in with the bits of our
own choosing, our own bias,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.130
to make sense of it.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.750
But what makes this
especially interesting

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.650
as an illusion is the
fact that it is an arrow.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.290
And like it or not, we
will compelled by it

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.930
to look at it, because it
speaks of an act of violence.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.100
That speaks to this innate
sense of threat, our responses

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.340
to threat.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.365
And the question is, of
course, who fired it?

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.610
Because even though it's a joke,
we cannot look at this without

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.090
thinking that someone out there
there has been an enemy with

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.170
the intention to cause me harm
That is truly the compelling

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.480
part, which is missing
from climate change.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.130
If there's any
part which is there

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.800
in the middle, which our brains
a bit between needs to fill in,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.045
it's a sense of who did
this, and who is responsible?

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.530
Climate change has
no external enemy.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.730
There is no enemy.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.970
It's caused by all of
us, from way we live

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.761
and the way that we
behave, and what we do.

00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:18.175
There's no intention.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.700
We're not intending harm.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.510
We're just putting food on
our table, heating our homes,

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.699
driving our kids to school.

00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:28.240
They were having a
holiday, but we've

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.448
worked hard for that holiday.

00:25:29.448 --> 00:25:30.800
We're entitled to it.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.784
So when people say climate
change is really serious,

00:25:33.784 --> 00:25:36.200
and look what's causing it,
the way we live is causing it,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.150
not surprisingly
people push that away,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.330
because it is a challenge.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.235
It contains blame.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.380
And of course, they have
no intention to cause harm,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.945
but the point at which they
accept but climate change is

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:50.670
a problem is the point at which
that intention becomes real.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.722
And at that point, they
become responsible.

00:25:52.722 --> 00:25:54.430
So it's hardly surprising
that people go,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.110
you know what, I don't
need to know about this.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.652
Why would he?

00:25:57.652 --> 00:25:59.151
Why would you want
to take something

00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:00.960
on board that makes
you basically feel bad?

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.580
So what would
climate change look

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.250
like if there was an enemy?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.300
Is that the issue?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.654
Well, I think yes.

00:26:09.654 --> 00:26:11.070
Because I think
if it had an enemy

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.945
it would be a very
different kind of problem,

00:26:12.945 --> 00:26:14.800
and we would respond
very differently.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.340
Imagine, for example,
that North Korea

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.080
was responsible for
climate change--

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.580
not us, not our actions, not my
driving, not my holiday, North

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.540
Korea.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.810
There's North
Korea, pumping gases

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.050
into the atmosphere with
the intention of destroying

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.920
the world's climate.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.070
There they are.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.400
There's the proof.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.170
That's one of our
drone satellites

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.785
took that photo last week.

00:26:33.785 --> 00:26:34.460
There they are.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.543
That's what they're doing.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.310
And we know they're
doing it deliberately

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.280
to destroy the
world's environment,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.250
because a secret
memo from Kim Jong Un

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.860
has been smuggled
out of North Korea.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.260
And he says, yes, haha haha,
with his devilish laugh, ha ha

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.760
ha.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.890
He said, with our poison gases
we will destroy wheat and grain

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.640
production across the Midwest--
which is, incidentally,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.150
one of the long term
worst scenario outputs

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.080
for climate change.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.200
Ha ha ha.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.400
Nefarious chuckles.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.830
If it was that kind of
problem, if we knew that,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.840
and once it was
established, it would

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.865
be a very, very different issue.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.080
Wouldn't it?

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.170
There would be no debate.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.580
There will be no
right wing opposition.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.200
There will be
nothing, cause there

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.491
will be a clear enemy with
the intention to cause harm.

00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:20.590
We can zero in on it.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.660
But because of its
diffused responsibility,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.730
because I said of its
missing gap in the narrative,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.900
it becomes extremely open for
us to interpret or reshape it

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.780
in our own form.

00:27:32.164 --> 00:27:34.330
You know, sometimes people
talk about climate change

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.540
as the elephant in the room.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.966
But it's not, really.

00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:40.423
Even the elephant in the room
is not even really the finger

00:27:40.423 --> 00:27:41.430
that we're ignoring.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.740
Because it's kind of like the
elephant we're all inside.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.610
And when you're
inside something you

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.040
can't see it, because it is
literally all around you.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.020
You can only see it
if you then creates

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.120
a story of in which you project
those issues on to someone

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.620
else.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.710
And that's what we do.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.520
We create storylines
around climate change

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.020
to try and make sense of it.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.430
But then the storylines, as I
said, then become the issue.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.760
So is there an enemy?

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.610
Well, yes.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.390
Everybody's busy
finding enemies.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.310
That's what we do
to make sense of it.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.435
One of the things I did
when I was writing the book

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:17.775
was I had a day with
the Tea Party, in Texas.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.420
My hostess was lady
called Deborah Medina.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.390
Deborah is a very powerful
Tea Party activist,

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.655
and she ran for the
gubernatorial contest in Texas.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.855
One of the campaign
photos was this.

00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:33.500
This is Deborah with
her gun that she told me

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.730
she keeps always down
by the side of her seat.

00:28:37.057 --> 00:28:38.640
I said, why have you
got gun, Deborah?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.520
What are you going to
do with this thing?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.770
She said, you never know
when you might need it.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.070
Bearing in mind that there I
was, as a former Greenpeace

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.350
activist, standing in
front of a Texan Tea Party,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.710
I understand we felt a little
bit nervous about what exactly

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.930
might define when and where
one might need this thing.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.970
Because it became very clear as
we started talking about this

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.810
that the real problem of climate
change was people like me.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.710
You know, Texans,
they're nice people.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.460
They were very open about this.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.649
And it wasn't personal
in that sense.

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:12.190
But clearly, from
their point of view

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.200
this was a liberal scam, created
with the objective of removing

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.640
their personal freedoms
and opportunities.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.949
That's how they shaped it.

00:29:20.949 --> 00:29:21.740
There was an enemy.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.860
In the missing match,
the missing thing

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.904
who shot the arrow,
it was people like me.

00:29:25.904 --> 00:29:28.070
They were making a sense
of it by imposing an enemy.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.486
And the problem of this was
not that the enemy was related

00:29:30.486 --> 00:29:32.750
to climate change at
all, but climate change

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.190
was created by the enemy.

00:29:35.685 --> 00:29:37.060
But then again,
people on my side

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.200
do this all the time as well.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.440
You know, we create our
own heroes and villains,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.529
and bad big oil
of Rupert Murdoch.

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:46.695
And I'm not saying these
people aren't very serious.

00:29:46.695 --> 00:29:47.252
They are.

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.460
They're serious contributors.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.650
What I'm also saying is that
they shape a story in ways.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.610
If you're a supporter
of Rupert Murdoch,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.670
if you're a supporter of oil,
if you support capitalism,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.110
you look at these stories
and you react against them.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.110
None of this in the end
is about climate change.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.844
It's about the shape
that people give it.

00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:04.510
Similarly, if you
oppose big government,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.800
and if you oppose
environmentalists,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.580
you look at the fact that
they hold climate change,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.960
and you say.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.626
I don't like it.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.970
So the big question
is, can we find

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.624
a new way of talking about it?

00:30:13.624 --> 00:30:16.040
Because given our brains aren't
making sense of a science,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.289
they're just making sense
of what the people around us

00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:20.654
are saying, and the
emotions associated with it,

00:30:20.654 --> 00:30:23.070
can we break this pattern by
finding new ways of doing it?

00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:25.780
I think the answer
is yes we can.

00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.780
I think the answer is also
that this can give us hope.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.520
Because just as we
have the capacity

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.160
to be very, very inwardly
focused, and very,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.500
very in-group minded,
nonetheless we

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.926
can also have immense
capacity for cooperation

00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.300
across boundaries,
when we choose

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.470
to find ways of talking
about that and doing it.

00:30:45.195 --> 00:30:46.820
Certainly there's no
reason to say that

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.630
just because we talk about
climate change this way

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.921
that there aren't 1,000 other
different ways of talking

00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.302
about it.

00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:54.760
I'm only going to give you one
example, but there are many.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.140
I had a most
fascinating conversation

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.960
with one of the country's
evangelical leaders.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.170
Joel Hunter is the leader of the
10th largest church in America,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.210
a megachurch down in Florida.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.850
And he gets climate change.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.190
Talking with him made me
realize that there were ways

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.244
that within the climate
movement and the wider

00:31:12.244 --> 00:31:13.660
environmental
movement we've never

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.710
thought of talking about it.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.940
Cause he comes from
a different culture.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.290
And it's a culture which
is based on how do we

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.590
go out there and mobilize
people around things which are,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.070
let's face it,
uncertain, in the future,

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.420
and require people
to make sacrifices?

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.550
That's his job.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.100
That's what he does.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.950
And he's hugely
successful at it.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.330
As indeed all of the
main religions are.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.182
They found ways of doing this.

00:31:38.182 --> 00:31:39.140
Now don't get me wrong.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.306
I'm not saying for one
second that climate change is

00:31:41.306 --> 00:31:42.930
a religion, or
that it should be.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:43.440
It is not.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.306
It is grounded in
scientific fact.

00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:47.680
What I am saying though is
that the way that sometimes we

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.180
think about things
have things in common.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.420
The way we think about our
politics, our community,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.550
our families, our society,
and our religions,

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.816
have in common a set of
underlying psychological rules.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.440
So I said, Joe, what
are we doing wrong

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.650
in the climate movement?

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.680
How we do this stuff better?

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.774
He said, well, one thing
we do in my church is

00:32:05.774 --> 00:32:07.440
we try and create a
community of belief.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.815
We bring people
together to share

00:32:08.815 --> 00:32:10.340
their belief and
their conviction.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.881
And he said you guys, you tend
to just give people a leaflet,

00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:14.440
or you tell them
to go to a website.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.190
We want to bring them
in, hold their hand,

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.316
take them through the steps,
recognize that doubt--

00:32:18.316 --> 00:32:19.815
because you know,
you're not allowed

00:32:19.815 --> 00:32:21.225
to doubt climate change.

00:32:21.225 --> 00:32:23.350
If you believe in climate
change, if you accept it,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.980
you're allowed to say you know
what, I'm not so sure anymore.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.970
You meant to hold that as
if it's some kind of fact,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.928
but of course it isn't.

00:32:28.928 --> 00:32:30.520
It's hard to hold on to things.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.770
You need to recognize that.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.130
You need to recognize
your anxiety over it,

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.040
because we don't do that either.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.650
And in his church they would.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.336
And this is especially
how we go out

00:32:39.336 --> 00:32:41.210
and we reach people is
we witness to the fact

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.950
that we believe in something.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.699
We say, I believe.

00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:44.090
And this is important to me.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.620
And we go out and
we spread that.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.910
I think again we're
not that great on that.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.000
We always present like--
when we talk about it

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.880
we present PowerPoints
and slides.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.050
We keep speaking to that
part of the brain which

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.010
is the intellectual side, not
the part which is about saying,

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.345
here's a social message of cue.

00:32:59.345 --> 00:32:59.970
Do you like me?

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:00.512
I'm like you.

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:01.511
I believe in this stuff.

00:33:01.511 --> 00:33:02.310
You should as well.

00:33:04.194 --> 00:33:06.610
He also says that-- and I think
this is really important--

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:12.290
but in his thinking you don't
suddenly come to-- belief

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.240
develops over time.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.552
But sometimes it moves in
jumps, what in his language

00:33:19.552 --> 00:33:20.635
he would call an epiphany.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.570
Sometimes you see something,
you hear something,

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.537
and suddenly it changes the
way you think about the world.

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:29.120
And I think we need to recognize
that for climate change, too.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.286
But you don't just suddenly--
it's not like osmosis,

00:33:31.286 --> 00:33:33.690
not like you read some
reports that all kind of seeps

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.910
in through your fingertips
as you read them.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.300
You know, like Matt
Murdock, Daredevil,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.892
who was-- because he's a
superhero he could read

00:33:41.892 --> 00:33:43.350
newspapers, just
at his fingertips,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.725
and it all kind
of like flows in.

00:33:44.725 --> 00:33:46.520
But it doesn't work like that.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.610
How it works is that
sometimes you're not sure,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.840
sometimes you are sure.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.600
Sometimes you hear
some inspiring,

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.094
sometimes you read
something, sometimes you

00:33:55.094 --> 00:33:56.010
get caught in a storm.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.301
Sometimes something happens,
and it shifts who you are.

00:33:58.301 --> 00:34:01.410
But you need to recognize that
believing in climate change

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.894
is hard, and it's something
which comes in jumps.

00:34:03.894 --> 00:34:06.310
In his church they even do
something called an altar call,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.860
where they say, here, have
you heard what we said?

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.760
Now's the chance to
change your life.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.340
And we encourage people to
come up and step forward.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.480
I think it's very
important to recognize

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.360
that things like a huge
climate marches which

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.219
have been happening around
the world, a lot of what we're

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.010
trying to do within
the climate movement,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.385
is trying to get people to
have that moment of revelation

00:34:22.385 --> 00:34:23.330
and personal change.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.630
Here is the point when can
really do something new,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.929
think differently about it.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.030
Now, step forward.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.840
Be a part of this.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.679
My view is that things
like the climate march

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:36.260
is most important
not for the fact

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.690
that it had over 300,000
people on the streets,

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.469
but for every one of
those 300,000 people

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.000
it was a transformative moment.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.227
So in other words, it was
most important for them,

00:34:45.227 --> 00:34:47.810
including many people I spoke
to who had never been on a march

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.969
before.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.755
And finally, get learning.

00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:53.630
In this peculiar way we
can learn from people

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.150
we don't normally ever speak to.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.030
Learning from other
people we could

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.462
learn, as Joel said to
me, if you give people

00:34:59.462 --> 00:35:00.920
a heavy moral load,
if you say they

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.850
have to change their lives,
they have to think differently,

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.670
they have to do
things a new way,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.300
you've got to have some
language of forgiveness.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.370
You've got to have the means
to say you can start fresh,

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.570
you can start new.

00:35:13.614 --> 00:35:15.530
And again, I think in
climate change we don't.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.071
And it's no surprise
that people keep

00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:19.200
this stuff at arm's length,
because why would you

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.490
want to take something on
board when it's challenging,

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.750
and it's not clear what's
going to come out of it?

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.286
However, if you can say this
is great this is something

00:35:27.286 --> 00:35:29.660
positive, this is a something
that speaks to your values.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.400
This is something-- where
something new will come out

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.670
of this, which is worthwhile
and worth going for.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.670
And when you come on board,
we start from square one.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.270
I think that is
a language which,

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.120
if it speaks to people's values,
we can really move forward on.

00:35:43.439 --> 00:35:44.855
So thank you very
much for coming.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.900
And indeed we have some
time for questions.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.400
Please.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.090
AUDIENCE: Getting back to the
mayor, you know, with the sign

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:03.640
saying do-- it seems to me
that if we were all doing--

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.480
the problem is really
what we're doing,

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.800
not necessarily
in whether or not

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.070
we believe in climate change.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.480
If we were all doing the things
necessary to avoid climate

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.480
change, it wouldn't
really be that important

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.950
if people knew about
climate change.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:23.434
Now-- so the thing I think it's
probably the most important to

00:36:23.434 --> 00:36:25.850
winning here is to motivate
people to do the right things,

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.284
do what that mayor wants.

00:36:27.284 --> 00:36:28.700
Now it turns out,
different people

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.033
are motivated in different ways.

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:32.270
There may be people who
believe in climate change.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.660
But virtually everything--
but the climate,

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.780
the things we do that cause
climate change are part--

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.286
are part of also--
and primary causes,

00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:42.410
of a lot of other problems.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.240
For instance, I spent
a lot of time-- well,

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.390
it's a very painful
experience, talking

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.395
to people on the far right
about environmental issues.

00:36:52.395 --> 00:36:55.200
And I find that whenever
I mention climate change,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.040
they totally like black out.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.140
They won't even talk about it.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.400
But there are other
things, that the behaviors

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.610
we do that cause of
climate change, that

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.980
really resonate with them.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.870
For instance, monopolies that's
for the oil companies, that

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.540
prevent fuel freedom and
choice at the fuel pump.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.010
The quasi-governmental
organizations

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.300
like utilities that restrict
freedom, by putting constraints

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.730
on how individuals power their
homes, and things like that.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.220
The fact that we're
being prevented

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.580
from using cleaner, cheaper
fuels, and restrictions

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.580
on our freedom,
these things totally

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.420
resonate with those guys.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.160
And it turns out that the
guys on the right-- I mean,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.560
we saw this recently in Georgia.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.970
In Georgia the Sierra
Club now has a partnership

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.440
with the Tea Party to the
force Duke Power to support

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:42.980
more solar.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.410
Sierra Club, left-wing
tree-huggers,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.210
want it cause of climate change.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.600
The Tea Party wants it
because they want freedom

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.470
from the power of the
quasi-governmental

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.950
organization, which
is the utility.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.830
Instead of trying to
convince people of things

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.350
which don't relate
to their issues,

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.265
why don't we respect
their issues,

00:38:04.265 --> 00:38:07.930
as well, get them to
do the same things,

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.055
even though they're for
completely different goals?

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.320
If we can get the
climate deniers

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.770
to do exactly what the
climate acknowledgers want,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.500
do we care whether
or not they're

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.940
both working toward
the same goal,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.030
as long as they're
doing the same things?

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.710
GEORGE MARSHALL: So I
think that's a very--

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.830
I think that's a very-- thank
you, an intelligent, well

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.610
observed comment.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.720
And the question, for
anyone who did not

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.430
hear that, if I can
paraphrase it is to say,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.090
do we have to talk
about climate change,

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.329
if we can find ways
of mobilizing people

00:38:45.329 --> 00:38:47.370
in terms of their own
values, to do the things we

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.920
need to do to take action on it?

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.710
If climate change
is this toxic issue,

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.320
can we step around that,
because there are so

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.240
many things that could be done
to move in the right direction.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.430
And I think that the answer
to that is very important.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:05.417
And yes, for what you've
described, for people,

00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:07.250
especially for people
on the right-- and too

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.380
have spent a lot of time
speaking with conservatives--

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.030
there are many things where
there are opportunities

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.150
to change the
structure of society,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.120
especially the kind of
corporate dominance of society,

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.240
to change people's lives.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.985
People-- conservatives
often also

00:39:23.985 --> 00:39:26.180
are strongly ideologically
opposed to waste,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.662
and waste seems like a very
positive place to start.

00:39:28.662 --> 00:39:30.620
They're also very interested
in new investment,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.980
and new opportunities, too.

00:39:32.761 --> 00:39:35.010
And there's ways for things
like with renewables, too,

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.235
where you can create very
powerful social norms

00:39:37.235 --> 00:39:37.735
of action.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.877
If people start installing,
for example, renewables,

00:39:41.877 --> 00:39:44.210
it is interesting that it's
something that conservatives

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.480
are often very, very
interested in doing,

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.021
of having solar
panels on their roof,

00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:50.270
for example, as a way to
show personal success,

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.146
or it's a nice thing.

00:39:51.146 --> 00:39:53.644
Well, it's nice if solar panels
are not about losing things.

00:39:53.644 --> 00:39:54.627
It's about gaining.

00:39:54.627 --> 00:39:56.710
You gain a bit of money,
you gain a bit of status,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.660
and it looks good.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.410
And I think the answer for
that is absolutely yes.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.900
We can shape climate change
around people's values.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.860
We certainly don't
need to talk about this

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.540
as an environmental issue.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.180
I mean, it's been
a huge mistake.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.650
This is about resources,
it's about power,

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.500
it's about the future,
it's about morality,

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.416
it's about the way we
want to shape the world.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.450
The environmental
label only came to it

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.030
because the first people
to come to the party

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.988
were environmentalists.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.690
We can reshape it
in different ways.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:31.240
However we have to recognize
at some point that it cannot be

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.570
simply dealt with by a composite
of a number of things doing

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.260
the right thing.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.910
We simply cannot deal with
like a little 10% energy saving

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.990
there, and more efficient
air conditioning there,

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.070
and change for
light bulbs there.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.400
And we also know we cannot
achieve the bottom lines we

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.760
need in terms of change, but
we also know that people have

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.670
a disturbance and unnerving
tendency to transfer

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.710
their behavior from
one place to another.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.850
So people who fit low
energy light bulbs

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.265
have a very strange tendency to
drive more, or use more water.

00:41:03.111 --> 00:41:04.610
It's sometimes
called moral license,

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.970
it's for capacity for
people to use one thing

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.890
as a personal offset for
another form of behavior.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.010
So we have to have
something underlying

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.370
where we say actually that
there's a bigger goal here.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:17.090
And what worries me about not
talking about climate change

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.300
is we have to
ultimately get some kind

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.170
of overarching structure,
even if it operates

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.730
in the free market,
even if it's just

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.010
a cap on the amount of
stuff that we can use.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.810
And if we do not get enough
people engaged with the issue

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.640
to accept it or
believe in it, we

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.030
will never have enough political
consensus to put that in place.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.842
So I absolutely
agree with you, but I

00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:39.050
think there has to be a
level at which we're up front

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.110
and say, yes, this is important.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.410
But we can reach that
from different paths.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:46.150
And I like the idea of people,
conservatives and conservatives

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.280
the absolute priority, we have
to get something broader based

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.520
on this, coming at this
from a very different angle,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.540
saying we want to make these
changes and do these changes,

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.030
because it speaks to our values.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.300
And we don't give a
damn about polar bears.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.650
Our concern is about our
community, our locality,

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.765
or our landscape, our property.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.590
So there are ways
of reshaping this.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.600
Other questions, please.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.676
Yeah, please, sir.

00:42:09.676 --> 00:42:11.570
AUDIENCE: Do you think
climate deniers are

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:16.180
more common in the US than
in Europe, and if so, why?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.990
GEORGE MARSHALL: Yes, the
percentage of people in the US

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.980
who-- deny is a difficult word.

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:26.020
Can I just say, before
we even go into it,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.900
there's denial at all
levels In the more sort

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.430
of common
psycho-therapeutic sense,

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.230
there is denial
across the board.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.450
There are ways I'm in
denial about climate change.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.552
There are ways that I
actively seek to defend myself

00:42:43.552 --> 00:42:46.010
against the full knowledge of
what is happening by creating

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.470
personal psychological
distance from it.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.987
Or weird inconsistencies
in my own behavior.

00:42:51.987 --> 00:42:54.070
Just as that was the
beginning of my presentation.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.510
That's maybe small-d denial.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.380
But rather than going
out there and labeling

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.930
the people who do not
accept the science,

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.513
and say they're the
deniers, and we're

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.710
he whatever, the
believers, let's

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.450
recognize that right
across the board

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.700
you have a range of
people who are trying

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.370
to make sense of this issue.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.870
I personally sometimes
think there's

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.175
more hope of getting the people
who actively oppose action

00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:15.660
on climate change
to swing around

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.229
than the people in the middle.

00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:19.395
Just as sometimes people
can have sudden conversions

00:43:19.395 --> 00:43:21.034
from one political
position to another.

00:43:21.034 --> 00:43:22.450
But they're engaging
in the issue,

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.270
and thinking actively about it.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.380
Having said that, then,
if we just keep that word

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.430
denier for the moment, but
recognizing it's much broader--

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.510
is there a higher level of
concern or awareness in Europe

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.760
than there is in America?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.770
Yes.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.510
Are there more
people in America who

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:42.760
actively oppose the
silence than Europe?

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.260
Yes, there is.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.250
But that also reflects,
I think, a much greater

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.870
political polarization in the
States between left and right

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.980
than you tend to find in Europe.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.220
Europe is mostly dominated
by social democratic parties,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.300
which occupy the middle ground.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.179
In the US, actually
to be honest,

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:01.720
I think that's probably where
the Democrats are as the Social

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.590
Democratic Party.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.470
There is no functioning
left in the same way

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.065
that there is maybe
in Europe, but there

00:44:07.065 --> 00:44:10.180
is a huge divide between
them and the right.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.920
And I'm always amazed
in America by how

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.950
opinionated people
on both sides get,

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.250
in terms of their
opposition to the other.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.409
It's extremely polarized.

00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:19.950
And of course, then
that makes people

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.533
decide that they
want to choose sides.

00:44:21.533 --> 00:44:23.360
Are you with them,
or are you with them?

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.700
That polarization then
becomes self feeding.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.755
If you sense that the
people around you who

00:44:27.755 --> 00:44:29.520
are conservatives, for
example, around you

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.010
do not accept
climate change, you

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.460
are then much more likely to
get sucked over to that side.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.270
But do not think that there
is something significantly

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.540
different happening there.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.940
The political and the
media landscape in America,

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.890
and the cultural landscape
and the divides--

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.190
it's a huge country between
the center of the country,

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.610
between the rural
and the urban-- all

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.900
help to feed all of this.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.960
But in Europe we
have similar divides,

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.880
and they are maybe less
marked, because we're

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.697
less polarized as a society.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:00.780
But they're getting worse.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.150
Right across Europe
we have the emergence

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.000
of an extreme right, which
is happening especially

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.660
around migration issues.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.980
But one of the marks of
the extreme right in Europe

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.030
is they do not accept
climate change.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.760
What worries me is
when denial-- let's

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.160
call it that, outright
denial, saying I do not,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.170
I do not accept the
science, becomes

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.860
a mark of people's
political identities.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.100
So it's not just another
attitude they have,

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.780
but to be right wing you
have to deny climate change.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.210
My worry is that that's where
America's already reached.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:37.310
We know that it is now
a stronger prediction--

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.810
people's position
on climate change

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.174
is a stronger prediction
of their politics

00:45:41.174 --> 00:45:42.715
than their position
on birth control,

00:45:42.715 --> 00:45:47.980
or their position on
abortion, or gun control,

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.697
or capital punishment.

00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:51.530
That's to say that more
conservatives do not

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.560
accept climate change
than they follow

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.100
party line on
those other issues.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.517
That means it's now
become a mark of identity.

00:46:00.517 --> 00:46:02.391
You're a conservative,
you don't accept this.

00:46:02.391 --> 00:46:04.900
And my worry is we're seeing
the same pattern in Europe.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.520
So it's vital that
we find new ways

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:10.310
of talking which bring
in this other group.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.590
Please, sir.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.090
AUDIENCE: So I find the
hardest aspect of this

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.590
to be the sacrifice aspect.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.840
I mean, in terms of my
experiences and conversations

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.200
with people, if I
talk to somebody

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.610
and even if they're fully
on board with climate change

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.110
and the conversations
typically goes

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.800
to how are we going to generate
more energy, cleaner energy.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.390
It's never how can we cut back.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.050
Jared Diamond was
here, and I asked

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:41.710
him am I going to have to give
up my massive data centers

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.650
to solve this, cause
that's how I have my fun.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.330
And he said no, we
just to make America

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.650
more like Europe, which I
thought was a strange answer.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.650
And I think about this, and
I feel like-- so right now

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.070
we have a situation where in
countries like China and India

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.140
they're racing as
fast as they can

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.730
to increase their
consumption, because they're

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.980
developing economically.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.640
They have very rapidly
growing middle classes,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.990
and they're saying finally, we
can have the kind of lifestyle

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.550
that people in the West have,
like why can they have these

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.070
nice lifestyles, and we can't?

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.150
Lifting out of
poverty, basically.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.460
And the thought is
like if I'm going

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.066
to start making sacrifices,
or if some group is going

00:47:21.066 --> 00:47:24.930
to start making sacrifices,
it's going to feel unfair

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.750
if not everyone on
the planet is making

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.037
the same sacrifices
simultaneously.

00:47:30.037 --> 00:47:31.495
And I feel like
that's an obstacle.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.400
GEORGE MARSHALL: So the question
there was one of sacrifices,

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.750
and how do we deal with that.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.420
Are sacrifices innate in
the issue of climate change,

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.337
and also how do we message that?

00:47:42.337 --> 00:47:43.295
How do we deal with it?

00:47:43.295 --> 00:47:46.520
You yourself are saying you
feel uncomfortable with it.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.010
Of course, then there's the
issue of recently developing

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.630
countries, especially
countries like India and China,

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.530
where some people are for
the first time in their lives

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:59.170
having their most
basic needs met.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.140
I agree.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.290
I think, however,
we need to recognize

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.517
that the language of sacrifice
or the narrative of sacrifice

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:10.350
is in some ways
created around this.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.390
I think there are ways that we
can meet a lot of our material

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:17.010
needs at a very, very
much lower impact.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.790
And it's not just like a matter
of being more like Europe.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.940
It's a matter
recognizing that there

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.209
are ways that we can live
which are more rewarding.

00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:26.500
I think the idea of sacrifice
is the idea of ultimately

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.230
giving something away.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.400
I think the language
which is more powerful

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.830
is the one of regaining
something that we have lost.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.240
People are very
disconnected socially.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.960
There is a strong connection
between high carbon societies

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.370
and the destruction of society,
the dislocation, the way

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.490
that people just cover
huge distances sitting

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.240
in their own cars.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.830
I realize there's a problem in
that American society is now

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.730
built and constructed
around hypermobility.

00:48:53.914 --> 00:48:56.330
But I think there are very
encouraging signs, for example,

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.080
in the way that people
are re-inhabiting

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.560
the center of cities, the way
that for the first time ever,

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.750
demand for vehicles
and for transportation

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.780
mobility amongst young
people is falling.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.830
Not falling because
of money, although we

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.210
know that they are
hard times for people,

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.960
but also falling for
just simple demand.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.840
People are wondering, do I
really need to have this stuff,

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.550
and be locked into this,
or are there other ways

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.216
that I can live?

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:26.570
When we talk about where we
need to get to, on many indices,

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.500
especially in
terms of transport,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.100
we would be most of a way
towards a low carbon society

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.480
if we introduced
new technologies

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.965
and we lived at the level
that we lived at in the '70s.

00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:40.930
Well, I was around in the '70s.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:41.980
And you know what, it was fine.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.260
I'll tell you one thing
interesting about the 70s,

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.930
was that actually
that was the time when

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:52.040
right across the Western world
personal happiness peaked,

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.830
was in the first five
years of the '70s.

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.250
That was a time when people
had a combination of having

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:01.450
their lifestyle met,
their needs met,

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.570
having holidays,
having fun things,

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.780
having toys, having
decent houses,

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.950
having jobs-- which let's
face it, is important.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.570
There are other things
which meet people's needs.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.190
But at the same time,
having community,

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.814
having society, having family,
having knowing the people

00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:17.480
on their street.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.850
And we've lost a lot of that.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.745
But I wouldn't say that
this isn't a problem,

00:50:21.745 --> 00:50:24.245
and I also definitely wouldn't
say that we should in any way

00:50:24.245 --> 00:50:26.590
be thinking about denying
the other people in the world

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.529
a chance to develop.

00:50:27.529 --> 00:50:29.070
And given that we're
doing that, that

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.940
means we're going
to have to do more.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.400
Indeed, it's a conundrum.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.571
I think ultimately
the only way we're

00:50:34.571 --> 00:50:36.320
going to move forward
on this-- and again,

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.480
going back to the
previous question--

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.646
is we're going to have to
believe that it is vitally

00:50:39.646 --> 00:50:42.150
important for our survival
that we let go of some stuff.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.210
And that's going to be painful.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:44.835
And we're going to
have to grieve that.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.320
It's not as if it's
going to plain sailing.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.350
And we're going
to have to grieve

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.660
the loss of the
fossil fuel age, too,

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.701
because we're going to
have to walk away from it.

00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:54.830
And there's things in
there which are really fun.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.340
There are things in there
which have been really fun,

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.390
it's been a great party.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.330
Let's recognize that.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.850
Also, let's recognize
that we can't do it.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.230
Could I have a question
from anybody else?

00:51:08.361 --> 00:51:09.300
No, OK, please.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.320
And then that's
the last question.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:10.819
Thank you.

00:51:13.269 --> 00:51:14.810
AUDIENCE: Just a
bit of an objection.

00:51:16.092 --> 00:51:18.452
Maybe in terms of
a question that you

00:51:18.452 --> 00:51:21.290
can explain why you do it.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.790
The reality is that
the vast majority

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.200
of things that we need to do in
order to prevent climate change

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.112
are profitable.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:35.219
It seems to be
bizarre that those

00:51:35.219 --> 00:51:36.760
who support climate
change constantly

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.620
focus on the subject of
sacrifice, when in fact they

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.960
should be talking about profit,
and the things that prevent us

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.335
from accomplishing
these profits.

00:51:46.335 --> 00:51:48.625
Give an example, here
in New York City, one

00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:52.400
of the largest and
cheapest efforts

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.990
to mitigate climate impact
is our clean heat program

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.460
I helped on, where
we went and we

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.480
banned the use of number
six fuel oil in the city.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.770
By doing so we've reduced by
over a million tons per year

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.930
the amount of CO2 that's
being emitted, and enough

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:14.030
PM 2.5 emissions,
so that according

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.320
to the Department
of Health we've

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.710
reduced the mortality rate
in the city by 700 to 800

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:21.220
per year.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.720
And that's in a program
that had been going on

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.275
for a four to five year period.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.580
The way we accomplished
it was by modeling

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.600
out the alternative
fuels, basically

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.160
number six versus
number two, natural gas,

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.325
et cetera, for the
buildings in the city.

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.700
We went to the
mayor and we said,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.632
mayor, if you force
these buildings--

00:52:44.632 --> 00:52:46.090
and there are only
10,000 of them--

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.650
if you force these buildings
to stop using number six,

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.450
they will all end
up saving money.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.360
We went and we did the
environmentally responsible

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.360
thing, the thing that's
good for climate change,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.400
and the way we justified it
was by pointing out to people,

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.560
educating them and showing
that they would not only

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.060
have a cleaner
environment, but they

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.210
would save money if they did it.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:11.220
Now that is the case
almost across the board.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.380
Why in God's name do the
climate change guys constantly

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.980
talking about sacrifice,
when it's a heck of a lot

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:21.625
more motivating to tell people
there's a ton of money to be

00:53:21.625 --> 00:53:23.750
made out there, there's a
ton of money to be saved?

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.583
You can not only have
a cleaner environment,

00:53:25.583 --> 00:53:27.980
but you can have a cheaper
environment, more jobs,

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.610
better economy, et cetera.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.434
GEORGE MARSHALL:
Well, there are a lot

00:53:31.434 --> 00:53:32.850
of people saying
different things,

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.830
and there are
people like yourself

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.360
who are saying exactly that.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.440
There's opportunities
and jobs, there's

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.992
opportunities and profit.

00:53:38.992 --> 00:53:41.200
They are, of course, people
who are environmentalists

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.658
who are saying
something different,

00:53:42.658 --> 00:53:45.610
and that is because from
their world view-- which

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:49.140
I have to say, in many ways I
share those politics-- we are

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.540
skeptical of economic
growth, and we are skeptical,

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.790
I think, with good reason,
about whether in the absence

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:59.286
of any cap on our own
behavior, either here

00:53:59.286 --> 00:54:01.160
in the developed world,
or around the world--

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.060
we should be saying things
can be entirely motivated

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:04.970
by profit.

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:07.220
Because there's going to be
tendency to just do things

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.700
more efficiently, and
still have more of them.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.010
But I agree, that the
profit opportunities

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.129
are very, very important.

00:54:15.129 --> 00:54:17.170
I think that there's
rewards there at all levels.

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.040
If I was speaking now to a
room full of business people,

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.730
I would probably
be stressing that.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.150
That would be their values.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.220
And I think the obvious
answer to question

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.310
is why do some of the
environmental campaigners

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:30.470
or climate change campaigners
not talk about it?

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:32.436
Because it's not their values.

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:34.810
As I said, climate change is
created around the narrative

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.020
that we make of it.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.470
But it can be any
of those things.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.550
There's no individual ownership.

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.883
There's nothing which says
climate change is this thing.

00:54:40.883 --> 00:54:42.820
Climate change can be
an opportunity for jobs.

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.480
Climate change can
be an opportunity

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.550
for a new kind of morality,
if you're that way concerned.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.610
It can be a way
of building faith,

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:50.860
and it can be a way of profit.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.943
It can be a way of growth.

00:54:51.943 --> 00:54:53.200
It can be those things.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.757
So I entirely agree with you.

00:54:54.757 --> 00:54:56.590
There is no rule that
says you talk about it

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:57.280
one way or another.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.822
And I think maybe in a way what
you've shown there is exactly

00:54:59.822 --> 00:55:01.905
the issue, which is that
people respond to the way

00:55:01.905 --> 00:55:03.810
that the thing is
discussed and talked about,

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.010
sometimes more often than
actually the core science.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.940
I'm going to close down now if
I may, but thank you so much.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.990
Thank you.
