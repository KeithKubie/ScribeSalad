00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.187
When x = 2, 8x squared + 9 = 41.

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:09.000
This is pretty tricky, especially
if you're relying on a calculator.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.450
So it's really important that
you write out every step.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.570
When we evaluate the expression,
we replace x with -2,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.820
and the expression becomes
8 * (-2) squared, + 9.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.760
Remembering the order of operations,
we should evaluate the exponent first.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.785
(-2) squared = -2 * -2,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.085
which is positive 4.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:45.190
Our new expression becomes 8 * (4) + 9.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.692
Next we multiply 8 *
4 which gives us 32.

00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:54.546
Our new expression becomes 32 + 9.

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.961
32 + 9 = 41
