Google cast is all about
enabling multi-screen

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.980
experiences for the living room.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
It uses a sender/receiver
topology that works like this.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.790
You already have an app on Android,
iOS, or the web.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.300
That's your sender.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.080
You start by integrating the cast SDK

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.640
to enable discovery of cast
devices on the local network.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.420
When your app finds a nearby device,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.440
it makes the cast icon
visible to your users.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.210
This nearby cast device could be
a Chromecast or even an AndroidTV.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.729
It's the receiver.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.680
The user will touch the cast
icon on the sender and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.770
select the cast device to send or
cast stuff to the big screen.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.550
What's actually happening here is
the sender's telling the cast device

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720
to load a particular
receiver application.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.880
The Cast device then pulls that in from
the web since it's just an HTML 5 app

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.550
written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.480
It could be a simple media receiver that
plays a stream directly from the cloud,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.300
or a custom receiver such as a game.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.230
You can also send messages from your app

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.210
to the receiver app to control things
like play, pause, volume and more.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.160
And that's it.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.990
A quick and
simple overview of Google Cast.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.840
We'll cover more detail in
the Google Cast STK and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.520
receiver apps a little later on.
