00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.440
It seems at first weird that we might learn from Thomas Aquinas.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.480
He was a medieval saint, who was reputed to have levitated

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.360
and had visions of the Virgin Mary.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.540
He was much concerned with explaining how angels speak and move.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.040
And yet, he continues to matter because he helps us with the problem

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.400
which continues to bedevil us:

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.620
how we can reconcile religion with science,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.640
and faith with reason.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.120
Aquinas was both a philosopher and a saint.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.960
Refusing either to lose his faith or mindlessly believe,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.040
he developed a new understanding of the place of reason in human life.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.560
Aquinas's monumental contribution was to teach Western Europeans civilisation

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.820
that any human being, not just a Christian,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.620
could have access to great truths, whenever they made use of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.660
God's greatest gift to human beings: reason.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.820
Aquinas broke a logjam in Christian thinking -

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720
the question of non-Christians could have both wisdom

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.640
and at the same time, no interest in or even knowledge of Jesus.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.020
Aquinas universalised intelligence.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.340
He opened the Christian minds to the insights of all of humanity

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.600
from across the ages and the continents.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.340
The modern world, insofar as it insists that good ideas can come from any quarter,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.060
regardless of creed or background, remains hugely in Aquinas' debt.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.760
Thomas Aquinas was born to a noble family in Italy in 1225.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.080
As a young man, he went to study at the University of Naples

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.640
and there came into contact with a source of knowledge which had just then been rediscovered -

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.260
the texts of ancient Greek and Roman authors.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.040
Aquinas then became an academic at the University of Paris

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.320
and an exceptionally prolific writer,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.940
producing nearly 200 pieces about Christian theology

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.840
in less than three decades.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.900
His books bear beautiful and strange titles,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.940
like the Summa Theologica,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.460
and Summa Contra Gentiles.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.640
Such was his devotion to knowledge

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.520
even at the moment of his death at the age of 49,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.900
Aquinas was reputed to have been in the middle of writing an extended commentary

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.500
on the Song of Songs.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.140
After he died, he was canonised in the Catholic church

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.920
and he is now the "patron saint of teachers".

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.280
Aquinas's starting point was that some of the world's greatest thinkers

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.020
have not been Christian,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.200
but this didn't bar them from having huge insights,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.700
because, as Aquinas proposed, the world can be usefully explored

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.060
through reasons and not just through faith.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.000
To explain how this could work,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.080
Aquinas brilliantly proposed that universe and all its dynamics

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.780
operate according to two kinds of law

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.760
For Aquinas, a lot of the world follows natural laws.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.980
We can find out for ourselves how to smelt iron,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.800
build an aqueduct, or organise an economy.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.140
And none of these relies on believing in God.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.780
Aquinas discussed Jesus is in junction to

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.420
Jesus may have given this idea a particular memorable formulation,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.020
considered Aquinas,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.020
but it's in fact been a cornerstone of moral principles

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.100
in most societies at most times.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.600
How could this be possible?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.000
Well, the reason, Aquinas argued,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.320
is that it's an idea that belongs to natural and not eternal law.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.980
Aquinas considered that in a few situations

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.720
God does works simply through eternal law,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.440
outside of human reason.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.060
And he cited prophetic revelations and the visits of angels as examples.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.440
However, he reassured us the most useful knowledge

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.000
can be found by atheists and secular-minded people

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.420
within the realm of natural law.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.480
Aquinas's ideas unfolded at a time when Islamic culture

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.600
was going through very similar dilemmas as Christianity

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.060
in terms of how one can reconcile reason and faith.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.880
For a long time the Islamic caliphates in Spain, Morocco and Egypt

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.280
had flourished by being open to knowledge from all over the world,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.520
generating a wealth of new scientific ideas and philosophy.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.620
However, due to the increasing influence of fanatical religious leaders,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.460
Islam had become more dogmatic and oppressive by the time Aquinas was born.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.940
It had, for example, reacted violently against the Muslim philosopher Averroes.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.780
Like Aquinas, Averroes's been deeply influenced by Aristotle,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.380
and had argued that reason and religion could be compatible.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.500
However, the caliphates, anxious never to depart from the literal words of God,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.300
made sure that Averroes's ideas would be banned

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.340
and his books burned.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.140
Aquinas knew that the Muslim world's increasingly radical rejection of reason

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.000
was harming what had once been its thriving intellectual culture.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.140
And it was overwhelmingly thanks to Aquinas's ideas

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.280
that Christianity did not suffer the same process of stultification.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.280
Though Aquinas was a man of deep faith,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.280
he provided a philosophical framework for open scientific inquiry.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.700
He reminds us that knowledge can and should come from multiple sources,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.540
from intuition but also from rationality,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.120
from science but also from revelation,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.540
from pagans but also from monks,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.460
that sounds obvious, until we notice just how often

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.560
civilisation has been and is still being harmed by people's refusal

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.900
to take this brilliant idea on board.
