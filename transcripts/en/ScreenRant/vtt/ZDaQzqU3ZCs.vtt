00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.950
Shared universes are all the rage these days
and have become the norm for major film studios.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.720
Whether it’s Marvel, DC, or Star Wars, interconnectivity
is the name of the game in Hollywood.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.520
While these are the most obvious examples
of the phenomenon, they may not have been

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.940
the first of its kind.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.820
Filmmakers have seemingly been toying with
shared universes for years, though being far

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.860
subtler with the process than studios are
today.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.840
You may never look at one of your favorite
films the same way again.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.620
Here are 10 movies you had no idea share the
same universe.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.629
Star Wars and Indiana Jones

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.269
Star Wars could share a universe with its
Lucasfilm brethren, Indiana Jones.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.579
The series includes some minor references
to the saga, such as Club Obi-Wan in The Temple

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.600
of Doom and hieroglyphics of R2-D2 and C-3PO
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.339
One fan proposes that the aliens from Kingdom
of the Crystal Skull visited Earth long ago

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.930
and shared the story of Star Wars by engraving
imagery on the walls of structures.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.990
Another theory says that Indiana Jones is
just an elaborate dream of Han Solo’s while

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.810
he’s frozen in carbonite.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.320
Take whichever you want, but there’s no
denying either would be interesting if true.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.450
Out of Sight and Jackie Brown

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.869
By now, viewers are familiar with the Quentin
Tarantino universe, but did you know it includes

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.159
films Tarantino wasn’t involved with at
all?

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.140
Steven Soderbergh’s sleek crime caper Out
of Sight takes place in the same universe

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.090
as Tarantino’s Jackie Brown.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.469
Both movies are based on novels by Elmore
Leonard and share one specific character that

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.100
serves as the glue between them.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.729
Michael Keaton portrays Ray Nicolette in the
two projects, confirming a connection.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.229
What makes this even more impressive is that
Out of Sight and Jackie Brown were released

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.909
by separate studios, so they must have had
good humor about it.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.719
Blade Runner and Alien

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.990
Ridley Scott redefined the sci-fi genre with
these two classics, which both feature android

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.990
characters.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.010
That could be more of a coincidence, thanks
to an Easter egg found on the Prometheus DVD.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.300
Showing a message from Peter Weyland of the
Weyland corporation, it describes a discussion

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.380
Weyland had with a mentor or competitor who
seems to fit the bill of Blade Runner’s

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.980
Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.130
The note talks about a man with a God complex
who watched his creations “blow up in his

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.000
face,” which is essentially the fate of
Tyrell, who was killed by one of his replicants.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.160
Could we see a xenomorph in Blade Runner 2?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.940
Only time will tell.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.640
Star Trek and Sherlock Holmes

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.580
Spock and Sherlock Holmes are two of the most
logically thinking characters in all of pop

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.560
culture, so it would only make sense if the
two were related.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.010
One theory suggests that Spock is a descendant
of the renowned detective.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.810
In Star Trek 6, Spock mentions that an ancestor
of his said that when you eliminate the impossible,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.280
whatever remains, however improbable, must
be the truth.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.840
That quote is typically attributed to Mr.
Holmes, implying a familial connection between

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.730
the Vulcan and the Englishman.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.870
Spock is half-human, after all, so this one
adds up.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.720
The Rock and James Bond

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.700
Michael Bay loves action, and he may have
found a way to include one of the most famous

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.750
action heroes in his film The Rock.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.090
Many believe that Sean Connery’s character
John Mason is an aged 007.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.470
Mason is described as a highly-trained British
operative who has no identity and for all

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.090
purposes, does not exist, which certainly
sounds like an MI6 agent.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.960
Connery even does a parody of his Diamonds
are Forever one-liner when he first meets

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.560
Nic Cage’s Stanley Goodspeed, so the two
characters have the same sense of humor.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.710
It seems too good to be true, but those who
enjoyed Connery’s run as Bond got one more

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.180
film.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.690
Spy Kids and Machete

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.560
These two films seemingly don’t have much
in common, but there are some strong connections

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560
between them.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.900
Namely, Danny Trejo plays the same character
in both movies.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.470
In Spy Kids, he’s the uncle of the young
protagonists and brother of Antonio Banderas’

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.470
character.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.600
Robert Rodriguez, who directed Spy Kids and
Machete, felt that Trejo should be a Mexican

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.690
Jean-Claude Van Damme and be in a movie of
his every year.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.070
The first opportunity that arose was Spy Kids,
and the rest was history.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.590
Here’s a shared universe with something
for children and adults, proving that you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.060
can blend extremely varying tones between
installments.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.459
Daredevil and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.310
All of these protectors of New York were created
by the same accident.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.980
After Matt Murdock was blinded by acid from
a truck, the future heroes in a half shell

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.870
living under a sewer were the next to receive
super powers.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.200
Acid leftover from the crash leaked into the
sewer, giving birth to the Ninja Turtles.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.690
Since the properties are owned by different
studios, it doesn’t seem likely they’ll

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.410
ever crossover on the big screen, so this
small connection is all fans will have to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.410
work with for now.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.140
Though, it would be a lot of fun to see Tony
Stark trading quips with Michelangelo.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.140
The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.470
These two masked heroes have a lot more in
common than fighting injustice.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.310
They’re actually relatives.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.820
Though the films can’t make any mention
of this fact now due to rights restrictions,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.980
the Green Hornet is actually the great-nephew
of the Lone Ranger.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.260
When the radio programs were popular, they
both shared a character: Dan Reid.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.653
Dan was the Lone Ranger’s nephew and would
go on to become Britt Reid’s – a.k.a.

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:09.260
the Green Hornet – father.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.130
This means that through the latest films,
Seth Rogen is a descendant of Armie Hammer,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.570
a strange proposition if there ever was one.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.410
Inception and The Matrix

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.140
These two sci-fi titles are known for throwing
audiences for a loop.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.140
Here’s one more.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.530
A theory states Inception is actually a prequel
to The Matrix.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.930
The biggest piece of evidence comes in the
form of Robert Fischer, who after being incepted,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.510
decides to break up his father’s empire
and forge his own path.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.030
Evidently, that meant solar energy, which
would be the source the machines used later

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.030
on.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.450
The theory also suggests that the dream machine
in Inception is a beta version of the Matrix

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.690
plug in and that the bullet time is a variation
of Inception’s concept of time, where activities

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050
in the dream world take longer than in reality.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.170
It’s very interesting and would make for
an entertaining crossover.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.560
Star Wars and E.T.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.060
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are longtime
friends, and that relationship led to a couple

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.530
of great Easter eggs in their films.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.380
In Spielberg’s E.T., the titular alien encounters
a kid dressed as Yoda for Halloween, identifying

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.320
the child as a sign from “home.”

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.340
Many years later, Lucas returned the favor.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.500
In one of The Phantom Menace’s Senate chamber
scenes, there are three creatures that strongly

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.570
resemble E.T. in one of the pods.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.280
Elliot’s companion apparently calls the
galaxy far, far away home.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.500
Perhaps he’s strong with the Force, and
that’s why he can lift bikes with his mind.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.990
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.610
Which hidden shared universes are your favorites?

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.340
