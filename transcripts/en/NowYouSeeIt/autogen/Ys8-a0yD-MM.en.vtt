00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.860
 Come to be a psychological test 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.320
 We let the audience see the scene composed of eight shots. 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.300
 The story is about suspicion and a little bit of confusion. 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.740
 Let the audience go to the comments 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.280
 A girl in his apartment has a suspicious unidentified man passing his window 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.840
 She went out to figure out what was going on. 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.460
 After the play, we asked the audience 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.140
 Several open questions 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.480
 Listen to their opinions 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.100
 What do you feel? Like it? 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
 Still don't like it? Problem like 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.240
 We show the same movie to another group of viewers. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.520
 The only difference is 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.660
 Each lens is left and right opposite 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.240
 So the left-to-right motion has changed from right to left. 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.920
 What we want to ask is, what does such an editor change? 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700
 Does the direction of the character affect the viewer's perception of the character? 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.280
 Or does it affect the audience's perception of the whole show? 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.620
 The answer is "will" and the impact is bigger than you think. 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 But why does walking direction affect it? 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.340
 In order to understand the importance of direction change 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.060
 We must understand the axes of the three movements 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.460
 The characters on the screen can be moved in three directions. 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.060
 Left and right, up and down, and before and after 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.880
 The direction in which the character moves, which is associated with the scene. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.800
 Moving to the front of the camera shows his strength, dominance, and aggressiveness. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 Far from the lens, it shows weakness 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.860
 The same reasoning role looks down on behalf of the weak 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.080
 Looking up, it looks high 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.800
 "Now, my evil power will never stop!" 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.940
 "Is it felt?" 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.060
 "I feel that." 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 "呜~" 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 These two explanations have its truth 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.540
 Of course, someone goes down and away from the lens 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.340
 The angle of observation with someone up and close to the lens is different 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.200
 [child scream] 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.760
 [Monsters also start to scream] 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.040
 But the last action moves laterally 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.440
 Running from the right to the left is not so obvious. 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.100
 What is the difference between the left and the right? 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.720
 Why is it important from right to left? 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.140
 The answer lies in "time" and "language" 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.260
 In Western culture, from left to right symbolizes the direction of travel 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.920
 Our language reading is also from left to right 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.940
 Reading starts from the left and ends when we read to the right 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.720
 In video games, the character starts on the left 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 The level ends on the right 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.420
 Any line chart, go to the right time 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 In daily life, almost all towards the right 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.720
 Symbolizes time, progress, normality 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.360
 And the action to the left symbolizes going back to the past. 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.960
 Symbolizes anomalies and degradation 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.360
 This idea can be seen in the theory of film. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.380
 Left to right movements in the eyes of people 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.700
 More natural and normal than right to left 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.820
 Because our brain processes images naturally from left to right 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.920
 Actions from left to right, symbolizing time and normal ideas are heavily used in movies 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 In a variety of movies 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.460
 For example, "The Lord of the Rings" always keeps the action from left to right. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.860
 The journey from the Shire to the Doomsday volcano 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.680
 All are left-right moving lenses 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.200
 Using the screen to point out their goals without knowing it 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.000
 Reach a specific location 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.100
 Take the clear goal of "The Lord of the Rings" compared to the last scene of the "Golden Armor" 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.240
 This scene consists of two shots 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.220
 The first shot is the soldiers walking in front of the burned house, from left to right 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.440
 The second shot is from right to left. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 The background is still a burning house 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.080
 Suddenly changing the side direction 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 Make people feel like they are changing direction at will 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.780
 Implying that the soldiers are just arbitrarily arbitrarily aimless 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.080
 Stanley Kubrick uses the direction of the direction to express his ideas 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.280
 Point out that the military does not have a clear goal 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.780
 Perhaps this is his comment on the entire Vietnam War. 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.340
 The horizontal movement of the character can also tell the situation 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.900
 In a scene of the "Golden Armor", the soldiers moved to the right 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.020
 Moving toward the battle zone outside the picture 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.580
 At the same time, the wounded soldier was brought back from the battle area. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.040
 From right to left 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 The reinforcements here suggest 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.380
 Soldiers go to the place outside the screen 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.320
 It is the place where the wounded soldier was carried back. 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.040
 "King Khmer" and "Rescuing Rennes" also used the same lateral movement technique. 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 [background music, fuzzy conversation] 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.080
 "Weide!" "Yes!" 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.760
 "Look at what you can do?" "Report is" 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.800
 So, from left to right, people feel positive and progressive, normal 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.940
 At least that is the assumption of most film theorists. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.660
 It’s only about five years ago that this is the case. 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.460
 Researchers began to move laterally from empirical surveys 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.660
 In 2012, Cleveland State University did an experiment 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.220
 By giving people a continuous shot of eight shots 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.540
 They show the same movie to another group of people 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.660
 But all left-to-right actions are changed from right to left. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.840
 Each group answers a few detailed questions 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.880
 There are also some open questions like how they feel after reading. 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.440
 The results confirm the hypothesis of many film theorists 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440
 But there is always no more reliable evidence to prove 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.940
 The key to this experiment is to analyze the answers to open questions. 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.580
 For example, 24.8% of people answered "anxiety", "tension", "uneasy" and "doubt" 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.500
 Describe his feelings about the film 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.600
 11.9% of people answered "fear", "fear" and "fright" 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.740
 The biggest difference between the two groups is that 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.160
 There is a discourse that the experimenter calls "negative influence" 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.500
 Similar answers include "Don't like editing" "Like editing" "Feel good" "Feel bad" "Fun" "boring" 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.680
 "Strong" and "weak" These are the answers to the two films. 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.160
 Most different words 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.180
 For the "left to right" film people always use like 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.880
 "good", "fun", "strong" words 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.020
 However, people who look from right to left will use words like "bad", "boring" and "cowardly". 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.720
 The viewer’s view of the action from left to right is positive and vice versa. 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.480
 This research is a great opportunity for filmmakers. 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.020
 Simply change the direction of the character's movement 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.100
 The director can instill negative or positive emotional reactions to the audience. 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.440
 But it seems that some directors have already understood this technique. 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.920
 Know from left to right, from right to left 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.980
 Let's go back to the era of Hitchcock 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.020
 The protagonist and villain of the "train geek" directed by Alfred Hitchcock 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.140
 Just let us see the walking movements of their feet 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.720
 They are close to each other, as if they would meet each other on the road that hints at the future. 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.820
 If our research is right from left to right, it is more active than right to left. 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.100
 This opening has already let us know in the subconscious. 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.340
 Going from right to left, is the villain in the film 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.420
 From left to right is the protagonist. 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.880
 So the action from left to right is not just a symbol of the advancement of time. 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.380
 Also suggesting whether something is positive or negative 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.880
 Roger Ebert himself supports this argument. 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.940
 As explained in his 2008 book How to Read a Movie 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.040
 Roger Ebert even goes further to explain the left and right positions of the screen. 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.020
 Give people a more positive feeling, or more negative 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.540
 A character on the right makes people feel positive and controls the situation 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.080
 At the same time, the character on the left will feel weak, maybe more evil. 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.980
 This topic is also a commonplace. "Right - good, left - bad" 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.000
 A lot of filmmakers use this technique 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.800
 "The owner is my friend." 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.080
 "You do not have friends" 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.220
 "Hey! You go away!" 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.380
 "You just walk away!" 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.360
 "You!" "You are!" 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.940
 "you!" 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.780
 "Reverse is going to thunder!" 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.720
 "AhRRRRRR!" 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.320
 Roger Ebert claims that this technique of left and right position 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.500
 Has transcended language and culture and is used everywhere 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.480
 He said all the movies he has seen in his life. 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.100
 Asian film will use similar left and right matchup skills 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.500
 And the findings support his arguments. 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.320
 Regional beliefs, right and left habits, and ethnicity 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.760
 Will not affect the viewer's feeling of moving laterally 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.800
 Of course, making a movie is not absolute. 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.420
 And sometimes, the opposite rule can get the same effect. 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.520
 But either way, the research shows the results 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.280
 There is a difference between the left or right side of the movie. 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.600
 Because it is the theory of recent years, the experience of using film skills can also confirm 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.860
 Roger Ebert said he once suspected himself when he convinced himself. 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.760
 But now it has been confirmed 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.440
 I contacted Cleveland State University. 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.880
 Ask the person who did the research at the beginning 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.800
 They still continue to do research 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.100
 Test film theory 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.560
 After 100 years, I can learn new film making skills. 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.260
 I feel very excited 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.540
 Previous suspicions, there is now clear evidence 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.140
 So, the next time you see the character crossing the screen. Think carefully: 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.420
 "Where did he go?" 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.840
 "Which direction does he go?" 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.880
 "Where did he go?" "Where did he go?" 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.080
 "I don't know. He took my clothes and went over there." 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.940
 "Fast chase" 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.360
 Thank you for watching, I have to clarify the experimental film at the beginning. 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.980
 Not the film originally studied 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.620
 That movie is not public 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.060
 But they have articles that make movies publicly. 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.460
 So I copied the film according to the narrative of the article. 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.500
 I highly recommend that research article. 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.980
 Really great! I thoroughly discussed this topic and it was something I never thought about before. 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.240
 I will put the link in the video information. 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.760
 In addition, the film theorist I mentioned in the film 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.220
 No name 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.660
 In fact, I am referring to "Levy Coules" 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.620
 He is super fierce and writes a bunch of film theory 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.600
 In the 1970s, he proposed three axes of film action. 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.700
 And how do people think about the action in the movie? 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.140
 Recommend you GOOGE for him. 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.800
 I will also put some of his works on the film information (translation: harureya) 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.760
 Thank you (translation: harureya)
