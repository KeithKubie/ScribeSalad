00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.930
- [Voiceover] So I have a
arbitrary inscribed quadrilateral

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.740
in this circle and what I wanna prove

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.960
is that for any inscribed quadrilateral,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.542
that opposite angles are supplementary.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:15.857
So when I say they're supplementary,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:18.080
the measure of this angle
plus the measure of this angle

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.970
need to be 180 degrees.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.380
The measure of this angle
plus the measure of this angle

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.412
need to be 180 degrees.

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:26.650
And the way I'm gonna prove
it is we're gonna assume

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.120
that this, the measure of
this angle right over here,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.461
that this is x degrees.

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.410
And so from that, if we
can prove that the measure

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.810
of this opposite angle
is 180 minus x degrees,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.970
then we've proven that opposite angles

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.590
for an arbitrary quadrilateral
that's inscribed in a circle

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.260
are supplementary, 'cause
if this is 180 minus x,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.380
180 minus x plus x is
going to be 180 degrees.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.610
So I encourage you to pause
the video and see if you can do

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.110
that proof and I'll give
you a little bit of a hint.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.390
It's going to involve
the measure of the arcs

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.246
that the various angles intercept.

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:01.770
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
This angle that has a
measure of x degrees,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.782
it intercepts this arc, so
we see one side of the angle

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:13.070
goes and intercepts the circle there.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.630
The other side right over there.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.280
And so the arc that it intercepts,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.640
I am highlighting in yellow.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.818
I am highlighting it in yellow.

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:26.490
Trying to color it in, so there you go.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.220
Not a great job at coloring it in,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.020
but you get the point.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.360
That's the arc that it intercepts

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.150
and we've already learned
in previous videos

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.150
that the relationship
between an inscribed angle,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.970
the vertex of this angle
sits on the circle,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090
the relationship between
and inscribed angle

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.460
and the measure of the
arc that it intercepts

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.080
is that the measure of the inscribed angle

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.200
is half the measure of the
arc that it intercepts.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.930
So if this angle measure is x degrees,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.521
then the measure of this
arc is going to be 2x,

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.255
2x degrees.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.080
All right, well that's
kind of interesting,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.320
but let's keep going.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.600
If the measure of that arc is 2x degrees,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
what is the measure of
this arc right over here?

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.727
The arc that completes the circle.

00:02:12.727 --> 00:02:14.370
Well, if you go all the
way around the circle,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.428
that's 360 degrees.

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.710
So this blue arc that I'm
showing you right now,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.840
that's going to have a measure of 360

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.011
minus 2x degrees.

00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:32.640
360's all the way around.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.900
The blue is all the way
around minus the yellow arc.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.360
What you have left over if you
subtract out the yellow arc

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.483
is you have this blue arc.

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:44.160
Now, what's the angle that intercepts

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.693
this blue arc?

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:47.530
What's the inscribed angle

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.776
that intercepts this
blue arc right over here?

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:53.399
Well, it's this angle.

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.960
It's the angle that we
wanted to figure out

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.280
in terms of x.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.730
Wow, I'm having trouble changing colors.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.960
It is that angle right over there.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.174
Notice, the two sides of this angle,

00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:11.842
they intercept, this
angle intercepts that arc.

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:14.990
So, once again, the measure
of an inscribed angle

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.060
is gonna half the measure of the arc

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.500
that it intercepts.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.230
So what's 1/2, what is 1/2

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.891
times 360 minus 2x?

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:29.511
Well, one 1/2 times 360 is 180.

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:32.607
1/2 times 2x is x.

00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:34.240
So the measure of this angle is gonna be

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.774
180 minus x degrees.

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:41.240
180 minus x degrees, and just like that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.170
we've proven that these opposite sides

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.200
for this arbitrary
inscribed quadrilateral,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.650
that they are supplementary.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.420
You add these together,
x plus 180 minus x,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.000
you're going to get 180 degrees.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.150
So they are supplementary.
