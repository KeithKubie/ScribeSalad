00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
West is powerful I would say like we
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.110
West is powerful I would say like we
have a really well developed mythology

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
have a really well developed mythology
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.150
have a really well developed mythology
of the exploratory hero but where we're

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
of the exploratory hero but where we're
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.009
of the exploratory hero but where we're
not so well developed is the second part

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
not so well developed is the second part
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.570
not so well developed is the second part
because in the second part of the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
because in the second part of the
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.070
because in the second part of the
classic hero story you're supposed to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
classic hero story you're supposed to
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400
classic hero story you're supposed to
come back and communicate about what you

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
come back and communicate about what you
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.490
come back and communicate about what you
found and so there's a individual

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
found and so there's a individual
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349
found and so there's a individual
exploration element and then there's a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359
exploration element and then there's a
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.420
exploration element and then there's a
communicate and update the culture

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
communicate and update the culture
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670
communicate and update the culture
element and both of those are equally

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
element and both of those are equally
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.990
element and both of those are equally
important and it's something that we

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
important and it's something that we
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.450
important and it's something that we
don't do well we don't have much respect

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
don't do well we don't have much respect
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890
don't do well we don't have much respect
for tradition in the West and it's a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
for tradition in the West and it's a
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.370
for tradition in the West and it's a
really really big problem because the

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380
really really big problem because the
 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.229
really really big problem because the
ethical responsibility of a human being

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
ethical responsibility of a human being
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540
ethical responsibility of a human being
is to take the dead culture so that's

is to take the dead culture so that's
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.630
is to take the dead culture so that's
the dead father or the dead God and to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
the dead father or the dead God and to
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.779
the dead father or the dead God and to
