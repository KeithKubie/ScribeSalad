when I was playing the sharpness and the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979
when I was playing the sharpness and the
 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.340
when I was playing the sharpness and the
and the sort of the real loss lack of

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350
and the sort of the real loss lack of
 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.340
and the sort of the real loss lack of
stretch ability was very important the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
stretch ability was very important the
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.950

problems been solved now I I should find

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
problems been solved now I I should find
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100
problems been solved now I I should find
out actually I mean certainly I do have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
out actually I mean certainly I do have
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899
