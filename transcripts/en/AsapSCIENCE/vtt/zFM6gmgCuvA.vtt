00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.570
We see it in movies and TV shows all the time
- birds delivering messages. Whether it’s

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.769
a historical drama, or the ravens in Game
of Thrones, one has to wonder - can birds

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.429
actually deliver messages with accuracy?

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.220
Not to burst your fantasy bubble, but Ravens,
while incredibly intelligent, aren’t the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.430
likeliest of birds to get this job done. Sorry
John Snow! But the somewhat surprising fact

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.460
is that other birds, such as pigeons, are
fantastic at it! Hence the name ‘carrier-pigeon’.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.769
In fact, they were successfully used nearly
3000 years ago to declare the winner of the

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.739
Olympics, abroad.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.989
Pigeons have an innate homing ability, meaning
they will return to their nest to mate. Flights

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.929
as long as 1800 km have been recorded. Because
of this, they have been used for centuries

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.879
to send messages, but - and this is a pretty
big but - they generally only sent messages

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.369
in one direction. They would be taken away
from their homes, and when needed, could send

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:59.399
messages back home, because their natural
instinct was to fly there. So the idea of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.699
sending a bird wherever you needed it to go
is a little farfetched. However, by placing

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.100
their food at one location, and their home
in another, pigeons have been trained to fly

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.420
back and forth between 2 locations reliably.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.310
They have great eyesight, and use the sun
and the stars, landscapes, odors, sound waves

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.740
and potentially even the earth’s magnetic
field to locate home. Not to mention, they

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.899
seem to have an internal compass which orients
them. And because of their migratory behavior,

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.630
they can be trained as flocks, as opposed
to other birds which would require one-on-one

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.719
attention to accomplish the task.
