trusty element is there as well so it's
 

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.280
trusty element is there as well so it's
come together and that's our modern-day

come together and that's our modern-day
 

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.470

and that's a very common thing I spend
 

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.450

about a decade looking at mistakes in

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:46.460
about a decade looking at mistakes in
 

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.070
about a decade looking at mistakes in
the media and journalists we do make a

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080
the media and journalists we do make a
 

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.390
the media and journalists we do make a

lot of mistakes there's no question
 

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.250
lot of mistakes there's no question
about that but there is a difference as

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.260
about that but there is a difference as

one of the things that I think it does
 

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.850
one of the things that I think it does
on a really basic level is it increases

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:06.860
on a really basic level is it increases
 

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.260
on a really basic level is it increases
the amount of confusion that we have in

the amount of confusion that we have in

the amount of confusion that we have in
the information space when you have

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:09.500
the information space when you have

the information space when you have
stuff that is true or mostly true and

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:12.380
stuff that is true or mostly true and
 

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.180
stuff that is true or mostly true and
then you have things that are completely

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:13.190
then you have things that are completely
 

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.400
then you have things that are completely
false and they're sometimes built around

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.410
false and they're sometimes built around
 

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.020

already polarized maybe a little bit
further and it certainly created a lot

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:50.660
further and it certainly created a lot

maybe it's just because it goes viral so

yeah I mean there's no disputing that

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:18.310
yeah I mean there's no disputing that
 

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.520
yeah I mean there's no disputing that
misinformation has existed for a very

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:20.530
misinformation has existed for a very
 

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.410
misinformation has existed for a very
long time there's also I think no

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:22.420
long time there's also I think no
 

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.600
long time there's also I think no
disputing that the media has played a

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:24.610
disputing that the media has played a

role in spreading false information at
 

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.050
role in spreading false information at
times throughout history so what's

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:28.060
times throughout history so what's
 

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.970
times throughout history so what's
different well what's different is we

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:29.980

Facebook is such a massive traffic
generator it is a huge target for

it for economic means and so what's

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:50.890

up with different approaches on Facebook
to try and get that traffic to make

00:24:59.730 --> 00:24:59.740
to try and get that traffic to make
 

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.370
to try and get that traffic to make
money from ads and so the economic model

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:02.380
money from ads and so the economic model
 

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.890
money from ads and so the economic model
for misinformation is probably more

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:04.900

of it and one of the interesting things
 

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.890
of it and one of the interesting things
which I think toom alluded to in the

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:22.900
which I think toom alluded to in the
 

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.810
which I think toom alluded to in the

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:24.820
election was that you know arguably some
 

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.490

of the propaganda stuff and actually the

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:26.500
of the propaganda stuff and actually the
 

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.920
of the propaganda stuff and actually the

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:28.930
financially oriented based news were
 

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.380
financially oriented based news were
kind of identical the pro-trump stuff

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.390
kind of identical the pro-trump stuff
 

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.900
kind of identical the pro-trump stuff

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.080
Russia might have been trying to help
influence again I don't think Russia

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.090
influence again I don't think Russia
 

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.540

flipped the election but that stuff was

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:39.550
flipped the election but that stuff was

challenge and also a difference between

01:19:58.890 --> 01:19:58.900
challenge and also a difference between
 

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.350
challenge and also a difference between
the sort of emotion driven side which is

01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360
the sort of emotion driven side which is
 

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.820
the sort of emotion driven side which is
really what performs well on Facebook

really what performs well on Facebook
 

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.400
really what performs well on Facebook
and the very clinical

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:05.410
and the very clinical
 

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:08.190
and the very clinical
you know bloodless facts only side and

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:08.200
you know bloodless facts only side and
 

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.450
you know bloodless facts only side and
and this is one of the challenges that

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:09.460
and this is one of the challenges that
 

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.770
and this is one of the challenges that
we have of just knocking down this

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:10.780
we have of just knocking down this
 

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.330

information in general is that when you

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:12.340
information in general is that when you
 

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.400
information in general is that when you
come at it from the pose of the debunker

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:14.410
come at it from the pose of the debunker
 

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:15.690
come at it from the pose of the debunker
which is something I do a lot you just

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:15.700
which is something I do a lot you just
 

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.280
which is something I do a lot you just
look like a know-it-all and you look

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:17.290
look like a know-it-all and you look
 

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.320
look like a know-it-all and you look
like an annoying person wagging your

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:19.330
like an annoying person wagging your
 

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.910
like an annoying person wagging your
finger at everyone and if you're just

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920
finger at everyone and if you're just
 

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.100
finger at everyone and if you're just
doing an impure leaf actual term you

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:23.110
doing an impure leaf actual term you
 

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.959
doing an impure leaf actual term you
can't really compete with emotion and

01:20:24.959 --> 01:20:24.969
can't really compete with emotion and
 

01:20:24.969 --> 01:20:27.600
can't really compete with emotion and
and so I think there's a lot of complex

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:27.610
and so I think there's a lot of complex
 

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:29.459
and so I think there's a lot of complex
things going on but a lot of it I've

01:20:29.459 --> 01:20:29.469
things going on but a lot of it I've
 

01:20:29.469 --> 01:20:30.840
things going on but a lot of it I've
talked a lot about platforms with

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:30.850
talked a lot about platforms with
 

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:32.160
talked a lot about platforms with
technology and that kind of thing and

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:32.170
technology and that kind of thing and
 

01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:34.680
technology and that kind of thing and
the core of it is really you know human

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:34.690
the core of it is really you know human
 

01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:37.500
the core of it is really you know human
our emotions the way our brains work we

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:37.510
our emotions the way our brains work we
 

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.630
our emotions the way our brains work we
are drawn to things that align with what

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:39.640
are drawn to things that align with what
 

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.130
are drawn to things that align with what
we already thinking what we already feel

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.140
we already thinking what we already feel
 

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.680
we already thinking what we already feel
and and the algorithm is aspirate that

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:43.690
and and the algorithm is aspirate that
 

01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:45.630
and and the algorithm is aspirate that
so well I think people are not only

01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:45.640
so well I think people are not only
 

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.950
so well I think people are not only
retreating to fantasy but they're also

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960
retreating to fantasy but they're also
 

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.450
retreating to fantasy but they're also
retreating into kind of their own

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:48.460
retreating into kind of their own
 

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.150
retreating into kind of their own
ideological bubble and you know the last

01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:51.160
ideological bubble and you know the last
 

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.770
ideological bubble and you know the last
thing I would just say is I think this

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:52.780
thing I would just say is I think this
 

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.120
thing I would just say is I think this
has come up a couple of times where

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:54.130
has come up a couple of times where
 

01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:56.820
has come up a couple of times where
people focus on conservatives in the

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:56.830
people focus on conservatives in the
 

01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:58.760
people focus on conservatives in the
right and they're fake news

01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:58.770
right and they're fake news
 

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.500
right and they're fake news
but since Trump has been elected if you

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:00.510
but since Trump has been elected if you
 

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:02.240
but since Trump has been elected if you
look at the really hyper partisan

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:02.250
look at the really hyper partisan
 

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:04.400
look at the really hyper partisan
liberal Facebook pages and websites they

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:04.410
liberal Facebook pages and websites they
 

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:05.930
liberal Facebook pages and websites they
are getting huge engagement because now

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940
are getting huge engagement because now
 

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.520
are getting huge engagement because now
they have an enemy and there is

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:07.530
they have an enemy and there is
 

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.870
they have an enemy and there is
absolutely a lot of misinformation

01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880
absolutely a lot of misinformation
 

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.390
absolutely a lot of misinformation
coming from that side as well now and so

01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400
coming from that side as well now and so
 

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.250
coming from that side as well now and so
again it's not it's not even about the

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260
again it's not it's not even about the
 

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:15.530
again it's not it's not even about the
sides it's about us as humans and how we

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:15.540
sides it's about us as humans and how we
 

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:16.880
sides it's about us as humans and how we
interact with the information in the

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:16.890
interact with the information in the
 

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:18.590
interact with the information in the
world around us and that's at the core

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600
world around us and that's at the core
 

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.390
world around us and that's at the core
of this challenge that's why it's been

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400
of this challenge that's why it's been
 

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.070
of this challenge that's why it's been
around forever but when those things

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080
around forever but when those things
 

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.950
around forever but when those things
become mediated by algorithms on huge

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960
become mediated by algorithms on huge
 

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.930
become mediated by algorithms on huge
platforms suddenly it takes on another

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940
platforms suddenly it takes on another
 

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.940
platforms suddenly it takes on another
approach so it is a complex problem and

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:28.950
approach so it is a complex problem and
 

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.890
approach so it is a complex problem and
it comes down to us as humans I think at

01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900
it comes down to us as humans I think at
 

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.560
it comes down to us as humans I think at

closing thought from you one of the
questions that game what was whether

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:36.750
questions that game what was whether

questions that game what was whether
there should be some kind of
