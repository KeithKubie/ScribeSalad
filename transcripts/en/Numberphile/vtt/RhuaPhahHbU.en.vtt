00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.899
All right, so we've got a sphere.

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:06.298
It's sort of a shell of a sphere, and then there's a thing for it to stand on, a little base,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.630
there's a hole in the top,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.320
and there's this pattern, this cool pattern of sort of pentagons, and so on.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.500
And I've got a flashlight, or a torch,

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.069
if you haven't been in America for too long. You can take the sort of lens off

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.520
and you just get like a, it's supposed to be like, like, it's like a candle or something.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.400
But what I want to use it for is

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
to show this thing's stereographic projection.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.340
So, if I put the light right at the North Pole of the sphere

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.660
Then you get this pattern of shadows. So, right, so what is stereographic projection?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.710
It's a map from the sphere

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.720
to the plane, and the light rays sort of do that map.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.520
A light ray comes from the North Pole and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.220
let's say this one here, right, so it hits the point on the sphere here

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.160
and it goes down to the the table here, to the plane. So and you can see like if I put my little finger

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.880
near to this point on the sphere, you can see the shadow

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.760
on the plane is where is where it's going to.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.280
It was one of the first ways that people thought about, like, maps of the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.989
Earth, or the heavens, right, the celestial stuff, so the Greeks knew about this stuff and a lot of the old

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.879
kind of star maps are done with stereographic projection. So one of the things that's really cool about it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.199
is it preserves angles. And you can see on this model as well, these like three or six 60 degree angles here

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.119
It's like it's like a radiation symbol here

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.399
And the shadow has these 60 degree angles, and the sphere also has those 60 degree Angles

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.640
So not only does it preserve angles, right, angles stay the same, it also preserves circles.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.360
You can see on this, there's all these

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.240
great circles like an equator of the sphere.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.559
Well actually this one doesn't have an equator, if this is the North Pole, there isn't an equator drawn in,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.720
but, like, the path that you take if you just start sailing in a straight line around the Earth is this circle that's like an equator.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500
If you look at where is this path on, down on the shadow, I think it's this one here

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.009
And you'll see that it's a circle there as well. So to see the circles a little bit better

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.159
maybe, let's, let's have a look at this one. It's got circles all over the place. It's kind of like a dodecahedron, icosahedron thing with circles.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.839
Let's see what kind of shadow this makes, and if I hold the light in the right place you can see,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.509
so this circle up here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.940
goes to this circle down here. So, yes, somehow it knows that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.020
circles are supposed to be circles, even though things are getting kind of weirdly distorted, right, the size of the circles changes a lot

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.219
on the plane, they're all the same size on the sphere, of course, but it still knows that they should be circles, right?

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.969
I mean, you know if you move it somewhere else,

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.769
then, like it has to be right at the north pole for it to work, and the same thing with the angles.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.389
If it's not as a north pole, it's not a stereographic projection, it doesn't have all these nice properties.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:46.539
So here's a yet another, right, pattern on a sphere, with this sort of weird curvy thing going on, so,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.480
well, what's this gonna make? You may be surprised. Well, let's find out. And, put this in.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.940
There's this perfectly regular

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.640
square grid hiding inside of this really curvy round thing.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.340
Well, the way I made this is I started with the square grid and then I put it back up onto the sphere to see what's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.359
going on. So I could just continue making this square grid going further and further out.

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.019
And then I'm gonna get closer and closer in to the North Pole,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.560
but I'll never actually get to the North Pole, right? The North Pole somehow

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.929
corresponds to going infinitely far out this way, going infinitely many squares,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.929
eventually, well I wouldn't ever get to the North Pole,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.659
but that's what the North Pole corresponds to. The North Pole isn't there. It's a one-to-one thing. Every point on a sphere

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.829
gets a point on the plane, apart from the North Pole. So, so the plane, plus one point at infinity,

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:43.299
infinitely far away, is the same as the sphere. This is a two-dimensional surface goes to the two-dimensional plane. Let's go one dimension down.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.379
Let's do the, so the equivalent of the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.400
sphere the 2-dimensional sphere is the one-dimensional circle, right?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.599
It looks like a line if you just look at a piece of it. Let's draw the, the table, and then

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.779
my light is gonna be here at the North pole of this

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.799
circle, right? A circle is sort of a one dimensional version of the, of the sphere.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.198
And so, you know, a light ray comes down here, and it hits the sphere somewhere, and it hits the plane somewhere,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.480
and that's the map. Stereographic projection takes you from here to here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.380
And so, you know, what we were doing is, okay, squares are marching off this way,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.690
and like, you know, there's, there's another square,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.279
and so there's another line that goes out here, and the corresponding point on the sphere

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.299
gets closer to the North pole, and you get closer, and this line goes off, and you get closer, and this line goes off,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.870
but you never, like, the North Pole itself is somehow, like,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.790
infinitely far away. Circle, same thing as the line plus a point.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.260
And we had the sphere in ordinary three-dimensional space is the same thing as the two-dimensional plane

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.059
plus one point, the North Pole, infinitely far away. Sphere in two-dimensional space

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.580
sphere in three-dimensional space

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.790
sphere in 4-dimensional space? Okay,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.149
so, if we're in four-dimensional space, we can still measure things, and we can still say, there's a sphere, right?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.070
It's the thing which is the set of points which are at some distance from the center, and we can't see it

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.290
you can't, you know, because it's four dimensional. But, same thing. The sphere is the same thing as

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.140
the three-dimensional plane, space, whatever,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.100
plus a point at infinity.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.140
So, or in other words, I can't show you this sphere in 4-dimensional space,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.940
but I can show you the shadow. The shadow is gonna be a three-dimensional thing, so we can see it,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.100
or we can 3D print it, or we can do computer animations or something.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.960
This gives you some idea of what this thing in four dimensions is.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.760
So here, what we were doing, we were like,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.100
drawing squares on the sphere in three-dimensional space, and then casting a shadow. So we're gonna draw something else on the sphere

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.340
in 4-dimensional space, and cast a shadow.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.420
So what are we going to be drawing?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.760
Monkeys. So this is a like a monkey design, like so, so you're sketching, you're sketching something on the surface of this sphere.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.929
So just like, you know, you're drawing some two-dimensional picture here,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.229
I need to draw a three-dimensional picture on this sphere in four-dimensional space. And the three-dimensional picture I'm gonna draw is

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.910
this monkey, or it's going to be a slightly distorted version of this monkey.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.239
Brady: "So what, what, could you draw that with? Like, like, three-dimensional paint?"

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.380
Well, yeah.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380
I mean like, like the sphere in 4-dimensional

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.580
space is a three-dimensional thing, so anything threee-dimensional you can put it on there, in the same way for anything

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.500
two-dimensional on a two-dimensional sphere, or surface, whatever. So really this is drawn on one

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080
cubical side of a hypercube,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.079
whatever, and then it gets sort of

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.199
radially projected out onto the sphere in four-dimensional space. Once you're on the sphere then we can do this

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.609
stereographic projection, make a three-dimensional shadow of it in

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.289
three-dimensional space, which we can see. This is the monkey inside of one cube of a hypercube.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.669
And he's, so this, this cube has six neighbors, so this monkey needs six neighbors

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:03.448
And they're all kind of like twisting around in various ways. This is showing kind of, some kind of crazy four-dimensional symmetry group.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.949
That's why the monkey is there, is it's a motif that's showing this symmetry. We got our four-dimensional flashlight and/or torch,

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.949
whatever, depending on your commonwealth status,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.080
and you project it down to three-dimensional space and we see what it looks like.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.680
Brady: "We can see it then."

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.500
We can see it without poor three-dimensional brains that can't deal with four-dimensional stuff.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.740
There are people who claim they can see in four dimensions, but I think they're lying. Right, so this is

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.220
eight monkeys,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.299
and they're showing this particular kind of four-dimensional symmetry. So maybe you can see this, there's like,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.400
there's a ring of four monkeys, one two three four, going around like this.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.159
And they're all sort of standing on each other's heads.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.139
And then there's another ring of four monkeys that goes through here, one two three four,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.340
and there's a particular kind of sort of twisting symmetry that

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.560
sends, like, this monkey to this monkey to this monkey to this monkey, and they kind of screw, twist around

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.580
as you go through. There's an animation. You'll show the animation. Maybe it will make sense.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.640
[monkey screeching]

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.699
Some people get like really weirded out by this.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.848
They're like, you know, they're sort of disturbing, the shapes of them.

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:24.029
But it's just math. Like, this is just what it does to the monkey. There's no emotional content intended.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.700
Take some it what you will. I guess that's art, right. You can do whatever you want with it.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.020
Brady: "It's your fault you gave them the horrific faces though. That's not the fault of math."

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:40.340
Look, he's happy! Look at this happy monkey! I mean, maybe he's a little bit annoyed that his, his friend is standing on his head.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.960
[snickering]

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.440
So this is the fun part. So this is a, this is a fun story, actually.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.100
Brady: "It just pooped on you."

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.589
Well actually, so, oh, oh it's still going, huh.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.739
So, so they're printed, right? 3D printed, and it's made with, like, plastic dust that gets melted. They're hollow.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:04.180
But in shipping, some dust gets shaken out, so they, you know, gradually sort of lose dust, we can,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.200
yeah, everything gets covered in white dust.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.460
Brady: "That's from the fourth dimension!"

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.440
It is, it is four-dimensional monkey dust.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.800
Now, I could have made this

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800
less of a problem.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.400
The issue is, like, the mouth is the only exit hole, right? If there were two exit holes in a monkey, then you could

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.400
blow air through it, and blow all of the dust out.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.079
But where are you going to put another hole in a monkey?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.189
I mean, you already have monkey butts all-. Like, you cannot take a photograph of this that doesn't involve a monkey butt. And if there

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:38.120
were eight, yeah, yeah. So this is eight monkeys,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:44.740
which, and there's one monkey in each cube of the hypercube, that cube, the hypercube has eight, eight cubes in it

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.410
So this is a particular symmetry that comes sort of associated with hypercube

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:57.480
So there are these other four-dimensional versions of the Platonic solids. So there's something called a 24 cell, and you can do the same thing.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:06.240
With 24 monkeys. So this one, there were these two chains of four monkeys each, head to, head to foot, head to foot

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.330
This one also has these, these chains of monkeys,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.819
so the best one is probably this one right in the middle one two three four five

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.069
There's a chain of six monkeys here, going head to foot. And you can spot these other chains of monkeys.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.629
So there's another chain of six monkeys. So there's all, there's I think, four different chains of six monkeys,

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:31.619
because 4 times 6 is 24, good? 24 cell. And just going one step further, because why not? You can do the same thing with

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.340
120 cell.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.739
120 monkeys. This isn't actually the whole thing. So this is only up to the equator of the sphere in 4-dimensional space.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.810
So this is only showing the southern

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.079
hyper-hemisphere, hemi-hypersphere, whatever

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.930
So there should be more monkeys out here.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.589
You can see like, they're trying to grab on to things, but there are no more monkeys out there.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:57.198
Just, it would get enormous, but okay, so it was like

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:03.709
chains of monkeys. This one has a chain of ten. And again, you can, you can do these animations where

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:11.059
those monkeys are sort of slowly moving along those chains, twisting as they go. And these are showing different four-dimensional symmetries

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.578
that don't really exist in three-dimensional space.

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.938
Even why, you know, this thing,

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:17.930
I mean,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.889
it's not actually fair, because you know there's different,

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:24.229
like there's six dents taken out of this, and there's one, and you know, forgetting all that, suppose

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.870
it was an ordinary, you know, just a perfect mathematical cube,
