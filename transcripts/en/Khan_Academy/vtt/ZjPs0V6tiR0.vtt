00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.492
- [Voiceover] In this video,

00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:03.316
I want to do a
demonstration of the process

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:05.190
of labeling voltages on a circuit

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.719
that we're about to analyze.

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:09.957
This is something that
sometimes causes stress,

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:11.982
or confusion, and I want to just basically

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:15.299
try to get out of that
stressful situation,

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.798
so the first thing I want to do,

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.548
is remind ourselves of the convention,

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:22.809
the sign convention
for passive components,

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.957
so we said, If we have a
resistor that we draw this way,

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:29.935
and we label the voltage
plus or minus V on it,

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:32.743
then when we label the current arrow,

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:35.883
we want to label the current arrow

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:40.098
so it goes into the positive
terminal of the component,

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:42.456
in this case a resistor,

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:44.372
so just another quick example,

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:47.254
if I draw the resistor sideways like this,

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:50.461
if I label the voltages,
the minus one on this side,

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.083
and the plus one on this side,

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.583
then when I go to apply the current arrow,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.252
I put the current arrow into
the positive voltage sign,

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:07.212
so this here is the sign convention

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:09.158
for an individual component.

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:10.942
How do we label the voltage,

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:14.725
and the current together to be consistent?

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:16.776
Now we're going to to over
and analyze a circuit.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.460
I've drawn a circuit here.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.136
It's two identical circuits,

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.871
and we're going to do
it two different ways,

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.370
with two different voltage labels,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.835
so the first thing we do, of course,

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:26.875
when we analyze a circuit,

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.578
is we set up the variables
that we want to talk about.

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:31.800
We'll do this side first.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.550
I'll label this as i,

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.966
and that's a choice I can make,

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:41.804
and then I'm going to
label the voltages too,

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:45.101
and I'm going to choose to
label the voltages like this,

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:48.925
plus and minus V, and we'll call this V1,

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.758
and this will be plus or minus V2,

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.972
so first, let's carry through

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:56.885
and do the analysis of this circuit,

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.463
and I'll give some
component values to this.

00:01:59.463 --> 00:02:01.463
We'll call this 10 ohms,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.247
and this one's 20 ohms.

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.020
Now I'm going to do an application

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.270
of Kirchhoff's voltage law,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.712
around this loop,

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.455
and we'll see how it turns out.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:17.555
All right, so Kirchhoff's voltage law

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.122
will start at this node here,

00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:22.481
and will go around the circuit this way,

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.539
and we'll do some equations.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.872
We'll say, plus three volts,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.616
when we go through this device,

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.823
we get a voltage rise of three,

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:32.460
then we get a voltage drop,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.891
because we go from plus to minus,

00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.724
we get a voltage drop of minus V1,

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.693
and then we get another drop of V2,

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.500
minus V2, equals zero.

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:50.383
That's our KVL equation
for this circuit over here,

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:53.106
so let's keep going with this analysis.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.556
Three volts, minus V1

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:56.723
is i times R1,

00:02:59.043 --> 00:02:59.960
i times 10,

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:04.485
and V2 is i times 20 ohms,

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:13.935
and that equals zero, so let's keep going.

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:16.751
Three minus i times 10,

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:23.775
plus 20, equals zero,

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:29.536
and that means that i equals minus three

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.152
over, minus three goes to this side,

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:38.329
10 plus 20 is 30, and the
minus sign goes with the 30,

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.162
minus 30,

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.237
so i equals plus amp,

00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:52.108
so we solve for i, and
let's just pick out V1.

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.533
Let's solve for V1,

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.116
and we said earlier
that V1 was i times R1,

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:01.204
so V1 equals i, which is .1 amps,

00:04:04.337 --> 00:04:05.504
times 10 ohms,

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.402
equals one volt.

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.464
If we do it for V2,

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.585
that equals .1 amps,

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:23.002
times 20 ohms, and that equals two volts,

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:25.748
and I can do one last little check,

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:28.057
I can go back, and I can see KVL,

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:31.019
I could do a check to see if
this equation came out right,

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.102
so three volts, minus V1 is one volt,

00:04:37.717 --> 00:04:39.384
and V2 is two volts,

00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:43.892
and that equals zero,

00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.355
and I get to put a check mark here,

00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:48.635
because yes, it's equal to zero.

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:50.116
That was a real quick analysis

00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:53.152
of a simple two resistor circuit,

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:55.296
and we got all the voltages and currents.

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:56.998
Now I'm going to go do
the same thing again,

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:59.095
but this time I'm going
to do the voltage labels

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:00.884
a little bit odd.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:01.757
What I'm going to do here,

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:04.174
is I'm going to say two plus.

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:08.192
I'm going to define V1
to be in that direction,

00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:11.275
and we'll keep V2 like it was before,

00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:16.179
and now I need a current variable,

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:19.236
and I'm going to call my
current variable i here,

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.457
just like we did before.

00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:22.922
Now at this point, you might say,

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.163
Willie, you did it wrong.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:24.996
You did it wrong.

00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:26.764
That's not the right voltage label,

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:27.762
but I want to show you

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:29.214
that I'm going to get the same answer,

00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:33.164
even though I did it this unusual way,

00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:36.141
so let's do the same KVL
analysis on this circuit,

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:37.511
and what I want to show you,

00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.713
is that the arithmetic
that we're about to do

00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:42.355
takes care of the science just fine.

00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:43.772
All right, so KVL

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.383
on this circuit says that

00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:50.628
we'll start at the same place,

00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:53.378
and go around the same direction,

00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:57.639
so this says they're three volts,

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.196
a voltage rise of three volts,

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:01.458
we go in the minus sign,
and out the positive sign,

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.920
so that's a voltage rise.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.245
Now we get over to R1, and we
go in the minus sign of R1,

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:08.810
and out the plus sign,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.310
so that's plus V1,

00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:16.610
that's different than
we had last time, right?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.232
Last time we had minus V1 here, see,

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:21.567
and now we have plus V1.

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:24.261
This is going to work out okay though.

00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.483
Now we go in the plus sign of V2,

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:29.941
and we come out the minus sign,

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:34.236
so that's a voltage drop,
so we do a subtraction,

00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:35.986
and that equals zero.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.850
All right, we've got different equations,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.602
but we've got different definitions of V1,

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.462
so now I want to write these V terms

00:06:44.462 --> 00:06:46.296
in terms of the resistance value,

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:47.741
and the current value,

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.908
and this is where we use the
sign convention carefully,

00:06:53.237 --> 00:06:56.613
so now we need to include
a term to represent R1,

00:06:56.613 --> 00:06:58.306
to use Ohm's law here.

00:06:58.306 --> 00:06:59.426
Now we have to be careful,

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:02.194
this is one point we have to be careful,

00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:07.085
the current is going in the
negative terminal of R1,

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:09.594
so we're going to say

00:07:09.594 --> 00:07:11.427
VR1 equals negative i,

00:07:17.054 --> 00:07:17.887
times R1.

00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:21.991
Does that make sense?

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:23.604
If we define our current variable

00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:25.116
to be going in the negative sign,

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:27.947
then Ohm's law picks
up this negative sign,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.439
to make it come out right,

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:33.356
so down here, we plug in minus iR1,

00:07:36.307 --> 00:07:38.474
which is minus i times 10,

00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:41.327
that's a difference,

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.631
and then we go through V2,

00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.606
and V2 is the same as it
was in the other equation,

00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:46.523
minus V2 is

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:50.464
i times R2, which is 20,

00:07:52.978 --> 00:07:55.061
and that all equals zero.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.988
Even right now, if you
look at this equation,

00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:01.380
you see this minus sign,
that snuck in here,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.375
because of our good use
of the sign convention

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.073
for passive componets.

00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:08.415
That makes this equation

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:10.832
look just like this one here,

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:17.098
so let's continue with the analysis.

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.615
Just need a little bit more room,

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:25.222
three volts minus i

00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:32.223
times 10 plus 20,

00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:38.605
equals zero.

00:08:39.488 --> 00:08:41.211
Now we have the same equation as before,

00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:44.491
so we're going to get the same i,

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:47.950
i equals, three goes to the other side,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.450
and becomes minus three,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.995
10 plus 20 is 30,

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.429
with the minus sign.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:54.512
It goes over,

00:09:01.387 --> 00:09:02.637
same as before,

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.790
so those came out the same,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.434
so now let's go check the voltages,

00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:11.173
see if we can compute the same voltages,

00:09:11.173 --> 00:09:12.484
and what he have to notice here,

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:14.260
is our reference direction,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.559
the original reference
direction we have for V

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:19.392
generated a minus sign
when we used Ohm's law,

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.651
so we keep doing that, it's okay,

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.651
so V1, equals minus iR1,

00:09:29.074 --> 00:09:31.574
equals minus .1 amps times 10,

00:09:34.578 --> 00:09:37.161
and that equals minus one volt,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.143
and V2 equals i times R2,

00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.898
which is equal to .1 times 20 ohms,

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:51.892
and that equals plus two volts,

00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.243
and now the difference,

00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:55.076
we see the difference here.

00:09:55.076 --> 00:09:58.243
Here is the difference that showed up.

00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:05.734
V1 in this circuit has the
positive voltage at the top,

00:10:05.734 --> 00:10:09.797
it came out with a value of plus one volt,

00:10:09.797 --> 00:10:12.766
and when we flipped over V1,

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:14.493
negative one volt here,

00:10:14.493 --> 00:10:16.455
means that this terminal of the resistor,

00:10:16.455 --> 00:10:21.237
is one volt below this
terminal of the resistor,

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:24.118
and that means exactly the
same thing in this case,

00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:25.442
as it does in this case,

00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:29.257
so these two things mean the same thing,

00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:33.424
and of course, the voltage on
number two came out the same,

00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:38.409
so the purpose of the demonstration

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:39.634
was just to show you,

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:42.403
that no matter which way
you name the voltages,

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.788
somewhere in here, like right here,

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:46.369
Kirchhoff's voltage law will take care

00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:47.780
of keeping the sign right,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.987
and you end up with the
same answer at the end,

00:10:50.987 --> 00:10:52.306
so when you're faced with the problem

00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:54.146
of labeling a circuit like this,

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:57.357
don't stress out about
trying to guess ahead,

00:10:57.357 --> 00:11:00.002
what the sign of the voltage
is going to turn out.

00:11:00.002 --> 00:11:01.813
You just need to pick an orientation,

00:11:01.813 --> 00:11:02.692
and go with it,

00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:04.532
and the arithmetic will take care of

00:11:04.532 --> 00:11:06.571
the positive signs,
and the negative signs.
