WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.510
Okay.
So we're at the conclusion,

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.900
we're at the conclusion of,
um,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.350
of studying our theoretical study of bonds and reactivity.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.860
Uh,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
then we'll go on to something completely different and we're ending by talking

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.960
about reactivity in terms of for functional groups.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.080
And you're doing your own functional groups,
I remember for tomorrow.
Okay.
Uh,

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.880
so we already talked about carbon eel last time and now we're going to go onto a

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.890
mid carboxylic acid and kill lithium as other functional groups and then we'll

10
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.320
do something just completely different for the next,
uh,

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.490
quarter of the semester.
Okay?
Uh,

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.290
so resonance is Homo Lubo mixing that happens within a molecule.

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.840
The molecule of course knows all about it.

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.910
It only becomes resonance because we draw a picture that's too simple and we

15
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.310
need to modify the picture,
right?

16
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.220
And that modification is called resonance.

17
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
And a good example of that is the amid functional group.

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.371
Now,

19
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.600
when I include an amid on the first exam where people are supposed to identify

20
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.670
functional groups,
circle them and name them,

21
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
it's inevitable that some people will circle to see double Bondo and say,

22
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.820
that's a carbonyl group.
And some people will circle it,

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.360
circle the nitrogen and say that's an amine.

24
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.900
But an amid is not an amine and it's not a key tone or a carbonyl group.

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.600
It's its own thing.
And the,

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.340
the reason is that those interact with one another in a way that makes them no

27
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:51.480
longer like an amine and no longer like a carbon eel group.

28
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.470
That's resonance.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.520
So we'll look at it here in terms of d two different pictures of the molecule.

30
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.831
One is as a carbonyl amine and the other is as an amid,

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.360
which if you're in the Lewis structures,

32
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.830
you draw with a double headed Arrow and show two uh,

33
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.400
two resonance structures and you have in the carbon eel and a,

34
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520
you identify a homo that makes the thing of base and a Lumo that should make it

35
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:20.754
an acid.

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.900
But resonance is an e is can be thought of as an reaction already within the

37
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:32.301
molecule between the Homo in the Lumo and it's a make and break situation just

38
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:37.650
like we saw with between molecules last time where the unshared pair makes a new

39
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:38.700
bond.
In this case,

40
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:43.701
the second of a double bond and something leaves from the carbon that's being

41
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:48.660
attacked.
The thing that leaves is the second bond of a double bond.

42
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.930
So it's another one of these make and break situations.

43
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:56.931
But in this case it's a correction to our naive localized picture of that we

44
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:03.040
drew at the beginning.
Okay,
so let's see about this.

45
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.840
First we have the naive prediction,

46
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.340
what that should say about the characteristics of the molecule and then what the

47
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.560
experimental observation is,

48
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.350
which requires that we use something more complicated.

49
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
The resonance structures or thinking in terms of molecular orbitals.

50
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.480
Okay.
So,
uh,

51
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.490
the amines and carbon heels are perfectly stable molecules in terms of being low

52
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:28.690
energy.
They don't just do something,

53
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.350
but what's associated with the idea of resonance structures is the thing is more

54
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.600
stable than you would have predicted if you didn't consider the resonance

55
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.111
structure.

56
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.070
So you say that's more stable and you can see why it would be more stable

57
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.900
because the unshared pair is mixing with a vacant orbital and becoming lower in

58
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:49.480
energy.
In fact,

59
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020
the observation is that it's more stable by about 16 kilocalories per mole,

60
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.080
which about a fourth as much as a carbon nitrogen bond is worth.

61
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.640
So it's a significant amount of energy.
Now,

62
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
if you have a CN single bond that's longer than a double bond and longer than a

63
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.500
partial CN double bond that you'd have for the average of the resonance

64
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.810
structures on the right.
And in fact,

65
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:21.811
that bond is shorter than normal single nitrogen carbon bonds by about 0.1 for

66
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.290
OnX drums.
Okay.
On the left,

67
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.370
you have a short double bond for CW Bondo,
but on the right,

68
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.000
it's a partial single bond.
So it should be longer,
not held as tightly,

69
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.910
and in fact,
it is longer than others.
C O double bonds by about 0.03 Ostrom's.

70
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.280
Okay.
Uh,
we've seen before when we were talking about x,

71
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.510
h three y nitrogen tends to be pyramidal,

72
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.650
so as to give s character to the unshared pair of electrons.

73
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.920
But on the right,
if it's going to be part of a double bond,

74
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.450
it has to be plainer and we can see why that is.

75
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.560
So here's the Pi Star Lumo of the CW Bondo.

76
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.780
And here in front is the unshared pair on nitrogen in a PR battle,

77
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.440
which overlaps and d localizes mixes with the vacant Lumo,

78
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.103
right?

79
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.170
That means that you have a partial double bond for the CN and a partial single

80
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.890
bond for the CEO.

81
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.810
How is it that putting an electron's makes it a single bond rather than a double

82
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.644
bond?

83
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.050
Why would putting in electrons weaken a bond?

84
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.280
Alex can't hear because it's an anti-bonding orbital,

85
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.210
the Pi Star of CEO.
Okay.
Now,

86
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.980
so it's plainer indeed,
and I'll show you pictures that prove it,

87
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.130
uh,
because it gives the overlap.

88
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.980
If there were an s p hybrid on the nitrogen,

89
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.370
the s part of it wouldn't overlap with the p Pi.

90
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.120
So a pure p orbital gives the best overlap.

91
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.720
So that's why it's plainer from an molecular orbital point of view.
Uh,

92
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.050
now if you have a single bond,

93
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.250
it's easy for things to rotate around it because it's cylindrically symmetric.

94
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.300
But we know that a Pi bond is not cylindrically symmetric.

95
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.590
It is that oval shape.

96
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.690
So there's a barrier to rotation about the central bond of a carbon carbon

97
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:30.524
double bond.

98
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.510
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.950
<v 0>because when you rotate the nitrogen in front like this,
by 90 degrees,</v>

100
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.160
you've wrecked the overlap that allowed those electrons to be stabilized.

101
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.290
Right.
In fact,
once you've done this,

102
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.880
there's no reason for the nitrogen to be sp squared hybridized anymore because

103
00:06:50.881 --> 00:06:51.480
the,

104
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.100
the unshared pair is not trying to overlap with the carbon p orbital behind it.

105
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.851
Right.

106
00:06:56.851 --> 00:07:01.500
So it might as well hybrid eyes and become sp squared the way it normally does

107
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.820
and this structure,

108
00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:07.821
the halfway rotated structure turns out to be 16 kilocalories more stable than

109
00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:14.190
the one our,
pardon me,
less stable than the one where you do have the overlap.

110
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.140
So twisting it has a barrier of 16 kilocalories from all.

111
00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:20.700
Have you ever seen that number before,

112
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.613
<v 1>Zach?</v>

113
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.120
<v 0>That's what we saw at the beginning.</v>

114
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:31.050
It's more stable when those electrons can be stabilized as compared to enemy in

115
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.060
and a carbon eel that are not interacting because when you turn it 90 degrees,

116
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.720
they indeed are not interacting because there are thug and all.

117
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.260
Okay.
An amine,
as we said,

118
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.740
should be basic and a carbon eel should be acidic because of the law.

119
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.490
Lumo the Pi Star CEO,
but if they mix with one another,

120
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.500
then the homo is lower and the Lumo is higher,

121
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.020
so they're not reactive at a more,

122
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.950
they're not as unusual in their highness and their lowness.
Right.

123
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.540
So it turns out that the mid is relatively unreactive.

124
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.520
Now,
do you know relative to what you'd expect for an amine and a carbonyl now,

125
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.800
do you know where you encounter amids all the time?

126
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.530
You can touch it amid with no problem.
How Sofi?

127
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.170
Pardon?
Pardon me?
You acids,

128
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.310
amino acids which make proteins.
Mito acids aren't amends,

129
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.560
but proteins which are made of amino acids and amine reacting with a car,

130
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.580
but those are a mids and you want them to be stable.
Why?

131
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.880
You don't want them to be our active like a carbonyl and an amine.

132
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.930
It's so your skin works.
Otherwise,
in lab,
if you,
what does a base,

133
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.260
if you feel sodium hydroxide,
you've done this,
what does it feel like?

134
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.550
It's slippery.
If a bed's weren't unusually stable right?

135
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.510
Then when you felt at your skin would go away.
Right.

136
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.750
So it's a good thing.
In fact,
uh,

137
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.360
and the last thing I was also important,

138
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.050
so you're opposing dipoles mostly,
right?

139
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.820
Carbon to oxygen is pl is plus towards carbon minus toward oxygen,

140
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.810
carbon,
nitrogen plus toward carbon minus toward nitrogen.

141
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.220
But mostly those two are opposed to one another and a little bit they add.

142
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:31.221
So you get a net displacement of positive negative charge in the molecule from

143
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.400
left to right,
positive to negative.
Okay.

144
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.130
That's what would happen if it were a carbon eel and a mean,

145
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.860
but it's not a carbon eel and a mean.

146
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.610
It's strongly dipole are not canceled and it's in this direction perpendicular

147
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:51.390
to the original direction because you take electrons that were on nitrogen and

148
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.630
the amine and you shift them into the carbonyl group.

149
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.820
So it's as if the,

150
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.970
the magnitude of that effect is as if you transferred one third of an electron

151
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.880
from nitrogen to oxygen.
If you did that,

152
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.610
you'd get as much displacement of charge on average.

153
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:11.730
Is there actually is right now.

154
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.240
It turns out that all these ladder properties are crucial for structural

155
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:20.610
biology.
We already saw that if you want skin to work,

156
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.530
it has to not be as reactive,

157
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.510
but these other things are important to the geometric things that nitrogen has

158
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:28.530
to be playing or not.

159
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.210
There's a barrier to rotation is very important and also the dye polarity,

160
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.950
the direction of the dipole is very important and will show that.
So here's,

161
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.890
here's an amid bond,
okay,

162
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:45.000
the nitrogen is blue and the oxygen is is red.

163
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.050
You see the double bond,

164
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:51.051
but you shift electrons from the nitrogen to the carbon group and that is the Pi

165
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.880
Star.
That's proper.
That's the,
that's the,
that's the Homo,
not the Pi Star.

166
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:59.790
It's the,
it's the homo,
the pie electron pair,

167
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.590
which is shifted from nitrogen and shared with the CW Bondo.

168
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.340
Now that sharing is,

169
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:12.240
we just said on the previous slide creates an electric dipole.

170
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.820
So the electrons are shifted in the direction shown.

171
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.060
And that's crucial because here is a picture of a helix,

172
00:11:19.061 --> 00:11:23.220
an Alpha helix of a protein,
and I outline the backbone of it there.

173
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.390
Okay.
So several turns of an Alpha Helix,

174
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:30.870
which has a lot of amid bonds in it.
And if we look at it,

175
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.780
we see there's an a mid,
there's another amid,
there's another amid all,

176
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.870
more or less on the top of this helix.
What's interesting about those,

177
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.540
Andrew?
What's interesting about the set of them?

178
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.383
<v 1>Uh,</v>

179
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.120
<v 0>how are they up there?</v>

180
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.810
You think it's favorable or unfavorable?
The way they're aligned up plus minus,

181
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.200
plus minus,
plus minus in a row,

182
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.350
they're all lined up so as to be attractive to one another.

183
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.800
So that stabilizes this structure.
In fact,

184
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:16.801
another way of talking about it is to say as as shown here by these deltas that

185
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:21.700
the oxygen is partially minus and that the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is

186
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:22.780
partially plus.

187
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.800
So getting this minus near that plus is favorable.

188
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.210
What do you call that?

189
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.990
Anybody know that is a hydrogen bond,
right?

190
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.870
So you'd have,
it's a stabilized by electrostatic interaction.

191
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:42.580
These hydrogen bonds,
not only there,
but there are other ones too,
like here,

192
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.050
a chain of them there and another chain down here at the bottom.

193
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.930
So this helix is stabilized by the fact that the dipole points,

194
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:56.320
the way it did,
if it pointed in the perpendicular direction,

195
00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:58.930
you wouldn't get this stability.
Okay?

196
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.990
And it's also stabilized by the geometry that's favored the local play

197
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:08.950
narrative.
The fact that you don't twist around the CN double bond.

198
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.750
So here's the partial double bond.
So here's Carbonell,
here's the CN.

199
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.120
And that's partially,
although it's written as a single bond,

200
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:20.840
it's partially a double bond.
So you don't twist about it.
So this item,
this item,

201
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.100
this item,
this Adam,
are all in the same plane,
right?

202
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.230
And you'll see another such group here,

203
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.430
back behind where here is the,
is the bond in question.

204
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.640
So this item,
this item,
this item,
this Adam,

205
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:38.190
we're all in the same plane or here at the bottom you see it where you,

206
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:41.950
you're looking almost in the line in the plane,
right?

207
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.480
And what does that mean?

208
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.760
It means that the backbone is not as floppy because you take away some of the

209
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:52.660
possibilities of twisting it.
So it helps it take this shape.

210
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:57.661
So both the dipole and the fact and the geometrical freezing of some of the

211
00:13:57.731 --> 00:14:00.320
single bonds means that,
that,

212
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.340
that this structure is a particularly stable and therefore a very,

213
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.210
uh,
prevalent in biological macromolecules.

214
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.910
So that makes a lot of difference that of mids,

215
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.920
our mids and not a mean carbon eels.
Okay.

216
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:21.160
Now how about carboxylic acids?
That's the next functional group.

217
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.730
So let's come compared with water,
they asked,

218
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.130
are they acidic compared to alcohols?

219
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.550
Because you might think that in the same way that an amid is an amine key tone,

220
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.470
you might think that a carboxylic acid is an alcohol ketone,

221
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.510
but it's not right.
They interact with one another in much the same way.

222
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.040
Now,
if you had just a regular old alcohol,
it can associate as an acid.

223
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.040
It's not very strong as an acid.
You don't burn your skin with it,
right?

224
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.310
But it,
uh,
it has a,
so it has a pka of 16 that's the,

225
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.330
the dissociation constant is 10 to the minus 16.
That's not very impressive.

226
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.790
But for a carboxylic acid,

227
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:08.030
the reason it's called an acid is because it's PKA is much lower.

228
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:10.640
It's more acidic.
The equilibrium constants,

229
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:14.600
10 to the minus five so it's acidic.
It's not an alcohol,

230
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:19.250
it's 10 to the 11th times stronger than an alcohol.
Right.

231
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.620
And why now?
Why?
Well,
just like an amid,

232
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.510
you have an unshared pair on the Oah oxygen,

233
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.160
which could be stabilized by the,
by the Pi Star,

234
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:34.550
orbital of the CW Bondo.
Now,

235
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.490
if that stabilizes the material on the left,

236
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.040
how should it affect the equilibrium constant?

237
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.960
Should it be it more or less acidic?
That is because of this interaction.

238
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.810
Because of this residence structure,

239
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.010
we could say because this pair of electrons is stabilized by the carbon eel,

240
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.200
there's a factor that stabilizing this,
which doesn't exist in the alcohol.

241
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.770
So you're stabilizing the material on the left of the equilibrium.

242
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.130
Would that tend to make it more acidic or tend to make it less acidic if it's

243
00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:10.940
stable on the left,
right.
You so you have,

244
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.360
here's the stuff on the left.
Here's the stuff on the right.

245
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:16.580
It's uphill and energy,
no matter what you're talking about,

246
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.490
it's hard to dissociate as an acid,
right?

247
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.420
So I make this more stable,
which is what I just showed.

248
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:28.250
There's resonance here that stabilizes this Homo Lumo mixing within the
molecule.

249
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.470
Does that make it more or less easy to dissociate?
Harder or easier?

250
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.770
Harder.
Right.
It's further up hill,
so this seems backwards.

251
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.050
The stabilization that we saw in the analog of the stabilization we saw in an

252
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:50.051
amid that makes your skin not dissolve has the opposite direction.

253
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:51.950
It predicts that the,

254
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.390
that the dissociation would be more uphill where in fact it's less.

255
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.980
Why?
Because if we look at the product,

256
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.370
you also have homo Lumo interaction between an unshared pair on this oxygen and

257
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:11.690
the carbon eel and that will stabilize it on the right and make it easier to

258
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:14.840
dissociate,
which should be more important.

259
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.470
The amount of extra stabilization on the left.

260
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.280
Here's what it was for an alcohol or originally,
right.

261
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.360
We stabilize it on the left and we stabilize it on the right,

262
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.030
which is more stabilized.

263
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.100
The carb oxalate or the original alcohol,

264
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.580
the carboxylic acid.
What do you know from the fact that it's more acidic,

265
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.920
which must have gone down further.
This one must have gone down further.

266
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.910
Can you see why?

267
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.170
Why would this one be more stabilized by Homo Lubo mixing that?

268
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:55.260
Is this be more important than it is here

269
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.303
<v 1>with that</v>

270
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.430
Lucas symmetry?
No.

271
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.120
Charge separation.

272
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.750
<v 0>Okay.
There's bad charge separation here.</v>

273
00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:13.390
Here you don't on the right you don't separate charge.

274
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.810
That may have been part of what Lucas was trying to say,

275
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.980
but there's another way you can say it.
Just in terms of Homo Lumo mixing,

276
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.700
you're the language you're using is the language of resonance,
right?

277
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.830
That you don't want a separate charge.

278
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.900
I want to see why in terms of molecular orbital energies are atomic orbital

279
00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:35.800
energies that you get more stabilization here,
Alex.

280
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.133
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

281
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.440
<v 0>right,
but that's true in both cases is an electron pair here that mixes with the</v>

282
00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:46.630
vacant orbital.
There's an electron here,

283
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.030
like tron pair here that mixes with the vacant orbital.

284
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.670
Why is it more effective here than it is here?

285
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.210
<v 1>Player?
Just guessing,</v>

286
00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.090
but the residents with the two structures in the left,

287
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.690
the residence on the sit down the,
Ooh,
his,

288
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.970
<v 2>but with the other one,
because the age is in there.</v>

289
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.490
It's actually what can get even more stable.

290
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.620
I have to think about that a while,

291
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.520
but I want you to try him in terms of the what makes homo Lumo indirect mixings

292
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.940
good.
What makes them important?

293
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.970
Overlap.
Overlap.
That's the same in both cases it's the same.

294
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:35.300
Oxygen reactive mixing with the same don't want.
And what else?

295
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.490
If there's high,
if it's a high homo,
what do you,

296
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.400
how would you say,
well,
what's the,
how would the homo here,

297
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.560
the homo here is an unshared payer on oxygen.
The whole low here.

298
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.330
Does it unshared pair on US agenda?
Are they the same?
No,

299
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:55.790
because the on the on the left is taken up by the hydrogen.
Right.
Okay,

300
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.960
so the one on the left has another proton,
which this one doesn't.

301
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.590
That means that the electrons here are more stable,
lower in energy,

302
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.970
and this is a higher hormone which is associated.

303
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.050
Another way of saying the same thing with the fact that that's a negative
charge.

304
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.530
When you have a negative charge,
it's a bad place to put electrons.

305
00:20:15.531 --> 00:20:19.220
They're high in energy.
Another way of setting and the way you said it,

306
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.470
which is probably a better way of saying it,

307
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.980
is that the proton is gone so it's not stable.

308
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.330
So you expect more humble Lumo mixing here because of better energy match.

309
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.720
Then on the left there for the observation that it's 10 to the 11th time,

310
00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:35.960
stronger as an acid.

311
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.590
So it's a higher homo because of that negative charge or the absence of a

312
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.283
proton.

313
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.093
<v 0>Okay,</v>

314
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.420
so there's our carboxylic acid and the last functional group we wanted to talk

315
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.930
about today,
which is a really complicated one.

316
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.800
I mean it starts very simple but you'll see it gets pretty baroque pretty soon

317
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.634
here.

318
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820
So its methyl lithium and the chance of your figuring all this stuff out ahead

319
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.190
of time is about zero,
right?

320
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:09.760
So don't be depressed if this looks like it's getting very complicated.

321
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.810
Remember there,
there are three approaches here.
One is the draw lines.

322
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:17.170
I'll I Lewis to understand how things come together.

323
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.940
Another one is to use a computer to generate molecular orbitals.

324
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.960
Two to break,

325
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:27.550
break the total electron distribution into orbitals and look at them one at a

326
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:32.080
time.
And having seen what the computer produces.

327
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.270
Some of those orbitals are interpretable as we've seen that they're anti bonding

328
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:40.030
in a certain region,
bonding in a certain region and so on,

329
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:45.390
but the chances of you're competing with the computer in drawing accurate

330
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:49.150
molecular orbitals to the extent that molecular orbitals are real,

331
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.750
the chance if you're competing with the computer is not very good.

332
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.810
So don't expect that you can exactly draw them.

333
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.400
But if you see the one that the computer is drawn,

334
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.690
at least in some cases you can make some guesses about it.

335
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:06.820
You can see how many nodes that has,

336
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.480
whether they're our nuclei in the middle of Lobes,

337
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.570
which would make that unstable orbital where it's bonding,

338
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.950
where it's anti-bonding,

339
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.580
those kinds of things you can analyze even though you can't produce them

340
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:21.730
yourself.
So don't think that you're going to be able to write.

341
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.650
But then there's another point of view,

342
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.860
which is to look at localized payers bonds and anti bonds and how they'll come

343
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:32.710
together.
Right.
And that you can do,

344
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.890
that's the intermediate between using just Louis and doing the full molecular

345
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.330
orbital kind of thing.

346
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.110
This is something you can do in your head and that's what we're going to show

347
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:46.870
these different points of view with this one.
So here's methyl lithium.

348
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.830
Now what will make methyl lithium reactive?

349
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.620
What's a high homo of methyl lithium?

350
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.610
<v 2>Marty,
what makes Homo Deus?</v>

351
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.500
What makes for a high homo?
What kind of things do you

352
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.403
<v 1>think about?</v>

353
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.270
Like with the lines,

354
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.740
<v 2>just just with a pair of that.</v>

355
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.220
I'm not trying to make like a slide before where you're doing all that and
stuff,

356
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.470
but just you have two atoms that come together.

357
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.360
Will they give a very high homeowner what determines how far they go up and down

358
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.723
<v 1>the homeowner?</v>

359
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.060
<v 2>What's one thing in terms of overlap?
Okay,</v>

360
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.130
so here are two atoms that are coming right together.

361
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.160
A single bond us and so good overlap.
Let's suppose it's the same as all overlap.

362
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.410
Okay,
what else?

363
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.373
<v 1>Okay,</v>

364
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.740
<v 2>what does it besides overlap determines how far is it?
Good energy.</v>

365
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.600
The energy match right now what's special about methyl lithium?

366
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:12.000
Methyls not going to be funny.
That's our standard thing.
But lithium is funny.

367
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.510
Where is it?
On the periodic table?
Maybe that's the problem we're having

368
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.390
on the far left,
which means it doesn't have a very big nuclear charge.

369
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.290
So does that mean electrons are going to like me in there and not like being

370
00:24:25.291 --> 00:24:28.940
there
because it's not much nuclear charge,

371
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.530
so it's going to be a bad energy match.
High Energy.

372
00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:35.310
So there's going to be a high homo,
right?

373
00:24:35.311 --> 00:24:38.640
The Homo here from the carbon doesn't go down very much because of the bad

374
00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:42.780
energy manager.
Okay,
so this is an unusually high homo.

375
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.830
What will it look like?
Where will it be on the carbon or on the lithium?

376
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.373
<v 1>The homeowner.</v>

377
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.490
<v 2>Is it good?
Is it going to be symmetrical or is it going to be more carbon?</v>

378
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.470
Are going to be more lithium,
more on the carbons.
That's the lower one.

379
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.560
Okay.
So if we want to look at the homo,
this thing,

380
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.540
it's going to be mostly on carbon,

381
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.680
not so much on lithium and an unusually high homo because of the lithium and

382
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.290
there it is.
That's the homo.
Marty,

383
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:18.020
you're going to finish this here by saying what Oracle does it look like?

384
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.980
<v 1>I'll
up</v>

385
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.950
<v 2>here it is.
And there's the orbital.</v>

386
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.040
It's the two p orbital on carbon,

387
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:32.610
mostly right with just a little bit of lithium,

388
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.850
one s or two s pardon me on it,

389
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.050
but just a teeny bit of lithium and it's anti bonding between the lithium and

390
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:40.940
the carpet.
It's the or no,
no wait,

391
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.600
it must be a p orbital on lithium because it's the favorable one.

392
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:48.080
It's the bonding one,
right?
We see the red,
but there's a little,

393
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.030
we see the blue of the lithium,

394
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:53.540
but there's a little red on the other side that we don't see that making a net,

395
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:57.500
which I didn't do.
Okay,
so that's the whole Mo.
It's a sigma.

396
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.710
Now what will the Lumo B,
Hey,

397
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.120
what do you say?
What?
What do you think for a little while of methyl lithium?

398
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.080
Can't hear very well.
Yeah,
don't.

399
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.620
Lithium has a lot of vacant orbitals on the atom,
right?

400
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.940
It comes in with only one valence electron.

401
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.320
Only one of its four valence orbitals is occupied.

402
00:26:22.321 --> 00:26:26.960
So it's got in fact three vacant orbitals.
So that's gotta be Lumo.

403
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.040
There's the Lumo mostly on the lithium.
Okay.

404
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.830
Now,
but the Lumo plus one is this orbital,

405
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.250
which I've drawn in a funny way at a very,

406
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.980
at a relatively high d electron density contour,
making the things

407
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.320
<v 0>very small because if I've made a bigger,</v>

408
00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:50.340
it goes way off the top of the sheet and off the bottom of the sheet cause the,

409
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.860
this orbital isn't held very tightly by lithium.

410
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:57.861
It's sticks way out and it turns out to be out of the range that gets plotted by

411
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:01.330
Spartan.
So you get funny looking holes and the orbital.

412
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:05.970
So I chose this particular density,
but anyhow,
you see it's a PR battle,
right?

413
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.370
That's different sides top and bottom.
Now.
So you have a,

414
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.380
is this an unusually low Lumo?

415
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.020
<v 2>Monique,
what do you say?</v>

416
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.550
I'll let me say something.
I say lithium has a small nuclear

417
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.460
<v 0>charge,
not a very good place for electrons to be.</v>

418
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.760
<v 2>Right.
Which means that,
that,</v>

419
00:27:31.761 --> 00:27:34.860
that it's that it's got to be very high orbital energy.

420
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.710
Can you see any contrary things and say it might be unusual.

421
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.880
<v 1>Hello?
Yeah,</v>

422
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.840
here for long I think it would be

423
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.790
<v 2>because of the low nuclear charge compared to what?</v>

424
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.440
What are we comparing with to say whether oracles or higher levels,

425
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.080
the carbon carbon or carbon,

426
00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.820
hydrogen sigma and Sigma Star bonds.
Right.

427
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.780
So clearly enough the carbon and hydrogen start lower in energy than the lithium

428
00:28:08.811 --> 00:28:09.870
does,
but one,

429
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.200
but they have big overlap.
So sigma star is quite high,

430
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.060
much higher than lithium because it's an atomic or bullet hasn't mixed with

431
00:28:22.061 --> 00:28:24.930
anything.
This one.
Okay,
so it isn't so,

432
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:27.450
so methyl lithium has an unusual,
yeah.

433
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:31.620
<v 0>Low vacant orbital and an unusually high occupied orbital.</v>

434
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:32.640
And what do you expect?

435
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:39.070
<v 2>You ever seen a case like this before where the same molecule was both Bh three.</v>

436
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:42.170
It's very for the exactly the same reason,
right?

437
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:47.300
Except more so because lithium is more so than Boron being further to the left

438
00:28:47.301 --> 00:28:48.380
of the periodic table.

439
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.620
So we can put two of these things above a up and down from one another like this

440
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:58.130
and have the whole role of one be stabilized by the Lumo of the other,

441
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.430
uh,
strike.
Do you again why it has a little bit about,

442
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.300
yeah,
because it's an atomic orbital.
It's not

443
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.560
<v 0>killer,
but it's not a bonding.
Orbitals didn't mix with other things.</v>

444
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.190
The things we're comparing with are not carbon and hydrogen,

445
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.740
which are in fact lower than lithium.

446
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:23.170
It's the sigma and Sigma Star bonds of carbon and hydrogen,
which,
and this,

447
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.520
the Lumo here is higher than that of lithium lithium's unusually low because

448
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:31.620
it's still an atomic orbital didn't mix with anything.
Okay.

449
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.180
So there's stabilization of the sigma by the Pi,

450
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.430
but at the same time we can go the other way on the homo on the top can be

451
00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:42.430
stabilized.
The Lumo on the bottom.

452
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:46.870
Same as in Bh three giving B two h six.

453
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.980
Okay,
so these things dimerize.
They come together,
Homo of one,

454
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:53.650
stabilizing the Lumo or the other and vice versa.

455
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.150
They move together and you get a thing that looks like that very much like B two

456
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:03.100
h six right?
So you have two vacant Lithia,

457
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:07.270
more bundles,
stabilizing the unshared pair of carbon.

458
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.350
You can think of it that way.
And it also goes the other way.

459
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:15.670
The unshared pair on that carbon is stabilized by two vacant lithium's.

460
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:18.603
Okay.

461
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.980
So these are three center to electron bonds just as in B,
two h six.

462
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.920
Okay.
Now,

463
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:31.110
but remember lithium has two other vacant orbitals each Adam,

464
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.880
we've only used one here,
right?

465
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:39.220
So they can combine to give this,
this is actually the Lumo of that dimer,

466
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.750
right?
Those are in the plane of the four membered ring,
right?

467
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.590
And there's another,
there are other vacant orbitals too,
like this pie one,

468
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:51.430
which is in and out from that four membered ring made up of p orbitals on the

469
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:52.264
lithium.

470
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.670
That's the Lumo plus one of that dimer.
Okay,

471
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:02.270
now I'm going to rotate this.
Now pay attention here because it's it.

472
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.600
Get the picture.
The next picture is a little confusing.

473
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.130
I'm going to rotate this thing so that we're looking just a little bit.
Uh,

474
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.670
we're looking mostly in the plane of the molecule,

475
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:17.050
but twisted a little bit so we can see it.
Still see the top of the molecule,

476
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:22.051
and we're going to twist it such that the red lobe in back is behind the red

477
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:23.680
lobe in front.

478
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.490
So what we're going to do is rotate around that axis and shift it tore a little

479
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:32.380
bit toward the center of the picture.

480
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.590
So it's that same orbital and there it is now,

481
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.070
but it's a little confusing in the middle because there's one red lobe in the

482
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:42.730
back and one in the front.
Okay?
Uh,
we could,

483
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.030
we could draw it down.
Okay,
so that's what it is.

484
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:49.990
But we're going to drop an access that goes right through the middle of that

485
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:53.860
square,
that a parallelogram.
Okay?

486
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.750
And now along that axis,
we're going to bring up another molecule,

487
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:04.150
but it's going to be rotated 90 degrees.
So those are the same,

488
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.920
the same two orbitals Lumo plus one.
In both cases,

489
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:12.760
the one bottom has rotated 90 degrees around the axis I drew.

490
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.880
Okay?
Now will those things interact favorably with one another?

491
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.330
And even if they,
their first,
they're orthogonal and second,

492
00:32:25.331 --> 00:32:29.420
even if they mixed,
you wouldn't care.
Why?
Because there mate.

493
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.970
So what we want to do is look at the bottom,
not that Lumo plus one.

494
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.100
We want to look at the whole mo of that one,
that diamond,

495
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.620
which looks like this.

496
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.980
<v 2>And now you see something neat that the blue in front overlaps the blue vacant</v>

497
00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:50.981
one and the red and back up right pop overlaps the behind red vacant one.

498
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:56.660
So the electrons in the home or on the bottom get stabilized by overlapping with

499
00:32:56.661 --> 00:33:01.190
the Lumo plus one on the top.
And of course,
by the same token,

500
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.700
the homo of the one on top overlaps with the Lumo of the one on the bottom like

501
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.194
that.

502
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.370
So we already had two molecules come together to form dimers.

503
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.650
Now we're having two dimers come together to form a tetramer [inaudible]

504
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.260
uh,
because that's the one that does the overlap,

505
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.610
the actual Lumo does it overlap?
This one on the bottom?

506
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.490
Okay,
looking that,
does that mean essentially,

507
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.610
then you go because it's more stabilized.
Uh,
well,

508
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.320
but it mixes with this one.
So the Lube oil plus one and this one interact right?

509
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.910
Here's the homo and they made move plus one.
So the,
okay,

510
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:51.740
so the look,
so it contributes to this one,

511
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.900
right?
When this,

512
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900
when the Hobo here of the dimer mixed with the Lumo plus one of the other diver,

513
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.100
you've got a mixture.
This one looks mostly like the Hobo,
this dimer,

514
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:06.800
but it's a little bit helped out by looking at like the Lumo of this one.

515
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.140
There's a new vacant or a little bit,
it's still hire.

516
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:12.170
You don't care about that one anymore.
Okay,

517
00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:16.940
so now we can take two of these and bring them together.
That's a bonding.

518
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:23.000
The orbitals we just showed
and you get a cube,

519
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.450
right?
So here's the one on the bottom.
One,
two,
three,

520
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.970
four and here's the one on the top.
One,
two,
three,

521
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:36.200
four and they've been turned 90 degrees to line up these orbitals and they come

522
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:41.000
together and the electrons to get more stable.
Now that used on every lithium,

523
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:46.280
another one of its vacant orbitals
right?

524
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.690
But what Angela,
there's another one.
Okay,

525
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.080
so the homeowner

526
00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.730
<v 0>now turns out to be this,</v>

527
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.910
and you can understand that the biggest part of it,

528
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.450
by seeing that it's a four center to electron bond,

529
00:35:01.451 --> 00:35:04.690
mostly it's a p orbital or a hybrid orbital of the carbon.

530
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.610
And unshared pair of carbon,

531
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.840
but it stabilized by three vacant orbitals of lithium.

532
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.850
So three vacant lithium atomic orbitals,
stabilized on shared pair of carbon.

533
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.310
But as Angela points out here,

534
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:24.150
there's another one that's a still a vacant orbital on lithium that's on the top

535
00:35:24.701 --> 00:35:27.310
lithium.
There are other ones on the other three lithium's.

536
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:32.730
So we need more electrons or it's capable of stabilizing more electrons.

537
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.390
Where do you get them?

538
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.040
<v 2>Well,
you might think you bring another Cuba,
but in</v>

539
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.940
<v 0>fact there's something easier to do because this is done in solution.</v>

540
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:43.411
And the solution,

541
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:48.390
the solvent is dyed methyl ether as shown here or some other ether,

542
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.490
which has an unshared pair of electrons and it comes along and get stabilized by

543
00:35:54.491 --> 00:35:58.480
that.
But at the same time,
the other three oxygens,

544
00:35:58.481 --> 00:36:03.460
the other orange balls,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
the other three lithium's I should say,

545
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.820
stabilize oxygen's of other ethers.

546
00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:10.821
So you have for ether molecules associated with the tetramer of methyl lithium.

547
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.290
And this is about as complex as we're ever going to get,

548
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:17.560
<v 1>right?</v>

549
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.700
<v 0>So I think you would have had a hard time at the outset predicting this.</v>

550
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.970
But having seen it,
I think you can understand it.

551
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.520
That's what we're aiming for at this stage

552
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.500
because as we go on and get lore that this reacts with this and gives this the,

553
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.280
what I want you to be able to do is to look at it and say,
Aha,

554
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.370
that's what happened.
That's why that reacted that way.

555
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.100
Not necessarily in some cases you'll be able to predict,

556
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.120
but in other cases you'll be able to understand and correlate it with what you

557
00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:50.140
know.
So if you put more ether in,
if it's,
if it's,

558
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.940
you have a lot of excess ether,

559
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.240
then it rips these things apart so it can fly a party.

560
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.470
You get a bunch of ethers on every lithium.

561
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.060
<v 1>Right.</v>

562
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.710
<v 0>And in fact,
this is,
this is a further,
uh,</v>

563
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.203
uh,

564
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.750
development of organic chemistry beyond what we usually do in a elementary

565
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:17.200
chorus,
which is to understand the non bonded interactions.

566
00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:21.280
Because often you wouldn't consider that oxygen lithium to be a real bond is

567
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:26.050
just sort of a weak salvation thing.
Although truly it is a bond.
Okay.

568
00:37:26.051 --> 00:37:30.190
So these so called non bonded interactions and the effects of solvent are a

569
00:37:30.191 --> 00:37:34.720
vital part of Lore.
What solve it.
You choose for a given reaction.
Uh,

570
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.390
for example,
if you want to facilitate ionization,

571
00:37:37.391 --> 00:37:39.460
you use certain solvents and not other solvents.

572
00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:40.900
And we'll talk about that a little bit,

573
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.370
but I just want you to show what to show you what there is out there beyond the

574
00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:47.410
bonding that we've already talked about.
But we've,

575
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.730
we've really taken theory pretty far here in the first half of the first

576
00:37:51.731 --> 00:37:54.870
semester of the course.
Now,
uh,

577
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:58.180
I said we would vote and I forgot to bring a piece of paper.

578
00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.830
I have this piece of paper,

579
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.680
but I'm not gonna use it for that cause this is the thank you note.

580
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:07.210
So if you want to,
if you haven't signed what's fastened around,

581
00:38:07.211 --> 00:38:09.640
cause there are few people who haven't signed it.
Well let's pass it down,

582
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.760
back and forth,
down the aisles.
I think most people have signed it,

583
00:38:12.761 --> 00:38:16.360
but some have it,
you don't have to.
And uh,
you also don't have to contribute.

584
00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:18.400
But if you want to be,
uh,

585
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.510
have a sense of satisfaction of having contributed to the class gift,

586
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.110
you can leave a small coin on the table over there.
Okay.

587
00:38:26.111 --> 00:38:28.810
But the other business we have to transact is,

588
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.360
I'm going to give a review session before the exam,

589
00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:33.010
but it's not obvious when we should give it.

590
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.050
So I decided that the easiest thing to is to see how many people cannot,

591
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.220
how many people,
not first.
We want people,
not only that can,

592
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:46.750
but would come,
right?
If you could come,
but wouldn't,
you're irrelevant.

593
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.680
So the question is how many people cannot err,

594
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.270
uh,
would come other times,
but cannot come at the time shown.

595
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.750
And the one that has the fewest will win.
That makes sense.

596
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.900
<v 2>Okay.
So how many people cannot come?
Uh,
uh,</v>

597
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.940
Thursday evening,
eight o'clock.
That's too many.

598
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.580
However,
eight 30

599
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.730
the here we have about that.
My judges,
about 15.

600
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.300
Uh,
how many,
uh,

601
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.500
how many cannot come in Friday afternoons.
Lab.

602
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.470
Okay.
Uh,
how many people could not come Saturday?
Early

603
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.913
Salon.

604
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.080
How many a Saturday at 10.
Can I,
how many Saturday at two?

605
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.480
How many Sunday?
Uh,
how many Sunday?
One to three.

606
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.580
Well,
bear in mind that there's also the ta session Sunday evening.

607
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.430
I think it's better if I do it.
Uh,
you know,

608
00:40:02.431 --> 00:40:05.460
two days before the exam rather than the day before.
But on the other hand,

609
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.350
none of these earlier times can get there.
They're always at least 15 people.
Let,

610
00:40:10.351 --> 00:40:13.320
let me,
let me see about,
about option two.

611
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:18.210
That was the one Thursday at eight 30.
How about if it were nine?

612
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.930
How many,
how many could not come up?

613
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:25.710
Was at nine Thursday evening,
tomorrow evening.

614
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.610
That actually is.
And what,
let's see,
Sunday again,
Sunday,
early sometime,

615
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.530
early afternoon.
Those are,

616
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.240
they're actually more who can't come on Sunday then Thursday.
So I'm sorry,

617
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.560
but it'll be a Thursday.
It could be eight 30 or nine in.

618
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:46.500
Does it make a difference?
Is there somebody who'd come?
If we started at nine,

619
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.400
pardon me,
Saturday what?

620
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.840
Saturday was pretty bad.
But let me see.
Saturday nine.

621
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.070
Yeah,
that's worse.
Saturday,

622
00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:07.071
10 Saturday to Saturday 8:00 PM

623
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.940
so it'll be,
it'll be tomorrow.
It'll be tomorrow night.

624
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.000
It'll be tomorrow night at eight 30 and I'll send you an email once I got a
room.

625
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.200
Okay,
let's continue.
Okay,

626
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.650
<v 0>so to summarize,</v>

627
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:28.651
the first half of the semester we've seen amazing modern tools that show us

628
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.910
molecules,

629
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.940
the real thing at the level of angst drums and at the timescale of picoseconds

630
00:41:36.191 --> 00:41:38.190
10 to the minus 12 seconds.
Uh,

631
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:42.180
we've seen scanning probe microscopy that can feel Adams and,

632
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:47.530
and x Ray de fraction that can see them and can see bonds with difference

633
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:49.700
density.
We've seen spectroscopy,

634
00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:54.470
IRR and Esr and next semester we'll talk about nuclear magnetic resonance.

635
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.190
So there are amazing tools,
not only experimental tools,

636
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.200
but theoretical tools.

637
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:04.970
This stuff about quantum mechanics so that then people believe quantum mechanics

638
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:09.971
enough that they talk about doing calculations on a computer as experiments,

639
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:16.130
right?
Rather than just things you do in the lab.
So that's amazing.
Right?

640
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:20.570
And it all has developed fairly recently,
say since the Thai.

641
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.210
Uh,
most of the important things we've talked about have developed since I was in

642
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:27.260
graduate school.

643
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:33.850
But what's amazing is that organic chemists were not at all surprised when they

644
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:40.400
were finally able to see these things because they already knew what they looked

645
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:44.450
like.
So it wasn't surprising.
It was,

646
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.220
it was satisfying.

647
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:50.180
And there were a few little queer things that are understood better now than

648
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:52.580
they were before,
certainly.
Right.

649
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.510
And things like being able to generalize about what makes a functional group

650
00:42:56.511 --> 00:42:58.610
that's completely new,
right?

651
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.990
But fundamentally what molecules look like and how atoms behave and that this

652
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:05.330
reacts with this.
That was already known.

653
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.610
So how could they possibly know it when they didn't have these tools?

654
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.930
And that's going to be our chore for the Next Quarter or the semester is to

655
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:19.100
figure out how they knew.
How did organic chemistry really developed.

656
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.000
And a reason for this is that if you know how it developed,

657
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.410
then you understand the language much better because the language we use isn't

658
00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:29.060
the language of quantum mechanics.

659
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:34.040
Usually it's the language that developed during this a long gestation period.

660
00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:37.130
And it started as we said before in the 17th century.

661
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.000
And we've gone on this and we've talked now about science,

662
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:45.650
the scientific method and forced laws and how we finally found out what the

663
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:48.170
force law was for Adams.
Right?

664
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.690
And in the 20th century,

665
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.670
this whole theoretical experimental stuff came together and we saw that bonds

666
00:43:55.671 --> 00:44:00.671
were shared electrons and we could see them and the quantum mechanics could help

667
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:01.760
us to understand them.

668
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.680
But we've left out this middle period starting with the end of the 18th century

669
00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:11.681
with Lavoie Zaa discovering oxidation and ending with the discovery of quantum

670
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:12.321
mechanics.

671
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:17.300
Cause this is the period during which most of organic chemistry developed.

672
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.890
And we have to see how it happened.
Okay.
So this,

673
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.030
if you've been here 107 years ago and been graduating,

674
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.620
you would have been in this picture with your,
uh,
with your,
uh,

675
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.520
fancy boots and so on.
Right?
This is the computer science building.

676
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:39.690
You walk up now,
it used to be the chemistry lab on the right.

677
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:43.350
You know where it is?
Watson Watson lab down there.

678
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:48.440
Okay.
So let's look at some,
see what they understood at the time.

679
00:44:48.441 --> 00:44:52.520
They chalked things on the bricks to show show off their knowledge.

680
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.250
So here's ch four methane.

681
00:44:55.251 --> 00:44:59.900
Obviously they knew that and here's the reaction of sulfuric acid with zinc,

682
00:44:59.901 --> 00:45:04.400
which gives hydrogen.
They knew that.
And here,
what do you think?

683
00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:06.170
That crazy thing is in the middle

684
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.580
<v 2>that's a benzene ring and remember how it looks like,</v>

685
00:45:10.581 --> 00:45:14.590
but they confirmed at about the same time the clairvoyant people saw that that

686
00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.910
valence is all went to the center.
Okay.

687
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.130
And down here you'll see another thing.

688
00:45:21.131 --> 00:45:25.060
Those are probably aromatic rings with the double bonds not shown,

689
00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.840
but an interesting thing that showed is that the Greek letters alpha and Beta

690
00:45:28.841 --> 00:45:31.480
there,
those are symbols that are still used

691
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.550
<v 0>to denote different positions that you can put substituents in the ring.</v>

692
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.290
Okay.
This is inside the chemistry lab,

693
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.700
which was in asset where sss is now.
And uh,

694
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.150
you'll see things like,
like this,

695
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:51.230
<v 1>right,</v>

696
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.430
<v 2>which came from that lab.</v>

697
00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:55.730
I'm sure there was a big box of them floating around here.

698
00:45:55.731 --> 00:45:57.970
And I rescued one on one time to go.

699
00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.580
The others got thrown out there.
And,

700
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.050
and what's,
what's that second Arrow?
There's another important tool.

701
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.070
Bunsen burner
Bunsen lit,

702
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:16.970
invented the burner about 1860 or something like that.
Or Seventies.
Okay.

703
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.010
Here there's one that looks just like this,
right?

704
00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.960
Actually this isn't that old because it says on it,
uh,

705
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.960
West Germany.
So it's interesting.

706
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.780
Okay,
what do we see here?
The white thing,
mortar and Pestle,

707
00:46:37.781 --> 00:46:41.650
they can grind things up right?
And there.
What's that?

708
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.580
It's a beer at dry upside notice.

709
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.340
That's the only quantitative tool.

710
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.430
<v 0>So were there any other quantitative tools in this picture that they were</v>

711
00:46:57.431 --> 00:46:58.270
showing off?

712
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.060
<v 1>Well,
there's some,</v>

713
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.770
<v 2>uh Huh.
Anything else that will give you a number?</v>

714
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.770
Oh,
but that's just a crude balance,
right?
There were,

715
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.440
they had analytical balances but they weren't portable.

716
00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:28.310
They couldn't let them out the prospect street from the picture.
Okay.

717
00:47:28.311 --> 00:47:31.490
But that was
okay.

718
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.550
This guy here

719
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:38.891
look like that.

720
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:43.891
See Mail and climb class of 1901 s and you know his name because Glaxo Smith

721
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:50.731
Kline and he gave the money for the Cline biology tower in the Klein Chemistry.

722
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.200
Lie over the client.
Geology via to client.

723
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.210
But you can also measure Christmas

724
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.900
<v 0>angles on crystals.
Right?
But that's about it.</v>

725
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.790
Somehow with these tools,

726
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.860
they figured out where Adam's were in molecules.
Isn't that crazy?

727
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.130
So if you look at the front of the building,

728
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:16.750
you'll see down here he's wrapped and stuff now cause they're painting him,

729
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.910
Benjamin Solomon,

730
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.140
Yale's first scientists or first chemist anyhow,

731
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.920
and he's holding something.
He didn't see what he's holding

732
00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.330
<v 2>big flopping crystal.
That's where science was.</v>

733
00:48:34.331 --> 00:48:38.020
That that's what he's mostly known for his mineralogical things.

734
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.790
Okay.
But here on these plaques is something else.

735
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.050
This is the names of the people who actually developed all this stuff during

736
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:48.280
that 19th century.

737
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.560
So it starts in the 17th century actually with boil and the gas laws.

738
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:56.470
But that was way before notice.
He's a hundred.

739
00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.790
He was born 120 years before the time we're talking about [inaudible].

740
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.560
So things happen,

741
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:07.120
but not a lot from our purposes during that period really got underway with the

742
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:10.450
second person.
These are,
these are in chronological order.

743
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.660
The second one is Lavoie [inaudible] and that's where we're going to start.

744
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.110
And then dailies doctorates alias fairly.
They were going to talk about these

745
00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.250
<v 0>people.
Okay.</v>

746
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:23.490
And here is you and your cousins who did all this stuff because we have a family

747
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:27.790
tree here.
So there's you

748
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:29.923
<v 2>and me.</v>

749
00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:35.840
And I studied quantum mechanics as a graduate student with Evie Wilson.
Right?

750
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:41.260
Who was a postdoc with Linus Pauling at cal tech who did ex-ray in proteins.

751
00:49:42.021 --> 00:49:46.040
He's the first guy that saw the healer,
the proteins.
Okay.

752
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.780
And another postdoc.
Appalling was jack done it.
So we've talked about a lot.

753
00:49:50.781 --> 00:49:55.220
So donuts who we've talked about a lot is your great uncle academically.

754
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.090
But if we go back around,
Oh,
and here are things.
Notice how many of these things,

755
00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.010
the 20th century things we've talked about,

756
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.290
the shared that notice that that bold face is things that are experimental

757
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.680
<v 0>and,
and uh,
normal faces is theoretical things.</v>

758
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.290
Shared pair bonds me,
som or ISM,

759
00:50:16.291 --> 00:50:20.400
which is resonance electron pair shifts,
the curved arrows,

760
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.890
quantum theory reaction mechanisms.

761
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:27.800
We already talked about a mo ammonia being oxidized by chlorine example,

762
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.200
IRS spectrus we talked about,
we haven't talked about,
well,

763
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:33.740
we've talked a little about polymers.
Not much.
We haven't done mass spectroscopy.

764
00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.770
Well,
we did actually the problem set and the first thing,
right?

765
00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.320
A confirmational analysis we'll do at the end of the semester x-ray.

766
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.700
We've talked about Nmr next semester.
Molecular orbital methods.

767
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:44.690
We've talked about a lot.

768
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.450
This is what we've been talking about that we'll do at the end of the semester.

769
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.570
A non covalent structure structures.
We just talked about a little bit,

770
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.930
scanning probe microscopes,
quite recent,
so on.

771
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.200
So we've actually talked about a lot of this stuff already,

772
00:50:57.201 --> 00:51:01.130
the more recent stuff,
but what we want to talk about now is the earlier stuff,

773
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:04.550
how people discovered things in the 19th century.

774
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.470
So these are the guys that did it.

775
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.520
And in particular we're starting with Lavoie Ca.

776
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.260
But Lavoie was not the first altogether.
Uh,

777
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:19.220
but I'm going to have to wait until next time to tell you who was first.
