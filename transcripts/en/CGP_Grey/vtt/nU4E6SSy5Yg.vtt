00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.399
Hello Internet,

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.790
I want to talk about Canada who this week
made my reason-to-like her list one item longer

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.680
by deciding to abolish the penny.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.889
Since I previously made a video called 'Death
to Pennies' it should come as no surprise

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.339
that this move gets a big 'Go Canada!' from
me.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.050
So lets take a moment to cheer Canada for
her economic rationalism, look at how getting

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.510
rid of a coin works in practice, and remind
her sister to the South why she might want

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.119
to do the same.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.259
Canada's plan is pretty simple: in a couple
months the Royal Canadian Mint will switch

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.999
the penny making machine from on, to off.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.999
That's it.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.050
Pretty much nothing else in the world is going
to change.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.940
Pennies will still be be legal tender in Canada,
so that jar of several hundred that you'll

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.410
never bother to count will always be worth
just as much as it is today.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
And In shops there will still be that person
who pays with exact change.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
But after they've tediously counted out their
precious (worthless) pennies the shop will

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.100
send them to back to the Royal Canadian Mint
to be melted down.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.710
Thus the supply of pennies will slowly decrease
over time in pleasant half-life curve.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.390
But, while the penny will functionally go
away, prices listed in one-cent intervals

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.390
will not.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.210
Your coffee and TimBits will still cost the
same and when you get to the cash register

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.030
the total amount after tax will still have
single cents.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.900
And if you pay by card, that exact amount
will be deducted from your account.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.110
The only difference is if you pay in cash,
not card, *and* you don't have any pennies

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.790
with which to waste everyone else's time then
the price will be rounded to the nearest five

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.790
cents.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.280
And yes, in rounding sometimes you win and
sometimes you lose but -- and this is the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.140
rather salient point -- either way a one or
two cent difference isn't worth caring about.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.030
Which is why Canada can safely jettison the
penny in the first place.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
Inevitably, thought, this is the point in
the discussion when pro-penny people propose

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.159
that ditching the worthless coin will make
prices go up and your savings go down.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.630
But the evidence for this claim is nonexistent
because many countries have done this before

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.729
with no ill effect.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.100
Sure, coin collectors and inefficiency fans
will be sad to see the penny go but overall

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.159
it's a big win for Canada because printing
money isn't free.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.260
The cost to make a one-cent penny is 1.6 cents.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.979
So every year when Canada visited the mint
she spent 29 million dollars to buy 18 million

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.210
dollars worth of pennies -- effectively throwing
away 11 million dollars a year.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.299
Now, obviously ditching pennies won't single-handedly
balance the budget but it's the easiest most

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.979
rational place to start.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.170
Congratulations Canada!

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.880
May others follow in your path.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.880
P.S.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.149
If you want to know more about why the United
States in particular should get rid of pennies

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.879
you can either watch my video on the topic
or listen to fellow penny-hater John Green

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.800
get arm-wavingly angry about not only pennies,
but also nickels, which are even worse.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.639
Also There should be a new main video up in
the next week or two but if you want to help

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.840
me make them faster you go here on my website
to help out with the fact-checking for upcoming

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
projects.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.159
Thanks for watching.
