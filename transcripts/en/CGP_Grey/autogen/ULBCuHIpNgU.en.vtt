00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.760
 This is not the Confederate national flag. 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.760
 This is not the Confederate national flag. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.329
 When the US separated in two during the civil war, this was the flag that 

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:11.490
 His rebel side used: The Bonnie Blava, copied from the Republic of East Florida. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.290
 Not seriously This country existed: due to a border conflict between Spain and the USA 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.630
 On the sale of Louisiana gave local rebels the opportunity to take control of a fort and in 1810, declare 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.419
 independence, with the required flag and a functional government - for 78 days. 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.470
 The US put an end to that. 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.169
 Anyway, we move forward to the Civil War when Mississippi separated from the Union and 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.180
 It adopted the flag of the small country that had been found within its borders. And it turned 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 On the unofficial flag of the revolt, but for a long time. Blue does not persuade 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.860
 It's a Yankee color. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.190
 The new confederal government asked for proposals and received several. 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.480
 Including those of a German-Prussian artist from Alabama who was possibly inspired 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.540
 in the Austrian Empire. I in Betsy Ross. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 (Note to the margin: since we speak of names with erroneous names, Betsy Ross probably did not design this one 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.340
 flag - there is no evidence that you give credit to the legend, just stories long after you die. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.550
 In the style of Godiva maiden. But we are turning aside.) 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.940
 The confederal government selected it as its official flag and called it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.900
 "Stars and Bars" - so to name this other stars and bars is bad for two reasons: it is not his name, 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 This is a cross. That's bars. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 The new flag was adopted outside the war, but in the battlefield, the similarity with the flag of the Union 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100
 He was confused, along with all the terror and smoke. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.890
 However the Confederation followed the flag, but the army wanted to avoid fire friend 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.350
 so he chose one of the rejected designs and made it a war flag. 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 Navy also liked the design and eventually also changed it, although using a lighter blue 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 and supposedly less Yankee. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 The popularity of the official flag fell to the Confederation as time went by 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 (although the number of stars was increasing) while the popularity of the war flag grew. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.729
 So in 1863 the Confederate government again tried again, and chose the target by sticking the flag 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.100
 of war to one corner. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.220
 This was "better" in the sense that the flag seemed less yankee, but "worse" 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.790
 in which now the international symbol to surrender was in the background. 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.270
 The army kept its design. 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.100
 Two years later the Confederate government tried again, adding a red bar 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.830
 and a new name "aggressive" (The blood-stained flag). In addition the new flag made the flag of war more rectangular. 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.700
 So it could no longer be confused with the white flag and it was the last flag, since 36 days later 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.720
 the confederacy surrendered. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.890
 So this design technically was never the flag of the allied government - but ... 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.390
 close enough
