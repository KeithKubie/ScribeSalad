00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.420
P is the center
of the green arc.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.880
So this is p right over here.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.550
The measure of angle
P is 0.4 radians,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.400
and the length of the
radius is 5 units.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.250
That's this length
right over here.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.680
Find the length
of the green arc.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.910
So just to kind of
conceptualize this a little bit,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.510
P, you can imagine, is the
center of this larger circle.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.940
And this angle
right over here that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.660
has a measure of 0.4 radians, it
intercepts this green arc right

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.479
over here.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.270
In order to figure this
out-- and actually,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.228
I encourage you to pause
this video now and try

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:44.050
to think about this
question on your own.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.640
How long is this arc,
given the information

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940
that they've given us?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.330
Well, all we have to
do is remind ourselves

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.410
what a radian is.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.380
One way to think about a radian
is if you look at the arc

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.140
that the angle intercepts, which
is this green arc, if you think

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.650
about its length, the
length of this green arc

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.560
is going to be 0.4 radii.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.170
One way to think
about radians is

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.570
if this angle is
0.4 radians, that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.150
means that the arc
that it intercepts

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.630
is going to be 0.4 radii long.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.730
So this length we could
write as 0.4 radii.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.600
Or "radiuses," but "radii"
is the proper term.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.860
Now, we don't want our
length in terms of radii.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.790
We want our length in terms
of whatever units the radius

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.060
is, these kind of 5 units.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.700
Well, we know that each
radius has a length of 5,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.800
that our radius of the
circle has a length of 5.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.730
So this is going to
be 0.4 radii times 5--

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.900
and you know they just call
it units right over here.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.490
I'll put it in quotes because
it's kind of a generic term--

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.100
5 units per radii.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.210
So the radii cancel out.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.460
We're left with just the
units, which is what we want.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.039
So 0.4 times 5 is 2.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.140
So this is going
to be equal to 2.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.530
So just as a
refresher again, when

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.900
the angle measure
in radians, one way

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.810
to think about it is the
arc that it intercepts,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.950
that's going to be
this many radii long.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.680
Well, if each radius
is 5 units, it's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.673
going to be 0.4 times
5 units long, or 2.
