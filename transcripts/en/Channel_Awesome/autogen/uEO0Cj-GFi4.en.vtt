then the more thing about like yeah that
 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.710
then the more thing about like yeah that
gliders been like there from the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720
gliders been like there from the
 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.330
gliders been like there from the
beginning it's gonna be weird just that

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340
beginning it's gonna be weird just that
 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.610
