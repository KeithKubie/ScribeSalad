00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:15.283
Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:20.988
Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.577
When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled,

00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:28.253
which is expected before the end
of the 21st century,

00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:30.583
researchers project global temperatures

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:35.602
will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.623
If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius,

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:43.675
then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:46.491
with some regions becoming drier
and less productive,

00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:50.588
but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive.

00:00:50.588 --> 00:00:56.062
On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude

00:00:56.062 --> 00:01:01.939
to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.715
when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick.

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:11.040
So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.750
So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.294
with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future.

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:22.778
The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large

00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:27.567
to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:33.279
But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.575
hasn't changed in 35 years.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.707
Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down?

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:44.566
The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough.

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.844
But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem.

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:50.292
In order to predict how
the temperature will change,

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:53.947
scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.981
the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing.

00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:00.640
A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.154
between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space,

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:09.636
like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases.

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:13.114
To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down.

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:15.663
We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity

00:02:15.663 --> 00:02:18.031
from the experiment that we've already

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.964
performed in the industrial age 
since 1750

00:02:20.964 --> 00:02:24.516
and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:29.186
for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:31.590
To do this, we need to know
two things:

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.560
First, the global temperature rise
since 1750,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.349
and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.480
relative to the pre-industrial climate.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.043
For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities

00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:47.560
have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.653
which have warmed the planet.

00:02:49.653 --> 00:02:53.351
But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:57.794
of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet.

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.131
Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:05.435
from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.896
So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known.

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:14.239
But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.223
And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity.

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:21.601
To understand pre-industrial cloudiness,

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.401
we must use computer models
that reliably simulate

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.398
the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds.

00:03:28.398 --> 00:03:32.038
Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick,

00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:34.263
but that's only one type of aerosol.

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:39.116
Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air.

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:40.570
They are either primary,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.389
from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass,

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.188
or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere,

00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:51.940
also known as particle nucleation.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.786
Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere,

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:58.282
and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments,

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:01.747
or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:07.555
More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed.

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:11.320
So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.201
and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water.

00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.507
The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life.

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:22.645
So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles.

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:24.207
However, despite their importance,

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:26.738
how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere

00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:30.334
and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood.

00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:33.681
Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.280
are not well established

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.197
because they're present in only
minute amounts,

00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:42.410
near one molecule per million million
molecules of air.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.303
This lack of understanding
is the main reason

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:48.294
for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity,

00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:52.680
and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.538
However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, "Cloud"

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:01.301
has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.996
and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can,

00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:11.231
for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions

00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.094
in the laboratory.

00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:17.184
In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:20.608
responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere,

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:24.422
which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines,

00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:27.059
and biogenic vapors from trees.

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.598
Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron,

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:34.844
Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays

00:05:34.844 --> 00:05:38.865
enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds.

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:43.526
This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:47.077
since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere

00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:49.918
varies with solar activity.

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:53.460
So Cloud is addressing two big questions:

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.600
Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.069
And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities?

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.232
That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century.

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:12.735
And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability

00:06:12.735 --> 00:06:15.941
in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:18.533
of galactic cosmic rays on clouds?

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:23.745
Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.
