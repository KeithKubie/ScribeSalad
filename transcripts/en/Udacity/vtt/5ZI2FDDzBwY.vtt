00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.120
We ended at the following iteration.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.320
We looked at how linear regression performed on our initial feature set and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.200
decided to reduce the feature set to a simpler selection, specifically the top

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.000
three performing features, Hershey's, Kit Kat, and Airheads.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.620
Simpler models are usually more effective.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.160
Than complex models.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.970
In particular, reducing the number of features as much as possible to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.130
those that matter most is almost always beneficial.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.580
Moreover, lower numbers of features avoid the curse of dimensionality.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.230
Which is something that we'll talk about much more later on this course.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.790
Let's now evaluate the newer model with the reduced feature set.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.180
And in this plot just as before, the green line refers to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
the true inter selection time and the blue line refers to our model.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.225
Now, in this model.

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:50.380
Our predictors using less information to predict the demand for Starburst.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.590
You can see here the result of doing so.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
Notice that our predicted line is a bit less jagged than the line that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520
uses all of the features.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.690
Which indicates that we're over-fitting less.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.069
Revising the feature set choice from the question phase successfully resulted in

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.560
reducing overfitting.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.190
We can also see now the new means square error of our new model.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.510
Now let's make a plot on the test set.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.860
The overfitting issue has been somewhat resolved, but now we need to

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.910
examine the issue of our model missing the spikes in interselection time.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.630
Clearly this time we cannot avoid having to make a different choice at

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.240
the model phase
