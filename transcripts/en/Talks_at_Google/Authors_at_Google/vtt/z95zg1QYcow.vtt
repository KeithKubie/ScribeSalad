00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:03.120
JAMES MULCAHY: Do you want to do
some deep thoughts to start out

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
or--

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.370
ANDREW ZIMMERN: I'm hot toast.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.790
I'm higher than most.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.410
I'm not from France,
but I love French toast.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.150
I'm the chief of relief,
contain the wild beast,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.480
the finesse of the West,
the masterpiece of the East.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.410
Thank you.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.550
Thank you.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.384
AUDIENCE: If this TV
thing doesn't work out.

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:22.758
JAMES MULCAHY:
Yeah, that was not

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:24.220
planned ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.910
ANDREW ZIMMERN: I
shamed-- I would

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.451
love to say I just
through of it now,

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:32.470
but I shamed Alain
Ducasse with that

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.025
three weeks ago at
an event that he

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:40.005
was being a complete and total
disappointment for-- seeing

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:46.140
your heroes just jerks
is just one of the worst

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.960
things in the world to see.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.750
The emperor has
no clothes, right?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.570
I mean, it's awful.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.550
I'm sure all of you Denny
Hastert fans feel the same way.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.220
I mean, it was awful.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.660
I was at an event and Ducasse
was less than participatory,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.720
even though he'd agreed to do
certain things at the event.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.230
And so as the quasi-MC
friend of the hosts

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.700
kind of guy with
the microphone, I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.200
decided the only way to get back
at him would be to rap at him,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.520
and then ask him if
he was uncomfortable.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.630
He was.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.380
It was a personal
career highlight for me.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810
Anyway, I digress.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.185
JAMES MULCAHY:
No, this is great.

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.531
We've never opened with
a good rap battle story.

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:32.447
It's one of the best
ways of solving problems.

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:34.230
ANDREW ZIMMERN: It's an anarchy.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.600
I'm an anarchist.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.410
In life, we are making bread.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.600
I am yeast.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.410
I mean, this is not
a fucking salad.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.050
I mean, we're making bread.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.880
JAMES MULCAHY: In
that kind of spirit,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580
let's do introductions quickly.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.640
Yeast, anarchist, chef,
blogger, television personality,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.240
James Beard Award
winner, everyone

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240
knows who this guy
is, Andrew Zimmern.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.013
He is here today to
talk to us about--

00:01:59.013 --> 00:02:00.745
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.450
--he just went to
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.658
And when I asked him-- by
the way, I'm James Mulcahy.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.470
I'm the executive
producer of Zagat video.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.180
Watch us on youtube.com/zagat.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.800
So we were chatting about what
we wanted to talk about today.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.710
And Andrew said he wants to talk
about the broken food system

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.499
and how to fix it.

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.290
I assume it's going to
take more than a rap

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.249
battle to fix that one.

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.456
ANDREW ZIMMERN: You know,
we've tried everything else

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:22.300
and it hasn't
worked, so why not?

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.140
Why not?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.860
Hamburger Helper just
did a hip hop album

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.710
as a promotional activation.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.530
I don't know, anyone here seen
or heard the Hamburger Helper--

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.280
one person did.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.720
I mean, it is marketing magic.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.510
Their sales of Hamburger
Helper went up 27%.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.850
More people, in the first week,
touched that activation then

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.780
saw all of their ads
aggregated in the United States

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.880
over the course of a year.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.330
It was the most successful
thing that General Mills

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.890
has done in the marketing space
in years-- years and years.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.330
And like all big
corporations, I'm

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.270
crossing my fingers that they
will do it again and learn

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.320
from that.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.700
So I don't think it's that.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.080
It may not be that far off
to say maybe a rap battle

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440
isn't such a bad idea with that.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.772
You know, giant
corporations-- I love

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:23.980
saying these kinds of things.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.690
I've just realized I'm sitting
in a giant corporation.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.300
Giant corporations get
really, really risk averse.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.440
And it becomes really
tough territory for them.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.560
Has anybody--
there's a TV newcomer

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.600
named Anthony Bourdain.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.702
Anybody hear of him?

00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:40.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.120
My first season at Travel
Channel and his second season,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.050
the network aired
a special episode

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.810
where I did a half
hour alone of my show,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.670
then Tony was in the second
half hour of the show.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.850
Then I was in the first
half hour of his show.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.530
Then he did a half hour alone
to conclude his show's hour.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.620
So it was like a real
crossover, but I guess, well,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.470
two hour-- anyway, you
get the idea, right?

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.190
And at the time, it was
the highest rated thing

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.130
Travel Channel had
ever done other

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.459
than like one weird episode
of "World's Best Beaches"

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.810
and some fluke on
the poker tour show

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.550
during a political State of
the Union speech or something.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.387
By the way, Travel Channel
ratings go through the roof

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:29.220
whenever there is like
a presidential speech

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.764
and everyone wants to go
to lifestyle that night.

00:04:33.764 --> 00:04:34.930
And they never did it again.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.060
And I ask every single year,
not just with me and Tony,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.150
but why not this talent
and that-- and the fans

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.150
love that kind of stuff.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.370
So you can never overestimate
or underestimate-- I'm not sure

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.120
which it is-- the power
of a giant corporation

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.590
to make the wrong decision.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.970
Let's get back on topic.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.540
JAMES MULCAHY: So kind
of a broad stroke first,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.430
this broken food system that
you want to talk about today.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.860
My question is, how broken
is it and how bad is it?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.260
What point are we at right now?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.450
ANDREW ZIMMERN:
It's really broken.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.130
It's really bad.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.730
And we're at a-- I think
we're at a momentous time

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.110
where we can slide into the
abyss and be done with it.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.680
And I'm talking about good
food for all as we know.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.160
Let's just call
it-- drop labels.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.196
I hate the organic, natural.

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:25.570
I mean, all those
names have been

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.980
co-opted and branded
and mislegislated.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.550
You can call something
organic on a shelf,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.010
but you're allowed to spray
it with every pesticide known

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.680
to man before the plant
flowers or blooms, which

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.441
is the beginning of the
fruit or vegetable growth.

00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:45.440
I don't know how many
botanists are in the room,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.712
but this is the most
ridiculous law of all time.

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:50.920
I mean, all these chemicals
go into our water system.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.230
They damage our fields.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.400
It hurts crop rotations,
a lot of fallout

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.840
from these kinds of issues.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.810
But there it is, you can
still call it organic.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.710
You can call something
organic or natural

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.310
on the shelves if it's, what,
89% or 93% natural organic,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.740
only a certain number of
the ingredients in there.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.929
And I'm misstating it maybe
by a percentage point or two.

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:11.970
But that's not important.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.570
The idea is that the
words are meaningless.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.430
We all know what a real
food system looks like,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.670
which is abundant food that's
healthy and good for us

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.020
available for all.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.860
I mean it's just kind
of a simple concept.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.124
But I believe--

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.540
Let me just define
a couple terms.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.470
I believe we are midway in a 25,
30 year social change movement

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.390
sufficient to recover
from the damage

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.990
that we've done
to our food system

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.420
over the last 50, 60 years.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.900
Social change movement took
25, 30 years for seat belt

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.060
legislation appropriate
so that now my child, when

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.770
I get into the car--
I literally have

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.980
to strap in before I
actually get in the car.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.890
Because, Dad, your seat belt.
But that's the coolest thing

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.400
in the whole world.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.980
Smoking cigarettes was really
cool when I was my son's age.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.380
It's not really cool now.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.330
And there's warning
labels on the boxes.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.010
Stronger warning labels, by the
way, in Europe than over here.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.190
I don't know how many of
you buy cigarettes overseas,

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.770
but there's this giant white
label with black writing

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.070
that says, this package may
kill you or will kill you.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.500
I mean, it's amazing.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.310
But it took 25, 30 years for
us to destroy the Marlboro Man.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.860
We're in the middle of this
social change movement.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.430
We can continue to pursue
policies, lifestyles.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.460
And all of us turn a
blind eye to the fact

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.380
that eating well, as
we defined it earlier,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.405
is a class issue in America.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.030
We can ignore that fact, or we
can do something to change it.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.470
It used to be an embarrassment
in the late '70s, early '80s

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.650
when I came into the food
scene as a young cook,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.960
fresh off the boat
from Europe and Asia

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.870
where I'd been staging, trying
to put together a college

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.180
career, trying to figure out
where I belonged in the food

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.720
system as a professional.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.360
But it was odd then
that really good food

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.220
was being served in
restaurants for a lot of money.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.590
And so many people that I knew
couldn't afford to eat in them.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.929
And it's only
gotten worse, right?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:43.490
Increasingly, our-- and I'm
very pro restaurant by the way.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.460
I just believe that
we have to have access

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.780
to food in abundant
supply that's healthy.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.060
And we're actually--
our government

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.400
is pursuing policies that are
the complete opposite of it, so

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.160
much so that as my friend Tom
Colicchio often reminds people,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.360
if you are paranoid
or enough of a cynic,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.790
you might think that the
government is actually

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.330
anti-social justice movement.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.120
I believe there's so much
confusion on this subject

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.400
that we've gotten away from the
nuts and bolts, common sense

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.080
sort of way of
doing things that we

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.730
were doing a hundred years ago.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.740
I mean, we've centralized
our food system.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.390
And everyone realizes it's a
mistake to have 8, 9, 10, 12--

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.500
pick whatever stat you like--
companies making 60%, 70%,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.150
80%-- pick whatever percentage.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.540
And it's different
every year, right?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.770
It differs on what
magazine article you read.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.540
But the point is to
concentrate so much power

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.376
in the hands of so few
when it comes to food

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.920
is a real problem, right?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.940
We have subsidized corn in this
country, famously-- I mean,

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.050
I don't need to educate you
guys on that-- to the point

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.920
where that food is
practically free.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.960
And we wonder why
people on food stamps

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.870
are buying so much of the
stuff that is so bad for them.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:09.960
Why is it more expensive to
buy a fresh peach in America

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.160
in 2016 than to buy a fast
food fried chicken sandwich?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.340
I saw an ad last night.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.380
I was watching the hockey
game in my hotel room.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.630
And on came an ad
for Burger King.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.832
10 Nuggets now cost--

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.740
AUDIENCE: $1.50.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.960
ANDREW ZIMMERN: It's $1.49
actually, but very good.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.570
And I was like, what
brilliant marketing

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.585
person over there at
Burger King's ad agency

00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:34.710
said, no, no, no.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.970
Don't make it $1.50.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.010
Make it $1.49, because you
know that it costed out--

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.220
someone on the food
side was like, oh shit,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.520
we can do that for $1.50 as long
as we get them to buy the giant

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.810
Coca-Cola.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.980
And you know, when you're
making lunch or dinner

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.200
for a family that doesn't have
a lot or a person that doesn't

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.680
have a lot, so unhealthy.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.570
That fried-- and by the
way, that $1.49 chicken

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.430
is not fresh, nice chicken meat
raised by Farmer Jones upstate

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.480
in a chicken farm that
if you closed your eyes

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.850
and imagined a chicken farm,
that's what it looks like.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.676
Does not look like that.

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:16.890
It comes from a
horrible place where

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.255
this stuff gets slurried in
famous Jamie Oliver style,

00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:22.410
right?

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.890
Are you aware-- you saw
the Jamie Oliver thing

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.750
where he took all the bones and
the crap that was half rotten

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.170
and pureed it, and then
they ammoniated it.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.960
And then the machines
take the ammonia out

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.720
and you're left with
this pink slurry

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.030
of chicken bone and fat and
skin that most nuggets are

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.250
made from?

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.160
Yes, no?

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.460
I'm getting nodding heads.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.820
So in a world-- in a world-- I
mean, this is America in 2016.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.050
I love my country so much.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.250
I am the biggest
patriot that I know.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.980
I mean, I'm really overboard.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.080
I'm like Abraham Lincoln,
Washington cherry tree,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.060
you know, sons of liberty,
love this country.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.340
How is it in the
greatest country

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.780
in the history of the world,
in the greatest civilization,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.610
at a point in time where we have
the most romantic and loving

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.570
relationship with food,
where we know the most,

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.450
can produce the most, and
have the technical ability

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.760
to feed the most, are 20%
of Americans food insecure?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.110
I just don't get it.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.970
It's no longer an embarrassment.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.330
To me, that's criminal.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.170
It's criminal.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.470
I don't understand why
it's illegal for someone

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:37.680
to sell loose joints-- those are
marijuana cigarettes-- in grade

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.310
schools, but it's OK to
give them soft drinks that

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.560
have 40 grams of sugar in them.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.270
Oh wait, sorry, soft
drinks only have 28 to 30.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:55.210
It's the mock mango
smoothies from Odwalla

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.040
that have 40 to 60
grams of sugar in them.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.280
So if a kid drinks
one of those, I

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.650
mean-- I don't know about
how many of you are parents,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.655
but at the time that my
8-year-old was drinking them,

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:08.530
it was like, I mean peel
him off the ceiling.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.170
He's done.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.420
I mean, it's a three hours
shutdown at that point.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.280
I can not understand for the
life of me how in this country

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.770
we let that kind of thing go on.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.150
And we could go
on and on and on.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:26.200
I mean, diabetes is-- type
two diabetes is up like crazy.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.160
Our waistlines are growing.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.380
And the sensible solutions
are out there for people.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.950
But somehow they're
either not cool enough

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.730
or our legislators don't
take them seriously.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.420
There's a giant problem.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.220
So we're at this
shapeshifting point

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.750
where we can continue
to ignore the problem,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.800
and things will get
worse-- irrevocably worse

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.970
in terms of, we're
losing species, right?

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.950
Giant bluefin tuna
stocks, they have now--

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.750
I just read it two
or three days ago.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.894
And for years we've been
hearing giant bluefin

00:13:57.894 --> 00:13:58.810
tuna are disappearing.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.590
Giant bluefin tuna
are disappearing.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.870
And everyone would say
well, slow down a second.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.647
Underwater schools of
fish-- and everyone,

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.480
fish experts were taking
about pelagic fish,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.126
pelagic fish are
fairly reliable.

00:14:12.126 --> 00:14:14.860
And they're like oh, cod
stocks and other things,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.540
they come and go, and
how if it has off years,

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.740
and it comes and goes.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.140
And tuna experts were
saying not pelagic fish--

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.670
not pelagic fish.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.760
And sure enough, they
now have determined

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.140
that tuna is down 98%
over the last 50 years

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.680
and almost been fished
into extinction.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.805
On the flip side, fruits-- we
were talking earlier, bananas.

00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:41.557
I don't know how many of you
read the banana.com blog.

00:14:41.557 --> 00:14:42.390
One of my favorites.

00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.730
I used to tell these
stories because I was

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.510
aware of the issue in the '60s.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.860
But in the '50s, there was
a great-- for a hundred

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.820
years, 1850 to 1950, there
was an incredible banana

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.280
being shipped all over the
world out of South America.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.510
There was a blight.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.330
And that species was killed.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.140
And they found a blight
resistant cultivar

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.940
banana called the Cavendish.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.730
And that's the banana that we've
eaten, I believe, since 1962.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.540
99% of the bananas in the
world that are eaten-- sorry,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.750
in the West are
Cavendish bananas.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.870
Well now there's a
Cavendish banana blight,

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.310
one that's so bad that the
global banana conference was

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.020
moved from its location
in Costa Rica this year

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.540
to Miami because they didn't
want people being exposed

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.220
to bad bananas or
some people trying

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.760
to smuggle other species.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.030
Apparently a lot of shenanigans
go on at banana conferences.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.980
No jokes, please.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.260
And they moved it to Miami.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.719
And they are
basically saying, we

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:51.010
are going to have a new banana.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.843
And the new bananas
that they're looking at,

00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:55.620
the two or three that they
can cultivate easily and swap

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.930
into these farmers and get the
numbers going-- in other words,

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.120
the trees will grow fast
enough to produce fruit.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.120
And we won't skip
years where we just

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.910
don't have enough bananas-- are
ones that are-- wait for it--

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.470
easier to transport,
thicker skin,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.730
not as tasty or as good
for you, by the way.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.230
But they'll look really
nice, and we can sell them.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.870
It's like we're repeating the
horrific nature of the Red

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:29.370
Delicious apple in
our American addiction

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.800
to have something that
looks pretty and is

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.210
at the right price,
and we're going

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.300
to ignore everything else.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.820
Which is what we do
famously with meats.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.410
The problem with
beef in America is

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.320
that prices have
stayed steady, pegged

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.640
to inflation, since the 1950s.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.390
And the lobbies are
very, very strong.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.460
So the eye, the
size of the muscle,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.190
has stayed the same
in the supermarket

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.730
in individually wrapped
portions for 45 years.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.750
And the color has stayed
the same for 45 years,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.300
because everyone
knows that that's

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.730
how most Americans look at it.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.829
I want to see the
size of that muscle,

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.190
and I want to see it be
a certain color, right?

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.640
When the fact of the matter is
that everyone will tell you--

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.703
Michael Pollan has been
telling, and a lot people

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.369
have been talking
about it for 20 years.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.079
Eat less meat, right?

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.260
More beans and
legumes, fresh fruits,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.400
meat the size of a hockey puck,
only one or two meals a day,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.000
on and on and on.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.190
Brand new study just came
out a couple of days ago.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.420
I saved all these things.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.420
I brought my iPad because
I was going to cite.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.480
I was doing to do
a lot of citing.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.310
Which I always wanted
speak somewhere

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.860
where I had to do
a lot of citing.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.870
But you can look it up.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.210
You can Google it.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.250
That's what I did.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.260
A brand new study just came out
three days ago over in Europe

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.090
that confirmed in
fact that eating

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.300
less meat, in every possible
way it was measured,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.840
is better for you.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.830
Not eat no meat, just
way less meat, right?

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:08.250
So America, we are addicted
to 14 ounces, a giant steak,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.590
or a half chicken on a
plate, big hunk of broccoli

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.870
or cauliflower, baked
potato, salad bar.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.270
I mean, that's what we want
our plates to look like.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.330
And that is the
least healthy way.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.180
We all think breakfast should
look like Denny's-- two

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.030
pancakes, two eggs,
bacon, sausage,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.340
cup of-- it's much
better to have a French

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.800
hooker's breakfast, cup of
espresso and a cigarette.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320
I mean, it's actually
better for you

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.000
than the American
classic breakfast.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.750
So I mean, we are at
this place in time

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.470
where we've done so
much, so much damage.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.280
I mean, we can go
on and on for hours

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.560
talking about chicken farms
and feedlots and water supply

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.070
and all this kind of stuff.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.410
We need to have a major,
comprehensive national food

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.550
policy, and one agency
that is in charge

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.360
of the legislation-- of
supporting the legislation that

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.760
comes out of the creation
of that department.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:12.510
And that's really the nuts
and bolts solution of it.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.690
I mean, you can peck
away at this thing,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.350
but I think our big
problem over the years

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:26.510
has been we do galas to
raise money for food shelves

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.340
where it doesn't make a dent
in feeding the populations that

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.180
need the food.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.740
I'm on the board of
several agencies.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.441
I'm on the board of
taste for the NFL.

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:37.440
I mean, we raise millions
of dollars every year.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.960
We support these food shelves
in all the NFL cities.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.620
And every year when I talk
to people who run the food

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.510
shelves, we cannot keep up with
the number of people who need.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.820
And the people who
are there are not

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.350
homeless people who somehow
have found themselves

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.720
without a refrigerator.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.840
We're talking about,
in some cases, families

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.070
where both parents work.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.270
It used to be the
classic one income

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.440
families couldn't support.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.215
Now we're finding even--
because of the minimum wage

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:12.530
issue and stuff like that-- that
some dual income families can't

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:18.200
afford to feed themselves
21 meals a week for their--

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.560
and have the car they need
to drive, a safe home.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.120
I mean, this is America in 2016.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.440
Something is radically,
radically wrong.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.980
We are throwing so much love and
attention at the wrong places.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.150
The government is slashing--
I think the last farm bill,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.270
they were cutting
$9 or $10 billion--

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.770
that's with a B-- out of
the food stamp program,

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.040
something that has been on
of the few things that been

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.570
working for a long time, right?

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.100
And we finally got SNAP and
other types of food assistance

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.530
programs to have their chits
accepted at farmers markets

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.710
and places like that so it
can actually be somewhat

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.490
of a sustainable system.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.490
And we can't raise
that kind of money

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:10.200
doing galas and telethons and
donations and Salvation Army

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.360
type stuff.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.760
I mean, it's just we
can't keep up with it.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:20.000
FDA and USDA, they
overlap on some things.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.527
They don't meet on others.

00:21:21.527 --> 00:21:23.110
And there's a huge
place in the middle

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.130
that we're just not
taking care of people

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:30.770
and they're falling through to
the-- there is no safety net.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.380
We need to radically
change how we look at food.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.530
And I believe, as do
a bunch of others,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.470
that the solution has to be
political and legislative.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.170
And that's I think where
all the new thinking

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.660
of some national
leaders on this,

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.810
thought leaders on this issue
is that it has to be political.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:56.050
Tom Colicchio and his
FPA, FoodPolicyAction.org,

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.982
have started four
or five years ago,

00:21:58.982 --> 00:22:01.190
created themselves, and
started going down that road.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.280
And I do believe that is
the only solution that's

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.118
going to work.

00:22:05.118 --> 00:22:06.534
JAMES MULCAHY: How
far away do you

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.280
think we are from kind of an
overarching solution like that.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.110
You're describing
global problems as well,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.290
so it really doesn't just
rest with our country.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.220
And then it's the
local governments

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.030
and local progressive
places maybe feeling

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.906
exploitable a little
bit with these policies?

00:22:19.906 --> 00:22:21.780
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Well
the problem is that none

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.790
of the policies match.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.266
And they don't queue up dollar
wise in terms of matching funds

00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:27.640
from the government,
which is why

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.560
we need a national,
a United States

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.820
government, a federal
agency to man this thing.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.670
Once we get a federal agency
online that's actually

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.650
doing the job that government
is there for, I am-- complete

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:50.480
transparency, I am a left
wing, 1960s Lindsay liberal.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.500
He was mayor of this city for
eight years when I was born.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.750
That was the environment
I grew up in.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.460
I'm not on Karl
Marx's left knee,

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.980
but I'm on his
right knee I mean,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.680
I'm almost all
the way at the end

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.260
of the-- I'm not quite
a social utopian,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.170
but there are things about it.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.760
So I will confess, I'm at
the far end of the spectrum,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.560
just so you know
where I'm coming from.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.270
However, I really
do believe there we

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.890
are at the time and place
where the problems have been

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:30.960
so easily isolated that
while as left wing as I am,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.750
I don't believe in
bigger government

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.400
because bigger government
tends to cloud the issues.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.870
I believe in the
power of business.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.970
I teach entrepreneurship
at Babson College.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.860
I believe that business,
especially small business,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.145
can save the food world.

00:23:44.145 --> 00:23:46.520
And I've dedicated the last
four or five years of my life

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.830
towards trying to enable and
teach and help people grow

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.010
those small food companies
all across the country

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.390
for that reason, because I've
seen so many of them fail.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.810
And I believe that you've
got to pick a place to do it.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.310
And if I believe in
decentralizing our food system,

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.090
I'd be working positively
towards a changed--

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.250
an end, a means to do that.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:13.130
But at its very core, our
founding fathers, I do believe,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.260
felt that the one place that
governments had a major role

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.680
was in protecting the safety
and security of its people.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680
And I believe that includes
health and wellness.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.760
And I believe that it
has risen to that level.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.785
And we have two antique
departments, the FDA

00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:33.280
and the USDA, that
should be scrapped.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.180
A new one should be built. We
should have a food department.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.080
There should be a
national food policy.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.924
I find it curious
that no one has even

00:24:40.924 --> 00:24:42.340
asked-- I have not
heard, and I've

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.820
been listening really closely.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.540
No one has asked
any candidate what

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.570
their position is on National
School Lunch Program.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.950
I mean, that's pretty important.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.390
Last time I checked,
everybody in this room

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.220
was a kid once
who ate at school.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.150
Some private, some public,
but everyone ate at school.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.000
I mean, shouldn't we
have some kind of way

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.530
to make sure that our children
are eating the right thing,

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.700
at the very least?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.120
Everywhere that the public
dollar intersects with food

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.730
we have a problem--
jails and institutions,

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:16.180
the way we feed and care
for our elderly in assisted

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.580
living facilities that receive
government money for food.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.540
Those populations are
the worst served by food.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.160
And I'll tell you
something that I

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.000
think we all have a little
bit of a trouble with.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.700
I am part of the problem,
because I globe trot

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.770
around the world, and have the
last 11 years, showing-- yes, I

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.470
show both sides of the coin.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.380
I'm tribal.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.820
I'm in very poor neighborhoods.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.520
I'm in slums.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:51.440
Largest slums in the world,
I've done entire programs from.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.700
But I've also done the million
dollar Victorian mansion

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.360
in Mississippi and the
fabulous big spread

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.800
and it looks like it should
be out of the centerfold

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.990
of "Garden and Gun."

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.530
And it's a lifestyle that only
a handful of people can access.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.950
And I feel a little bit
of guilt about that,

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.750
because I'm selling something
that nobody can participate in.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.030
And I think we have
to start-- we're

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.700
so badly misaligned
that where it starts

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.444
is with some kind
of national policy.

00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:25.860
And then it could
go down to state

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.651
and local, because
there are certain things

00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:31.670
that state and local governments
are ideally suited to monitor,

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.569
put in place-- the needs
are different in Alaska

00:26:34.569 --> 00:26:35.610
than they are in Florida.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.400
I'm the first one to tell you.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.920
But I mean, the idea
that we have thousands

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.300
of tons of meats rotting away
in freezers, whether it's

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.790
alligator meat in Florida or
bison meat in the Southwest,

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.767
and we can't get
that healthy protein

00:26:52.767 --> 00:26:55.100
into the hands of people that
need it the most-- I mean,

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.651
we talked about-- I talked
about the magazine article.

00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.400
And you hear people
all the time talking--

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.450
you probably recognize
this phrase-- the warm hug

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.140
that food gives.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.650
It does.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.480
It makes some people
feel really good.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.990
And if one of you
came to my house

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.910
and I cooked a really
wonderful home cooked meal

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.370
for eight of you and we
sat on the deck outside

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.510
and watched the sun
set and the moon rise,

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.080
it would be an
idyllic experience

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.667
and you'd get that
warm hug that food

00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:24.500
gives, because the food
would be really good

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.210
and it would be a
really nice setting.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.560
But the people who need
that aren't you guys.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.860
The people who need that warm
hug are seniors in those state

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.880
run facilities, people in
jails and institutions,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.390
kids in school.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.620
Right, you follow me?

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.750
We're giving that warm hug
to the wrong population.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.390
JAMES MULCAHY: So in
that kind of spirit,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.020
is there somewhat that
we can do as consumers,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.940
as more average consumers,
not these needy populations,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.090
make better choices about
one form of food system?

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.380
And the consumer dollar talks
as well in addition to policy.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.340
Does that help, or is too late
for that sort of intervention?

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.798
What are some of
the better choices

00:28:01.798 --> 00:28:04.160
we can make in our every
day decision making?

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.270
ANDREW ZIMMERN: You hit
the nail on the head.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.728
Take the question mark out of
that and make it a statement,

00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:09.920
and that is your answer.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.399
I firmly believe it's why
I make the show I make.

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.940
And I've said in a
lot of interviews,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.710
you can change the food
world one plate at a time.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.030
You make it every time
you go to your market.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.950
You make it every time you
sit down with friends to eat.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.785
I am a lotus eater.

00:28:26.785 --> 00:28:28.250
I am a hedonist.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.910
I am still going to
drink-- I understand

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.600
that sugary sweet sodas
are bad, and I still,

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.850
once a week, I
love my root beer.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.170
Sometimes I'll have two.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.210
I love root beer.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:44.750
Root beer is like, [SIGHS], and
it's the elixir of the gods.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.270
But I know it's not good
for me so I have to limit

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.540
my intake of root beer.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.500
And I talk about these
issues with my friends.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.250
And I actually-- I'm looking
out at a sea of-- well,

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.730
there's one or two of you
that are younger than me.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.410
But I'm looking out
at a sea of faces

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.660
that I believe, because I'm
an optimist, a super optimist,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.600
I believe that you
people actually

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.680
care more about this issue
at this time in your lives

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.600
than my generation did at
that time in our lives.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.550
I think that you guys have
been preached at and TVed at

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.160
and magazine articled
at and online

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.080
blogged at about these
issues to know that there

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.630
is something wrong with this.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.754
My parents never wanted to
have me volunteer somewhere

00:29:34.754 --> 00:29:36.170
to do something,
but my wife and I

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.230
want our kid to volunteer and
do things and help other people.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.520
I think the social climate is
different in America in 2016,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.840
in a good way.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.556
And I think that if you
just look at it in-- I

00:29:47.556 --> 00:29:49.620
hate these terms, so I
don't want you to think

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.680
that I support the use of them.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.380
Things like farm to table--
it's just a God awful term.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.050
Whoever names the generations,
who's in charge of that?

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.620
Who named millennials
millennials?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.270
I don't get it.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:06.320
However, everybody has
sign posted the five or six

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.210
attributes that
millennials represent.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.960
And my favorite one
is transparency.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.330
And I've tested and measured
this with millennial friends

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.180
of mine and millennials
who work for me

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.000
at my office in Minnesota.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.704
And they are a much
different feeling--

00:30:21.704 --> 00:30:23.870
they have a much different
feelings about this issue

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.560
than I ever had.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.050
So I do believe that voting
with our pocket books,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.430
practicing what we preach,
spreading the gospel,

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.170
but most importantly,
becoming politically

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.310
motivated to help change this.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.930
And I think that's something
that our country has

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.120
done a really bad job of.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.120
Famously in a lot
of countries that

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.610
are stable or semistable
democracies now,

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.470
the first year that they held
elections, turnout was massive.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.860
And I'm not trying to hold
up Iraqi politics as a model

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.990
for the American system.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.600
But I remember watching TV
after the first Gulf War.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.690
And one of the beautiful
stories that came out

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.450
of that incredible
shithole of an event

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:19.035
was seeing so many
real Iraqi citizens,

00:31:19.035 --> 00:31:21.820
I mean moms, dad and people--
and I've spent time in Iraq.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.920
I've spent time in Syria.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.199
It's the most beautiful
and nicest, kindest people

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:25.740
in the world.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.040
My Syria show is must
see TV for anyone

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.390
who wants to witness what the
kindest society in the world

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.790
looked like just a few
short years ago, albeit

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.910
ruled by the wrong people.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.600
The folks who actually live in
that country, the most gracious

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.930
and kind I've ever met.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.360
Incredible show we shot there.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.870
But seeing Iraqis with
the purple finger--

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:54.880
I have an Iraqi ballot sheet
hanging in my living room

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.450
as a reminder to me, because
I put it in the living room

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.240
and not in my office because
I wanted visitors to my home,

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.320
when they're sitting,
they have to look at that

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.570
and they have to look at a
stuffed Buffalo on the wall

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:05.390
that I shot.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.010
And it's purposeful
so I can talk

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.950
to people about these issues
that are very important to me.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.764
And they had, I don't
know, 90% turnout.

00:32:13.764 --> 00:32:15.930
I mean, they couldn't keep
them away from the polls.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.460
Here in our country, we
have political entities,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.560
politicians, local and state
governments that are actually

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.190
trying to prevent
certain population

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.430
groups from voting,
or at the very least

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.840
make it harder for them
to vote, in a country that

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.570
was founded on the
premise that everyone

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.320
should have a right to vote.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.710
I mean, it was over a tax
issue, but I mean, taxation

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.970
without representation, right?

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.670
I mean, you get a right
to vote in America.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.810
And our turnout is notoriously
low, election after election.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.540
I believe that if we push
our legislators-- that's why

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.760
I like Tom Colicchio's group.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.830
They do that
legislator scorecard.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.470
And it's all based
on food issues.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:06.440
If we push our food
leaders or if we

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.750
push our political leaders
onto what a lot of us

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.184
call kitchen table
issues and we insist

00:33:12.184 --> 00:33:13.600
on holding their
feet to the fire,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.180
we will do more to help
change our country.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.925
You know, I am not the one
who coined this phrase.

00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:22.090
And I'm not even sure Tom did.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.390
I'm sure it was
smarter people than us.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.910
But the moment we actually
have a food policy and one

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.720
legislator loses
their job because we

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.690
don't like the way
they dealt with it,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.640
you will see a giant sea change.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.860
And I believe that will happen
within the next 10 or 12 years.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.360
I think we have to
reformulate our cabinet.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.225
I think there has to be
a national food policy,

00:33:43.225 --> 00:33:46.760
and that needs to be enforced
by a food department, not

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.050
an FDA or USDA.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.170
And I really believe that we
can start at the local level

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.900
to do that too, get our
local politicians talking

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.390
about food first.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.940
I mean, local congressmen,
city council members,

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.560
local-- when I say
local legislatures,

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.700
I mean at the state level.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.400
You know, they need
to be invested.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.090
Farms, those are jobs program.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.319
And I look at companies.

00:34:12.319 --> 00:34:13.860
Google's a different
kind of company.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.092
But I look at the fastest
growing food company

00:34:16.092 --> 00:34:17.550
in the world right
now is a company

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.380
called Hampton Creek,
run by my friend

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.900
Josh Tetrick out of San
Francisco, California.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.644
His first product
was a vegan egg.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:30.670
But he didn't sell it.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.120
His second product
was mayonnaise

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.860
made with the vegan egg.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.659
So it emulsified with oil.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.550
And it tasted fantastic.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.389
It's a great tasting mayonnaise.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:47.199
Now what he used to create
that egg were plant products.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:54.080
Proteins and other chemicals
extracted from certain plants

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.410
were used to make a fluid
that would replicate the 22

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.140
actions that an egg has
in the kitchen, right?

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:04.680
Crazy.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.524
In fact, raised in the
tens of million of dollars,

00:35:08.524 --> 00:35:09.940
put the smartest
people in a room,

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.440
and three years later they came
out with this amazing stuff.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.320
They now have like 43
products launching by August.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.657
They're the fastest growing
food company in the world.

00:35:18.657 --> 00:35:20.615
They just went over a
billion dollars in sales.

00:35:20.615 --> 00:35:26.470
It's just this epic kind
of wonderful success story.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.060
I've known Josh for a long time.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.470
And one of the things that I
take a little bit of credit

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:38.040
for it is that through
our talks and friendship

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.430
and telling the story of
Hampton Creek as many times

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.850
as I have-- and I was the
first one to profile him

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.810
on television-- it
occurred to me because I've

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.390
been to all of these
horrifically poor countries

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:53.410
around the world-- let's
just pick one, call it Haiti.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:59.110
If he is using sweet potato
vines and certain types of peas

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:03.550
that grow like wildfire
in a tropical environment,

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:08.020
isn't it fantastic
that we could have

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.300
farms in third and
fourth world countries

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.830
in the equatorial band around
our country growing vegetables

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.120
that actually could get a
fair market price the way

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.780
we started to with coffee and
chocolate and vanilla beans,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.830
right?

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.830
And wouldn't it be wonderful
if those applications

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.670
could be used towards
healthifying our food system?

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.460
It would be a
diplomatic victory.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.786
It would be a jobs bill.

00:36:32.786 --> 00:36:34.285
It would be an
economic development.

00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:36.400
So they're just
throwing millions

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.640
of millions of dollars
at Haiti and letting

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.350
their government make decisions
about what to do with it.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.120
If we did it through the
entrepreneurial business

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.490
system of putting food
companies in there

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.310
that were doing that, what a
fantastic, fantastic thing.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.730
Those kind of things I
really support, and I believe

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:58.110
searching out those products
and buying them-- Hellmann's

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.260
famously sued Hampton
Creek because they called

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.650
their first product Just Mayo.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.090
And Hellmann's
said, oh no, no, no.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.510
That's not mayonnaise.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.320
They can't call themselves Mayo.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.822
And Josh was like, we're not
calling ourselves mayonnaise.

00:37:12.822 --> 00:37:14.030
We're calling ourselves Mayo.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.290
And he did it purposely so
that he could eventually

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.550
get this fight started.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.152
And the Hellmann's
people along with,

00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:25.930
I believe it was the FDA--
again, you can Google it.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.100
It's a great story.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.970
But someone made a joke about
well, we could kill him.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.260
That would solve the problem.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.741
And my name is
all over the thing

00:37:34.741 --> 00:37:37.115
because I was sort of pimping
them out a lot in the media

00:37:37.115 --> 00:37:38.470
and stuff like that.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:42.120
And I was just so proud of that,
because when those people are

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.250
worried about you and
angry and making jokes

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.310
about offing the
head of this company,

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.950
you know you're on
the right track.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.390
I mean, that's how you know
you're on the right track

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.900
when you have enemies.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.382
My entertainment
lawyer said to me,

00:37:54.382 --> 00:37:56.090
I'll know when I'm
really successful when

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.880
someone sues me.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.180
I think there's
some truth to that.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.290
So these are the
things, when you

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.640
start to scare people like that,
you're breaking the old system.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.200
And I think Josh's
corporate motto--

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.540
it's ad hoc and kind
of behind the scenes.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.000
It's not the official
mission statement.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.470
But Josh's favorite
quote is, if we

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.940
could start blank over from
scratch, how would we do it?

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.630
And I think with certain
parts of our food system,

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.500
we've tried to correct it so
many times instead of saying,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.770
you know something, bulldoze it.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.640
Let's start over.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.060
This is America 2016.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.190
We have the smartest people
in the world in this country.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.460
Let's actually reconstruct it.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.110
It doesn't take that long.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.510
I don't know about you guys.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:50.080
I'm horrified, I
mean, horrified when

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.700
I turn on my laptop
in the morning

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.640
and my news starts just
auto populating in my inbox.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.540
And I read-- and I
hope I get this right,

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.730
and my apologies to
Subway if I get it wrong,

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.400
but I think it was Subway.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.150
Subway came out and said,
we have a big announcement.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:13.620
We are going to use only
cage free eggs in our stores.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.460
And I was like oh my
God, that's fantastic.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.668
And then I kept reading down
the article and it said,

00:39:17.668 --> 00:39:25.380
and we promise to
do this by 2025.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.420
I mean, this is nuts.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.690
Now I've been in the food
business a long time.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.190
I get it.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.160
Subway's a big company.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.570
And so if they're going to have
a global policy with sandwiches

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.840
all of the world, the supply
lines and distributors--

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.750
so I get it if would take two
years or a year and a half.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.320
They really want to
make sure it's right.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.560
But there are so many suppliers
out there with cage free eggs.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.395
And Subway, as big
a company as it is,

00:39:50.395 --> 00:39:51.520
ain't using that many eggs.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.040
Their egg salad isn't
their biggest seller.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.300
But for them to come out and
say it's going to nine years

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.560
to commit to this,
to me says everything

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.430
that's wrong about our
broken food system today.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.680
They came out with it to
make a statement because they

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.160
know people aren't going to
read more than three lines

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.580
below the thing, and
the headline everywhere

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.770
is Subway commits
to cage free eggs.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.900
And so I was like oh
Subway, that's fantastic.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.640
Campbell's came out
and said, we're not

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.540
going to-- we believe
in truth in labeling,

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.700
and we support the
transparency of having

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.060
no GMOs in our soups,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.229
What they didn't
say was what I think

00:40:36.229 --> 00:40:37.770
they should have
said is, we're going

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.020
to make our soups from scratch.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.020
We're going to put natural
products in our soup.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.784
And we're going to
use the right thing.

00:40:42.784 --> 00:40:44.200
We all know what
we're looking at.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.450
Vegetable soup is going to
be just vegetables and soup

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.611
cooked by real people in a can.

00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:49.810
Canned food's great.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.289
Hamburger Helper is great.

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:53.580
Those things, you got to be
able to feed people, right?

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.580
We have billions of hungry
people in this world,

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.530
losing arable land, so
many different problems.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.380
We have to have
solutions for everyone.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.305
Not everyone is going to get
to eat Eleven Madison Park.

00:41:05.305 --> 00:41:08.760
And you can't tell them to
build a billion seat restaurant.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.890
I wish that was the case.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.140
But we have to start
applying common sense stuff.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.940
We have to start
doing it politically.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.190
And we have to start calling
people on their bullshit.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.500
I mean, it really has
gotten to that point.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.420
And I think luckily
if you ask me,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.780
I think it's going to happen
over the next 10, 12 years.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.620
I think we're going
to see enough change.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.470
It may take 15 to get there, but
I think we're going to do it.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.970
JAMES MULCAHY: So
Chef, I definitely

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.276
want to leave a lot of time for
questions like we discussed.

00:41:39.276 --> 00:41:41.970
Part of your job is to
evangelize these better ways.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.566
And you mentioned something
to me about a blood oath

00:41:44.566 --> 00:41:46.440
that you took with some
of your chef friends.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.120
ANDREW ZIMMERN: I
can't talk about it.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.380
JAMES MULCAHY: You
can't talk about it.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.879
I want to hear about
the blood oath.

00:41:49.879 --> 00:41:52.510
ANDREW ZIMMERN: I
absolutely-- if I told you

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.760
that story, number
one, it's that type

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.510
of thing with so many
famous people involved

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.970
and that kind of like,
who killed John Kennedy

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.040
kind of thing, where's
Jimmy Hoffa buried.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.050
I don't-- I'll tell you.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.690
So I'm at an after,
after, afterparty

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.575
at the Miami Food and
Wine Festival, South Beach

00:42:18.575 --> 00:42:20.360
Food and Wine Festival.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.340
And everybody thinks that
there's some kind of door

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.340
that the 40 or 50 food people
like me all walk through

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.530
and we're alone in
this fantastic place

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.120
and there's just vats of caviar.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.860
And you know, satyrs
are wandering around

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:41.050
and Dom Perignon
Rose '62 is flowing

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.180
from machines previously
used at the Kimmelman bat

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.330
mitzvah for chocolate dipping.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.754
And that is true.

00:42:49.754 --> 00:42:50.920
But this was a larger party.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.290
There were some normies there.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.800
Horrible joke.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.350
But it's actually very rare for
a lot of us, the right people

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:01.220
to be in the room
at the same time.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:06.090
And there were 10 or 12 of us
gathered around a little circle

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.020
with a lot of
other people trying

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.090
to get in on the conversation.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:14.340
And myself and Jose Andreas
and Colicchio and Bobby Flay

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:19.530
and Jean-Georges Vongerichten
and-- I'm blanking on some,

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.200
but people like that.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.960
And we're all standing around.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.710
And the game that we
were actually playing

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.960
was, who was cooking at
that restaurant in the '80s,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.100
because the '80s was a decade--
I completely forget the '80s.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.540
I'm a recovering alcoholic
and heroin addict,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.940
and that was the decade I didn't
sober up until January of '92.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.410
So I can't tell you a
thing about the '80s.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.050
When I married my wife, she
laughed because I'd never

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.880
seen an episode of "Friends."

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.540
It's true.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.480
I just missed the whole decade.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.944
So I was cooking
a lot in New York.

00:43:52.944 --> 00:43:54.360
And we're all
trying to figure out

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.370
who-- we were all young
line cooks coming up.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.260
And we remember it like,
this guy was amazing.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.470
Whatever happened to him?

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.180
He was such a better
cook than all of us.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.220
And it's odd how so
many of us were working

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.120
in the same restaurants
at the time together

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.690
or followed each other
when one person left.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.340
Because the world of line
cooks in New York back then

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.950
was fairly finite.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.930
And it's amazing that so
many of us, now in our 50s,

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.050
are kind of like elder statesmen
in a much more popular food

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.220
universe.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.860
And at one point,
someone said oh,

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.740
are you going to contribute to
such and such gala or whatever.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:35.080
And Tom Colicchio
got on his soapbox.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.540
And it was so motivating
and so inspiring to hear

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.460
somebody-- I mean,
it's one thing for me

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.710
to say it to you guys.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.830
But when I grab my colleagues,
I mean my real peers

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.890
and colleagues by the
lapels, the ones who

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.960
aren't playing the
game the right way,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:58.630
and convince them that fewer
galas, fewer fundraisers, fewer

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.910
of everything, dedicate
all your resources

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.860
to putting a million people
on the Mall in Washington, DC,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:12.690
insisting that our government
change its way of doing things

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:18.060
and insisting on a national
food policy and a federal agency

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.100
that would supervise it.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.860
I mean, those are
the kind of things

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.360
that are really meaningful,
and that perhaps this was

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.050
the year for all of us
to kind of, collectively,

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:33.790
take a step back from
pissing in the wind.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.600
I'm still donating
as much as I can

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.790
to my local food self,
because I can't not do that.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.670
But on the bigger,
grander scheme of things,

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.050
taking some of the energy
that I've been doing that

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.870
hasn't been making the change.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.690
Helps to throw a
nice party, and maybe

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.950
focusing it on a couple
days on my schedule

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.910
that I go to Capitol Hill
and I work hard on something.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.750
And it made sense to me, because
two years ago I got a phone

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.160
call from the one organization.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.070
And they asked me to help.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.080
They wanted me to tell
stories about Africa

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.796
and help electrify Africa.

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:07.920
Because if you want to make
Africa safe and secure,

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.336
how about giving
them electricity?

00:46:09.336 --> 00:46:11.440
But let's stop throwing
money over there.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.120
Let's stop supporting
tin pot dictators.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.150
Let's stop supporting oligarchs.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.760
Let's stop sending bags of
rice out of cargo planes.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.880
Let's just give them
electricity so the food

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.760
that they grow and make
themselves can be stored.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.510
Let's give them electricity
so that when we give them

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:31.040
medicines that are
perishable, they can have them

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.210
in refrigerators that work.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.510
If you put electricity
in Namibia,

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.620
it would become one of the
leading exporters in the world

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.280
of fish and shellfish.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.130
The best seafood in the world
comes from the Skeleton Coast

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:48.630
as it wraps around the Western
side of the Horn of Africa.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.380
The best in the world
comes from there.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.031
Not Spain, not New England,
not Australia, Namibia.

00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:55.530
Right?

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.170
But they don't have electricity,
so they can't process the fish

00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.600
and seafood.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.380
I digress.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:08.640
If we can put
together the attention

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.180
in the right way as we did with
the Electrify Africa campaign,

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:17.600
and if the food people took a
page out of the social justice

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.980
playbook that ONE has, solely
focusing on legislating issues

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.030
one after another
after another, I

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.870
think we would
have more success.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.930
So it really resonated with me.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.310
And we all sort of took
a blood oath that night

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.960
that that was going
to be our focus.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.960
And I'm super, super proud
of that, because I've

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.520
seen it work with ONE.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.880
So, anyway.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.030
I said to James over lunch,
I said, I talk a lot.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.570
So what I really want to
do is have a conversation.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.180
So he said, we'll have 10
minutes for Q&amp;A. I said,

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.220
let's leave 25
minutes for a Q&amp;A.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.450
I don't think I even
let you ask a question.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.680
JAMES MULCAHY: I got four in.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.545
I think I got four.

00:47:58.545 --> 00:47:59.820
It's good.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.030
But that said, I think
it's time for questions.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.890
We have 10 minutes.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.595
ANDREW ZIMMERN:
Let's do questions.

00:48:03.595 --> 00:48:05.011
JAMES MULCAHY:
Let's do questions.

00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:06.885
Who has a question?

00:48:06.885 --> 00:48:07.760
We have a microphone?

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.350
Oh, the mic is over here.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.850
ANDREW ZIMMERN: If
you shout it out,

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:14.816
I will repeat the question so
the me at home can hear it.

00:48:14.816 --> 00:48:17.890
AUDIENCE: So remember when Oprah
famously said eat less meat

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.019
or don't eat meat,
and they sued her.

00:48:20.019 --> 00:48:24.030
And that worried me because
I think that some of us

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.430
try to change things, the
food lobby's very powerful.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.860
How do you believe that
that will get [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.110
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Well I think
the food lobby has gotten

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:36.760
smart enough as they've seen
their market share fall apart

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.340
that the way to do it is
not to threaten and bully.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:46.770
The people who are calling for
not eating as much meat today

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.150
are not being sued.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.390
We know that a
healthy diet-- I mean,

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.850
confirmed-- eat less meat.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.990
You will live longer.

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:57.470
You'll be disease free.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:59.285
I mean, you will
have less diseases.

00:48:59.285 --> 00:49:00.160
You will live longer.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.340
I mean, it is
staggering the data

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.100
in this brand new study that
just got released two days ago.

00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:10.060
No one has sued me,
and I've been saying it

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.820
for a long time--
a year and a half.

00:49:16.117 --> 00:49:17.700
Not because I'm a
meat eater, but just

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.697
because you want to make sure.

00:49:19.697 --> 00:49:21.780
The last thing I want to
do is one of those people

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.680
that one year says--
a flip flopper,

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.660
and then no one believes
anything you say.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.060
So you like to be kind
of sure of your issues

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.910
when you're a person like me
that actually has a platform.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.140
And I take a lot
of responsibility.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.500
I've wanted to have a platform
so I could do something

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.450
with this mic.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.470
My show, some people think
it's fat white guy goes

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.370
around world, eats bugs.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:46.720
I'm serious, that's how it's
been described, not by me,

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.040
by other people.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.940
But there's a lot of
people-- and I'm sure,

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.610
this being a very smart
crowd, gets that it's not

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:55.510
about that at all.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.325
It's about preaching patience,
tolerance, and understanding

00:49:58.325 --> 00:49:59.918
with other parts of the world.

00:49:59.918 --> 00:50:02.450
We're all part of
a global community.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:05.040
And let's tell uniting
stories around food

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.170
rather than divisive
ones about who

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.600
you like to have sex with,
what music do we listen to,

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.340
what kind of god do we believe
in, what language do we speak,

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.760
what color is our skin.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.180
All that shit's irrelevant.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.450
This is 2016.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.951
It's a very, very flat world.

00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:19.700
Let's talk about the
things that unite us,

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.280
not the things that divide us.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:25.150
And we were talking about
solutions from another place.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.990
You know, I just
came back-- I mean,

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.300
I could list a hundred
countries right now

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.300
or a hundred cities, places I've
been in where they eat the diet

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.530
that we would best emulate.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.230
I just came back from Okinawa.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:40.450
Some of the happiest
and disease free

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:43.700
and the longest living people
in the world live in Okinawa.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.630
I was cooking with five
grandmas only to find out they

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:50.180
were five great-grandmas,
and all in their late 80s.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.670
And I shit you not.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:54.160
If you go to my
Instagram, and you only

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.099
have to go back like
three, four weeks,

00:50:56.099 --> 00:50:58.140
there I am with these five
ladies in the kitchen.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.800
Not a single one of them
looks over the age of 65.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.460
They're all in their late 80s.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.400
And they're cooking away
and fast and conversational.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.630
Now I just buried my
dad at age 87, 88.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.160
Had a long, great life.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.100
It was fantastic.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.710
Feel happy and wanted to go.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.540
But his condition at the end
was nothing like these women.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.740
And the difference
there is they really

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:28.340
believe in Yakuzen,
the healthy attributes

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.180
of a lot of bitter
vegetables and greens

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.820
that they incorporate
in their diet.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.569
They all still sleep on futons
and they sit on the ground

00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:37.860
to eat, so they're constantly
up and down, up and down,

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:38.520
up and down.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.450
So they're flexible.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:41.790
They all exercise.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:43.190
They all garden.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.570
Because everyone, it's almost
part of the Shinto belief

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.730
in that part of Japan that
everyone, even people window

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:53.700
gardening, but they do it every
day so they nurture something.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.205
And they're respected
in their culture.

00:51:56.205 --> 00:52:00.410
Old people in our culture
are no longer cool, right?

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.070
I mean, we're even going to
put Brad Pitt and Angelina

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.200
away in a home somewhere
at some point, right?

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.260
Let's not look at them.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.669
Ooh, they're old people.

00:52:07.669 --> 00:52:08.710
They are in a wheelchair.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.620
They've got diseases.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.600
I don't want to look at that.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.660
That could be me some day.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.740
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.823
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:52:13.823 --> 00:52:16.450
I mean, that's the way we
look at it in our fast paced,

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.030
disposable culture
here in America.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:22.420
And I think that there
are so many people

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.150
now looking at those things
and talking about those things.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:29.430
And they, by the way, eat
very small amounts of meat.

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.280
And when they do, even
when they fry their pork,

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.590
classically the style of doing
it is that it's then rinsed.

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.020
A lot of the harmful
fats come out.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.920
A lot of the healthy
fat stay in when

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.980
pork is twice cooked like that.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.690
So it's an amazing thing
to see and be a part of.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:52.240
I think being vocal is still
important, despite that issue.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.330
I mean, and look, who's
going to sue Oprah?

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:57.094
Oprah is going to come
back at him with-- I mean,

00:52:57.094 --> 00:52:58.510
she's like her own
country, right?

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:59.990
She's like Switzerland.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.448
I wouldn't want to
mess with Oprah.

00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:04.440
JAMES MULCAHY: All
right, who else?

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.860
[INAUDIBLE], I think
in the back there.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.120
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Great
beard by the way.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.740
Bearded guy is next, then
we'll get to the other guy.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.737
Bearded guy keeps pumping
his hand up and down.

00:53:14.737 --> 00:53:15.570
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.278
ANDREW ZIMMERN: No,
no, that's all right.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.590
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the Subway situation,

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.340
how long that would take.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.440
My question is with
certain ingredients

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.996
that we put in a lot of
cheap foods in this country--

00:53:30.996 --> 00:53:32.370
can you hear from
the microphone?

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.280
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Yeah.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.710
AUDIENCE: So my question is
a lot of cheap ingredients

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.080
are things that are made to keep
cheap, like hydrogenated oils,

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.220
palm oils.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.970
What do you feel is
the solution for this?

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.604
It's so widespread and it's--
to inform people about it,

00:53:45.604 --> 00:53:47.770
it almost feels like it's
just an immediate pushback

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.140
because it's in so much.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.110
What do you feel could
be a solution to that?

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.609
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Well I've got
some really good news for you.

00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:58.090
Some of the largest food
companies in the world

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:02.550
have chosen not to go the way
of Kodak and go out of business.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.310
So I can speak for
one in Minnesota

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:05.810
that I'm very, very proud of.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:08.530
And it's one that is
universally vilified

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:11.130
as being one of the worst
examples of big food,

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.110
and that's General Mills.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.750
General Mills had a mission
statement for the last 50 years

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.740
that really had nothing
to do with making food.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.870
They have become
a brand company.

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.450
And a lot of their
brands used a lot

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.620
of those ingredients
and stuff like that.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.130
New leadership team came in,
and they chose a new mission

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.630
statement.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:30.980
It was announced.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.172
But unlike those
splashy announcements

00:54:33.172 --> 00:54:34.630
of Campbell's and
the other people,

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:38.044
this one kind of
went under the radar.

00:54:38.044 --> 00:54:40.210
And they announced they had
a new mission statement.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.240
And it was based
off a World War II

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.690
letter from the then head
of the company to the board,

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.440
the owner of the
company to the board.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.540
I think it was James
Ford Bell the Second.

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:56.860
And he wrote the company, to the
board, what a wonderful thing

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:01.360
it was to be a part of a group
that took food and shared it

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.670
with love with the world.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.294
And this was at a point in time
where the world had really come

00:55:05.294 --> 00:55:06.270
together, right?

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.560
And food was needed.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.410
And shelf stable was needed.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.139
And big food was kind of
needed to feed people.

00:55:13.139 --> 00:55:14.930
And there was a great
sense of pride there.

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.570
And General Mills, and
I'm going to botch it,

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.361
but essentially their
new mission statement

00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:23.790
is to be of service of-- give
service to the world with food

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.360
through love, or
something like that.

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.110
But service, food, and love
are in their mission statement.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.884
Food was not in
their-- the phrase food

00:55:31.884 --> 00:55:33.550
was not in their last
mission statement.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:36.790
And they are on a quest.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:41.930
They're reformulating and
remaking lots of their foods.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.330
And the reason is
that in the past,

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:52.650
they used to buy companies like
Annie's that made natural mac

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.540
and cheese, right, where it's
actually freeze dried cheese

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.290
and there are no
hydrogenated oils.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.400
It's all natural product
that mimics the Kraft

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.830
mac and cheese, right?

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.290
And instead of being
$0.69, it's $1.29.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.200
But it's still
really inexpensive

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.340
and it allows families that
want to eat healthily and give

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.590
their kids mac and
cheese, they can do it.

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:15.420
That's your choice.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.580
If you want to eat
mac and cheese,

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.500
at least we have a
healthy one that isn't

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.890
filled with a lot of crap.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.707
So General Mills
and Kraft and Nestle

00:56:21.707 --> 00:56:23.290
and all these other
big food companies

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:25.540
buy companies like that.

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.910
Well now they're realizing
they can't buy them fast enough

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:32.230
and stay afloat, so they better
start incubating companies

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:35.839
like that with innovation teams,
because they have all the R&amp;D

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:37.130
and all the money in the world.

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:39.462
So they can do it easier
than you and I could

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.920
going out to Silicon Valley
and trying to raise $10 million

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.850
and take five years just to
get in the supermarket, right?

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:48.600
So not only are they
putting the work

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.177
of their innovations
and R&amp;D labs--

00:56:50.177 --> 00:56:51.760
and General Mills
is not the only one.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.510
All the big food companies are
doing it that I'm aware of.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.590
And they are
committing to remake--

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.380
you know, Kraft, Nestle, all
these giant food companies have

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.165
been coming out
one after another,

00:57:03.165 --> 00:57:04.540
because they're
afraid all of you

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.580
are going to stop
buying their product.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.870
Because enough people
like me and Michael Pollan

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:13.070
are saying less meat, cook more.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:15.540
Our problem and the reason
why eating well in America

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.180
is a class issue is that
sometimes we're not just cash

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.060
poor, we're also time poor.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.190
When are we going to do it?

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.840
So it helps to
have products that

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.652
allow us to put ingredients
together in 20 minutes

00:57:28.652 --> 00:57:30.360
and get it on the
table, or say that they

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.900
can do from the freezer
to the over to the table

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.610
in a short amount of time
and serve a family on the go.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:40.380
So the good news is, is
that companies are doing it.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.050
We're finding out
that those ingredients

00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:43.550
aren't healthy for us.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.890
And the new generation
of consumers,

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:47.920
because of their
love of transparency,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.600
is not buying them.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.150
So the products are changing.

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:54.340
I know like Progresso soups
at General Mills in August,

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.830
it's coming out they're
going to be in Tetra Paks.

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:59.550
It's an all natural product
cooked by real people.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:03.165
I mean, it is a massive
campaign to start soup season.

00:58:03.165 --> 00:58:05.540
And I hear about these things
because I live in Minnesota

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:07.040
and I have friends
of General Mills.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.730
That's a huge, huge thing.

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.130
And as those companies
begin to do that,

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:15.120
it's going to catch fire,
which is why I'm bullish on it,

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.307
because those things
are not good for us.

00:58:17.307 --> 00:58:19.390
Are we going to let this
guy be the last question?

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:20.340
JAMES MULCAHY:
[INAUDIBLE] time for.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.765
That's a [INAUDIBLE]
problem as well.

00:58:21.765 --> 00:58:22.240
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Oh my God.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.390
JAMES MULCAHY: So
it's 2 o'clock.

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:25.180
Anyone who want to
roll out can do that.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.055
We'll take one more
question and then we'll--

00:58:27.055 --> 00:58:29.290
ANDREW ZIMMERN: Sounds great.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.000
AUDIENCE: So I worked in the
inner city education system

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.560
here in New York City.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.400
And I was really glad to hear
that you mention national food

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.880
programs and lunch programs.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.130
But the thing that I noticed
and was really surprising

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.120
was that a lot of
kids, because there's

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.464
a stigma around free
lunch, won't eat it.

00:58:46.464 --> 00:58:47.380
They'll throw it away.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.470
I think the statistics were
50% of it gets thrown away.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.780
How would you reach into
places like the inner city

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.250
and start to educate people and
shift the culture and stigma

00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.200
around government issued food?

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.710
ANDREW ZIMMERN: So it's such
a fantastic question, and one

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.872
that I love to talk about.

00:59:08.872 --> 00:59:10.330
I have a lot of
personal experience

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.560
with this, because as
a recovering addict

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.380
and alcoholic, the last
year of my using life, which

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.060
was 25 years ago, was
on the streets of New

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.290
York as a homeless person.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.050
I took meals at
the Salvation Army

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:26.090
and soup kitchens and stuff
like that where whenever I

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.840
needed to eat or needed a bed.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.530
And God bless you.

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:38.420
And the shame of
hunger insecurity

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.620
and the stigmas
around it are just

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.430
like those with addiction
and other recovery issues.

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:49.734
People are afraid to
come out and say it.

00:59:49.734 --> 00:59:51.400
One of the ones we're
dealing with right

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.150
now is mental health issues.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.076
Who wants to come out
and say, I'm bipolar.

00:59:55.076 --> 00:59:56.354
Will I lose my job?

00:59:56.354 --> 00:59:59.070
Will my girlfriend
want to leave me?

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:00.850
Will my friends talk to me?

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.170
I mean, you know, I have
mental health issues.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.540
I'm a recovering
addict and alcoholic.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.940
I shine up pretty good
when I'm taking my medicine

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.120
and I'm not drinking
and drugging.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.150
You know, I'm a pretty
efficient human being.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.740
For me, it came
down to education.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.480
And I think one of the tent
poles of our new national food

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.320
policy has to be education.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.680
I will tell you
right now, and this

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.710
is why I think we're in the
midst of this 30 year thing,

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:37.120
20 years ago I believed in the
mythology that exists today,

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.040
that if you went into a
school in the inner city

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.455
in an outer borough, which is
code for poor people of color.

01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:47.330
I mean, it's just awful.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.226
But if you went out
to a school like that

01:00:49.226 --> 01:00:50.850
and you said where
does milk come from,

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.390
I do believe 20 years
ago a lot of them

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.110
would have answered
the supermarket.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:01:00.360
I do believe that the education
that we have today, most

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.490
of those kids now
say cows, because it

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:04.870
became such a national joke.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.640
Our kids don't know
where milk comes from.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.990
So I think that the education,
especially in schools,

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:13.490
is growing.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:20.200
I believe that your snapshot
of it is extremely accurate.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:25.380
The shame associated with
asking for help is awful.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:25.880
It's awful.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.930
I've been there.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.290
But we all know, we would
tell, if we were all-- I mean,

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:30.940
I'm a parent.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.840
I tell my kid all
the time, asking

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.280
for help is a sign of strength.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.890
It's not a sign of weakness.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.910
And I tell him all
the time, you're

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.920
going to take steps you
don't believe in to get

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.570
results you can't imagine.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:45.160
And they sound like-- those
sayings sound like greeting

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.680
cards, but they really do work.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.460
And I think it's why we
need to have a national food

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.360
program that's
federally funded, and we

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.920
need to make it a
cabinet position

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.680
because we need to divert
education about food

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.530
to the people that need it
the most, parents and kids.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.970
It needs to be taught as
one of our major courses.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.190
I mean, why are we
not teaching food

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:12.030
when we've been doing social
studies and history and math?

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.250
I mean, look, it's
Google, right?

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.810
But take away my quadratic
equation, go for it dude.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.360
Take away my rice
or bread, there's

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.240
revolution in the
streets, right?

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.740
I mean, we need to be studying
food and talking about it

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.300
and devoting educational
resources to it.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.850
But I do believe
it's getting better.

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.900
And I would bet that touch
was is because we have

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.185
to let people go back to work.

01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:32.600
JAMES MULCAHY: It is.
