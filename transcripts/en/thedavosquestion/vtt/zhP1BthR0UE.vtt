&gt;&gt; My name is Bright Simons. I'm the chief
strategist of MPedigree. I am from Ghana.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.519
The issue of contract with medicine is one
but clearly should receive the highest attention,

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.000
the highest levels of government the world.
As we have spent accessing medicines throughout

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.610
the developing world. The quality of the medicines
that we actually supply is of the highest

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.990
importance. Sometime in 1995 as many as three
thousand people died. Three thousand children

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.070
I'm sorry, died from being vaccinated with
fake vaccines. Therefore this is initial clear

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.140
and high importance. And the more that we
ignore this issue less likely are our chances

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.420
of then showing that the monies and investment
that we are putting into us access to medicine

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.829
across the world to bear fruit. Therefore
I urge your leaders of the government to concern

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.050
themselves with issues that are affecting
the developing world like healthcare. We should

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.130
put a lot more emphasis also of the quality
of medicines that we are delivering to this

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.630
part of the world that are (inaudible) like
diseases . I think that is of fundamental

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.640
important at this age.
