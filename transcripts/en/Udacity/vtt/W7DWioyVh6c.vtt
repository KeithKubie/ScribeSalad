00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.670
Surprisingly, the answer is the car would be logged.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's examine why.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.211
The amy object doesn't have a local dot constructor property, but

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.451
amy does delegate the van dot prototype.

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:12.503
Van dot prototype is a brand new object that has been set up to

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:14.370
delegate the Car dot.prototype.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.733
That brand new object does not have its own dot constructor property,

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.140
much like any object coming out of Object dot create should not.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.370
At best, it is an object that delegates to an object that has its own dot

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.313
constructor property.

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:30.650
Car dot prototype has a dot constructor property because every single dot

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.530
prototype object that comes for

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.480
free with the function when it's created is given one

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.160
of these dot constructor properties pointing back to the original function
