00:00:00.614 --> 00:00:03.214
- After Thursday's snow storm,

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:08.212
the snow in Chillytown
was 55 centimeters deep.

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:10.588
On Friday, the snow kept coming

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.926
and several more centimeters fell.

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:14.632
So, okay, they're getting a lot of snow.

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:19.631
Now, the snow in Chillytown
is 84, 84 centimeters deep.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:24.242
How many centimeters
of snow fell on Friday?

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:25.301
So let's look look at this diagram again,

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:28.511
just so that we can imagine what went on.

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:29.710
So, the first time...

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.042
So the snow in Chillytown...

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.802
There's a storm on Thursday,

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:36.261
and then the show in Chillytown
was 55 centimeters deep

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:38.008
and they show that to us right over here.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.311
So this is the 55 centimeters,

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.426
is this point on the ruler.

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:45.011
So this is how deep,

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.607
this is how deep the
snow was after the storm,

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:50.801
after the storm on Thursday.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:51.675
This is how deep.

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:56.510
So this depth right over
here is 55 centimeters.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.004
But the snow did not stop, it kept coming.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.845
So now the snow in Chillytown
is 84 centimeters deep.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.445
So in the ruler, that's
this right over here,

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.801
84 centimeters deep.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.915
So they wanna know how many centimeters

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.516
of snow fell on Friday.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:15.161
So they want us to figure out

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.888
what is this amount right over here?

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:18.383
What is the amount that fell on Friday?

00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:20.027
They even put the question
mark right over here.

00:01:20.028 --> 00:01:22.202
Question mark centimeters.

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.173
So how do we figure that out?

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:25.697
Well, let's just right some...

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:29.618
Let's write some things
that we know are true.

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:32.890
So we know that 55 centimeters...

00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:37.361
55 centimeters, plus however
many centimeters this was,

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.616
so I'll write question centimeters.

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.298
So this is how many were
after Thursday's snow storm,

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:44.251
plus however many fell on Friday.

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.328
We don't know that, so I'm just gonna

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:47.441
write a question mark over there.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.188
That's going to be equal to the total.

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:51.910
That's equal to 84 centimeters.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.344
That's equal to 84 centimeters.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:58.940
So we just need to figure out
what's this question mark.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.602
Well, one way to figure out
what this question mark is

00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:06.112
if 55 plus question mark
is 84, then that means,

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:11.112
that means that 84 minus 55,

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:16.252
minus 55 is going to be
equal to the question mark,

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:18.911
is going to be equal to the question mark.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:20.131
And one way to think about it is,

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:21.698
if you had all this snow and you were to

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:24.095
subtract out 55 centimeters of it,

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:25.050
you're just going to be left

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.508
with the question mark amount

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:30.353
because the difference between 84 and 55

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:32.120
is what fell on Friday.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.229
The difference between 84 and 55.

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.017
So let's figure out what that is.

00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:38.825
So I can do that.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.933
I'm running out of space
here, I'll do it down here.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:46.301
So we have 84, 84

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:51.301
minus 55, minus 55,

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:56.033
and that's going to be
equal to our question mark.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.292
So let's look at our ones place.

00:02:57.293 --> 00:02:59.406
We have four ones minus five ones.

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:01.072
Well, since we don't know how to do that,

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:02.880
since four is less than five,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.079
so let's regroup.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.928
So let's take a 10 from the 10s place.

00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:07.208
Instead of having eight 10s there,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.221
let's have seven 10s there

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.903
and then make that extra 10 we just took,

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:13.382
turn that into 10 ones.

00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:16.247
So 10 plus four is 14.

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:17.549
So now we can subtract.

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.534
14 ones minus five ones.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.464
Let me move down a little bit.

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:26.690
14 ones minus five ones is nine ones.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.591
Seven 10s minus five 10s is two 10s.

00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.736
So our mystery amount
of snow, 29 centimeters.

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:38.820
So this right over here is 29 centimeters.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.465
And you can check that.

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:45.423
55 plus 29 is indeed equal to 84.

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:48.043
I encourage you to try to check

00:03:48.043 --> 00:03:50.156
that that does definitely work.

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:52.474
So how many centimeters
of snow fell on Friday?

00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:56.434
29, 29 centimeters.

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:58.101
The important thing for problems like this

00:03:58.101 --> 00:03:59.868
is just imagine the story.

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:04.582
Imagine what's going on,
and then draw diagrams

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:05.760
if they didn't draw it for you,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.786
and then think about writing
some math statements.

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:11.205
Some people would call
them number sentences

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:13.643
or equations that you
know are going to be true

00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:17.295
and then you can figure
out what you don't know.
