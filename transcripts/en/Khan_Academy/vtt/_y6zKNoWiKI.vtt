00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.150
- [Instructor] The base of a
solid is the region enclosed

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.190
by the graphs of y is
equal to negative x squared

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.350
plus six x minus one
and y is equal to four.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.010
Cross sections of the solid
perpendicular to the x-axis

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.320
are rectangles whose height is x.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.530
Express the volume of the
solid with a definite integral.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.790
So pause this video, and see
if you can have a go at that.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.210
All right, now what's
interesting about this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.260
is they've just given us the
equations for the graphs,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.140
but we haven't visualized them yet.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.970
And we need to visualize
them, or at least I like

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.480
to visualize them so I can
think about this region

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.930
that they're talking about.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.210
So maybe a first thing
to do is think about,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.200
well, where do these two lines intersect?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320
So when do we have the same y-value?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.420
Or another way to think about it is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.070
when does this thing equal four?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.680
So if we set them equal to each other,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.750
we have negative x squared

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.240
plus six x minus one is equal to four.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.600
This will give us the x-values

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.160
where these two lines intersect.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.740
And so we will get, if
we want to solve for x,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.980
we can subtract four from both sides.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.980
Negative x squared plus six x
minus five is equal to zero.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.110
We can multiply both
sides by negative one.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.200
We will get x squared minus six x

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.660
plus five is equal to zero.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.460
And then this is pretty
straightforward to factor.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.310
One times five is five,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.360
or actually I say negative one
times negative five is five.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.690
And negative one plus
negative five is negative six.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.090
So it's going to be x minus one

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.280
times x minus five is equal to zero.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.140
And so these intersect
when x is equal to one

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.890
or x is equal to five.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.720
Since we have a negative out front

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.590
of the second-degree term right over here,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.070
we know it's going to be a
downward-opening parabola.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.750
And we know that we
intersect y equals four

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.220
when x is equal to one and x equals five.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130
And so the vertex must
be right in between them,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.630
so the vertex is going
to be at x equals three.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350
So let's actually visualize
this a little bit.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.980
So it's going to look something like this.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.650
I'll draw it with some perspective
'cause we're gonna have

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.120
to think about a three-dimensional shape.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.220
So that's our y-axis.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.680
This is

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.450
our

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.120
x-axis.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.020
And let me draw some y-values.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.340
So one,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.470
two,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.600
three,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.120
four,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.400
five,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.420
six,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.300
seven, eight.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.960
This is probably sufficient.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.930
Now we have y is equal to four,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.370
which is going to look
something like this.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.310
So that is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.883
y is equal to four.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.060
And then we have y is
equal to negative x squared

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.130
plus six x minus one,
which we know intersects

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.650
y equals four at x equals
one or x equals five.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.670
So let's see, one,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.750
two,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.990
three,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.960
four,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.820
five.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.370
So x equals one, so we have
that point right over there.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.890
One comma four, and then
we have five comma four.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.770
And then we know the vertex
is when x is equal to three,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.100
so it might look something like this.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.840
We could substitute three back in here.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.170
So let's see, y will
equal to negative nine,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.310
three squared,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.140
plus 18

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.420
minus one.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.580
And so what is that going to be?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.750
That's going to be y is
going to be equal to eight.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.060
So we have the point three comma eight.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.120
So this is five, six, seven,
eight, yep, right about there.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.200
And so we are dealing with a situation,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.390
we're dealing with a situation that looks

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.650
something like this.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.750
This is the region in question.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.940
So that's going to be
the base of our solid.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.960
And they say cross sections of the solid

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.120
perpendicular to the x-axis,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.770
so let me draw one of
those cross sections.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.390
So this is a cross section
perpendicular to the x-axis,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.540
are rectangles, whose height is x,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.423
so this is going to have
height x right over here,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.410
height x.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.200
Now what is this, the
width, I guess we could say,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.920
of this rectangle?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.890
Well, it's going to be the difference

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.180
between these two functions.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.090
It's going to be these,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.110
this upper function minus
this lower function.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.930
So it's going to be, that
right over there is going

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.920
to be negative x squared
plus six x minus one

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.680
and then minus four,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.420
minus the lower function.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.700
So that could be simplified
as negative x squared

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400
plus six x minus five.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.390
And so if we wanna figure out the volume

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.140
of this little section right over here,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.740
we'd multiply x times this,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.270
and then we would multiply that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.400
times an infinitesimal small,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.780
infinitesimally small depth, dx.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.030
And then we can just
integrate from x equals one

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.580
to x equals five.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.500
So let's do that.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.060
The volume of just this
little slice over here

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.350
is going to be the base,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.100
which is negative x squared
plus six x minus five,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.950
times the height, times x,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.020
times the depth, times dx.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.580
And then what we wanna do is
we wanna sum up all of these.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.480
So you could imagine right
over here, you would have,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480
or like right over here,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.160
you would have a cross
section that looks like this.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.800
X is now much larger.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.450
The height is x, so now it
looks something like this.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.120
So I'm just drawing two cross sections,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.320
just so you get the idea.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.350
So these are the,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.950
this is any one cross
section for a given x,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.350
but now we want to integrate.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.490
Our x is going from x
equals one to x equals five,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.450
x equals one to x equals five.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.700
And there you have it, we
have expressed the volume

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.440
of that solid as a definite integral.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.740
And it's worth noting that this is,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.640
that this definite integral,
if you distribute this x,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.840
if you multiply it by all of these terms,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.810
it's very solvable.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.643
You don't need a,

00:05:48.643 --> 00:05:50.120
or it's very solvable
without a calculator.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.970
You're just going to get
a polynomial over here

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.810
that you have to take
the antiderivative of

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.083
in order to evaluate
the definite integral.
