00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Narrator] We are
now going to talk about

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.120
what is perhaps the most
important macro molecule in life,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
and that is known as nucleic acid.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.640
Now first of all where
does that name come from?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.580
Well scientists first
observed this in the nucleus

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.840
of cells and so that's where
you get the nucleic part.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.890
And it has some acidic properties

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.920
and so that's where you get the acid part.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.580
And perhaps the most
famous of the nucleic acids

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580
is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA for short.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.490
And we'll go into some
depth in this as we go

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.500
through our journey in biology,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.390
but you might already know
that this is the molecule

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.150
that stores our hereditary information.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.720
This DNA, to a large
degree, makes you you.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.190
And it's known as a macro molecule,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.550
and we've talked about macro
molecules in other videos,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.020
we've talked about carbohydrates,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.150
and we have talked about proteins.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.000
And DNA is a macro molecule

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200
because it can be made of
many millions of atoms.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.460
Just to get a sense of it,
you can see right over here,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.460
the double helix of DNA,
where you have one side

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.920
of your helix right over
there and then another one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.430
right over here and then
you kind of have these rungs

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.610
of this twisted ladder.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.400
A DNA molecule, let's
say in the human genome,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.830
a chromosome, for example,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.260
is primarily a really long DNA molecule.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.600
And they can have on the
order of a hundred million

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.900
rungs to this ladder.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.950
Now another thing to appreciate
like many other macro

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.380
molecules, DNA, or
nucleic acids in general,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.160
they are polymers in that
they're made up of building block

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.040
molecules and those building
blocks for nucleic acids

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.230
and DNA is the most famous nucleic acid

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.880
and RNA, Ribonucleic acid
would be a close second.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.380
But the building blocks of
them are known as nucleotides.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.213
Nucleotides.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:03.000
And we see some examples
of nucleotides over here.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.590
This is deoxyadenosine monophosphate,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.020
which would be a nucleotide found in DNA.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.030
You can see the various parts of it.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.830
You have a phosphate
group right over here.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.830
You have a five carbon sugar,
which in this case, is ribose.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.210
And then you have what is
known as a nitrogenous base.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.440
And why is it called nitrogenous?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.320
Well all those blue
circles represent nitrogen

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.470
and we've seen this before,
the grays are carbons.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.800
And the reds are oxygens
and the whites hydrogens.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.450
And so this part of the molecule

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.380
has some basic characteristics.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.480
While this phosphate group at the end this

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.380
has some acidic characteristics.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.540
And what happens is they
get stacked onto each other

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.380
where the ribosephosphates
alternate to form

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680
the backbone of this DNA molecule.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.900
You can see it right over here

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.850
where you have a phosphate and a ribose

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.410
and a phosphate and a ribose.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.630
And then you have the
nitrogenous base forming

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.000
part of the rung of the ladder.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.150
And the way that DNA
stores information is,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.630
every one of these nitrogenous
bases right over here

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.150
this is adenine, it has a
complimentary nitrogenous base

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.580
on the other to complete
that rung of the ladder.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.680
So adenine matches with thiamine and DNA

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.480
and we'll see in future videos in RNA,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.140
it's a nitrogenous base known as urasil,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.020
and guanine matches with cytosine.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.810
Don't worry too much about this now,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.080
we'll go into some depth
in this in future videos

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.690
when we talk about DNA and how
information is stored in it.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.290
But for the sake of this
video, just appreciate

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.130
that the monomer for a nucleic acid

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.970
like DNA is a nucleotide.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.950
So monomer, and to be very
clear, this would not be

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.010
the only monomer, the
analogous nucleotide in RNA,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.940
which stands for ribonucleic acid would be

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.250
adenosine monophosphate right over here.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.490
You can see the difference between the two

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.110
that we have an oxygen right over here,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.410
and we don't have an
oxygen right over here.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.680
That's why this is
called deoxy, and that's

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.580
why it's deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.270
You're missing one of those oxygens

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.690
on your five carbon sugar.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.910
But adenine as I mentioned is
not the only nitrogenous base.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.020
You could have a nucleotide
where the nitrogenous base

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.030
is thiamine, and so once
again, this looks very similar

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.390
but notice what is going on over here.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.220
You could have a nucleotide
that looks like this.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.220
Once again, you have your
five carbon sugar here,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.590
you have your phosphate group,
but the nitrogenous base

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.590
here keeps on changing.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.060
And it's the order of
these different nucleotides

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.670
that actually encodes
the information in DNA.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.380
Now one question you
might say is, well look,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.210
if I have this part of
the molecule that has

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.330
basic characteristics, why
is it considered an acid?

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.360
Well look at how this
molecule is structured.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.940
The basic parts form the
rungs of this ladder.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.460
So they're not going to be as reactive

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.420
because they're really
tied, they're closer

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.200
to the inside of the molecule
while the acidic parts,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.040
the phosphate groups are on the outside.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.680
So they're going to be more reactive.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.240
And so the molecule as
a whole is going to have

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.620
an acidic characteristic.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.960
I'm going to leave you there.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.530
In future videos we're going to go into

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.720
a lot more depth in the
importance of nucleic acid,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.390
especially DNA and RNA.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.600
And to just appreciate how
amazing these molecules are.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.270
Some folks theorize that
the first signs of life

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.400
were nothing more than
self-replicating RNA molecules

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.390
that eventually got enclosed
in some type of membrane

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.150
structures, which eventually
started forming the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.900
genetic machinery of a cell etc, etc, etc.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.530
So this is why these
nucleic acids are sometimes

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.530
considered the most fundamental
macromolecules to life.
