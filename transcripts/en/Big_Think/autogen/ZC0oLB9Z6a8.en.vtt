00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
a victim of algorithmic their victim of
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.040
a victim of algorithmic their victim of
social segregation of algorithmic

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050
social segregation of algorithmic
 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.170
social segregation of algorithmic
segregation and so I think that we're

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
segregation and so I think that we're
 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.700
segregation and so I think that we're
now starting to see everything for what

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710
now starting to see everything for what
 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.990
now starting to see everything for what
it is I think that we're actually

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
it is I think that we're actually
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.480
it is I think that we're actually
starting to to reabsorb our society and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490
starting to to reabsorb our society and
 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.400
starting to to reabsorb our society and
we're starting to see it and now we have

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
we're starting to see it and now we have
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.920
we're starting to see it and now we have
these individual decisions to make at a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930
these individual decisions to make at a
 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.410
these individual decisions to make at a
very granular level that I don't think

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420
very granular level that I don't think
 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.420
very granular level that I don't think
we ever thought of before and I don't

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
we ever thought of before and I don't
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.849
we ever thought of before and I don't
think that we saw our ramifications so

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859
think that we saw our ramifications so
 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.510
think that we saw our ramifications so
vividly portrayed in real quantitative

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520
vividly portrayed in real quantitative
 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.340
vividly portrayed in real quantitative
analysis and we're all getting data on

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350
analysis and we're all getting data on
 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.490
analysis and we're all getting data on
ourselves now that we didn't have before

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
ourselves now that we didn't have before
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.490
ourselves now that we didn't have before
we never maybe we melt off in class and

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
we never maybe we melt off in class and
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.910
we never maybe we melt off in class and
said something to another person

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920
said something to another person
 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.800
said something to another person
and you know somebody's at all you're a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810
and you know somebody's at all you're a
 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.270
and you know somebody's at all you're a
jerk where but we didn't have

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280
jerk where but we didn't have
 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.820
jerk where but we didn't have
large-scale lynchings like we have now

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830
large-scale lynchings like we have now
 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.980
large-scale lynchings like we have now
in social media when you put something

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990
in social media when you put something
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.120
in social media when you put something
out there I mean think about the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
out there I mean think about the
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.400
out there I mean think about the
polarization that happened in this last

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
polarization that happened in this last
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.930
polarization that happened in this last
election where people are like i'm

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
election where people are like i'm
 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.880
election where people are like i'm
unfriending you I'm you know blocking

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890
unfriending you I'm you know blocking
 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.650
unfriending you I'm you know blocking
you I'm d for you know it's like that

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660
you I'm d for you know it's like that
 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.140
you I'm d for you know it's like that
just created the bigger bigger schism in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150
just created the bigger bigger schism in
 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.540
just created the bigger bigger schism in
our society except we're seeing it now

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
our society except we're seeing it now
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.730
our society except we're seeing it now
and I think that's the fascinating thing

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740
and I think that's the fascinating thing
 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.530
and I think that's the fascinating thing
that's happening is and that's why I

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540
that's happening is and that's why I
 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.090
that's happening is and that's why I
keep going back to this idea of

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100
keep going back to this idea of
 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.940
keep going back to this idea of
evolution evolution is not necessarily

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950
evolution evolution is not necessarily
 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.580
evolution evolution is not necessarily
progress it's one of the biggest themes

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590
progress it's one of the biggest themes
 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.110
progress it's one of the biggest themes
of the book that I hope that people

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120
of the book that I hope that people
 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.950
of the book that I hope that people
understand because they're very nuanced

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960
understand because they're very nuanced
 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.990
understand because they're very nuanced
ideas but just because something is

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000
ideas but just because something is
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120
ideas but just because something is
evolving and changing does it mean that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130
evolving and changing does it mean that
 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.920
evolving and changing does it mean that
it's moving forward in a progressive

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930
it's moving forward in a progressive
 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.290
it's moving forward in a progressive
manner it doesn't mean that it's getting

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
manner it doesn't mean that it's getting
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.480
manner it doesn't mean that it's getting
better necessarily right we have you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
better necessarily right we have you
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.880
better necessarily right we have you
know evolutionary moments throughout

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890
know evolutionary moments throughout
 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.160
know evolutionary moments throughout
living history where things going to

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170
living history where things going to
 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.960
living history where things going to
went this way and it didn't work out so

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970
went this way and it didn't work out so
 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.910
went this way and it didn't work out so
well and they've died off and they and

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920
well and they've died off and they and
 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.790
well and they've died off and they and
so you know hopefully a lot of these

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800
so you know hopefully a lot of these
 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.860
so you know hopefully a lot of these
directions where we're kind of seeing

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870
directions where we're kind of seeing
 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.040
directions where we're kind of seeing
hate for what it is right in immunology

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050
hate for what it is right in immunology
 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.290
hate for what it is right in immunology
there's a great example of this if you

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300
there's a great example of this if you
 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.710
there's a great example of this if you
look at the HIV virus you know we've now

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720
look at the HIV virus you know we've now
 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.450
look at the HIV virus you know we've now
been grappling with this what for over

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460
been grappling with this what for over
 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.260
been grappling with this what for over
30 years now and scientists have gotten

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270
30 years now and scientists have gotten
 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.050
30 years now and scientists have gotten
really good at containing it right you

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060
really good at containing it right you
 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.360
really good at containing it right you
can take a combination of you know drug

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370
can take a combination of you know drug
 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.970
can take a combination of you know drug
cocktail of heart treatment and you can

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980
cocktail of heart treatment and you can
 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.670
cocktail of heart treatment and you can
and you can go in and you can basically

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680
and you can go in and you can basically
 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.090
and you can go in and you can basically
eliminate the virus from the bloodstream

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100
eliminate the virus from the bloodstream
 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.100
eliminate the virus from the bloodstream
but the virus is tricky and that it

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110
but the virus is tricky and that it
 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.740
but the virus is tricky and that it
hides itself in dendritic cells and then

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
hides itself in dendritic cells and then
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.840
hides itself in dendritic cells and then
you know very deep kind of in stem cell

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850
you know very deep kind of in stem cell
 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.710
you know very deep kind of in stem cell
layer of our bodies and it can hide out

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720
layer of our bodies and it can hide out
 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.700
layer of our bodies and it can hide out
for 7 10 15 years and so the second you

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710
for 7 10 15 years and so the second you
 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.150
for 7 10 15 years and so the second you
stop suppressing you know HIV it pops

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160
stop suppressing you know HIV it pops
 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.400
stop suppressing you know HIV it pops
back up it mutates it becomes more

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410
back up it mutates it becomes more
 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.100
back up it mutates it becomes more
virulent etc and so there are two big

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110
virulent etc and so there are two big
 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.890
virulent etc and so there are two big
theories right now in modern kind of

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900
theories right now in modern kind of
 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.130
theories right now in modern kind of
treatment for that one is ferreting it

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140
treatment for that one is ferreting it
 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.260
treatment for that one is ferreting it
out trying to cause the body to trigger

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270
out trying to cause the body to trigger
 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.990
out trying to cause the body to trigger
to release you know the kind of store at

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000
to release you know the kind of store at
 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.560
to release you know the kind of store at
HIV by kind of shocking it and ferreting

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570
HIV by kind of shocking it and ferreting
 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.660
HIV by kind of shocking it and ferreting
it out I look at that a lot like what's

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670
it out I look at that a lot like what's
 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.880
it out I look at that a lot like what's
going on with hate that's varied inside

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890
going on with hate that's varied inside
 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.650
going on with hate that's varied inside
of these people we suddenly had a cat

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660
of these people we suddenly had a cat
 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.050
of these people we suddenly had a cat
list that's ferreting out these hate

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060
list that's ferreting out these hate
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.540
list that's ferreting out these hate
emotions in our society and then the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550
emotions in our society and then the
 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.400
emotions in our society and then the
other thing and the other way to really

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410
other thing and the other way to really
 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.930
other thing and the other way to really
cure it if you look at the Berlin

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940
cure it if you look at the Berlin
 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.060
cure it if you look at the Berlin
patient for instance or the delta i

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070
patient for instance or the delta i
 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.000
patient for instance or the delta i
believe it's Delta 32 variant was there

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010
believe it's Delta 32 variant was there
 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.410
believe it's Delta 32 variant was there
six percent of living Northern Europeans

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420
six percent of living Northern Europeans
 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.530
six percent of living Northern Europeans
that have an immunity to HIV or to the

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540
that have an immunity to HIV or to the
 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.250
that have an immunity to HIV or to the
most popular strain of HIV and so what

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260
most popular strain of HIV and so what
 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.380
most popular strain of HIV and so what
we're doing is in science we're now

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390
we're doing is in science we're now
 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.550
we're doing is in science we're now
taking stem cells from those people and

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560
taking stem cells from those people and
 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.560
taking stem cells from those people and
trying to rewrite a person that's

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570
trying to rewrite a person that's
 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.870
trying to rewrite a person that's
infected with HIV is body so that they

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880
infected with HIV is body so that they
 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.740
infected with HIV is body so that they
can recognize the antigen of HIV and so

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750
can recognize the antigen of HIV and so
 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.660
can recognize the antigen of HIV and so
that they can be use their own immune

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:24.670
that they can be use their own immune
 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.820
that they can be use their own immune

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.760
system to either protect against it or
to get rid of it right to either

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770
to get rid of it right to either
 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.140
to get rid of it right to either
inoculate yourself against HIV and

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150
inoculate yourself against HIV and
 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.240
inoculate yourself against HIV and
change the actual T cells floating

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250
change the actual T cells floating
 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.980

around in your bloodstream or to
 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.380
around in your bloodstream or to
actually teach it how to recognize that

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390
actually teach it how to recognize that
 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.410
actually teach it how to recognize that
as a virus as a foreign antigen and to

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420
as a virus as a foreign antigen and to
 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.960
as a virus as a foreign antigen and to
then rid itself by using the own bodies

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970
then rid itself by using the own bodies
 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.510
then rid itself by using the own bodies
machinery so you're really re teaching

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520
machinery so you're really re teaching
 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.650
machinery so you're really re teaching
your body that this is bad I look at our

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:49.660
your body that this is bad I look at our
 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.460
your body that this is bad I look at our
culture right now as the exact same

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.470
culture right now as the exact same
 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.650
culture right now as the exact same
analogy because we have to teach

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:55.660
analogy because we have to teach
 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.040
analogy because we have to teach
ourselves at a cellular level that this

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.050
ourselves at a cellular level that this
 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.290
ourselves at a cellular level that this
is bad right I start the book off with

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300
is bad right I start the book off with
 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.510
is bad right I start the book off with
the Confederate flag for instance it

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520
the Confederate flag for instance it
 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.200
the Confederate flag for instance it
took 150 years and a mass shooting in

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.210
took 150 years and a mass shooting in
 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.770
took 150 years and a mass shooting in
South Carolina for us and a guy you know

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:10.780
South Carolina for us and a guy you know

want to create a race riot for us to
 

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.740
want to create a race riot for us to
suddenly realize that maybe that flag is

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:16.750
suddenly realize that maybe that flag is
 

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.740
suddenly realize that maybe that flag is
racist maybe it's a symbol of hate maybe

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:19.750
racist maybe it's a symbol of hate maybe
 

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.600
racist maybe it's a symbol of hate maybe
it's a symbol that we need to get rid of

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:21.610
it's a symbol that we need to get rid of
 

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.900
it's a symbol that we need to get rid of
in our culture and so it then takes us

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:24.910
in our culture and so it then takes us
 

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.810
in our culture and so it then takes us
as individuals to learn that and to

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:27.820
as individuals to learn that and to
 

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.790
as individuals to learn that and to
change ourselves and do not propagate

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800
change ourselves and do not propagate
 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.860
change ourselves and do not propagate
that or to learn how to squash it out at

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:31.870
that or to learn how to squash it out at
 

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.870
that or to learn how to squash it out at
a local level and so I think the exact

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880
a local level and so I think the exact
 

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.680
a local level and so I think the exact
same thing that we're learning now with

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:36.690
same thing that we're learning now with
 

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.300
same thing that we're learning now with

those things about teaching our body
that this is bad I think we're now

the hile Trump is a pretty terrible
thing that we should squash out pretty

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:49.780
thing that we should squash out pretty
 

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.079
thing that we should squash out pretty
quickly in our society and not let it

would stay underground
 

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.910

can act upon it in a very organic
 

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.660
can act upon it in a very organic
natural way and hopefully get rid of
