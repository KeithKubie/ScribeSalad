00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.270
One thing I want all of you to do is start looking and

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.520
understanding image formats a little bit.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.960
Look at how the color channels are distributed.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.410
And also what information we can extract about image compression.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.290
And also these days, of course, most camera formats have a EXIF, or

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.260
Exchangeable Image File Format.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.930
Which has information including of course, the width and

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.230
the height of the image.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.690
But also things like how it is coded and

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.920
what are the compressions associated with it.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.360
But more importantly these things also has information like the date the image

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.240
was captured geotags, and other information that's added in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.670
as an additional data structure with an image data cell.
