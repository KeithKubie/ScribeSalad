00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.440
You may recall this explanation from our lesson on explanation-based learning.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.230
There, the agent constructed an explanation like this to show that a specific

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.514
object was an example of a cup. For a good example of a pail, the agent may

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:16.468
have constructed similar explanation with the object being replaced by pail

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:22.210
everywhere. Now however, the agent knows that pail is not an example of a cup.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.225
Something is not quite right with this explanation. We've also just seen how

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:31.500
the agent can identify the false suspicious relationship in this explanation.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.640
It is identified, but the handle must be fixed because that is the feature that

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.130
separates the positive experiences from the negative experiences.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.140
The question then becomes, how can this explanation be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
repaired by incorporating handle as fixed? Where should handle as fixed go?
