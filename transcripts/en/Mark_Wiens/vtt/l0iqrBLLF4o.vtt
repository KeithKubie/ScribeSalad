00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:01.869
- Hey, everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.877
I am hanging out with Mike Chen.

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:06.071
- What's up, guys?

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.950
- He's an amazing food lover.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.068
And we're gonna take you on
a noodle tour of Bangkok.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.037
we're gonna eat some of the best noodles

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:16.521
and a well-rounded
variety of Thai noodles.

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:17.900
- Noodles are one of my favorite things

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.850
and we both love spicy food as well.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.852
- Yes, we do.

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:22.467
- So, I think we're gonna
get along pretty well.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:23.723
- It's gonna be an awesome day.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:26.306
(upbeat music)

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:30.691
In this video, Mike and I
are taking you on an ultimate

00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.548
Thai street food noodle tour of Bangkok,

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:35.281
where you'll discover five
different Thai noodle dishes

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.125
that you don't want to miss
eating when you're in Thailand.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.862
We had to begin this tour with
something big and beautiful.

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:44.080
And I'm talking about one of
the most impressive, giant,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.826
bubbling pans of meat
you'll find in Bangkok.

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:49.783
The first restaurant, this
place is called Wattana Panich.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.913
And this place is legendary in Bangkok

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.188
for their beef noodles,
their braised beef noodles,

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:58.659
Chinese-Thai style and
the absolute best thing,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.077
or the icon of this restaurant is their,

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:05.654
it's almost like a jacuzzi
of this eternal bubbling

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:09.465
beef parts and juices and oils and fats.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.203
- That was the craziest things
I've seen in Bangkok so far.

00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:14.316
And there's different
parts of cow in there.

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:15.395
- You can see everything.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.474
If you just gaze across
the surface of that pan

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:22.451
you see beef chunks, you see
tripe, you see intestines,

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.007
you see other unknown parts.

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:26.307
- [Mike] And you're telling
me that this thing is,

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:27.963
like, eternal.

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:30.835
- Yeah, they never turn off the fire.

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:33.450
Which brews beneath there.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.359
This is called kuay teow neua tukyang.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.502
So it's beef noodles with everything.

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.014
There's some beef balls in there.

00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:44.674
And it also includes both
braised beef and also fresh beef.

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:47.032
- [Mike] So I mean, do
they have hot oil here?

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:48.379
- They don't have hot oil.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.892
Usually the Thai seasonings
is chili vinegar.

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:52.693
Chili flakes and fish sauce.

00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:53.834
All right, let's go in for the broth.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.867
You can see how thick and rich that is.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:57.851
- Oh, that is fatty, that is fatty.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.351
- [Mark And Mike] Cheers, man.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.190
- Oh my God, that is, whoa.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.222
- Oh, it's good.

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:06.887
- That thing, that thing,
that broth can afford

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.091
to fly first class, that's how rich it is.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:10.278
I mean, wow.

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:11.111
- Oh, man.

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:14.299
It's like, you can actually
taste like the fatty collagen

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.664
thickness of that, man.

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:18.181
- I almost had to chew that broth.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.705
- Soup number five.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.122
Soup number five.

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:22.121
Here it is.

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:23.126
The soup number five.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.126
- I don't know what that means.

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.127
But I'm a little scared.

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:27.662
It looks, I see Chinese
herbs in there already.

00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:30.121
But I'm excited, I'm excited.

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.755
Whatever you're bringing out, I'll eat it.

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:34.375
- [Mark] Okay, so should we
season our noodles first?

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.740
Then we can proceed on with the other.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.925
- [Mike] How do you typically
season your noodles?

00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:39.078
- [Mark] Normally, this
is just crushed up chilis,

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:40.409
marinated in vinegar.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.488
- [Mike] I see that a
lot here in Thailand.

00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:43.556
- [Mark] Normally, do you like it sour?

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:44.578
- [Mike] I do.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:45.411
- [Mark] I love it sour, so.

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:46.244
- [Mike] Thank you, yeah.

00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:47.626
Load it in, absolutely.

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.126
- [Mark] Probably like.

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:50.135
- [Mike] Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:51.437
- Scoops of that.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:52.988
Usually this is not really spicy.

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:54.152
But it's just fragrant.

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:57.033
And the spice comes from
the ground red chili.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:03:00.093
So this is more for sourness.

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:02.487
- And then we got the heat coming up.

00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:04.987
I'm like, I just shovel it in.

00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:07.264
It's okay.

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:09.833
- [Mark] Usually about two scoops or so.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.062
Two scoops should do it.

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:14.277
- [Mike] This is where
things get beautiful.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.320
- Oh, look at that.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.424
You can see the color of
that broth just goes from

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:20.387
that dark brown color
to like a maroon almost.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:21.220
- Oh.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.497
Dude.

00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:26.664
That just made it magical.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.226
That's ridiculous.

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.129
You know, it has all the elements I like.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.212
Flavorful, it's vinegary.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.457
Man, that beef is flavorful.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:44.553
That beef is really flavorful.

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:45.551
- [Mark] Did you try the braised beef?

00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.584
- Yeah.

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:48.193
I mean, I think I had a
piece with a little bit

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.200
of tendon in there.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.950
But this piece looks
really braised actually.

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:55.631
- Oh yeah.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.405
Oh the braised beef is so tender.

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:59.948
That broth, yeah you just gotta drink it.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.623
- I'm not even being civilized here.

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:03.298
- It's so good.

00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:04.593
- [Mike] Let's move on
to our second item here.

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:05.595
- [Mark] Okay.

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:06.646
- [Mike] What do we got here?

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:07.797
- I think this one is goat.

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:10.464
And then this one is bull penis.

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:12.789
Soup number five.

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.437
- Oh, so that's the mysterious soup.

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.193
I knew that the way you
said that I was like,

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.533
number five, I think
something is off with that.

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:21.209
- Are we going straight in here?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.545
Or should we taste the soup first.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:23.642
- Okay, let's taste the soup first.

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:24.711
- Let's taste the soup first.

00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:25.722
- Ease our way in.

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:26.555
- Ease our way in.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:27.388
- It is very thick.

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:28.221
- Okay.

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:30.964
- Okay, the soup is good.

00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:33.245
- [Mark] Oh, it's good.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:34.905
It's amazing.

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:36.065
- [Mike] That soup is good.

00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:36.898
- It's so herbal.

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:41.065
I think we should go in for
bigger and better things now.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:45.935
Oh.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.717
It's actually incredible.

00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:50.252
- [Mike] I don't know if I
would use the word incredible.

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:51.466
It's different.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.131
- [Mark] Oh, I love it actually.

00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:56.135
- [Mike] It's sort of
like, it's really soft.

00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:57.635
But not too slimy.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.705
- [Mark] A little bit slimy.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:00.706
- It's a little slimy.

00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:02.618
It's got a little aftertaste to it.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.295
Was there a little bitterness to it?

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:05.799
I think I'm good with that one bite.

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:06.919
I mean.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.918
- Man, I really love it.

00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:09.143
Almost like intestines.

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:11.187
- [Mike] Yeah, less chewy.

00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:12.186
- But even less chewy.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:13.191
They're softer.

00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.205
Should we move into the other one?

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:15.038
- Yeah, let's do it.

00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:16.202
Let's do a piece of lean meat here.

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:17.975
All right, cool.

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:19.505
Yours got bones in it, you
gotta be a little careful.

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:20.504
- Yeah, yeah.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:22.350
I'll kind of nibble around the bones here.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.266
- [Mike] I'm just gonna
one bite this thing.

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.099
- Oh.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.491
- Oh, that's nice.

00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.150
- Oh, that just melts in your mouth.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.989
- That's great.

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:31.972
- After that stunning bowl of
beef noodles and that soup,

00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:36.117
we, Mike and I are just here
admiring the jacuzzi of beef.

00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:37.593
- [Mike] It's like
watching a meaty sunset.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:39.024
You can't look away.

00:05:39.024 --> 00:05:41.652
- I could just stare
into that all day long.

00:05:41.652 --> 00:05:44.028
And they actually use a shovel.

00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:47.804
To like scrape off all of that beefy fat

00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:49.950
that's probably caramelized
on the bottom of the pan.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.469
- You can't have it burned, so.

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.894
- It's just the cycle of
flavor that never ends.

00:05:53.894 --> 00:05:56.477
(upbeat music)

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.256
We just made it to the next restaurant.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.694
Mike, we're gonna eat here pad see ew.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.619
Like a fried noodles with soy sauce.

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:05.645
Thick noodles, yup.

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:06.738
- Oh, I'm excited.

00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:10.206
Is that what people call
drunken noodles in the States?

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.726
- It's a little bit
different, but same noodles.

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:13.183
Same actual like rice noodles.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.517
Standing here at the
front of the restaurant

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.743
watching them cook and
assemble the noodles,

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.982
and especially watching
him make that pad see ew,

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:20.598
it's just incredible.

00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:22.482
He puts in the egg and
the meat and then just

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.221
scratches it around on
the extremely hot wok.

00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.395
And the smoke just billows.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:28.882
So they actually have a chimney.

00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:31.439
And they have like fiber glass windows

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.499
so that it blocks in all the smoke.

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.039
Otherwise this entire
restaurant would just

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.361
be filled with the smoke.

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:39.712
This place is called Nay Lao Radna Yodpak.

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:43.181
And this place specializes
in two main noodle dishes.

00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:44.842
One of them is called radna.

00:06:44.842 --> 00:06:48.001
Which is, it's a noodle
dish with gravy sauce.

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:49.948
And the other dish is called pad see ew.

00:06:49.948 --> 00:06:53.812
Which is stir fried Thai
noodles with soy sauce.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.883
This restaurant is just buzzing right now.

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:58.415
And partly because we're here
right at the lunch time rush.

00:06:58.415 --> 00:06:59.413
- I can't wait.

00:06:59.413 --> 00:07:01.628
This is my first time
eating a noodle dish I love

00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:03.801
in the country of its origin.

00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:05.769
- And there's an egg fried within here.

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:08.062
There's pork, there's, I see the pork.

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.061
- Cheers, my friend.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.228
- Cheers, man.

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:15.300
- [Mike] Dude.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.095
- [Mark] Oh, the smokiness
of those noodles.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:18.796
- That is really good.

00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:20.877
I'll be honest, I mean, I don't know,

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.065
it doesn't look like much.

00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:25.367
But holy cow, that flavor.

00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:27.061
- You can just see a cloud
of smoke that's rising

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:28.936
from the wok as he's cooking it.

00:07:28.936 --> 00:07:31.199
So you know it's gonna have that smoky,

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.912
that deep smoky flavor.

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:34.938
- That is something you
never have in the U.S.

00:07:34.938 --> 00:07:36.193
- I think what we should do though is,

00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:38.865
we should try the other pad see ew first.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:40.402
To like compare that same flavor.

00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:42.178
Another version of pad see ew.

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:43.182
- [Mike] Yeah, let's do it.

00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:44.302
- [Mark] Just with different noodles.

00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:45.772
And with an extra omelet on top.

00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:48.282
So it's an extra egg
is always a good idea.

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:50.699
- And some gailan, of course.

00:07:59.858 --> 00:08:01.915
That was, can I say it?

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.338
That was all about the egg.

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:04.838
The egg is fluffy.

00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:09.594
But slightly like almost like
caramelized on the edges.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:11.497
I mean the noodles are
great, noodles are great.

00:08:11.497 --> 00:08:13.302
But that egg was the star.

00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:14.191
- All right, Mike.

00:08:14.191 --> 00:08:16.756
Third bowl of noodles,
this one is the radna

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:18.169
which is the gravy sauce with noodles.

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:20.059
So this is like a different composition

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:21.800
of a noodle dish here.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.830
- [Mike] Let's do it.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.983
- [Mark] And it's a thick gravy.

00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:25.278
But then the same ingredients.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:26.802
The same rice noodles.

00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:28.727
The gailan, the pork in here.

00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:30.406
- [Mike] I feel like
that's a common theme.

00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:34.573
- [Mark] You just admire the
stickiness of that sauce.

00:08:37.637 --> 00:08:38.470
- Oh.

00:08:39.438 --> 00:08:41.799
That pork is ridiculous.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.942
I do feel like this needs some acid.

00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:45.350
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.325
Vinegar and chilis.

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:48.868
Has to be done.

00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:51.755
- [Mike] It's gonna come down to that.

00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:52.754
- Vinegar.

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:53.587
- Yup.

00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:57.781
- Maybe a few more of these chilis.

00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:58.614
- Do it.

00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:02.069
- And then yeah, the chili.

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:03.349
Hit it with the chili, man.

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:05.682
- [Mike] Let's make it rain.

00:09:06.726 --> 00:09:08.202
- That's a beautiful rain.

00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:09.202
- Oh.

00:09:09.202 --> 00:09:10.203
I love it.

00:09:10.203 --> 00:09:11.207
- Oh yeah.

00:09:11.207 --> 00:09:12.842
- [Mike] Okay, so mix it up a little bit.

00:09:12.842 --> 00:09:14.759
Mix it up a little bit.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.188
- Get a goo going.

00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:20.074
This is one of those noodles
dishes where you almost

00:09:20.074 --> 00:09:22.324
have to like, kind of like eat it fast

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:23.667
before it slides out of your spoon.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.750
- Yeah, this is not gonna
be pretty, just saying.

00:09:28.763 --> 00:09:30.085
- [Mark] I love it with
the vinegar, though.

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:32.407
We need them to top this
with another omelet.

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:33.405
- I think so.

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:37.572
That omelet is like my
favorite thing on this dish.

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.139
- Oh, oh, that's good.

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:43.879
- I love them both.

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:46.224
I feel like, I don't know.

00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:47.226
How do you choose?

00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:48.765
It's like if you have two kids,

00:09:48.765 --> 00:09:50.552
who do you choose?

00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:52.301
You wanna keep 'em both.

00:09:52.301 --> 00:09:55.425
But I think the omelet from
here to this dish right here,

00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.788
that's be my perfect.

00:09:56.788 --> 00:09:57.777
- [Mark] Cool.

00:09:57.777 --> 00:09:59.012
- [Mike] But this place is fantastic.

00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:00.563
- We ordered his wish.

00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:02.009
His dream come true.

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:05.543
The wide rice noodles pad see
ew with the omelet on top.

00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:07.025
- [Mike] This is beautiful,
thank you so much

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:08.502
for thinking of me while on the way.

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:12.002
I think this is the dream team right here.

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.845
- [Mark] That was good.

00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:20.333
- I'm so happy.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:23.018
- That pad see ew was stunning, actually.

00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:25.820
The smokiness of that charred
flavor of those noodles

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.746
was unbelievable.

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:30.783
- At least Thai noodles,
you ruined it for me.

00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:32.044
- And we are on our way next

00:10:32.044 --> 00:10:34.317
to go eat boat noodles.

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:35.356
- [Mike] Oh wow.

00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:37.104
- Yup, this is it right here.

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:40.771
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:51.971
To make Thai boat noodles,

00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:54.199
they first added some
seasonings to a bowl.

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:56.683
Blanched the rice noodles
in fresh morning glory.

00:10:56.683 --> 00:10:59.604
And doused it in the thick
murky and full of flavor

00:10:59.604 --> 00:11:01.104
pig's blood broth.

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:08.326
This is the pig's blood here.

00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:09.332
Raw pig's blood.

00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:10.330
- That's raw pig's blood.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.771
- [Mark] Then she takes it

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.175
and then she dumps it into the soup

00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:15.416
to slightly cook it and
then that makes the broth.

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:16.499
- [Mike] Wow.

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.962
- Mike, look at all these boat noodles.

00:11:21.962 --> 00:11:24.954
And this restaurant is
called Khon Mee Sen.

00:11:24.954 --> 00:11:27.402
And this is a little
bit off the beaten path.

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:30.290
This is a restaurant near
to Pad Kret in Nonthaburi,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.950
so we're probably about 20
kilometers outside of central

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.719
downtown Bangkok.

00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:36.514
And I've been to this
boat noodle restaurant.

00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:38.107
But it's probably been a couple years ago.

00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:39.535
And again, we got two different noodles.

00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:41.280
We got the sen lak, which is
the medium sized rice noodle.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.205
And the sen mee which are
the thin rice noodles.

00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:47.209
- [Mike] So the broth is extremely thick.

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:48.337
- [Mark] Yeah, you can, oh man.

00:11:48.337 --> 00:11:49.993
It's almost like a gravy.

00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:53.062
Kind of slurp it all down
in a one biter, if you want.

00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:54.645
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:00.993
- I'll admit.

00:12:00.993 --> 00:12:02.524
This just kind of scares me.

00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:03.918
'Cause blood scares me.

00:12:03.918 --> 00:12:06.256
Because I'm not a vampire.

00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:07.726
And I had this in New York

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:10.463
where the soup, it was more soup.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.173
Than like saucy noodles.

00:12:12.173 --> 00:12:14.774
But this, I can't really
tell there's blood in here.

00:12:14.774 --> 00:12:16.752
- The blood really acts to rich it.

00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:20.382
And really like, for me it
really enhances the flavor.

00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:21.407
I love it.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.839
And I got a big piece
of liver in that bite.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.469
And if you can see the liver,

00:12:25.469 --> 00:12:27.314
the liver is half raw as well.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:28.333
- I see that.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:29.337
- [Mark] And it's awesome.

00:12:29.337 --> 00:12:31.035
The liver, it just melts in your mouth.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:32.639
- [Mike] With a bit vinegar.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.472
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:12:33.472 --> 00:12:34.305
- [Mike] I think it will be awesome.

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:35.138
- [Mark] You have to, man.

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:35.971
- [Mike] Let me hook you up.

00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:36.804
- You have to, thank you.

00:12:36.804 --> 00:12:38.002
Another thing that complements,

00:12:38.002 --> 00:12:39.738
That I feel complements
the boat noodles so well

00:12:39.738 --> 00:12:40.739
is sweet basil.

00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:41.738
- Yeah.

00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:42.855
- And you can just grab.

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.028
You can either just chase it,

00:12:44.028 --> 00:12:46.380
or you can toss some leaves in there.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.853
I might have to spoon it on this, man.

00:12:47.853 --> 00:12:48.838
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:49.853
No, do what you gotta do.

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.688
- I'm gonna spoon it.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.357
So we can get, you can
maximize the amount we can get

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.940
in one single bite.

00:12:57.771 --> 00:12:59.104
Oh no, my basil.

00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:01.222
- It just, we gotta just make sure

00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:02.865
we don't leave anything out.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:03.867
All right, cheers.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:04.700
- Cheers.

00:13:14.437 --> 00:13:15.932
- That's fantastic.

00:13:15.932 --> 00:13:18.761
I mean, the flavor is so rich.

00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.928
And again, not, no blood taste at all.

00:13:22.852 --> 00:13:24.435
- [Mark] Delicious.

00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:33.786
Load up with some bean sprouts even.

00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:36.634
- That'll give it some nice crunch.

00:13:36.634 --> 00:13:39.633
- That basil is where it's at, though.

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:40.618
- [Mike] There you go.

00:13:40.618 --> 00:13:41.688
- Thank you, man.

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:44.271
These chili flakes are amazing.

00:13:46.948 --> 00:13:48.365
Stir this around.

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:51.436
All right, next bowl.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.067
- Fantastic.

00:13:58.067 --> 00:13:59.339
Fantastic.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.170
- [Mark] Stack up the bowls.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.658
- [Mike] Whoa, is this pork rind?

00:14:02.658 --> 00:14:04.855
- [Mark] You crunch it up
inside the boat noodles.

00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:07.647
And that gives it the
extra crunchy dimension.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:08.512
- [Mike] Wow.

00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:10.549
- And that is what takes your boat noodles

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.318
to a final level of excellence.

00:14:13.318 --> 00:14:14.151
Oh yeah.

00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:21.811
- Oh.

00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:24.421
That is awesome.

00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:26.619
- It's like a crunch sponge.

00:14:26.619 --> 00:14:27.624
All right.

00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:29.207
- [Mike] All right.

00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:32.385
- We just finished with the boat noodles.

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:34.434
That was extremely satisfying.

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:35.425
So good.

00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:36.558
- Coma setting in.

00:14:36.558 --> 00:14:37.975
Boat noodle coma.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.561
- Again, you can feel free
to lean your chair back, man.

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:44.728
- If I'm not quiet here for
about 30 minutes, I'm gone.

00:14:46.327 --> 00:14:49.473
- I'll make sure to stay
awake 'cause I'm driving.

00:14:49.473 --> 00:14:53.473
We're driving on our way
to the next restaurant.

00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:56.086
That was a little bit of a long drive,

00:14:56.086 --> 00:14:57.525
but we made it to an area.

00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:58.934
This area is called Saphan Kwai.

00:14:58.934 --> 00:15:00.549
- I smell durian.

00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:01.565
Right now.

00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:03.475
- Oh, it's right there, hello.

00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:05.191
That smells delicious.

00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:06.797
We're gonna head over to
what is one of my favorite

00:15:06.797 --> 00:15:10.964
street food styles for
bamee, which is egg noodles.

00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:22.131
Saphan Kwai is a real Bangkok
Thai street food paradise.

00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.048
There's a lot of good
street food in this area.

00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:32.222
This place is called Uwan
Bamee Giew Guangdong.

00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:35.232
And this is one of my favorite
just simple street food

00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:37.315
restaurants in Bangkok.

00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:39.728
He is a master of bamee
which are egg noodles.

00:15:39.728 --> 00:15:42.757
And he makes the egg noodles
fresh himself every day.

00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:44.391
He kind of like loosens the noodles.

00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.730
He boils them for the
perfect amount of time.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.378
You can tell that he's an artist.

00:15:48.378 --> 00:15:49.944
He drops them into the bowl.

00:15:49.944 --> 00:15:52.469
Then he kind of fishes around the soup.

00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:54.855
He fishes out some of those dumplings.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.714
And then adds in the different sauces.

00:15:56.714 --> 00:16:00.626
I ordered for us the bamee giew moo daeng.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.112
And this is egg noodles
with dumplings in here.

00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:04.466
You got the shrimp dumplings.

00:16:04.466 --> 00:16:06.582
And then moo daeng is
the, it's the Thai version

00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:07.915
of cha siu.

00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:09.994
But it's a little bit different.

00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:11.088
It's kind of Thai-ified.

00:16:11.088 --> 00:16:13.393
- Is there a reason why there's
always a fish ball in here?

00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:14.453
- There's always at least one.

00:16:14.453 --> 00:16:15.688
- Like one.

00:16:15.688 --> 00:16:17.749
There's always, we
always get one fish ball.

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:19.311
- I think it's just that
whole variety of meats

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.227
and everything.

00:16:21.227 --> 00:16:23.517
And I love how he just kind of
handles the noodles artfully

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:25.517
before he blanches them.

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:30.554
He just, he knows his
noodles so well like a child.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.781
Oh.

00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:38.053
Oh, I love it.

00:16:38.053 --> 00:16:40.988
- [Mike] I got a beautiful
crispy pork skin with mine.

00:16:40.988 --> 00:16:44.142
And that provided such
a contrast in texture.

00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:45.880
- [Mark] The noodles
are so light and fluffy.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.265
Because they're so so thin.

00:16:47.265 --> 00:16:48.266
- It's really springy.

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:49.353
Really springy.

00:16:49.353 --> 00:16:51.182
- [Mark] They don't have
any of that kind of like

00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:52.265
floury taste.

00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:55.981
- The filling is excellent.

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:58.942
Right?

00:16:58.942 --> 00:17:00.940
- It almost has a bacon taste to it.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.857
- Beautiful, beautiful.

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:07.156
I wanna try some of this
soup in there a little bit.

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:09.489
- Yeah, you can do that too.

00:17:10.659 --> 00:17:12.139
- Oh yeah, the soup is very light.

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:13.889
Very light in flavor.

00:17:15.224 --> 00:17:16.519
And I don't know about
you, but whenever I see

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:19.486
a meat on a bone, my Chinese instinct

00:17:19.486 --> 00:17:22.395
is just telling me to gnaw on it.

00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:23.228
Oh.

00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:26.946
This is one of those bones that,

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:28.781
meats off the bones that the more you chew

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.304
the more the flavor releases.

00:17:30.304 --> 00:17:31.537
You don't.

00:17:31.537 --> 00:17:33.953
- It's just like creamy
porky goodness, man.

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:36.517
- You don't get a release of
flavor in this first bite.

00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:38.607
But as you chew it, you're like, wow.

00:17:38.607 --> 00:17:41.813
The depths of the flavor,
it's hidden inside.

00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:44.114
- That's been boiled for a
very long time, you know that.

00:17:44.114 --> 00:17:46.467
- And I got a piece
where I got the collagen

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:49.460
so it's little crunchy bones.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.520
- I got a little something
gelatinous on that bite.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.932
But they would definitely
be better with some chili.

00:17:53.932 --> 00:17:54.765
- [Mike] Oh yeah, yeah.

00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:55.598
Heck yeah.

00:17:55.598 --> 00:17:56.431
- [Mark] And vinegar.

00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:57.326
- [Mike] Heck yeah.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.625
Here, you want a whole spoon full?

00:17:58.625 --> 00:17:59.756
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:00.954
- [Mike] Thank you.

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:01.951
- [Mark] You wanna put some vinegar?

00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:03.607
- [Mike] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:06.190
(upbeat music)

00:18:08.238 --> 00:18:10.896
And I'm gonna go ahead and
add this in my broth as well.

00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:11.981
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:18:11.981 --> 00:18:15.215
- I'm gonna have my noodles take a dive.

00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:18.298
And right there, that's a 10 pointer.

00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:25.833
- Just look at that, the
beauty of these noodles.

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.591
They all have their own
personality, every noodle.

00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.461
- [Mike] It's cascading spice right there.

00:18:30.461 --> 00:18:32.439
- [Mark] Yeah, that's,
oh, that's beautiful.

00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:35.142
- [Mike] That's like
a waterfall of beauty.

00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:36.160
- [Mark] Oh, man.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.410
- That's a spice waterfall.

00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:43.713
That looked wonderful.

00:18:43.713 --> 00:18:44.715
Dude.

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:47.241
- What a bite, man, what a bite.

00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:48.518
That was superb.

00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:49.878
I loved it.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:50.938
Every single bite of it.

00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:54.605
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:58.177
- That was great.

00:18:58.177 --> 00:18:59.175
- What did you think, Mike?

00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:00.174
- That was probably the best egg noodles

00:19:00.174 --> 00:19:01.678
I've had outside of Hong Kong.

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:02.685
- Cool.

00:19:02.685 --> 00:19:05.317
- And I love everything
they threw in there.

00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:07.900
(upbeat music)

00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:12.778
- We've been walking
around for a little while.

00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:14.666
And we actually just
kind of ran out of time

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:17.683
to go to more famous pad thai restaurant.

00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:19.982
But there's this restaurant
that's very close

00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:21.557
to where we just had the egg noodles.

00:19:21.557 --> 00:19:23.890
It's called Pad Thai Je Tim.

00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:26.528
I know nothing about this place.

00:19:26.528 --> 00:19:27.947
I've never been here.

00:19:27.947 --> 00:19:28.944
But let's check it out.

00:19:28.944 --> 00:19:30.611
Let's see how it is.

00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:37.744
To make pad thai, he
first tossed in some tofu.

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.849
A spoonful of dried shrimp.

00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:42.277
And then a few fresh shrimp.

00:19:42.277 --> 00:19:44.343
He then cracked in a couple of eggs.

00:19:44.343 --> 00:19:46.124
Let them hiss and sizzle.

00:19:46.124 --> 00:19:49.276
Before adding in the main
pad thai rice noodles.

00:19:49.276 --> 00:19:51.820
To season, he added in a
number of different sauces

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.654
including a sweet tangy tamarind sauce.

00:19:55.654 --> 00:19:58.237
(upbeat music)

00:20:04.827 --> 00:20:06.152
All right, Mike.

00:20:06.152 --> 00:20:08.529
I gotta tell you, pad thai is
not really one of my favorite

00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:11.592
noodle dishes, Thai noodle dishes.

00:20:11.592 --> 00:20:13.869
- But it is traditional Thai cuisine.

00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:16.264
- Yeah, yeah, it is popular in Thailand.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:19.977
But I think sometimes it
gets even more of publicity

00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:22.326
because it's so famous
outside of Thailand.

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:24.293
It's a dish, noodle
dish that's usually more

00:20:24.293 --> 00:20:25.645
on the sweet side.

00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:29.092
Which is why it's not
my preference of a dish.

00:20:29.092 --> 00:20:30.663
But it's, it can be good.

00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:32.943
And I don't eat it that often.

00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:35.183
So it's gonna be good
to try this pad thai.

00:20:35.183 --> 00:20:36.176
- I'm excited.

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:38.110
I mean, like you said,
it is really popular.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.156
It's number one probably
number one Thai dish item

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:43.500
that we eat, at least in the U.S.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.172
So I'm excited to see the difference

00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:48.098
of authentic version than what we have

00:20:48.098 --> 00:20:49.665
back in the States.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.415
Why is this in a omelet?

00:20:51.415 --> 00:20:54.478
- Yeah, so this one is,
it's called a haw kai.

00:20:54.478 --> 00:20:55.502
So they wrap it in a egg.

00:20:55.502 --> 00:20:57.782
It's actually it's the
same type of noodle.

00:20:57.782 --> 00:20:59.192
They fried it in the same batch.

00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:00.471
- [Mike] But they wrap it in an omelet.

00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:01.736
- [Mark] This one is just
with shrimp but then this one

00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:02.738
they wrapped in omelet.

00:21:02.738 --> 00:21:03.744
- I feel like that's pretty ingenious.

00:21:03.744 --> 00:21:04.743
I'm gonna cut this in half

00:21:04.743 --> 00:21:07.617
so we can kind of see the anatomy

00:21:07.617 --> 00:21:10.575
of this pad thai omelet thingie.

00:21:10.575 --> 00:21:11.606
- There's tofu in there.

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:14.254
There's also dried shrimp.

00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:18.061
As well as big shrimp, fresh shrimp.

00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:19.060
Oh yeah.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.143
- Here we go.

00:21:23.972 --> 00:21:24.805
Oh.

00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:28.231
That is good.

00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:29.230
- Like it?

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.342
- You can give your
verdict, expert verdict.

00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:35.692
But to somebody who just
had pad thai in Thailand

00:21:35.692 --> 00:21:38.155
for the first time, that's really good.

00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:39.153
- Cool.

00:21:39.153 --> 00:21:40.167
- To me that's really good.

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:41.632
I don't know, what do you think?

00:21:41.632 --> 00:21:42.895
- It's okay.

00:21:42.895 --> 00:21:43.728
It's okay.

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:47.211
But like I said, I'm not huge on the dish.

00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:48.320
Pad thai in the first place.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.333
- But,

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:50.750
so as a pad thai,

00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:53.507
I know you don't love this dish.

00:21:53.507 --> 00:21:55.785
But as a dish itself, compared
to the other ones you've had

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:57.524
in this country,

00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.053
is this just okay, right, still?

00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:01.284
- I think it's okay, yeah.

00:22:01.284 --> 00:22:04.422
Other versions that have again, other like

00:22:04.422 --> 00:22:07.816
street food versions,
they'd have more of a smoky,

00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:11.045
you taste the smoke point on it.

00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:12.922
So yeah, I've had better versions.

00:22:12.922 --> 00:22:15.192
- So I'm gonna take a bite
of this banana leaf thing.

00:22:15.192 --> 00:22:17.886
- Oh yeah, that's good.

00:22:17.886 --> 00:22:18.886
It's chalky.

00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:26.680
- Why's it doing weird
things to my tongue?

00:22:27.632 --> 00:22:28.465
Wow.

00:22:29.429 --> 00:22:30.716
- It has a very chalkiness to it.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:33.172
And kind of a little bit of a bitterness.

00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:35.085
The other pad thai, and this
is just pad thai goong sod.

00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:38.062
Which is just with fresh shrimp.

00:22:38.062 --> 00:22:41.393
And gotta season that
with the wedge of lime.

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.454
- [Mike] Can we use this chili powder?

00:22:42.454 --> 00:22:44.132
- Yes, please.

00:22:44.132 --> 00:22:45.549
On those peanuts.

00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:49.898
All right.

00:22:49.898 --> 00:22:50.731
- Cheers.

00:22:58.473 --> 00:23:00.241
- You wanna chase that with some chives?

00:23:00.241 --> 00:23:02.123
- Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:04.440
- I love the chives, man.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.607
- Really good.

00:23:06.997 --> 00:23:08.676
- They're quite mild.

00:23:08.676 --> 00:23:09.910
So not only a lot of good noodles,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.071
but that was a lot of fun.

00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:12.393
Tasting all those
different types of noodles.

00:23:12.393 --> 00:23:13.475
All in a single day.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.522
What was your favorite?

00:23:15.522 --> 00:23:17.896
- Definitely the first place we went to.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.897
- The beef noodles.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.039
- With, especially with the omelet.

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:22.570
In the wide noodles.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.041
- Oh, the fried noodle one.

00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.734
- Yeah, yeah, the pad see ew, yeah.

00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:28.265
With the omelet on top,
it was transformative.

00:23:28.265 --> 00:23:29.502
- Oh yeah.

00:23:29.502 --> 00:23:30.523
Oh, that was good.

00:23:30.523 --> 00:23:31.531
Oh, I'd almost forgotten about that place.

00:23:31.531 --> 00:23:32.531
How could I?

00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:33.530
- [Mike] Yeah, that was delicious.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.534
- That was delicious.
