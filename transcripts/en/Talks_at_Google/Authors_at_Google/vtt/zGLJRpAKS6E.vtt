[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.350
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
All right, welcome.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.370
So first, just a little
bit of background-- I'm

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.170
an entrepreneur.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.910
My background's in
software development.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.060
I started coding
very, very young

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.320
when I found a Commodore 64
and a bunch of other older

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.470
machines, which by the
way, I've seen many of them

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.250
in your lobby.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.250
And I just [INAUDIBLE] today
and go hang out in there now.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.820
So from my early background
in software developments,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.410
I did that for a while.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.760
Went through the whole
management ranks--

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.590
climbed the management ladder.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.920
And for me, it
was a sense of I'm

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.570
noticing the human issues
getting in the way of what

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.136
I was doing in the
technology world

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:44.760
almost as much as
any of the technology

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.290
issues we're facing--
the process, the people,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.100
the way we work
together, and all that.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.160
So I got really
fascinated by that.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.860
And I worked in an aerospace
company at the time.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.150
And it won an award for being
the best mid-size company

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.510
to work for in America, right?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.510
A really sizable award.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.255
And I realized I wasn't
really satisfied there.

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:06.630
Despite that,
don't get me wrong.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.629
The benefits were great.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.130
The perks were incredible.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.570
I realized what I really
wanted was an environment where

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.599
I could really use my talents
fully where anything I sensed

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.640
that could be better I
could do something with it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.940
and act on it.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.280
And all of the free lunches and
perks and even a really cool,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.850
fun culture wasn't
enough for me.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.360
I just wanted to
use my creativity.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.556
And there was something
getting in the way.

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.930
And after a while, I realized
what was getting in the way

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.250
was something around the
way we work together--

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.180
the structure, the
politics, the bureaucracy.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.870
I had ideas.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.240
And I couldn't get them
socialized enough in the system

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.510
to change anything.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.120
And I'd go to meetings and we
wouldn't even get to my topics

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.480
because they were
painful and long and all

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.490
of these other things
that get in the way of us

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.230
using our gifts.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.240
So I eventually dropped
out of that whole system

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120
and started my own company.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.484
And my goal with
that company was

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.650
I want to find a better way.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.320
There's got to be a
better way to organize.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.490
And so my company
became a laboratory.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.560
And we experimented
over many years

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.460
as we grew that business
just looking for how can we

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.660
work together more effectively.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.810
And I had a bunch of
ideas, most of which

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.380
proved to be terrible ideas.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.630
And I won't share them with you.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.330
But over the years
of experimenting,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.000
some stuff actually worked.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240
So eventually we would
name it Holacracy.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.240
But where this came from was
not from a bunch of ideas,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.190
not from a bunch of
theory, definitely

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.820
not from a management
consultant.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.050
It was from a bunch
of entrepreneurs

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.550
trying to build a
business and figuring out

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.240
what works through
trial and error

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.510
and a lot of experimentation.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.450
So with that said,
let me introduce you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.700
to the category of how to
think about this thing.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.790
I think about Holacracy as
a new social technology.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.110
And being a software
guy by background,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.560
I think a lot about
technology and usually

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.430
when people talk
about technology,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.690
they're talking about the
physical technologies hardware.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.590
Gadgets, devices or even
software internet-- whatever.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.560
But there's this other
class of technology--

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.050
social technologies-- that
actually in a lot of ways

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.810
have been fundamental
in our whole progress

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.380
as a human species,
at least as much

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.920
as our actual physical
technologies--

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.870
technologies like rule
of law and democracy

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.420
and all of the
other ways that we

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.960
humans group together, organize,
and find ways to interconnect.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.940
Right, those are
social technologies.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.040
And yet, when we look at the
social technology in place

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.410
in most companies, it
looks like something

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.630
out of the feudal empire.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.690
There are kings and
lords and barons

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.520
and down at the
bottom, peasants.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.480
There's this management
hierarchy that really matured.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.010
This technology matured
about 100 years ago.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.310
This technology came about
when the telegraph was still

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.900
an exciting, new
communication mechanism.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.640
And management
technology has not really

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.400
evolved in any major
leaps since then.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.500
It's an old operating system.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.870
And it's not that there's
anything wrong with it per se.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.080
I think it's just quickly
becoming obsolete.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.660
The world today is moving faster
than our management systems are

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.209
able to adapt and respond.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.949
If we want nimble, agile,
responsive organizations,

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.490
how can we make them
more responsive?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.510
Perhaps-- perhaps we can look
at this fundamental social

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.510
technology and
innovate in that area.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.370
How else could we run a company?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.550
And I think this is a
worthwhile exploration

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.030
because I think a lot
of the challenges we

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.930
see in organizations today--
the bureaucracy, the politics--

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.570
they are hard to
solve by just patching

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.110
some new process on top of
the way we run a company.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.530
In many ways, I think our
companies today are perfectly

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.900
designed to achieve significant
issues with bureaucracy,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.520
politics, communication issues,
and all of the other stuff

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.991
that we suffer from
in most organizations.

00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:01.490
Right?

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.700
It's a feature, not a bug--
perhaps not an intended one.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.860
But there's something about this
fundamental social technology

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.940
that leaves a lot to be desired.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.950
And it also brings us
some important features.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.990
This gets us alignment.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.740
It gets us accountability.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.680
It gets us some way of breaking
down the work and scaling.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.500
And we need these things too.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.792
So when we talk about
new social technologies

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.250
for running an organization,
I think it's really important.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.770
We don't just throw
out all structure.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.530
And that's not what a
Holacracy is all about.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.410
It's about replacing
this structure

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.730
with some other
way of structuring

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.700
an organization that's maybe
a little more responsive.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.450
And why it might we
want to change this?

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.590
And what issues might
we need to deal with?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.870
Well, when we talk about
structure at this level,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.500
we're really
talking about power.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.742
Who has the authority to do
what in the organization?

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:54.200
What can we expect
from each other?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.727
These are deep issues.

00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:57.560
And when humans are
involved, sometimes what

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.269
we get with our nice
org charts on paper

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:01.810
is a management
hierarchy that really

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.910
looks something like this.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.020
Give you a second
to take that in.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.020
Have you seen any of
these actually at play

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.610
in a real organization
by the way?

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.350
I've seen at least
a couple of these

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.610
actually at play as the real
power structure in a company.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.720
And it's no wonder
humans are involved.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.680
We're messy creatures, right?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.530
We bring our egos and our
drama and our politics in.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.970
And when we don't have a
good way of structuring

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.910
the work around what we're
trying to do together,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.240
we often end up resorting to
the social dynamics at play.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.950
So what else can we do?

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.950
Well, there's another
way-- another way

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.270
of achieving order,
which is what

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.540
we want in any organization.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.550
We need some kind of order.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.920
And if I look at the city
around us, we're in New York

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.530
right now.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.530
As much as it looks like pure
chaos out there on one hand,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.060
there's actually quite a
bit of social order at play.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.340
I can pretty much fly
into New York and trust

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.620
that I'm going to be able
to get a taxi, find a hotel,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.040
get some food, and whatever
else I might need to do.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.530
And the right place--
the right services

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.820
will be there to support me and
without a boss directing them

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.689
all around.

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.730
There's no boss that made
sure the taxi was there

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.860
to pick me up-- the hotel,
the whatever, right?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.410
It just worked.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.220
So we ended up with
emergent order--

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.630
the kind of order that
is not imposed top down

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.560
from a centralized plan, but
the kind of order that shows up

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.240
when you have the right
framework of rules

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.440
and individuals with
the freedom to act

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.470
within that framework of rules.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.970
We see this every day
in our modern society.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.640
Yet when we go
into a company, we

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.442
see something very different.

00:07:41.442 --> 00:07:43.400
We see a very different
way of achieving order.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.450
It's an attempt to
centrally plan and control

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.779
and achieve an order by imposing
one as opposed to putting

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.320
in place the right
framework of rules

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.970
and allowing order to show up.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.270
And many companies are
somewhere between those extremes

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.970
of course.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.570
They're experimenting
and exploring

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.570
and many individuals when they
see structure that doesn't make

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.670
sense, say, well,
forget that, I'm

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.360
going to do what makes sense.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.676
And the structure
often gets in the way.

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:10.800
And I think that's why when
we talk about structure

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.220
in companies, there's
a lot of people

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.730
that have an allergic reaction
to the idea of structure.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.570
They associate it
with bureaucracy.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.070
But I'd say that's
because we've got

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.820
the wrong structure or the
structure that is in the way.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.740
When I walk around
New York, I don't

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.780
experience the structure of
the rules of the game at play

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.070
as limiting me.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.199
It's actually enabling me.

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:33.740
I kind of like those
two yellow lines

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.948
in the center of the road
as much as sometimes people

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:36.590
ignore them.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.309
That's structure.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:37.929
It's limiting.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:42.460
And yet it's enabling speed
and freedom and agility.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.880
The right structure does that.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.860
So how can we bring
into our organizations

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.110
a different type of structure.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.600
And what would that look like?

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.100
Well, the first thing
that Holacracy does

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.330
is introduce a
framework of rules

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.770
just like we have in societies.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.750
And it's captured
in a constitution.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.470
So once a company tastes
Holacracy, they experience it,

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.044
they get a sense of it, and they
decide they want to do this.

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.460
They want to move
forward with it.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.980
The first move is for the
CEO or department head

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.250
or whoever's adopting this
to sign a declaration ceding

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.680
their power into
this constitution,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.570
saying I am no
longer above the law,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.630
but I'm subject to the same
rules that everyone else is.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.440
And here's a framework
that we'll all

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.120
be bound by as we go about
doing our work together

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.350
in this organization.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.960
It's a pretty big shift.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.040
Can you imagine a CEO you know
or a significant department

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.320
manager or something like that
signing a declaration saying

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.540
I'm ceding my authority to
just do whatever I want and run

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.300
things as the boss into a
framework of rules like this?

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.850
It's a cool shift.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.560
And this constitution
you can actually

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.977
find it on GitHub
for those of you

00:09:53.977 --> 00:09:55.143
from a technical background.

00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:56.450
It's an open source document.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.700
It's a fundamental
rules of the game.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.330
I like to think of
Holacracy like a new sport.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.650
And these are the
rules of this sport.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.570
And it's a framework
that tells us

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.450
all how we can act and
interact and expect

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.967
things of each other and
change things in the company.

00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:14.550
So let's look at some of the key
shifts that this set of rules

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.280
introduces.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.960
And the first one is any of you
have a static job description?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.980
Like something that hasn't been
updated in at least months,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.752
if not years that
maybe is out of date--

00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:27.460
that probably was out
of date by the time

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.300
it rolled off the printer?

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.580
When was the last time you
ran to your jobs description

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.930
to figure out what you
should be focused on today?

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.430
Right?

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.320
Anyone?

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.810
No, didn't think so.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.310
Right?

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.990
So that's because they're
pretty much useless.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.130
I should say they're
useful for some things.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.720
We write them so that we
can post a job, great.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.390
But really, how
much clarity does

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.340
a typical job description
offer for our day-to-day work?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.230
Really, nothing.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.920
They are bureaucratic artifacts.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.090
Holacracy replaces those with
a new type of structure--

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.650
a new way of describing the
work-- the roles at play.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.880
And they're dynamically updated.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.090
So with Holacracy instead of
having one job description,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.130
you might fill 20
different roles.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.810
And you might fill 20 roles
in lots of different teams

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.090
all across the company.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.400
It doesn't just have to be one
place in this siloed structure.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.250
So you might fill lots
of different roles.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.070
And each one is a
little chunk of work.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.010
It's one discrete function.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.330
And the way of describing these
roles is much more grounded.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.330
So it has real clarity.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.730
And companies running
with holocracy-- people

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.220
do go and reference their
job descriptions-- their role

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.930
descriptions regularly because
they have really good clarity

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.340
that's the result of the
team's collective learning.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.180
And the reason is because
they're updated regularly

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.740
by the people doing the work.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.810
So there's a process--
it's called governance.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.690
I'll talk about it in
a few minutes where

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.970
each team gets together
and they learn together

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.610
and they capture that learning
and distill down what do we

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.560
need to be doing differently?

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.597
Who needs to be focused on what?

00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:01.430
And we capture that
learning in these roles.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.054
So they're living,
breathing, entities.

00:12:03.054 --> 00:12:05.684
And they have
meaningful clarity.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.600
That's one difference.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.920
Here's another.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.850
In most companies, you've
got a manager who delegates

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.350
some authority to you.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.630
Rarely is that really clear.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.920
Rarely do you know exactly
what your authority is.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.550
More often than not, it's kind
of like you have the authority

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.924
to do whatever you're doing
as long as the manager thinks

00:12:22.924 --> 00:12:24.542
it's generally the
right thing to do.

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:26.250
And as soon as they
don't, they'll get in

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.333
and they'll tell you that.

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:30.510
And then you better
align with what they say.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.230
With Holacracy, instead of this
kind of delegated authority

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.080
that can be pulled back or
micromanaged at any point,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.850
it's truly a distributed
authority paradigm.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.470
So according to the constitution
and the fundamental rules

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.800
of this game, when you have a
role that we created together

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.580
through this
governance process, you

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.110
have the autonomy
and the authority

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.940
to do anything that makes sense
to you to get the job done--

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.160
to get the job of that
role done unless there's

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.670
an explicit rule against it.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.150
So instead of needing
permission to act and to make

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.410
sure your manager is
happy all the time,

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.080
you've got autonomy
and authority

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.000
to go lead your role however
it makes sense to you.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.770
And when we discover that
there's a constraint we need,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.780
we will create that minimally
sufficient just in time.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.892
So instead of needing
permission to act first,

00:13:18.892 --> 00:13:21.350
you have a blanket grant to do
whatever makes sense to you.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.683
And as we learn together,
we'll start adding constraints

00:13:23.683 --> 00:13:25.220
just when we need them.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.100
And there's no manager to
undelegate that authority.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.980
So in a company like mine,
we run with Holocracy.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.810
Everyone has a real
autonomy and authority.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.410
Everyone can make
different decisions

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.380
and everyone knows what that
is and what the boundaries are.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.230
So it's a lot like living
in a society, right?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.640
I know I can do whatever I
want in my house, my property.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.620
But if I want to go
take my neighbor's car,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.340
I should probably
get his permission.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.580
That's his territory--
his property.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.830
Holacracy does the same.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.039
It makes clear what's
mine to lead and control.

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.580
And I don't need
anyone's permission.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.200
It's mine.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.040
It's my territory.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.310
I can do whatever I want.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.000
And it makes clear
where my neighbors

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.330
are-- where the boundaries
are and what we can

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.635
expect from each other as well.

00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:07.760
Because when we have a
autonomy in an organization,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.790
it's got to come with
a responsibility.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.110
So here's another shift.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.180
What this does when we have
constantly updating roles

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.230
with real authority
is instead of

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.240
these large-scale
re-organizations--

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.940
every few years and somebody
comes in and changes

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.260
the whole structure.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.360
Instead, we're doing
micro-reorganizations

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.140
constantly in every team.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.040
So we are rapidly iterating on
our organizational structure.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.146
And this isn't done at
the top and handed down.

00:14:35.146 --> 00:14:36.270
This is done in every team.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.060
Every team has a governance
process that they go through.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.020
It might be twice a month.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.370
In a more mature
organization with Holacracy,

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.810
it might be once a month
or every other month.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.890
We pull back and we say
what are we learning

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.360
and how do we restructure our
team to capture that learning.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.850
So rapid iterations,
micro-restructurings

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.680
throughout the organization.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.690
And what that means because
we have this transparent rules

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.870
system and we're constantly
changing and adjusting

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.980
and learning together
is when we need

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.590
to align-- get alignment, which
we need, in most companies,

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.990
the only way you can
really get change enacted

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.180
is by working the
political system at play.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.305
You build consensus.

00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:17.680
Anyone find yourself
in a meeting

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.270
at any point where you're
really there to build buy-in.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.920
Or you were there
because someone else

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.120
is trying to build your
buy-in for some change.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.800
And we play this game in
the system to get alignment.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.180
And that's actually
really expensive.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.600
If every time I want to
make a change to something

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.270
and it's significant, I have to
build buy-in and get consensus

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.057
from everyone.

00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:38.140
There's a lot of meetings.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.370
They're painful.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.550
And there's an
alternative, which

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.755
is get clear whose
is this to lead.

00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:47.130
And then that
person doesn't need

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.810
to go get alignment and build
buy-in and get consensus.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.050
They know this is mine to lead.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.950
And I can go get input
from whoever I want.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.460
And at the end of the day,
I'm going to make the call.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.720
And I'm going to lead
this and make a decision.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.420
And everyone can have
that in their area.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.430
And if we want to
influence the person,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.050
we have a rule system to do it.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.100
This is the point of the
Holacracy constitution.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.960
It gives us a
framework where if I

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.220
need to expect something
different from you than what

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.480
you're doing, I have a structure
in which I can propose that.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.340
And we can clarify
the expectations

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.810
between us-- the boundaries
or the constraints

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.260
we're operating in.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.180
So instead of doing that just
through political pressure,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.104
we can simply go use the rules.

00:16:25.104 --> 00:16:27.020
So what we end up with
is something a lot more

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.950
like a sport where once
everyone knows the rules,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.360
you usually don't see the
players thinking about them.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.680
They're just on the field.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.290
They're playing the game.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.870
They all have autonomy.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.732
You don't see.

00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:40.940
You don't see athletes
calling meetings to figure out

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.450
who should pass the ball next.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.780
Are you OK with me
passing the ball to you?

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.590
Is that OK now?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.295
You also don't see managers
directing the field.

00:16:51.295 --> 00:16:52.670
When people are
out on the field,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.030
they're using their
judgment in their roles

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.090
with autonomy leading.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.850
And everyone's
doing that together.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.250
And the rules are simply
the framework behind them.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.459
They're not in the way.

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:04.750
They're simply what gives
you a game in the first place

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.595
to play.

00:17:06.595 --> 00:17:08.720
Now learning the game is
a totally different story.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.136
And you've got to
learn the rules.

00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:12.060
And there's a whole
learning curve to this.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.690
But once you know
the rules, they

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.480
fade away to the background
if it's the right game.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.900
So let's look a little more
about how this actually

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.089
shows up-- what it actually
looks like-- how it works.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.190
And here's an example of a role.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.210
So this is a role I fill--
Holacracy spokesperson.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.390
And it has a purpose.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.620
Crystallize and convey
the Holacracy brand--

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.520
reveal its why to the world.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.490
So I also have some
accountabilities.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.830
These are things that
others can expect of me.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.600
So to go along with my
autonomy in this role,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.140
I have some responsibilities
and captures them and tells

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.300
everyone else what
they can expect.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.690
And when I fill a role
like this in Holacracy,

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.364
I don't need permission
from a manager.

00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:52.280
There are no managers.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.820
I don't need permission
from anyone to do my job.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.690
I can do anything that
makes sense to me.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.500
I can make any decision
and take any action

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.290
to express that purpose.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.250
As long as I don't violate an
explicit rule or constraint

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.280
that's been documented
somewhere-- so

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.000
broad grant of authority.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.250
And here's how we might see some
of those constraints play out.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.120
Here's another role.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.000
This is our web architect
role filled by a colleague

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.210
of mine, Olivier.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.080
And it has its own purpose--
clear and sexy website

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.060
for Holacracy and
HolacracyOne, my company.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.960
And notice this website-- or
sorry, this role Web Architect,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.400
has a domain.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.210
Domain-- think of that
as property of this role.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:34.900
Its domain.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.620
It controls our website.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.990
What that tells me is although I
have all the freedom in my role

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.862
to do whatever
makes sense to me,

00:18:42.862 --> 00:18:44.320
if I want to mess
with our website,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.340
I need this role's permission.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.590
Kind of like in our society,
I know I have the freedom

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.355
to lead my life however I want.

00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:52.980
But if I want to use
my neighbor's car,

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.710
I better get his permission.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.610
We have a framework of clear
boundaries with clear property.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.612
And we know who controls what.

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:01.570
And we know what we can
expect from each other.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.420
We have agreements.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.830
We might have a neighborhood
association or what

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.690
have you-- the same thing here.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.520
So I know that I have a
lot of freedom in my role.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.620
But he controls the
website-- integrate with him

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.180
if I want to do something
on the web and vice versa.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.120
He's got a purpose.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.370
He's got the authority to
do anything that makes sense

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.610
to him to get the job done.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.910
And he needs to honor
other people's property.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.570
So what we end up
with is a system

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.430
where there is no boss
delegating and directing

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.350
everyone else.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.300
Yet there are clear ownership.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.340
So it's not a consensus
based system at all.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.590
Every role knows
here's my territory.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.100
And I can lead
that autocratically

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.550
within my responsibilities
and any constraints

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.560
that we have defined
in governance together.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.040
And that governance
process happens

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.560
in what we call a circle.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.200
So circles group roles together.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.890
The metaphor I like
for this-- think

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.880
of the roles like little cells.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.350
Each one has an autonomy.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.020
Every cell in your body has its
own self-organizing process--

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.740
its own structure-- its own
area that it deals with.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.160
Its own processes.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.930
And yet each cell is
also part of an organ.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.070
And that organ doesn't
violate the autonomy of cells.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.450
Rather it adds
another larger entity

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.490
that integrates
them-- that deals

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.430
with the flows between cells.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.830
And that's what a circle does
in Holacracy for its roles.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.580
So this is nature's way
of scaling and organizing.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.580
And a circle in Holacracy
is like that organ.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.994
And what circles do every
month or thereabouts--

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:30.410
they'll hold a
governance meeting.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.410
And this happens
asynchronously between meetings

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.470
as well where every role
in the circle-- anyone who

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.360
fills a role is invited to
participate in the governance

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.520
process of the circle.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.410
So everyone who fills
a role-- this circle--

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.785
it's our marketing circle
outreach we call it--

00:20:45.785 --> 00:20:48.910
it includes the two roles we
looked at-- my spokesperson

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.820
role-- the web architect.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.570
And we show up in this
governance meeting.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.070
And that's where we define the
boundaries between our roles.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.920
That's where we define what's
his to control-- what's mine.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.540
What do we expect
from each other.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.957
We can create new roles
whenever we need them.

00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:04.540
And, remember, people
fill many roles.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.240
So that doesn't
mean hiring someone.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.570
I fill 20-some
roles in my company.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.470
So we can create
any role we want

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.840
and then go shop around and
find the best fit for that role.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.930
We can change roles.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.420
We can add
expectations on roles,

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.836
constrain roles--
whatever we need

00:21:17.836 --> 00:21:20.920
to do through this
governance process.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.100
And in that governance
process, anyone filling a role

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.300
has a voice.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.580
But we only use this
collective process

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.020
to define the boundaries-- to
define the scope of authority

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.590
of the different roles.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.880
Day to day when we're
executing, we're

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.029
not trying to come to
consensus on every decision.

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:39.570
We're just getting
the job done given

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.910
the authority we've been
granted through this governance

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.930
process.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.860
Even in the governance
process, it's

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.789
not a consensus-based process.

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:49.330
And it's one that's
actually grounded

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.800
in logic and arguments.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.810
Anyone can show
up and say, here's

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.050
something that got in the
way of getting the work done.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.450
Here's an example.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.780
And to resolve that and
prevent it from ever recurring,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.820
I'd like to add a new
expectation onto our web

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.000
architect role or whatever.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.516
And then there's a process of
sorting that proposal through.

00:22:08.516 --> 00:22:09.890
Everyone gets some
input into it.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.870
Although you can't just
say I don't like it.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.120
You got to say, well, here's
why that would cause harm

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:14.621
in my work.

00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.661
And then we'll integrate
and we'll sort that out.

00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:18.560
And we'll come out with
some new governance

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.310
that defines new expectations
for the team that work.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.430
And then we can go embody those
expectations, executing them,

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.429
get the job done day to day.

00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:29.970
So we have a
self-organizing process.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.760
And this scales.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.300
This is a fractal structure.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.880
So every level kind of
works the same, right?

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.070
So we don't just have
roles within circles.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.380
We have circles within
circles within circles.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.050
And this is, again, a
very organic process.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.850
So just like the
human body-- cells

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.850
within organs
within organ systems

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.460
within an overall organism.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.980
There's no boss cell in
your body believe it or not.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.480
Right?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.979
There's no one boss cell that
is telling all the other cells

00:22:56.979 --> 00:22:58.600
what to do and how to work.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.720
Rather every cell
has autonomy and yet

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.180
they also have to be aligned
with the broader organ.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.777
They have to figure out how
they work with the other cells.

00:23:06.777 --> 00:23:08.360
And that's kind of
what the organs do.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.394
They group them together
and deal with flows.

00:23:11.394 --> 00:23:13.560
And then there are larger
systems that group organs.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.393
That's what this is.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.056
So it's a fractal structure.

00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:17.430
Again, a lot like
nature, this is

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.620
nature's way of dealing
with complexity at scale.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.200
And within this, everything's
changing constantly.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.240
Every one of these
roles-- they're dynamic.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.670
They're updated in regular
governance meetings happening

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.310
in every circle as
we learn together

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.380
to keep it grounded and real.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.290
So it's a very dynamic process.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.181
And this is why when
if you read the press,

00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:40.430
there's some misunderstandings
out there in Holacracy.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.290
One of them is that this
is a "flat" structure

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.780
or no structure.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.510
And it's not.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.990
It's actually more structured
than a typical management

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.380
hierarchy.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.630
It's just a different
kind of structure.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.680
And it's one that is
really trying to align

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.022
with what's actually needed.

00:23:55.022 --> 00:23:57.480
It's the kind of structure more
like those two yellow lines

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.082
in the road.

00:23:58.082 --> 00:23:59.790
Not the kind that gets
in your way that's

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.930
bureaucracy and limits
you, but the kind that

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.700
enables us to go fast together.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.657
It's minimal, just-in-time
dynamic structure.

00:24:08.657 --> 00:24:09.490
But it is structure.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.540
And its clarity.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.680
Who can decide what?

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.310
Who can expect what from whom?

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.200
All of that.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.200
And let's talk about one
other piece, which is what

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.830
drives change in the system?

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.530
And, again, the same
thing that drives

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.120
change in many living
systems-- tension.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.340
And with Holacracy, we don't
mean tension in a negative way.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.410
So I define tension
as simply the feeling

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.240
you get when you sense a
gap between where we are

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.540
and where we could
be or some potential

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.000
that's better in some way.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.880
We sense a lot of these.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.840
Yet, how many people can say,
you know, anything I sense.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.320
Any tension I sense, any gap,
anything that could be better,

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.920
I know exactly
what to do with it

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.310
to drive a rapid,
meaningful change anywhere

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.490
in the organization.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.430
Very few companies today can
fully harness the sensing

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.020
that everyone within is doing.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.880
More often than
not, you get people

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.790
who have sensed issues
for years and don't

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.280
know how to drive change.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.270
So all they can do
is complain about it

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.460
or get apathetic
or wait and bide

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.710
their time for an opportunity.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.850
None of that is
using that wisdom.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.350
None of that is
actually taking what

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.680
we're sensing and
incorporating that

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.910
into a learning
organism of the company.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.030
So the goal of Holacracy
is pretty simple.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.590
It's to make sure any
tension sensed by anyone

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.740
anywhere in the
organization has a place

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.980
to go to get rapidly
and reliably processed

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.170
into meaningful change,
at least to the extent

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.930
that it's relevant to
the company's work--

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.830
its purpose in the world.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.890
And this also keeps us
really, really grounded.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.710
How many organizational
designs do you

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.575
see today that are the
product of somebody's vision?

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:57.950
And, actually,
that sounds great.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.300
But I think there's a
lot of issues with that.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.310
Anyone here in the
software development world?

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.217
I'm imagining many
of you, right?

00:26:05.217 --> 00:26:06.675
Have you ever seen
software designs

00:26:06.675 --> 00:26:08.909
that are the result of
somebody's good ideas

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:10.950
and vision and they apply
this whole architecture

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.520
to a software product
as opposed to listening

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.360
to what the customers
want and listening

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.250
to what the code even is
telling you and keeping

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:23.050
a more agile, adaptive design,
letting the design tell you

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.390
what it wants to be
instead of you imposing all

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.720
of your good ideas up front?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.960
We learned a long time
ago in the software world

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.190
that that kind of
waterfall design process

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.800
doesn't lead to
great results when

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.090
you have dynamic complexity
in the world-- when

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.050
you have a lot of
change, a lot of input,

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.850
and you've got to learn.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.340
Our organizations today
are in that world too.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.250
And get the approach we take
to designing organizations

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.070
is very much
somebody's big vision,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.230
grand ideas, top-down
imposed applied design.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.540
And then it's static.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.370
And it doesn't change that much.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.100
And the best we can do in
that is try to work around it.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.350
And we experience the structure
is getting in the way,

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.770
limiting bureaucratic structure.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.290
If we want to respond
to a world that

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.360
is changing fast with
our companies today,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.770
we need companies that can
be responsive to everything

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.590
sensed by everyone within and
let the design evolve itself.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.920
So Holocracy can be described
as an evolutionary design

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.040
algorithm rhythm for a company.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.530
What it does is
let the tensions we

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.540
sense tell us where we need
to change our organization's

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.360
design.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.010
So the design evolves one
tension at a time by somebody

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.474
sensing what's getting
in the way of the work

00:27:34.474 --> 00:27:36.640
and then doing something
about it, responding to it,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.960
adapting-- changing the design
of the company and testing it.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.160
How does that work?

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.080
Is that better?

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.020
Or do we sense more tensions?

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.520
Great!

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.180
More tensions.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.679
Good.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:48.456
Let's adapt it again.

00:27:48.456 --> 00:27:50.330
So a company running
with Holacracy, the goal

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.110
is not to be without tension.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.630
It's just that the same ones
aren't plaguing us for years

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.900
that we're not listening to.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.610
We want to deal with
those so that we

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.660
are free to sense the
next tension as we adapt

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.250
and evolve in our environment.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.369
That is the whirlwind
tour of Holacracy.

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:08.910
I want to save plenty
of time for Q&amp;A

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.243
because I got to imagine
there's probably more questions

00:28:11.243 --> 00:28:13.780
than you came in with perhaps.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.990
Often there is.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.490
And then I think there's
a book signing afterwards.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.200
And anyone who wants
to stick around,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.370
I'm happy to chat for
a bit-- so questions?

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:23.915
Yeah, mics.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.955
AUDIENCE: Hi, so suppose
that an individual in 10

00:28:33.955 --> 00:28:36.330
roles and those 10
roles are in 10 circles,

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.240
does that mean 10 governments
meetings per month?

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.090
And if so, how much of
your time does this take?

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.100
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah,
10 different circles

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.950
would be a lot.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.680
Most people,
practically speaking,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.800
in companies running
with Holocracy,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.070
you might have people in two
or three circles-- maybe four

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.600
or five.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.480
But more than
that's really rare.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.990
It means they're invited to
that many governance meetings.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.020
But like everything
Holacracy is tension

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.250
driven-- tension needing
to change the governance.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.720
Skip the meeting.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.691
Don't bother.

00:29:05.691 --> 00:29:08.190
If you have a tension, and you
want to change the structure,

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.470
then show up.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.580
And the beauty of the governance
process in holocracy--

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.560
when you show up with
attention and you

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.790
take the time to go to a
meeting and you address it,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.590
what you're doing is
changing the structure

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.760
so that tension
never recurs and we

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.270
know exactly who can make which
decisions and you don't need

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.396
to go to a meeting anymore.

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:26.270
So what you're actually
doing in the meetings

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.780
is removing the need to go
to meetings by getting really

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.000
clear on who does what so
that we never need to talk

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.540
about this in a meeting again.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.690
AUDIENCE: So is it
always clear enough

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.507
who else your tensions
affect to make sure

00:29:37.507 --> 00:29:39.840
that they attend the meeting
because if they didn't know

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.048
about it, they could show up.

00:29:41.048 --> 00:29:43.000
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, and usually yes.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.490
If somebody gets a tension
they need somebody else,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.990
one of the rules
in the constitution

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.114
is if somebody requests
that you priotize something

00:29:49.114 --> 00:29:51.240
in a meeting, you need
to make it a priority

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.180
with some constraints.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.860
But generally, yeah.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.715
Great.

00:29:54.715 --> 00:29:55.547
Yeah?

00:29:55.547 --> 00:29:56.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.410
So I have to fairly
unrelated questions.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.320
One is you mentioned at the
beginning that leaders would,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.840
or managers, would see their
authority-- power of control

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.230
to the constitution-- what
would their role then entail?

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.230
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yes, this is
one of the great challenges

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.810
and changes that
companies sort through.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.220
And it's not easy.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.670
So imagine you're a manager.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.880
You've climbed the rungs
in that corporate ladder.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.600
You've got a bunch
of direct reports.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.800
And, suddenly, there is a
system that bakes management

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.580
in as just a process
that everybody

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.120
engages in to some degree.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.970
And you don't need a
manager in the same way.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.970
What those managers need
to do is make the shift

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.810
to being more like
an entrepreneur

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.020
than a professional manager.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.910
In other words, how can I
create value in this team?

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.299
How can I actually do something
that needs to get done?

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:47.090
Catch something falling
through the cracks?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.060
Build structure so that I've
got the right roles in the right

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.360
processes in place.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.250
So some of that is similar
to what good managers tend

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.440
to do anyway.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.810
And some of it is
new and different.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.470
And there's a big.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.144
So often those managers end
up filling lots of roles.

00:31:03.144 --> 00:31:04.310
And they are creative roles.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.726
They are roles that aren't
just coordinating among people,

00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:09.740
but actually getting to build
and create and add value

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.780
in new ways.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.920
And some people won't
make the transition.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.420
Some people will
say, you know what?

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.240
I have a staked my self-esteem
on being a manager.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.550
And I do not want
to let that go.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.586
Or I've done it this
way for 20 years.

00:31:22.586 --> 00:31:23.960
And I don't want
to learn anyway.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.920
And they'll opt out.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.740
And you'll see that too.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.750
AUDIENCE: And I see on
the book that the forward

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.160
is by a David Allen.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.130
And I was curious about if you
had any thoughts on any work

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.750
you had or
collaborations with him

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.640
or things like that--
general comments.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.220
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, so anybody

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.327
know David Allen's work?

00:31:41.327 --> 00:31:42.035
Are you familiar?

00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:42.690
A bunch of you.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.565
He wrote a book called
"Getting Things Done."

00:31:44.565 --> 00:31:46.770
He is a productivity guru.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.990
He is a personal hero of mine.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.930
His company runs with Holacracy.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:54.150
And, yeah, so he was kind
enough to write the forward too.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.770
He was actually one of the
earliest adopters of the system

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.890
many years ago now.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.000
And for him, it was
an extension of what

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.480
GTD, or getting things
done, his method-- what

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.560
that does for an individual
of getting really clear.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.840
What are all of the inputs
coming into my world?

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.720
And how do I respond to
them quickly and consciously

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.130
and stay clear and organized?

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.630
He views Holacracy as doing
that for an organization-- so

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.340
the same kind of thing that
GTD does for an individual.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.280
Holacracy is the same.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.960
It's about sorting
out all this stuff--

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.619
the tensions-- the input
coming in-- and figuring out,

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:26.660
all right, how do we clear
those out of the way--

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.050
respond to each appropriately,
and then have space

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.500
to be creative together.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.572
AUDIENCE: That's a really
interesting framing way

00:32:32.572 --> 00:32:33.490
to look at it.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.906
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, definitely.

00:32:34.906 --> 00:32:35.850
Thank you.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.410
AUDIENCE: Hey, Brian, I'm Jason.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.570
Thanks for coming in.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.139
So you gave us a straight
overview of the system.

00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:42.430
I'm curious about the outcomes.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.180
So who's using this?

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.020
And are they're really
seeing significant results

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.840
that are different than, say,
a traditional organization?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.470
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, so right
now today as best we can tell,

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.280
there's somewhere around a
few hundred companies out

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.570
there doing this.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.969
And we don't have any
actual hard data metrics

00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:02.010
that we've collected yet.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.732
I really look forward to that.

00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:06.190
Harvard Business School is
doing an actual research project

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.830
right now on one of
the companies going

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.670
through the transition.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.250
And I hope that'll
be the first step

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.040
to getting some real
academic research

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.230
and what effect it has.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.390
And so I don't have any
actual hard numbers.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.680
I have a lot of
anecdotal stories.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.010
And one of the
challenges of this

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.630
is it's such a
fundamental change.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.480
How do you know whether--
even great numbers.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.620
One company reported
massive increases.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.020
They showed the revenue graph.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.070
And it was like this.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.570
And then it just went like this
once they adopted Holacracy.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.370
But I'm skeptical.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.100
I love the data.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.950
And if somebody wants numbers,
I'll throw that one at them.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.570
But how do you know
that was because

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.170
of Holacracy versus anything
else in their world?

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:45.920
I look at this.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.070
It's like changing
your operating system.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.670
So I'm a Mac user.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.000
I upgraded from being a
PC user several years ago,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.270
jumped into the Mac, and for
me, it's just a better platform.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.612
And my productivity, I
feel like it's higher.

00:33:59.612 --> 00:34:01.320
I think I can get
stuff done more easily.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.250
The operating system is
in the way less often.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.950
It gives me great platform
to build on top of.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.870
But I could tie any specific
metrics I might want to.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.080
And it's hard to tie it back.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.389
It's more just I have
a better platform.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.181
So for me, the best
judge-- and what

00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:17.889
I encourage all of
our clients and anyone

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.719
trying this to really tune
into is your own experience

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.949
of is it easier or
harder to use your voice

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.480
and drive some positive change?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.300
And I think that's a really
interesting, reliable metric.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.330
And if you look at, for me, when
I switched from Windows to Mac,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.239
I just feel like I can get
stuff done faster and easier.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.679
And I hear the same from
companies that switch to this

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:40.699
all the time.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.770
And that's actually why
many executives and CEOs

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.590
make the switch
after they try it

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.250
even just for a couple of days.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.692
Through the different processes,
Holacracy shows up and adds.

00:34:50.692 --> 00:34:52.900
And at the end of that, they
have a direct experience

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.750
of how did this way of
dealing with my tensions

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.437
compare to what I would
have done in the old system.

00:34:58.437 --> 00:35:00.020
And they get to see
in the old system,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.895
I would've talked to a
bunch of people, built

00:35:01.895 --> 00:35:05.150
a bunch of buy-in, called some
meetings, wrestled with it,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.480
and maybe a year
later, we would change.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.120
In the new system,
it happens faster.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.850
So just one example-- in Zappos,
which runs with Holacracy

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.660
as well, there was a meeting
of one of their circles

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.830
where they restructured
a business unit.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.850
And this was apparently
a contentious issue.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.010
There was a lot of intense
feelings in the room.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.049
And there was a
proposal to restructure,

00:35:28.049 --> 00:35:29.590
slice and dice this
thing, and change

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.006
some of what was
expected from it.

00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:34.090
And at the end of
about 20, 25 minutes,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.150
we ended up with a
new, integrated output

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.960
of total restructure
to this unit.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.940
And with everyone there,
bought into the path

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.110
forward, even after people
raised significant issues

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.620
with it, we sorted all them out.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.540
20, 25 minutes later we're done.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.210
They came up to me
afterwards and said

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:56.110
we've been wrestling with that
issue for literally years--

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.270
through hours and hours and
hours and hours of talking,

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.040
political influencing, meetings.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.910
And we never got to
clear resolution.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.619
And it just carried
it through inertia.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:06.910
We just kept it the way it was.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:07.786
Nobody liked it.

00:36:07.786 --> 00:36:09.660
But we couldn't agree
on what to do about it.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.450
And now in 20 minutes,
we just nailed it.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.000
And everyone's comfortable.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.849
Not that we've got
the perfect result,

00:36:14.849 --> 00:36:16.140
but that we've got a next step.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.180
And we can come back to
this meeting next month

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.630
and continue to evolve it
further as we learn what works

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.410
and what doesn't about this.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.040
So to me, that's the
metric that I like to.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.350
Is it easier or
harder to drive change

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.439
and to get tensions
addressed in the system,

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:33.730
AUDIENCE: Hey, Brian, thanks
for coming and explaining.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.760
It really is interesting.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.440
So I understand the
structure and the freedom

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.090
and the principles of Holacracy.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.730
In my experience,
one of the detriments

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.090
I see to organizations is
more about ego and insecurity.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.620
And so I'm just
wondering how those--

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.370
especially when you
give a lot of freedom,

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.357
you're going to-- this
idea of land grabbing

00:36:55.357 --> 00:36:56.440
is always the term, right?

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.280
And you get these people
that are operating

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.070
in that respect and the damage
it can do to an organizations.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.030
How does that work
in your system?

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.630
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, so I wish
I had an extra hour for you.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.010
This is one of my favorite
parts of Holacracy, actually.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.980
And it shows up in
some of the rules

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.060
of the decision making process
used in the governance meeting.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.350
And those rules are there
to keep egos in check

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.810
from influencing
your organization.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.870
It doesn't make people
saints that have no egos.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.700
What it does is prevent the egos
from dominating the meeting.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.450
And there's all sorts
of interesting rules

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.040
and a facilitation
process that's

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.612
used to cut through that.

00:37:31.612 --> 00:37:33.070
If you want to see
more of that, we

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.990
have a video simulation
of the governance

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.448
meeting on our
website that you can

00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:37.970
go watch and see those rules.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.820
And they're specifically
about how they deal with ego.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.670
But just to give you one a
little example, a little taste.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.740
In the governance
meeting process,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.450
let's say someone shows up
and they propose a change.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.470
I think we should add this
expectation to this role

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.830
or give this rule this
authority, whatever.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.780
There's a place where everybody
gets to then raise objections

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.840
to that.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.470
But objections are
not just I don't

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.260
like it or all
the egoic response

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.410
that sometimes people have.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.150
It doesn't solve my thing.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.320
Instead, there's these rules
of what is a valid objection

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.209
and what's not.

00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:12.500
And if somebody just shows
up-- here is a real example.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.750
I had a team.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.352
It was a project
management team.

00:38:16.352 --> 00:38:18.060
They were managing a
big, new initiative.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.240
And somebody brought a proposal.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.930
Someone else gets really
fired up, starts to jump in,

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:24.640
and interrupt.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.280
And there's rules, actually,
even about giving people

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.830
space to speak and
not interrupting

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.810
so I stop the person
I was facilitating--

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.992
stop the person until
it got to her turn.

00:38:32.992 --> 00:38:34.700
And then she had a
bunch to say about it.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.510
We got to the objection part.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.870
And she says, objection!

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.030
Yeah, this has been an
issue for us for years.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.980
And I'm so frustrated by it.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.100
And that won't solve it.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.027
And she went on and on and on.

00:38:46.027 --> 00:38:48.610
The poor proposer was not trying
to solve that person's issue.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.370
They were trying to solve
their own little piece of it

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.210
that they needed to
get their work done.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.150
And here's somebody else
from an intentionally--

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.230
she was trying to help.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.180
But it was getting in the way of
this person solving one issue.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.160
So she says objection.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:01.910
She says all this.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:04.650
And then using one of the
rules in the constitution,

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.360
I asked her this issue
you're having now--

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.122
is that going to be
created by her proposal?

00:39:10.122 --> 00:39:12.080
Or is that already an
issue that you would like

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.425
to solve independent of this.

00:39:14.425 --> 00:39:16.800
And, of course, she says, oh
no, that's already an issue.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.420
I've been suffering
from it for years.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.850
And I said, OK, well then
that's not a valid objection,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.490
according to the
rules of the game

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.390
because our goal is not
addressed her issue.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.010
It's only to address
the proposers.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.400
That's it-- that one issue.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.780
So for her to
raise an objection,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.450
she has to be able to say here's
why that proposal will get

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.100
in the way of me doing my work.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.960
And she has to
describe it concretely.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.260
Not just, I don't like it.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.270
It doesn't solve my pet
issue that I want to solve

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.610
or anything else.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.270
So there's a lot of rules like
that that are just subtle.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.440
They are questions.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.300
And they help sort
through and keep

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.790
us laser-focused on processing
one tension at a time

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.080
sensed by one person without
anyone else's stuff getting

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.197
in the way.

00:39:56.197 --> 00:39:57.780
And after that, I
invited her-- you're

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.434
welcome to add your
item to the agenda.

00:39:59.434 --> 00:40:00.850
And when we get
there, we'll focus

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.720
on processing your
attention however we can.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.730
So it's really about
giving everyone

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.820
a space to process their
tensions without all

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.145
the egos getting in the way.

00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:10.107
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:12.190
BRIAN ROBERTSON: And there's
more the book as well

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.645
about that whole process.

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:15.070
Yeah?

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, I totally get how
these processes can help make

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.790
incremental tactical changes.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.980
And I was wondering is there
a place for longer term more

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.940
strategic thinking.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.510
And if so, what sorts of
circles-- what roles would

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.784
you have to achieve that goal.

00:40:31.784 --> 00:40:33.700
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah,
definitely, absolutely.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.074
So, again, it's tension driven.

00:40:35.074 --> 00:40:36.490
So if somebody has
a attention of,

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.160
man, I think we need to be
looking at longer term, bigger

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.650
picture, strategic stuff.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:41.190
Great!

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.220
Process that tension.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.780
Maybe we need to create a role.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.180
We have roles like a
pricing strategy role

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.810
in my company, which looks
at across all of our business

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:49.980
lines-- big picture.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.560
What are we trying to achieve
with our overall business

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.890
model and all that.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.294
We have another role that looks
at how can we support companies

00:40:57.294 --> 00:40:59.460
that are trying to do it
themselves-- do it yourself

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.710
Holacracy adoption,
which is really hard.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.027
But we have a role that
that's the big picture of you.

00:41:04.027 --> 00:41:05.110
They're looking years out.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.230
What tools can we create?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.515
How can we make that easier?

00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:10.140
So whatever you need to do, just
show up, process that tension,

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.920
and create whatever you need to.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.130
Another example-- the governance
meetings although they often

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.149
are dealing with micro stuff
because often the micro stuff

00:41:18.149 --> 00:41:19.690
is what's actually
getting in the way

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.610
most practically in the work.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.160
Sometimes though they really
do pull up really high levels.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.140
So we had one just last
week actually where

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.880
one of our team
members showed up

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.040
and he had a circle team
that was doing some work.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.890
And it just didn't feel right.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:36.820
So he showed up and he
said, I propose we just

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.550
remove that circle, drop
it, toss it out, kill it.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.240
It was an interesting proposal.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.302
And there were a lot of
objections-- reasons why

00:41:44.302 --> 00:41:46.760
that circle is actually doing
important work that we really

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.579
need.

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:49.120
And then to resolve
those objections,

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.280
we pulled up to the
kind of 50,000 foot view

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.400
and looked at what is the circle
doing that really matters?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.940
And why does the
circle feel weird?

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.910
And what can we do
with those functions?

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:00.430
And, ultimately, we
restructured our whole vision.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.450
Inside of about 45
minutes, we completely

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:06.160
restructured, killed one
circle, put functions elsewhere.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.500
And it's really cool to see that
kind of dynamic reorganization

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.890
happening regularly in
companies instead of it's static

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.820
and its stuck in
what they're doing.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.770
And it is often the big,
strategic solution almost,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.600
but one tension at a time.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.650
And for me, this is the
really interesting thing

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.630
is it's like imagine a company
is a ball of yarn of tensions.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.780
Every thread is a tension.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.780
And it's all woven together.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.690
The temptation in
a lot of companies

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.706
is to look at the ball
of yarn, pull back

00:42:37.706 --> 00:42:39.330
to get really strategic,
and figure out

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.830
how are we going to untangle
all of these different tensions

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.140
and solve it all.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.240
Holacracy invites a
slightly different approach,

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.960
which is grab one thread--
pull that one thread out.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.760
Disentangle just that one
thread-- that one tension

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.136
from everything else instead
of trying to solve all of it

00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:56.676
at once, which often means we
talk about it forever and don't

00:42:56.676 --> 00:42:57.840
actually change anything.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.160
Solve that one thread.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:42:59.660
Good.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.840
Now solve the next one
until, eventually, there's

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.715
no more ball of yarn.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.490
AUDIENCE: So going
by your terminology,

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.440
I think a lot of
tensions in organizations

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.370
are around three pillars, which
are motivations, incentives,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.410
and vision.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:17.910
Right?

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.440
So a founder, like, for
example, Larry here,

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.690
might have a vision that,
hey, I want to is the world.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.300
I want to Google to be
present 30 years from now.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.920
But I'm pretty sure there's some
employee-- someone at Google

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.130
who is thinking, you know what?

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:30.880
Screw all of that.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.540
I want to make my paycheck
bigger in the next six months.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.780
And that's all I care about.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.560
If Google starts
going down, who cares?

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.790
I'll just jump ship
to some other company.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.130
So how-- and this
is just one example.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.880
But how do you align
those kind of tensions?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.325
And I think that's why the
management structure exists

00:43:46.325 --> 00:43:48.650
that someone says, no,
you want to do that?

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.787
Go do it somewhere else.

00:43:49.787 --> 00:43:51.370
This is how Google
wants to do things.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.320
And that's where the
top-down hierarchy comes in.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.160
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, so a huge piece

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.660
of the puzzle-- not the only
piece, but a huge piece here,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.690
is purpose.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.260
So Holacracy is a
purpose-driven system,

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.830
which means the whole thing
we're organizing around

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.790
is what is the ultimate
purpose of the company.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.790
And how are we going to
express it in the world.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:10.665
And that breaks down.

00:44:10.665 --> 00:44:13.070
So every role has its
piece of that-- its purpose

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.790
within this overall system.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.260
So that's one of the alignment
functions in Holacracy

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.340
is it's all about aligning
around purpose as opposed

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.190
to aligning around a person
like a manager, which

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.940
a lot of management
hierarchies fall into.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.200
People really align around
what the manager wants

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.020
or how they see the
world as opposed

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.660
to around the purpose at play.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.610
And that also gives an
element of motivation too.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:38.650
For me, when you get to
fully use your autonomy,

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:40.400
your capacity,
your creative gifts

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.390
to serve a purpose that
you've chosen to serve.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.240
There's a certain kind
of intrinsic motivation

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.164
that can show up.

00:44:47.164 --> 00:44:48.330
Not that it's guaranteed to.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.440
Some people are still
doing it for the paycheck.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.910
And then there's a whole
range in between of, hey,

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.850
I want the paycheck.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.950
But this is cool work.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.500
But I see at least a shift
towards that when companies

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.670
shift to have really clear
purpose that is compelling,

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.410
that's broken down, and everyone
has a place and the autonomy

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.990
to choose something that they
want to express and do it,

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.910
you get a different kind of
motivational force, which often

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:16.300
then has pay and other concerns
like that less of a front

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.260
and center focus.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.634
Not that they're
unimportant, but

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:21.280
at least not the main driver
of motivation anymore.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.640
And Holacracy isn't
a cure-all for that.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.320
Companies still have to wrestle
with that, even with Holacracy.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.838
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:45:27.838 --> 00:45:29.272
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah?

00:45:29.272 --> 00:45:30.950
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have
a few questions.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.230
One is-- you were
talking about pay.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.290
How do you decide
what people get paid?

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:36.150
BRIAN ROBERTSON: I
was wondering when

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.640
somebody would ask that because
it comes up in every talk

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.430
I give.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:43.150
So to use a metaphor,
again, think of Holacracy

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:44.960
like a new operating system.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.290
It isn't a full,
complete package

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.600
with all the apps you
need in your organization.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.100
Right?

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.065
It's like I love my Mac, but
I download a calendar app

00:45:53.065 --> 00:45:55.190
because I don't particularly
like the built-in one,

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.690
whatever.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.210
I download other apps.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.360
Holacracy does not tell
you how to do compensation.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.252
But you need an app to do that.

00:46:02.252 --> 00:46:03.460
So there are many approaches.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.390
And every company
that uses Holacracy

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:06.765
could do that a
little different.

00:46:06.765 --> 00:46:09.227
They might install a different
app for compensation.

00:46:09.227 --> 00:46:11.560
And the same with a number
of other business processes--

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.660
firing, benefits,
all of these things

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.780
are kind of like the
apps of business.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.492
And that's said,
to avoid completely

00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:21.890
dodging the question, let
me give you a common answer.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:25.022
Here's one app that's
actually fairly common now.

00:46:25.022 --> 00:46:25.980
It's growing out there.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.930
My company uses it.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.540
Zappos is moving to
something like it too.

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.120
And it's a badge-based
compensation app

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.550
where badges represent
skills you've demonstrated

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.639
to your peers that you have.

00:46:37.639 --> 00:46:39.430
So you can earn badges
in different skills.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.930
There's a library of badges.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.770
There's a process by
which you can propose

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.830
a new badge-- a new
skill that you think

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.940
needs to be recognized.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.120
And anyone can initiate that.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.970
And then anyone who's earned
the same set about badges

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.272
will get paid the same.

00:46:52.272 --> 00:46:54.230
And that's transparent
and everyone can see it.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.957
If you have this set of badges,
your pay is going to be that.

00:46:56.957 --> 00:46:58.790
And if you get this set
plus these two more,

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.390
then your pay is
going to be this.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.950
And if you think there's a set
of badges that doesn't show up

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.783
there and should have
a different pay level,

00:47:04.783 --> 00:47:06.416
you can propose it
and say, you know,

00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:09.040
these badges are worth this much
and these are worth that much,

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.604
then I think my set of badges
here should be worth this much.

00:47:11.604 --> 00:47:13.520
And there's a process
to evaluate that and get

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.650
it put in place.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.550
So what you end
up with is instead

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.670
of one linear climb
across a ladder

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.220
and pay is by management,
grade or whatever,

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.430
you end up with a
very dynamic system

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.530
where you can grow and
develop in any number of ways

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.440
by developing
different skills that

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.940
are useful to the organization.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.640
And based on the skills you've
demonstrated to your peers

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.220
that you are using
clearly and have,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.500
that will drive your pay in a
very peer-to-peer distributed

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.510
process.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.140
So that's one approach--
not required by Holacracy,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.560
but a common app that's
Holacracy compatible.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.490
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.570
And I want to ask
one more thing.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.920
You have all these roles the
people decide on and define.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.370
And then you have all the
people in your organization.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.967
What happens if someone's
role disappears and they

00:47:58.967 --> 00:48:00.050
need to go somewhere else?

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.200
Or you need to fill new
roles in your circle.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.100
And you need to get
people from somewhere.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.020
How does that happen?

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.770
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, think
of it like a marketplace.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.140
You got your buyers and sellers.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.490
And you need to connect them
and find the right transactions.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.000
So we talk about the
role marketplace,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.170
which is all these roles,
even in a small company.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.430
20 people-- you might
have hundreds of roles

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.430
that need to get filled.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.940
And there are new ones
showing up constantly.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.150
So there's an
internal marketplace

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.320
that develops of, hey, we've
got a new role in this circle.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.070
Here's what it is.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.610
And somebody's pitching to try
to find someone to fill it.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.780
And you get some candidates that
are looking for new roles that

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.880
are not completely booked.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.759
Or they just want something new
and creative add to their mix.

00:48:36.759 --> 00:48:38.050
And so they're shopping around.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:39.200
And they find this role.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.720
And then there's, of
course, still a need

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.178
to make sure they're
the right fit.

00:48:42.178 --> 00:48:44.691
So there's another role that
is assigning people to roles

00:48:44.691 --> 00:48:46.940
and making sure they're the
right fit for those roles.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.440
And that's going
to the market maker

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.780
that's bring them together.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.510
And lots of different
companies will then

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.970
do things to make that easier.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:58.480
Zappos use-- we have a
software app that supports

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.090
companies using Holacracy.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.520
They're using the API to
build a whole role marketplace

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.100
app as an extension of that
because they have 1,500 people

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.177
and lots of roles.

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.760
So they're making
it easier for people

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.352
to search and tag roles and
find the right fits for them.

00:49:12.352 --> 00:49:13.310
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.684
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Cool, thanks.

00:49:15.684 --> 00:49:17.100
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.090
Thanks for coming.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:23.250
Now I was thinking
that Holacracy--

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.370
on paper, that sounds great.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:26.380
It's transparent.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.710
It gives people the power.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.200
In case of crisis, it's not
like the South Park episode

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.686
where every bigger
leader keeps walking in

00:49:34.686 --> 00:49:36.060
and keeps changing the process.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.320
And no one really knows
what the problem is.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.400
And the problem, actually,
the solver who knows it

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.400
is very deep down into the
hierarchy without any power.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.360
That's apparently the problem
that Holacracy seems to solve.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.730
But as an organization
that already

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:56.810
has its own structure
and its own hierarchy

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:58.920
built into it-- and the
people have worked hard

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.070
to get high up there--
how do you start injecting

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.850
such things easily and
not like in a big bang

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.150
that people don't forget
the growing pain that much?

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.540
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, to
some extent, I have no idea.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.820
Good luck.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.530
What I mean by that
is it's huge change.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.900
And you can't-- at least I have
not yet found a way to avoid

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.029
all of the pain
of transformation.

00:50:24.029 --> 00:50:26.070
You don't change an existing
management hierarchy

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.530
to something like this without
going through some challenge

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:29.602
along the way.

00:50:29.602 --> 00:50:31.310
That said, we have
found some things that

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:33.270
might help minimize it some.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.410
And one for larger organizations
is pilot it somewhere.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.962
Don't just try to go over
whole organization all at

00:50:38.962 --> 00:50:39.670
once all upfront.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.210
That's hugely painful.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:46.350
Find a department, division,
team, subsidiarr-- something

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:50.700
that has enough insulation from
the broader corporate system

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.315
to say we're going to do things
differently on this team.

00:50:53.315 --> 00:50:54.440
And that's what Zappos did.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.160
They didn't start
across 1,500 people.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.550
They started in a department
of about 100 people.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.544
And they piloted
it there and got

00:51:00.544 --> 00:51:02.460
built in internal
expertise, which helped them

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.790
with their broader rollout.

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:04.620
So they did that.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:06.036
That's one technique.

00:51:06.036 --> 00:51:07.910
Another is there's lots
of ways to support it

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.000
with the right support,
coaching, training.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.150
Think of it like
learning a new sport.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:15.630
You could try to learn a
new sport or a complex game

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:17.580
by reading the
rule book and then

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.080
jumping in with
a bunch of people

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.010
that have only read the rule
book and trying to play.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.670
And that's going to
be really awkward.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.160
Or you can get out on the field
people who have played before

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.930
and a coach and not worry
about the rules too much.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.680
You'll learn those
as you play, right.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.970
And then get some
on-the-field instruction.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:35.330
And that's going to be a
much easier way to learn.

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.390
So that's another piece of that.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.250
And finally, there
are certainly a lot

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:40.420
of things you can
take out of this.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.170
There's a whole chapter
in the book that's

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.415
really just if I can't do
this whole thing, what can I

00:51:45.415 --> 00:51:46.040
pull out of it?

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.560
What little techniques
can I use in my team.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.340
So that can be really valuable.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.290
Although, that said, if you can,
better to do all of Holacracy

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.230
in part of the company
than part of Holacracy

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.670
in all of the company.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.260
And what I mean by that is
think of it like playing a game.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.740
You're not really playing
soccer if you adopt one rule.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.350
And if you want to be a
World Cup soccer player,

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.870
you don't get there by mastering
one rule at a time slowly.

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.790
You get there by doing all the
rules when you're six years old

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.710
and being sloppy
and messy at them.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.455
And you're playing
six-year-old soccer.

00:52:15.455 --> 00:52:17.580
And then eventually your
playing high school soccer

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.820
and professional soccer and
maybe someday World Cup.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.430
So better to adopt all of
it and part of the company

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:25.230
and accept it's
going to be messy.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.350
It's going to be clunky
and awkward and painful

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.140
and slow at first.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.620
But as you get better and the
rules fade to the background

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.850
and you're now really
playing-- you're

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.712
an athlete-- everything
transforms slowly.

00:52:37.712 --> 00:52:38.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:38.770
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Cool.

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:39.269
Thank you.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:47.220
I just wondered personally
your experience being a CEO

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.850
and then ceding your authority.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:53.050
And this thing
that you've created

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.610
has taken on a life of its own.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.360
I just wondered
what that experience

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.324
has been like for you.

00:52:57.324 --> 00:52:58.240
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.020
It's been an interesting
one for sure.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.740
I have a colleague that
does this work in France.

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.060
And he also is an ex-CEO.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.630
And he said, it's funny.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:10.920
A lot of people think that
would be really hard for CEOs

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.260
to actually let go
of power like that.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.070
He said, his
experiences-- most of them

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:16.440
are very happy to do that.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.170
And it's actually pretty
easy for them, at least

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.070
to make that leap.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.060
Learning the rules is another
thing and transitioning.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.220
And I've actually found
something very similar.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.537
It's not every CEO by any
stretch, but many of them,

00:53:29.537 --> 00:53:31.370
they want a better way
to run their company.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:33.980
They know that for this
thing to scale and outgrow

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.220
their limits of themselves,
they need to get power

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.220
in other people's hands.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.367
They need to not
hold everything.

00:53:41.367 --> 00:53:43.450
So many of them are already
looking for approaches

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.420
to get them out of being
the central bottleneck

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.470
in the system and yet that still
provide order and transparency

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.680
and don't end up crushing
the company they built.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.970
So many of them are very
comfortable signing that.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:59.510
Where it gets interesting is
when I as a Holacracy coach,

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.480
show up in a meeting with an
executive team or whatever

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.500
and the CEO jumps in just out
of habit and tells somebody,

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.071
hey, why don't you then
take on this or whatever.

00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:09.570
And I have to jump
in and say, whoa,

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.111
you don't actually
have the authority

00:54:11.111 --> 00:54:13.280
to tell that person
what to do anymore.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.460
You've ceded that authority.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.014
And there's no governance.

00:54:16.014 --> 00:54:17.430
So you have no
right to expect it.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.263
Would you like to go
to a governance meeting

00:54:19.263 --> 00:54:22.160
and propose an
accountability on his role?

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.410
And he might raise objections.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:24.910
And then we'll integrate them.

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.630
So that's an interesting
than experience.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:32.050
But, again, most CEOs I
work with the rise to that

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:32.850
quite well.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.050
It's still a learning curve.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.320
And they have to learn
new ways to lead.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.250
It's probably going back
to what kind of leaders

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:40.710
adopt something like this.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.140
It's those that are ready
for going back and learning

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:48.550
new ways to influence and
want something new anyway.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:51.200
AUDIENCE: So it seems that the
way that roles are handed out,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.390
there's a big focus on
self-actualization, finding

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.080
something that's a right fit
for you that's exciting for you

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.270
or that you're motivated by.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:00.722
How do you deal with the
fact that this grunge

00:55:00.722 --> 00:55:02.930
work that has to be done
that's attractive to no one?

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.937
How do you motivate people to
do the crap job, so to speak?

00:55:05.937 --> 00:55:07.520
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, so two answers.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.228
One of them is something
I find happening

00:55:09.228 --> 00:55:13.580
in my company and others often,
which is it's not a problem.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.060
And I keep expecting it to be.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:16.970
I keep waiting for--
we have this new role.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.154
And it's horrible work.

00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:19.570
I mean, who would
want to do that.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:20.770
It sucks.

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:22.700
And somebody volunteers.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.310
And I haven't quite
figured that one out yet.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.960
I think it might just
simply be the nature of when

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.310
you feel this kind of
peer-to-peer collaboration.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.730
And everyone knows
somebody needs to do that.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.820
And they've got other
work that they love to do.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.470
And if I could be of
service and help out and do

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.740
this crap role, then fine,
great, I can do that.

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.860
I'll volunteer.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.300
So often, it just takes care
of itself, but not always.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.152
And in that case, the
same thing applies

00:55:47.152 --> 00:55:48.360
in any company still applies.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.070
Sometimes when you're
hired for a job,

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:52.497
it comes with conditions.

00:55:52.497 --> 00:55:53.580
And the same is true here.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.890
You might hire somebody
into this on the condition

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.120
that they accept role
assignments like these.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.790
So we'll have that with
somebody we bring in

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.790
and somebody who
joins our company,

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.831
they might have some
agreements that they come in

00:56:05.831 --> 00:56:07.320
with like you'll
fill any roll that

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.430
deals with this kind of work.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.202
And as part of your employment,
that's an expectation so

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.660
that others know they can assign
that person to those rules

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.560
if the need to.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.370
AUDIENCE: But it still seems
it's very awkward to enforce,

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:17.570
right?

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.500
Or even just
underperformance in general

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.340
is something that's
difficult to talk about

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.780
in a group in front of
the large number peers

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.480
that you have to sit
next to every day.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:28.550
So how do you in
practice point out

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.320
that someone is not fulfilling
the expectations of their role

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.484
in the way that if other
people disagree with you,

00:56:33.484 --> 00:56:35.650
you now feel like you have
to shrivel up in a corner

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.380
and looking at the person.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.150
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, that's awkward.

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.230
So the first line of
defense with Holacracy

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:44.380
is make it a discussion
that we never

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.550
have to have in the
first place by making

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:49.810
blindingly obvious the
performance issue to everyone,

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.610
including the person
with the issue.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.760
That doesn't always work.

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.180
But a lot of
Holacracy's processes

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.540
are designed to get more
transparency of everything--

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.300
what's going on.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.790
So often I see people
self-selecting out

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.950
before anyone has to talk
about their performance

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.390
because it's really
uncomfortable being the one

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.040
that everyone sees not
performing and you know it.

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.782
And you see it yourself.

00:57:10.782 --> 00:57:12.740
Or sometimes I'll see
people calling themselves

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.740
out and saying,
look, guys, I know

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.429
I'm doing terrible in this role.

00:57:16.429 --> 00:57:18.220
But I don't know that
we have a better fit.

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.386
And I'm holding the line
as best I can until we find

00:57:20.386 --> 00:57:21.670
the right person to do it.

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.160
And then it can be an open,
transparent discussion.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.660
So that's the first
line of defense.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.850
It doesn't always work.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.610
But it happens more
often in companies

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.530
with a lot of transparency.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:34.320
And the second is you still
need somebody whose job it

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.890
is to watch performance.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.994
And if they've got a
better fit for a role,

00:57:37.994 --> 00:57:38.910
get someone out of it.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.160
And put someone else in.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.335
And that still shows up
in Holacracy as well.

00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:43.960
AUDIENCE: So that
person is essentially

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.180
a manager then in that role.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.010
BRIAN ROBERTSON: The
interesting thing

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.690
is they have no authority to
tell the person what to do.

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:50.780
They have no authority
to fire that person.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.669
That person might have 19
other roles in other circles.

00:57:53.669 --> 00:57:55.960
They have no authority to
tell that person what they're

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.960
paid in most
companies using a comp

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.072
app like the one I described.

00:58:00.072 --> 00:58:01.780
They have no authority
to tell the person

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.010
to take on these projects
or these actions.

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.470
All they're doing is
saying, are you the best fit

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:07.786
I've got for this role?

00:58:07.786 --> 00:58:09.160
Once they put you
in the role, it

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.444
is yours to lead until
they say, OK, great,

00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:12.360
I've got a better fit.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.810
I'm making a change.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.671
So it's a function that we
associate with managers.

00:58:16.671 --> 00:58:18.170
And that's one of
the tricky things.

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:19.800
Those functions do still exist.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.810
They're just different.

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:23.090
And they're divided out
differently in Holacracy.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:23.798
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:58:25.424 --> 00:58:27.590
BRIAN ROBERTSON: All right,
well thank you everyone.

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:29.200
Appreciate your
time for questions.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:29.700
Thank you.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:36.904 --> 00:58:38.320
AUDIENCE: Hi, I
got two questions.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.250
The first one is how do you
deal with existing organizations

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.770
where they are used to
managing with authority.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:47.180
They are used to their power
struggles and horse trading

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.020
and all that stuff.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.770
How do you switch them over?

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.310
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, with
a lot of effort and coaching.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.640
It's not easy.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.840
AUDIENCE: What would be,
I guess, the motivation?

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.590
BRIAN ROBERTSON: The
motivation to change?

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.740
Usually, it's somebody at the
top that starts having a vision

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:05.270
and seeing that this management
hierarchy is limiting

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.740
our flexibility--
our responsiveness.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.970
Or they like Tony at Zappos
said, I know as we grow,

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:13.060
bureaucracy sets in.

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.520
And I want to grow more like
a city, more innovation, more

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.490
entrepreneuralism.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.100
So it's usually somebody
starting to sense the limits.

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.080
If you don't have
anyone experiencing

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.480
any tension about the
current structure,

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.240
it's really difficult to find
anyone that wants to change it.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.080
But when you find
someone that sees

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.730
the potential for something
different, than Holacracy

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:33.160
gives a tool for, OK,
here's something different,

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.589
you can just do.

00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:36.130
And then there's
the coaching process

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:39.090
of shifting managers
from being managers

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:42.730
to being very different
entrepreneurs, shifting

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.560
other people that are used to
looking to managers to make

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.660
decisions and kind of
hiding in the hierarchy

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.580
to step out and
own their autonomy

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:50.877
and own their authority.

00:59:50.877 --> 00:59:52.960
There's a lot of coaching
that goes into all that.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.975
AUDIENCE: And my
second question is

00:59:53.975 --> 00:59:56.320
about how do you deal
with low performers that

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.910
decide to come out with a little
circle that does basically very

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:00.480
little?

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.540
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah,
the first line of defense

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.890
is simply transparency when it's
obvious to everyone around them

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:08.930
that that guy's not
performing, that

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.020
creates a lot of peer pressure.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.690
And that's not the only answer.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.640
It's just the ideal answer.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.430
And I see this at
play in companies

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.910
when somebody's poor
performance is blindingly

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.040
obvious to everyone,
the person tends

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.750
to opt out of a poor-performing
role pretty quickly.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.390
When that doesn't
happen, you still

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.510
need somebody else that's making
sure you have the right people

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.390
in the right roles.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:32.792
And Holacracy has a
special role in each circle

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:35.250
whose job it is to get the
right people in the right roles.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:36.560
And when somebody's
not performing

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.060
and they need to
make a change, they

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.020
have the authority to do that.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.950
Now that person can't
tell you what to do.

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:43.910
They can't tell you
how to do your role,

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.480
but they can find the right
people to give the autonomy to

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.370
in the role.

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:49.710
So there is still a
function of that as well.

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:50.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Tonya.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.001
I have so many questions.

01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:54.030
But a follow up
question on that.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.480
So is there ever an issue with
having more like in group,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.125
out group issues?

01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:02.250
The way that we deal with
poor performers at Google

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:02.975
is very private.

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:04.850
So if you're a poor
performer, your teammates

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.530
don't know about that.

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.010
That's a private conversation
you have with your manager.

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.330
It's not like everyone at a
meetings is like you suck.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.830
We're all talking about you.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.910
So I can just see if
there's a system which

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:19.090
requires like large-- the
larger-- people in masses

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:21.674
behaving negatively
towards an individual

01:01:21.674 --> 01:01:24.090
because they don't like how
that individual is performing,

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:27.680
can't that set things up for
the larger issues rather than

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.820
more private
conversations one on one?

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.030
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:31.655
I think there would
be a terrible idea.

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.270
But that's not how
Holacracy does it.

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:35.754
So it provides
more transparency,

01:01:35.754 --> 01:01:36.920
which makes it more obvious.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.220
But that doesn't mean we
have discussions about it.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.329
It's just more transparency
of who's doing what.

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:42.870
What are they getting
that every day?

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.550
That's just more transparent.

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.120
So it's not about
having discussions.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.160
As a group, this guy sucks.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.350
It's more about for that person
feeling like, oh, my god.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.970
My performance is being watched.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:54.910
Everyone can see it.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:56.640
We don't need to have a
discussion when you know

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.950
that you just have visibility.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.750
You can't hide
somewhere anymore.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.310
Everything you do is transparent
for everyone else to see.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.460
So that's the first sign.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.660
You still do have one-on-one
private conversations

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.618
when somebody needs to
get removed from a role.

01:02:07.618 --> 01:02:10.250
So there's that special role
I mentioned in each circle.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.610
That person's not
going to call a meeting

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:12.650
about that with a group.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:14.816
They're going to go talk
to the person and say, hey,

01:02:14.816 --> 01:02:16.400
I think we got you
in the wrong role.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.997
But firing someone
from a role is not

01:02:17.997 --> 01:02:19.580
the same as firing
them from a company

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.550
when they fill 20 other roles,
maybe a different teams.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.942
So I've been fired
from a role and thanked

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.400
the person firing
me because I knew

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.520
the role was a terrible fit.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.978
And I was just holding the line
until we could get somebody

01:02:29.978 --> 01:02:30.740
better in it.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.790
And that's great.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.499
So it's not a
public conversation

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:34.540
about performance at all.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.250
It's still a very one-on-one
when that needs to happen.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.510
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like while there may not

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:41.130
be official
managers, there still

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.200
are people that can make
a call on whether or not

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.050
someone should be in a role?

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.340
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Absolutely.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.339
So think of it this way.

01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:48.990
The functions that you typically
associate with a manager

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:51.070
get distributed out
into different roles

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.590
and different processes.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.930
So there is still a role that
can decide who's in which role

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:57.100
and make changes.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.030
But that person can't set
your comp-- can't fire you.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:02.629
And they can remove you
from that one role, sure.

01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:03.920
They can't tell you what to do.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.380
They have no authority to
say, hey, I want you to do x.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.740
Or you're responsible for y.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.510
That happens through
other processes.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:12.360
All they're doing
is looking at here

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.630
is the role we've
defined in governance.

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.827
Who's the right fit for it?

01:03:15.827 --> 01:03:16.910
They get the right fit in.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:19.440
And then that person has
autonomy until they jump in

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.750
and need to make a change.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.064
So, yes, you still have
the functions of a manager.

01:03:23.064 --> 01:03:25.230
They just get broken out
and distributed differently

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:28.170
and not centralized all in one
person with fuzzy boundaries.

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.128
And they can tell you
what to do and everything

01:03:30.128 --> 01:03:31.290
else all at once.

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:33.200
AUDIENCE: My question
is how-- so it

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.270
seems to me like--
correct me if I'm

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.780
wrong-- that people that
have a certain skill

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.670
set take on these
particular roles.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:44.280
So my question is how do
you develop and grow people

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.370
into other roles
or into other areas

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:48.170
that they want to go into?

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.086
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah.

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:50.700
So the first line
of defense there

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.640
is it's everyone's
responsibility

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.000
to deal with their own growth.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.770
And that's what many companies
rely largely on that.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:58.595
Some go further and
say, and we want

01:03:58.595 --> 01:03:59.970
to develop cool
internal training

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.550
programs to make it easier
for people to do that.

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:04.830
But the first ownership
rests with the person.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.960
So if you want to grow
and develop in new areas.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.190
Go shop around in
the role marketplace.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:12.510
It's what we mean by there's
a space hundreds of roles

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.640
around the company.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.460
Shop around.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.620
Go find which ones
excite you and that you

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.470
might be able to start filling.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:21.200
And see if you can find one
that's maybe 5% of your time,

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.860
but in a new area that forces
you to stretch and grow

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.890
and develop in that way.

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:27.098
And then take advantage of
whatever training programs

01:04:27.098 --> 01:04:28.910
or whatever else
you can find or get.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.450
And so it's a much more
organic growth path.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.080
Instead of you grow
by climbing the rungs

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.600
on the hierarchical
ladder, it's more what

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.490
skills do you want to build?

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.089
Go find ways to
use those skills.

01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:41.630
Go develop in lots
of different ways.

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.920
Whatever makes sense to you.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.000
AUDIENCE: Hey, I
really appreciate

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.210
a lot of the philosophy
behind a lot of this.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:51.320
I actually think at Google
we do a pretty decent job

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.490
at some of the
principles you recommend.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.720
Of course, we're not perfect.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.990
And we don't take it
quite to the same extreme.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.790
But I think a lot of the things
you were talking about I've

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.630
seen work here pretty well.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.380
One of the things we try to
do pretty thoroughly at Google

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.800
is use evidence and data
to support our management

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.670
decisions.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.314
What evidence do you have
to suggest that this works?

01:05:10.314 --> 01:05:11.230
BRIAN ROBERTSON: None.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:17.770
So I say that jokingly,
although, there's truth to it.

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:18.460
It's too early.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.310
We don't have any
good, hard data yet.

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.010
I can't wait till we do.

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:25.324
But frankly right now,
we have anecdotal data.

01:05:25.324 --> 01:05:26.740
That said, Harvard
Business School

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:31.114
is doing the first serious
academic study on this.

01:05:31.114 --> 01:05:32.530
The results are
not published yet.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:33.850
Although the researcher
tells me they're

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:35.300
really cool and interesting.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.980
So I can't wait till that's out.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.400
They're setting
up a second study

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.650
they are looking at doing now.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:42.250
So we will have
data at some point.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.580
That said, this is
a really tough thing

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.094
to get that kind
of hard data on.

01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:48.010
I have anecdotal data.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.630
I have one company
said, our revenue

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.390
tripled after we
adopted Holacracy.

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.350
And that may be--
I'm sure it's true.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.660
But how do you make
the causal link

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.340
between Holacracy and
revenue tripling, really?

01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.810
Like did you launch
a new product?

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:01.890
Maybe that was--

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:03.770
So it's so hard
to make that link.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:07.440
Instead, the data I tend
to encourage people to use.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.786
And this is a form of data.

01:06:08.786 --> 01:06:09.910
But it's a subjective form.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:13.020
It's tune in to your
internal experience.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.810
Is it easier or harder to use
your skills to drive change

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:17.936
in this company?

01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:19.560
Because if everyone
involved is saying,

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.060
hey, we tried this
for a few months.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:25.090
And what we notice is we can
use whatever tensions we sense.

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.120
We can get them
processed into something

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.250
more quickly with less obstacles
and less waste in the way.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:34.170
That should translate into
better results as best we can.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.280
And I think there's
a lot of wisdom

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.440
in that internal sensing.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.840
So in the absence of actual
hard data that I trust,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.775
that's the data point I tell
the people to use-- tune

01:06:44.775 --> 01:06:46.670
in internally.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.330
AUDIENCE: Leaders who
might be playing around

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:51.460
with the idea of
potentially doing this.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.850
Following Zappos's transition,
it seemed like at one point

01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.130
they had one foot in.

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:59.020
And now they have both feet in.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.810
If Google were to do
something like this

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.490
with the version of the
constitution that you have now,

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:07.490
would you recommend all
or nothing approach?

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.180
Or could you do this in
small, meaningful ways?

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.150
BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, so the
answer is a little nuanced.

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.420
I'd recommend very similar
to what Zappos did.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.750
Their footsteps are
excellent ones to follow.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.590
And they've done an amazing job.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:23.520
What they did was first they
adopted all of Holacracy

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.890
in part of the company, which is
actually way better than trying

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.870
to adopt part of Holacracy
in all of the company.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.040
So think of it like a
new sport like soccer.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.400
You probably don't get
to play World Cup soccer

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.920
by starting and saying, all
right, let's master kicking

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.530
the ball and nothing else,
just kicking the ball.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:41.530
And then the next thing.

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:43.690
Probably you get there
by playing soccer

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:45.160
at six-year-old level.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.212
But you're still playing by
all the rules of the game.

01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:50.170
So better to play by all
the rules of the game,

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.882
even in just one
team or department.

01:07:51.882 --> 01:07:53.090
And Zappos started with that.

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:54.464
They started with
one department.

01:07:54.464 --> 01:07:56.910
They played by all the
rules as best they could.

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.910
Now in terms of one foot
in one foot out though,

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:00.790
even playing by all
the rules doesn't

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:04.660
mean you've adopted everything
that you eventually will.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.780
So to use another metaphor,
think of Holacracy

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.480
like an operating system.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.930
It's a platform.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:13.160
But it doesn't give you
all the apps you need.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.569
So you guys know-- a good
platform goes a long way.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:18.800
Apps matter a lot.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.000
You need both.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.340
Holacracy is just
the operating system.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.670
The apps that you will
eventually build on top of it

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.680
are things like how
do we do compensation?

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.920
Holacracy constitution
does not tell you anything

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.520
about how to do compensation.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.470
It tells you how to decide
how to do compensation,

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.910
but not what to do with it.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.160
Nor does it cover firing,
budgeting, performance

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.740
management-- all these other
processes that you need.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.887
Those are the apps of business.

01:08:42.887 --> 01:08:45.220
And when you first start
running with this new operating

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.023
system, the best thing to do.

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:48.189
And this is what Zappos did.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:50.399
Keep all your apps as they are.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.350
Otherwise, you're just
changing too much all at once.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:54.640
So bite off a piece at a time.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.300
You do need to adopt the
full operating system.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.029
You don't run half
Windows half Linux.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:08:59.438
It doesn't work.

01:08:59.438 --> 01:09:00.479
You're either on Windows.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:01.290
You're on Linux.

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:03.330
You're on Mac OS X, whatever.

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.220
But you can do that.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.803
When I first-- I switched from
Windows to Mac a few years ago.

01:09:06.803 --> 01:09:08.970
And when I did, I
installed parallels.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.834
And I ran most of my apps--
the same ones I did on Windows.

01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:14.250
And that was a nice, graceful
path-- new operating system,

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.819
still used Quicken and
all these other apps

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:16.840
that were Windows-based.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.798
And then eventually I
started upgrading my apps

01:09:18.798 --> 01:09:19.890
and getting onto Mac apps.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.600
And that was a much easier path.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.469
So at the same time, you're
going to feel some pain.

01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:26.510
And that's what Zappos
talked about with one foot

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:27.270
in, one foot out.

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.920
They were doing
all of holocracy--

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.430
first in part of the company--
then in all of the company.

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.971
But they were still
running backwards

01:09:32.971 --> 01:09:36.569
compatible apps or barely
backwards compatible apps.

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.050
So their compensation
system was still

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.188
relying on what looked like
a management hierarchy.

01:09:41.188 --> 01:09:43.229
That's tough when you're
running in this new mode

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:45.529
at the core of your
operating system that doesn't

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:46.620
use management hierarchy.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.319
But your comp system still does.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.990
It's hard to tell people own
your autonomy and your role.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.200
The boss can't tell you
what to do when the boss can

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.330
set your pay or fire you,
which was the one foot in,

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.000
one foot out.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.500
So companies when they adopt
Holacracy will start there.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.700
But then, eventually, they will
feel some tension about that.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.724
And then they start
working on the apps.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.140
And they'll start
either designing

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.520
their own compensation
system that

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.220
is more Holacracy
compatible and doesn't

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.930
rely on a management hierarchy
and firing processes and all

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:12.510
these.

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:14.650
Or they'll go out
into the open source

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.630
community of apps
that are out there

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:18.076
and find one that
works for them.

01:10:18.076 --> 01:10:19.700
So we have an approach
to compensation,

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.040
for example, that's very
Holacracy compatible.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.010
It's also similar
to what Zappos does.

01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:27.614
You can steal ours or
vary it or whatever.

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:28.780
AUDIENCE: One more question.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.200
And actually, just
for the record,

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.460
we also at Google-- our
managers don't set our pay.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.210
So I think there are some things
as Mary Kate was mentioning

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:39.440
that are already applied at
Google just we have something

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.320
in between a Holacractic version
and a feudal system version.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.050
But one more question
about managers.

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.526
So I think back in the
day, Larry and Sergey

01:10:47.526 --> 01:10:48.400
didn't like managers.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.230
And they're like, well, let's
just try not having managers.

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:51.560
And they experimented with that.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.101
And they found that
a lot of Googlers

01:10:53.101 --> 01:10:55.240
really missed having managers.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.760
And the thinking
here is if you have

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.620
a good manager,
that someone who's

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.510
in your corner-- they
are a people manager.

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.090
They're not like
a project manager.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:05.000
So there's someone-- that's
a person whose job it

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.590
is to check in with you and say,
how are your projects going?

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.340
Let's talk about your
career development--

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:12.540
how do you feel about
well-being, work-life balance.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.959
And so I just wonder
have you surveyed people

01:11:14.959 --> 01:11:15.750
at these companies.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.291
And have you found
that anyone really

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:19.710
misses having a more--
someone that's really

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:22.200
in their corner whose job
it is to care about them

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.700
and their careers, their work?

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.310
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, definitely.

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.175
It is difficult to go
from having that-- having

01:11:29.175 --> 01:11:31.650
that parent-like
figure, especially

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:32.880
if you've got a good one.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.600
If you've got a bad
parent, that's different--

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.020
the same growing up.

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.290
It's really comforting to
live in your parents' house,

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.550
have them take care
of your needs--

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:42.310
know that you don't have
to brave the world of being

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.990
an adult yourself fully because
you've got a good parent.

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.450
And I think a lot
of our attempts

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:48.400
to develop organizations
today rely on trying

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.370
to get better parents.

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:53.516
In other words, let's get
better leaders, better managers

01:11:53.516 --> 01:11:55.390
in place so that they're
good parents instead

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:58.260
of the bad manager parent.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.520
And I think that can go.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.590
To a large extent, that can
improve things-- that can help.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:05.787
But at some point, if you really
want to take that next leap,

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.370
you need to move out
of home and learn

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:10.750
to be an adult that doesn't
need the caretaking protective

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:11.420
parent.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.510
It doesn't mean you don't have
a relationship with your parent.

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:15.580
It doesn't mean you don't have
peers that can support you--

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.204
that you can lean on-- that are
on your side-- that are helping

01:12:18.204 --> 01:12:19.440
you-- that are mentoring you.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.410
You can have all of those
things without having

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:23.730
it be parent-child dynamic.

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.590
It can be adult to
adult and peer to peer.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.190
So we have a role in my company.

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:28.720
It's called partner-partner.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.820
So it's a partner's partner.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.470
And that role is there as
a mentor for new people

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:36.630
as they come into
this organization.

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.640
So there's lots of ways that
you can support each other

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.370
as well as the informal
that always happens.

01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:46.290
But there is that big shift from
parent-child dynamics to being

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:48.470
an adult out in the world.

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:49.800
And that is hard.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.800
You see a lot of people that
are uncomfortable with that

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.710
at first.

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:56.550
And some of them don't want it
so much that they will leave.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:13:00.230
You will lose some people when
you apply a system like this.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.790
It's really hard.

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:04.040
Some people choose to stay
at home until their parents

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.178
literally kick them out.

01:13:07.178 --> 01:13:09.310
And some people don't.

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:12.140
I know plenty of people
at are approaching 30

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.210
and still live at
home as a child

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.850
under their parents' roof.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:18.080
So it's tough.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.320
And yet there's also
so much that happens

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.820
in somebody's
internal development

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.560
even when they really do
leave behind the sheltering

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.530
comfort and safety of that
parent-like manager figure

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.850
and own their
authority, be an adult,

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:32.694
still get mentoring
and all that.

01:13:32.694 --> 01:13:34.610
The other thing I'd say
is when most companies

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.249
attempt to throw out
managers, the biggest

01:13:37.249 --> 01:13:38.790
mistake they make
is not replacing it

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:40.180
with an alternate structure.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.202
And that is not what
Holacracy is about.

01:13:43.202 --> 01:13:44.160
Some companies do that.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.010
A few even make it
work like valve makes

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:47.424
that work actually pretty well.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.590
Although they have a lot
of politics because there's

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.315
no other process.

01:13:50.315 --> 01:13:53.140
So politics kind of rule.

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.400
But it's really hard.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.580
Holacracy is not that.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.910
It's more structured, not less.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:59.034
It's just a completely
different kind of structure,

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:01.851
more like a city that lets
more of a dynamic order emerge.

01:14:01.851 --> 01:14:03.600
So you've got to replace
it with something

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.289
or you don't get
a nice replacement

01:14:05.289 --> 01:14:06.330
for management structure.

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:09.330
You get something that often
is a big step backwards

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.740
or at least a side step into
a completely chaotic space.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.677
So replace it with something
would be my lesson.

01:14:15.677 --> 01:14:17.760
MODERATOR: All right,
that's all the time we have.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.720
So thank you so much, Brian.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.620
BRIAN ROBERTSON:
Thanks everyone.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:20.203
Appreciate it.

01:14:20.203 --> 01:14:21.120
