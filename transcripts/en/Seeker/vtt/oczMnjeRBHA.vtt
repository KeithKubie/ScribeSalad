00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.969
Space is big.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:02.969
Like.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:03.969
Really big.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.430
Of the many probes, orbiters, and surveyors
the people of Earth have sent into space to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.780
explore our solar system, an uncomfortable
number have been lost.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.090
Lost spacecraft make people crazy, engineers
included.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.010
We spend millions of dollars to send these
things to a very specific place, how do we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.350
just… lose them?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.070
What happens if we lose things in space?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.470
If they’re millions of miles away and are
far too small to see with telescopes, what

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.070
do we do?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.150
Usually, lost means loss of contact.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.160
It doesn’t always mean we don’t know where
something is.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.220
Engineers and mathematicians calculate the
trajectory of everything we send into space.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.940
But those calculations aren’t perfect (sorry,
y’all), so if a spacecraft stops talking

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.110
to us at some point, it can drift away from
our calculations… which brings us back to:

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.350
Space is big.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.510
The losses range from the Soviet, Zond 3 which
sent pictures of the far side of the moon

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.030
for the first time, but was lost on the way
to Mars; to NASA’s infamous Mars Climate

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.770
Orbiter which got lost because NASA’s teams
mixed up metric and english units; and even

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.700
a Japanese probe named Akatsuki which was
lost trying to orbit Venus… … but, then

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.350
it was found again!

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340
And being found again is the sweetest in space.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.170
The ‘verse is scary for little probes just
trying to get where they’re going.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.829
So, when we’re sending spacecraft to Mars,
Pluto, or even just down to the International

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.749
Space Station, we give them lots of ways to
tell us where they are.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:28.600
The Mars Science Laboratory, that carried
Curiosity to Mars, had multiple antennas to

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.369
communicate with Earth and other spacecraft
already at Mars that could relay the signals

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.369
back.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.749
The Curiosity rover itself also has multiple
antennas to talk to spacecraft in Mars’

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.759
orbit, as well as Earth directly through the
Deep Space Network.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.579
Again, Engineers work really hard and design
spacecraft to make sure that if something

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.689
goes wrong, they still won’t lose it.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.880
To you and me, when we hear something is “lost
in space” we probably get a sense of dread

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.020
(and not just because of the terrible 1998
film).

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.429
It just seems too daunting a task to find
something that’s LOST IN SPACE.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.939
But NASA’s got skillz.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.530
And there’s nothing more hype than finding
something you thought was gone forever.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.390
For example, Chandrayaan-1, an Indian Space
Research Organization probe currently orbiting

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.900
the moon, was just found by NASA’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.640
It had been missing since 2009.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.540
The ISRO lost contact with it, and they simply
couldn’t find it again, so they ended their

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.540
mission.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.451
But then, JPL shot a large amount of microwaves
at the moon from a dish in California, and

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:31.640
picked them up in West Virginia.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.940
They analyzed the bounce back, and found ol’
Chandy orbiting 200 kilometers above the moon.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.940
Boop.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.940
There it was.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.840
It once was lost, but now is… well it’s
still lost, actually because they can’t

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.710
communicate with it, I guess?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.840
That’s not typical.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.230
These are computer systems, a big part of
the problem is pinpointing their exact location

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.910
at that point, you just give it a call and
(hopefully, it picks up).

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.700
This happened in a less gloriously scientific
way with a solar-research sat called STEREO-B

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.120
-- part of a pair: Stereo A and B. The twins
were programmed to fly around the sun and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.620
take 3D pictures of mass ejections and flares.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.940
Unfortunately, “B” was lost in 2014 when
scientists tested its reset function and it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.180
just… never really came back.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.150
They knew its orbit, and where it would be,
but couldn’t talk to it because the sun

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.240
was in the way, and it wasn’t responding
to their hails.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.070
Fast-forward two years… scientists were
still tracking where it should be, and kept

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.060
sending messages its way and eventually, they
got lucky!

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.630
In 2016, Stereo-B came back online.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.740
There was enough charge in its batteries,
and its antenna was pointing in the right

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.830
direction, so they got a ping back!

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.130
These computer systems are designed to live
in one of the harshest environments known

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.070
to man, they can be the size of small SUVs
like Curiosity, or an oven-sized cube like

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.380
Chandrayaan-1.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.040
But space is big, and sometimes things get
lost.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.640
If we’re lucky, and keep sending signals,
we hopefully build them smart enough to be

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640
found.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.490
There are so many stories of satellite rescue,
maybe you should make a website to catalog

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.490
them all!
