00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history and today we’ve done it!

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.590
WE’VE FINALLY REACHED THE 21st CENTURY!

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.949
Today, we boldly go where no history course
has gone before, because your teacher ran

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.150
out of time and never made it to the present.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.640
Also, if you’re preparing for the AP test
it’s unlikely that today’s video will

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.250
be helpful to you because, you know, they
never get to this stuff.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.880
Mr. Green, Mr. Green?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880
Awesome, free period.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.679
Yeah, Me From the Past, there’s no such
thing as a free period.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.810
There’s only time, and how you choose to
use it.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.009
Also, Me From the Past, we’re in your future,
hold on I’ve got to take this stuff off

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.750
it’s hard to take me seriously with that.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.080
We’re in the future for you which means
that you are learning important things about

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.070
the you who does not yet exist.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.579
You know about Lady GaGa, Kanye and Kim, Bieber,
well you’re not going to find out about

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.809
any of those things because this is a history
class, but it’s still going to be interesting.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.940
INTRO
So the presidency of George W. Bush may not

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.129
end up on your AP exam, but it’s very important
when it comes to understanding the United

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.900
States that we live in today
The controversy starts with the 2000 Election.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.410
Democratic presidential candidate Al “I
invented the Internet” Gore was sitting

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.080
Vice President, and he asked Bill Clinton
not to campaign much because a lot of voters

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.470
kind of hated Bill Clinton.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.220
The republican candidate was George W. Bush,
governor of Texas and unlike his father a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.140
reasonably authentic Texan.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.090
You know, as people from Connecticut go.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
Bush was a former oil guy and baseball team
owner and he was running as a Compassionate

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.090
Conservative, which meant he was organizing
a coalition of religious people and fiscal

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.090
conservatives.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.940
And that turned out to be a very effective
coalition and George W Bush got a lot of votes.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.920
He did not however get as many votes as Al
Gore.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.410
But as you’ll no doubt remember from earlier
in Crash Course US History, in the United

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.750
States presidential elections are not decided
by popular vote.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050
They are decided by the Electoral College.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.650
So the election was incredibly close.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.030
It solidified the Red-Blue divide that has
become a trope for politicians since.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.250
And in the end Gore won the popular vote by
about 500,000 votes.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.950
However, Al Gore did not have the necessary
electoral votes to become president.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890
Unless he won Florida.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.939
Did he win Florida?

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.159
I don’t even want to go there…

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.519
In Florida the vote was ridiculously close,
but George W Bush had a gigantic advantage

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.739
which is that his brother, Jeb Bush, was the
governor of Florida.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.930
So when it came time to certify the election
Jeb was like, “Yeah.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.930
My brother won.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.930
No big deal.”

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.719
But then the Gore campaign sued to have a
recount by hand which is allowed under Florida

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.719
law.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.680
But then Bush’s lawyers asked the Supreme
Court to intervene and they did.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.680
Their decision in Bush v. Gore remains rather
controversial.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.430
They ruled that the recount should be stopped,
interfering with a state law and also a state’s

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.340
electoral process, which is a weird decision
for strict constructionists to make.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.579
However, one of the strong points of the United
States these past couple centuries has been

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.329
that sometimes we have the opportunity to
go to war over whether this person or that

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.970
person should be president and we chose not
to.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.550
So regardless of whether you think the recount
should have gone on, or George W Bush should

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.260
have been elected, he was, and he set to work
implementing his campaign promises, including

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.579
working on a missile defence system that was
very similar to Star Wars.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.499
And that was Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars,
not George Lucas’ Star Wars.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.829
Man if we could get a federally funded new
Star Wars trilogy that doesn’t suck that

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:16.829
would be awesome.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.249
Anyway, in the first 100 days of his presidency
Bush also barred federal funding for stem

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.870
cell research, and he supported oil drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.420
And speaking of environmental policy, the
Bush administration announced that it would

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.000
not abide by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on carbon
emissions and that didn’t go over well with

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.499
environmentalists in the U.S. or in all of
these green parts of not-America because they

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.689
were like, “You guys made all the carbon.”

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.499
To which we said, “This is America.”

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:49.019
Libertage
Bush also attempted education reform with

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.920
the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandated
that states implement “rigorous” standards

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.950
and testing regimes to prove that those standards
were being met.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.389
The No Child Left Behind Act is especially
controversial with teachers who are great

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.849
friends of Crash Course US History so we will
say nothing more.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.930
Most importantly, George W Bush pushed through
the largest tax cut in American history in

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.930
2001.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.840
Claiming that putting more money in Americans’
pockets would stimulate growth in an economy

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.940
that had stumbled after the bursting of the
dot-com bubble in 2000.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.700
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.320
The rules here are simple.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.190
I guess the author of the Mystery Document,
I either get it right, or I get shocked with

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.750
the shock pen.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.612
Alright, what have we got here today.

00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:33.500
I’ve got a feeling it’s going to be a
sad one.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.590
“It was a beautiful fall day, with a crisp,
blue sky.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.170
I was coming in to work late that day; I guess
I didn’t have first period class.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.630
It was only the second or third day of school.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.920
When I emerged from the subway, Union Square
was strangely quiet, which only added to the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.650
beauty of the day.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.890
People were standing still, which is weird
in New York under any circumstances, and looking

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.930
down University Place towards lower Manhattan.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.810
Before I even looked I asked a passerby what
had happened.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.120
She, or he, I really don’t remember, said
that a plane had crashed into the Trade Center.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.330
Then I looked and saw the smoke coming billo
wing out of the South Tower.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.140
I thought it was an accident, but I knew that
this was not going to be an easy day.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.950
Well it’s obviously someone who was in New
York City on September 11, 2001, but that

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.410
only narrows it down to like 10 million people.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.010
However, I happen to know that it is Crash
Course historian and my high school history

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.450
teacher Raoul Meyer who wrote that account.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.050
This is the saddest I have ever been not to
be shocked.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.500
So whether George Bush’s domestic policy
would have worked is up for debate, but the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.950
events of September 11, 2001 ensured that
foreign policy would dominate any discussion

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.250
of the opening decade of the 21st century.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.980
That morning terrorists affiliated with al
Qaeda hijacked 4 airliners.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.720
Two planes were flown into Manhattan’s World
Trade Center, a third was crashed into the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.600
Pentagon in Washington and a fourth, also
headed for Washington DC crashed in Pennsylvania

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.220
when passengers overpowered the hijackers.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.680
Almost 3,000 people died including almost
400 policemen and firefighters.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.310
As Americans rushed to help in the search
for survivors and to rebuild a devastated

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.760
city, a shared sense of trauma and a desire
to show resolve really did bring the country

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760
together.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.920
President Bush’s popularity soared in the
wake of the attacks.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.180
In a speech on September 20, the president
told Americans watching on television that

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.430
the terrorists had targeted America “Because
we love freedom […]. And they hate freedom.”

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.040
This is another critical moment in American
history where the definition of freedom is

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
being reimagined.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.010
And we were reminded in the wake of September
11th that one of the central things that government

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.520
does to keep us free is to keep us safe.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.260
But at the same time ensuring our safety sometimes
means impinging upon our freedoms.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.190
And the question of how to keep America safe
while also preserving our civil liberties

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.750
is one of the central questions of the 21st
century.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.500
At any rate, in the September 20th speech,
the president announced a new guiding principle

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.880
in foreign policy that became known as the
Bush Doctrine.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.510
America would go to war with terrorism making
no distinction between the terrorists and

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.590
nations that harbored them.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.470
Bush laid out the terms for the world that
night: “Either you are with us or you are

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.940
with the terrorists.”

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.150
But that dichotomy of course would prove to
be a bit of an oversimplification.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.971
So on October 7, the United States launched
its first airstrikes on Afghanistan, which

00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:12.730
at the time was ruled by a group of Islamic
fundamentalists called the Taliban who were

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.220
protecting Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda’s leader.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.100
This was followed by American ground troops
supporting the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.010
in chasing out the Taliban and setting up
a new Afghan government that was friendly

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.200
to the United States.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.410
This new government did undo many of the worst
Taliban policies, for instance allowing women

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.350
and girls to go to school, and even to serve
in the parliament.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.710
More women than girls in the parliament naturally.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.680
But by 2007 the Taliban was beginning to make
a comeback and although fewer than 100 Americans

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.670
died in the initial phase of the war, a sizeable
force remained and in the ensuing 12 years

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.210
the number of Americans killed would continue
to rise.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.800
And then, by January 2002, Bush had expanded
the scope of the Global War on Terror by proclaiming

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.760
that Iran, Iraq and North Korea were an “axis
of evil” that harbored terrorists, even

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.660
though none of those nations had direct ties
to the September 11 attacks.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.260
The ultimate goal of Bush Doctrine was to
make the world safe for freedom and also to

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.010
spread it and freedom was defined as consisting
of political democracy, free expression, religious

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.750
toleration, free trade and free markets.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.840
These freedoms, Bush said, were, “right
and true for every person, in every society”.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.100
And there’s no question that the Saddam
Hussein led Iraq of 2003 was not, by any of

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.400
those definitions, free.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.620
But the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United
States was predicated on two ideas.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.500
First, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction
- chemical and biological weapons that they

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.999
were refusing to give up.

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:38.450
And second, that there was, or at least may
have been, a link between Saddam Hussein's

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.959
Iraq and the Al Qaeda attacks of 9-11.

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:46.120
So in March 2003 the United States, Britain,
and a coalition of other countries, invaded

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120
Iraq.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.069
Within a month Baghdad was captured, Saddam
Hussein was ousted, Iraq created a new government

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:56.519
that was more democratic than Saddam’s dictatorship,
and then descended into sectarian chaos.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:01.100
After Baghdad fell, President Bush declared
the end of major combat operations in Iraq,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.580
but troops soon found themselves trying to
manage an increasingly organized insurgency

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.459
that featured attacks and bombings.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:12.079
And by 2006 American intelligence analysts
concluded that Iraq had become a haven for

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:15.459
Islamist terrorists, which it hadn’t been,
before the invasion.

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:19.060
In fact, Saddam Hussein’s socialist government,
while it occasionally called upon religion

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.750
to unify people against an enemy, was pretty
secular.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.699
Although fewer than 200 Americans had died
in the initial assaults, by the end of 2006,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:31.010
more than 3,000 American soldiers had been
killed and another 20,000 wounded.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.540
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis had died in
the conflict and the costs of the war which

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.460
were promised to be no more than $60 billion
had ballooned to $200 billion dollars.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.930
So that, and we try really hard here at Crash
Course to be objective was a bit of a disaster.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.379
But let’s now go back to the domestic side
of things and jump back in time to the passage

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.680
of the USA PATRIOT act.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.709
Which believe it or not is an acronym for
the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:01.889
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism act of 2001.

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:07.019
Oh, Congress you don’t pass many laws these
days but when you do… mmhm….

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:08.959
there’s some winners.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:13.089
The PATRIOT act gave the government unprecedented
law enforcement powers to combat domestic

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.230
terrorism including the ability to wiretap
and spy on Americans.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.680
At least 5000 people connected to the Middle
East were called in for questioning and more

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.980
than 1200 were arrested, many held for months
without any charge.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.770
The administration also set up a camp for
accused terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.220
but not the fun kind of camp, the prison kind,
it housed more than 700 suspects.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.509
The president also authorized the National
Security Agency to listen in to telephone

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:44.899
conversations without first obtaining a warrant,
the so-called warrantless wiretapping.

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:49.279
In 2013 Americans learned that NSA surveillance
has of course gone much farther than this

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:53.470
with surveillance programs like PRISM which
sounds like it’s out of an Orwell novel

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.120
- I mean both like the name and the actual
thing it refers to.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.689
Meredith would like us to point out that Prism
is also the name of a Katy Perry album proving

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:05.389
that we here at Crash Course are young and
hip and with it.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:06.740
Who is Katy Perry?

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.149
Oh right, she has that song in Madagascar
3.

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:11.689
Sorry, I have little kids.

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:16.279
The Supreme Court eventually limited the executive
branch’s power and ruled that enemy combatants

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.689
do have some procedural rights.

00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:23.540
Congress also banned the use of torture in
a 2005 defense appropriations bill sponsored

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.860
by Republican John McCain who himself had
been a victim of torture in Vietnam.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.509
But the Defense Department did condone the
continued use of so-called “enhanced interrogation

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:34.300
techniques” like waterboarding.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.180
Which most countries do consider torture.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.139
But George W Bush won re-election in 2004,
defeating the surprisingly weak John Kerry,

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:45.860
who was characterized as a “waffler” on
a number of issues including the Iraq war.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.420
Kerry’s history as a Vietnam protester and
also terrible windsurfer probably didn’t

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.420
help him much.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.089
Bush’s victory is still a bit surprising
to historians admittedly at that moment the

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.250
Iraq war seemed to be going pretty well.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.330
But during Bush’s first term, the economy,
which is usually what really drives voters,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.480
wasn’t that great at all.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.170
A recession began during 2001 and the September
11 attacks made it much worse.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.779
And while the GDP did begin to grow again
relatively quickly, employment didn’t recover,

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:15.230
hence all the description of it as a “jobless
recovery.”

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:21.600
90% of the jobs lost in the 2001-2002 recession
were in manufacturing, continuing a trend

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.490
that we had been seeing for 30 years.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:30.240
The number of steelworkers dropped from 520,000
in 1970 to 120,000 in 2004.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.410
And in his first term George W Bush actually
became the first president since Herbert Hoover

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.490
to oversee a net loss of jobs.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.709
Now I want to be clear that that’s not necessarily
his fault as I have said many times before

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:42.699
- economics are complicated.

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:45.769
And presidents do not decide whether economies
grow.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:49.819
But at any rate George W Bush was re-elected
and went on to have an extremely controversial

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:50.819
second term.

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:51.970
Let’s go to the thoughtbubble.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.579
In 2005 several events undermined the public’s
confidence in the Bush administration.

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:00.939
First, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief
of staff was indicted for perjury and then

00:13:00.939 --> 00:13:05.160
House Majority Leader Tom “The Hammer”
DeLay was indicted for violating campaign

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.199
finance laws.

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:11.480
Then in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed
into the gulf coast near New Orleans submerging

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.339
much of the city, killing nearly 1500 people,
and leaving thousands stranded without basic

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.389
services.

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:22.999
Disaster preparation and response was poor
on the state, local, and federal levels, but

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:27.149
the slow response of the Department of Homeland
Security and Federal Emergency Management

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:33.309
Agency was particularly noticeable as thousands
of mostly African American New Orleans residents

00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:35.259
suffered without food or water.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:38.499
Damage to the city was estimated at around
$80 billion dollars.

00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:43.649
And the Katrina disaster exposed the persistent
poverty and racial divisions in the city.

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:47.439
While the Katrina response probably contributed
to the reversal of fortune for Congressional

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:52.459
Republicans in the 2006 mid-terms, it was
more likely the spike in gasoline prices that

00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:56.839
resulted from the shutting down of refining
capacity in the gulf and increased demand

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:59.249
for oil from rapidly growing China.

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:03.759
Voters gave Democrats majorities in both houses,
and Nancy Pelosi of California became the

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.449
first woman Speaker of the House in American
history.

00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:11.970
And then, in 2007, the country fell back into
recession as a massive housing bubble began

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:17.399
to deflate, followed by the near collapse
of the American banking system in 2008.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.019
Thought Bubble, thank you once again for the
tremendous downer.

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:24.249
So, the Bush years are still in the recent
past, and it’s impossible to tell just what

00:14:24.249 --> 00:14:27.019
their historical significance is without some
distance.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:32.490
But the attacks on September 11 had far ranging
effects on American foreign policy but also

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.769
on the entire world.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:37.649
Under the leadership of George W Bush the
United States began a global fight against

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.470
terrorism and for freedom.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.490
But as always, what we mean by the words is
evolving and there’s no question that in

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.209
trying to ensure a certain kind of freedom
we have undermined other kinds of freedom.

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:52.689
We’ll get to the even messier and murkier
world of the 2008 financial collapse next

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:53.689
week.

00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:55.079
Until then, thanks for watching.
