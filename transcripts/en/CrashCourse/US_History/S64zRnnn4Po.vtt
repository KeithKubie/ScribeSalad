Episode 39: Consensus and Protest: Civil Rights
LOCKED

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.350
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history and today we’re going to look

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.689
at one of the most important periods of American
social history, the 1950s.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.689
Why is it so important?

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.910
Well, first because it saw the advent of the
greatest invention in human history: Television.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.370
Mr. Green, Mr. Green!

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.509
I like TV!

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.650
By the way, you’re from the future.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.689
How does the X-Files end?

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.349
Are there aliens or no aliens?

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.599
No spoilers, Me From The Past, you’re going
to have to go to college and watch the X-Files

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.320
get terrible just like I did.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.700
No it’s mostly important because of the
Civil Rights Movement We’re going to talk

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.430
about some of the heroic figures like Martin
Luther King and Rosa Parks, but much of the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.500
real story is about the thousands of people
you’ve never heard of who fought to make

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.820
America more inclusive.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.230
But before we look at the various changes
that the Civil Rights Movement was pushing

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.930
for, we should spend a little time looking
at the society that they were trying to change.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.920
The 1950s has been called a period of consensus,
and I suppose it was, at least for the white

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.930
males who wrote about it and who all agreed
that the 1950s were fantastic for white males.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.710
Consensus culture was caused first, by the
Cold War – people were hesitant to criticize

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.000
the United States for fear of being branded
a communist, and, second, by affluence – increasing

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.691
prosperity meant that more people didn’t
have as much to be critical of.

00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:10.840
And this widespread affluence was something
new in the United States.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
Between 1946 and 1960 Americans experienced
a period of economic expansion that saw standards

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.510
of living rise and gross national product
more than double.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.440
And unlike many previous American economic
expansions, much of the growing prosperity

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.470
in the fifties was shared by ordinary working
people who saw their wages rise.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.330
To quote our old friend Eric Foner, “By
1960, an estimated 60 percent of Americans

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.680
enjoyed what the government defined as a middle-class
standard of living.”[1]

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.220
And this meant that increasing numbers of
Americans had access things like television,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.990
and air conditioning, and dishwashers and
air travel.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.360
That doesn’t really seem like a bonus.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.720
Anyway, despite the fact that they were being
stuffed into tiny metal cylinders and hurdled

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.920
through the air, most Americans were happy
because they had, like, indoor plumbing and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.840
electricity.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.640
intro
The 1950s was the era of suburbanization.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.280
The number of homes in the United States doubled
during the decade, which had the pleasant

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729
side effect of creating lots of construction
jobs.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.470
The classic example of suburbanization was
Levittown in New York, where 10,000 almost

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.230
identical homes were built and became home
to 40,000 people almost overnight.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.670
And living further from the city meant that
more Americans needed cars, which was good

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.980
news for Detroit where cars were being churned
out with the expectation that Americans would

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.950
replace them every two years.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.400
By 1960, 80% of Americans owned at least one
car and 14% had two or more.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030
And car culture changed the way that Americans
lived and shopped.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.100
I mean it gave us shopping malls, and drive
thru restaurants, and the backseat makeout

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100
session.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.020
I mean, high school me didn’t get the backseat
makeout session.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.020
But, other people did!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.480
I did get the Burger King drive thru though.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.020
And lots of it.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.940
Our whole picture of the American standard
of living, with its abundance of consumer

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.080
goods and plentiful services was established
in the 1950s.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.710
And so, for so for many people this era was
something of a “golden age” especially

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.140
when we look back on it today with nostalgia.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.130
But there were critics, even at the time.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.180
So when we say the 1950s were an era of consensus,
one of the things we’re saying is there

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.000
wasn’t much room for debate about what it
meant to be an American.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.740
Most people agreed on the American values:
individualism, respect for private property,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.070
and belief in equal opportunity.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.300
The key problem was that we believed in equal
opportunity, but didn’t actually provide

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300
it.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.860
But some people were concerned that the cookie
cutter vision of the good life and the celebration

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.600
of the middle class lifestyle was displacing
other conceptions of citizenship.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.840
Like the sociologist C. Wright Mills described
a combination of military, corporate, and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.630
political leaders as a power elite whose control
over government and the economy was such as

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.720
to make democracy an afterthought.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.300
In The Lonely Crowd sociologist David Riesman
criticized Americans for being conformist

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.240
and lacking the rich inner life necessary
to be truly independent.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.710
And John Kenneth Galbraith questioned an Affluent
Society that would pay for new cars and new

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.050
missiles but not for new schools.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.380
And we can’t mention the 1950s without discussing
teenagers since this was the decade that gave

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.020
us Rock and Roll, and rock stars like Bill
Haley and the Comets, Buddy Holly and the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.920
Crickets, and Elvis Presley and his hips.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.920
Another gift of the 1950s was literature,
much of which appeals especially to teenagers.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920
Like, the Beats presented a rather drug-fueled
and not always coherent criticism of the bourgeois

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920
1950’s morals.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
They rejected materialism, and suburban ennui
and things like regular jobs while celebrating

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
impulsivity, and recklessness, experimentation
and freedom.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
And also heroin.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
So you might have noticed something about
all those critics of the 1950s that I just

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
mentioned: they were all white dudes.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.160
Now, we’re gonna be talking about women
in the 1950s and 1960s next week because their

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.030
liberation movement began a bit later, but
what most people call the Civil Rights Movement

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.210
really did begin in the 1950s.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.320
While the 1950s were something of a golden
age for many blue and white collar workers,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.940
it was hardly a period of expanding opportunities
for African Americans.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
Rigid segregation was the rule throughout
the country, especially in housing, but also

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.750
in jobs and in employment.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.340
In the South, public accommodations were segregated
by law, while in the north it was usually

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.280
happening by custom or de facto segregation.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.250
To give just one example, the new suburban
neighborhoods that sprang up in the 1950s

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.570
were almost completely white and this remained
true for decades.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.350
According Eric Foner, “As late as the 1990s,
nearly 90 percent of suburban whites lived

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.830
in communities with non-white populations
less than 1 percent.”

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.250
And it wasn’t just housing.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.620
In the 1950s half of black families lived
in poverty.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.440
When they were able to get union jobs, black
workers had less seniority than their white

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.160
counterparts so their employment was less
stable.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.840
And their educational opportunities were severely
limited by sub-standard segregated schools.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.300
Now you might think the Civil Rights Movement
began with Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.530
Boycott or else Brown v. Board of Education,
but it really started during WW2 with efforts

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.889
like those of A. Philip Randolph and the soldiers
taking part in the Double-V crusade.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.990
But even before that, black Americans had
been fighting for civil rights.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.090
It’s just that in the 1950s, they started
to win.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.030
So, desegregating schools was a key goal of
the Civil Rights movement.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.260
And it started in California in 1946.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.470
In the case of Mendez v. Westminster the California
Supreme Court ruled that Orange County, of

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.040
all places, had to desegregate their schools.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.520
They’d been discriminating against Latinos.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.199
And then, California’s governor, Earl Warren,
signed an order that repealed all school segregation

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.199
in the state.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.930
That same Earl Warren, by the way, was Chief
Justice when the landmark case Brown v. Board

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.300
of Education came before the Supreme Court
in 1954.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.270
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund under the leadership
of Thurgood Marshall had been pursuing a legal

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.290
strategy of trying to make states live up
to the ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson that required

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.490
all public facilities to be separate but equal.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.240
They started by bringing lawsuits against
professional schools like law schools, because

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.920
it was really obvious that the three classrooms
and no library that Texas set up for its African

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.639
American law students were not equal to the
actual University of Texas’s law school.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.070
But the Brown case was about public schools
for children.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.430
It was actually a combination of 5 cases from
4 states, of which Brown happened to be alphabetically

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.430
the first.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.520
The Board of Education in question incidentally
was in Topeka Kansas, not one of the states

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.630
of the old Confederacy, but nonetheless a
city that did restricted schooling by race.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.320
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.440
The rules here are simple.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440
I read the Mystery Document.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.110
If I’m wrong, I get shocked.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.009
"Segregation of white and colored children
in public schools has a detrimental effect

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.509
upon the colored children.

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.740
The impact is greater when it has the sanction
of the law, for the policy of separating the

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.330
races is usually interpreted as denoting the
inferiority of the negro group.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.530
A sense of inferiority affects the motivation
of a child to learn.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.320
Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore,
has a tendency to [retard] the educational

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.560
and mental development of negro children and
to deprive them of some of the benefits they

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.130
would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school
system.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.540
[Footnote 10]"[2]
Stan, the last two weeks you have given me

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.120
two extraordinary gifts and I am thankful.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.180
It is Earl Warren from Brown v. Board of Education.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.180
Huzzah!

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.139
Justice Warren is actually quoting from sociological
research there that shows that segregation

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.780
itself is psychologically damaging to black
children because they recognize that being

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.539
separated out is a badge of inferiority.

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.750
Alright, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.400
The Brown decision was a watershed but it
didn’t lead to massive immediate desegregation

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.090
of the nation’s public schools.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.360
In fact, it spawned what came to be known
as “Massive Resistance” in the South.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.070
The resistance got so massive, in fact, that
a number of counties, rather than integrate

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.850
their schools, closed them.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.270
Prince Edward County in Virginia, for instance,
closed its schools in 1959 and didn’t re-open

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.750
them again until 1964.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.539
Except they didn’t really close them because
many states appropriated funds to pay for

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:21.150
white students to attend “private” academies.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.890
Some states got so into the resistance that
they began to fly the Confederate Battle flag

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.350
over their state capitol buildings.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.169
Yes, I’m looking at you Alabama and South
Carolina.

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:34.050
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to
move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.029
and got arrested, kicking off the Montgomery
Bus Boycott that lasted almost a year.

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:41.729
A lot of people think that Parks was simply
an average African American working woman

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:45.869
who was tired and fed up with segregation,
but the truth is more complicated.

00:08:45.869 --> 00:08:50.129
Parks had been active in politics since the
1930s and had protested the notorious Scottsboro

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.129
Boys case.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:55.309
She had served as secretary for the NAACP
and she had begun her quest to register to

00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:57.839
vote in Alabama in 1943.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.529
She failed a literacy test three times before
becoming one of the very few black people

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:04.259
registered to vote in the state.

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:07.420
And in 1954 she attended a training session
for political activists and met other civil

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.470
rights radicals.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.749
So Rosa Parks was an active participant in
the fight for black civil rights long before

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:13.860
she sat on that bus.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.050
The Bus Boycott also thrust into prominence
a young pastor from Atlanta, the 26 year old

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.740
Martin Luther King Jr.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.499
He helped to organize the boycott from his
Baptist church, which reminds us that black

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:26.929
churches played a pivotal role in the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:32.240
That boycott would go on to last for 381 days
and in the end, the city of Montgomery relented.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.660
So that was, of course, only the beginning
for Martin Luther King, who achieved his greatest

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.319
triumphs in the 1960s.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:42.079
After Montgomery, he was instrumental in forming
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:46.009
a coalition of black civil rights and church
leaders who pushed for integration.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:50.310
And they needed to fight hard, especially
in the face of Massive Resistance and an Eisenhower

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.569
administration that was lukewarm at best about
civil rights.

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:57.709
But I suppose Eisenhower did stick up for
civil rights when forced to, as when Arkansas

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:02.259
Governor Orval Faubus used the National Guard
to prevent the integration of Little Rock’s

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:05.009
Central High School by 9 black students in
1957.

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:08.610
Eisenhower was like, “You know, as the guy
who invaded Normandy, I don’t think that’s

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.449
the best use for the National Guard.”

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:14.980
So, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division
(not the entirety of it, but some of it) to

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.769
Little Rock, Arkansas, to walk kids to school.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.089
Which they did for a year.

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:24.209
After that, Faubus closed the schools, but
at least the federal government showed that

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:28.499
it wouldn’t allow states to ignore court
orders about the Constitution.

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:30.639
In your face, John C. Calhoun.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.139
Despite the court decision and the dispatching
of Federal troops, by the end of the 1950s

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:39.110
fewer than two percent of black students attended
integrated schools in the South.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.019
So, the modern movement for Civil Rights had
begun, but it was clear that there was still

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:44.100
a lot of work to do.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.809
But the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement
shows us that the picture of consensus in

00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:52.399
the 1950s is not quite as clear-cut as its
proponents would have us believe.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:57.239
Yes, there was widespread affluence, particularly
among white people, and criticism of the government

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:01.649
and America generally was stifled by the fear
of appearing to sympathize with Communism.

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:06.730
But there was also widespread systemic inequality
and poverty in the decade that shows just

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.019
how far away we were from living the ideal
of equal opportunity.

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:15.779
That we have made real progress, and we have,
is a credit to the voices of protest.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:20.120
Next week we’ll see how women, Latinos,
and gay people added their voices to the protests

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.389
and look at what they were and were not able
to change in the 1960s.

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:25.389
Thanks for watching.

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:26.489
I’ll see you then.

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:29.989
