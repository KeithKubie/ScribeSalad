00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's go over the solution to this problem starting with the definition of the acceleration function.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know the acceleration due to gravity points downward.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's put this factor into two components.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have one component right here that is parallel to the string of the pendulum

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and another component that is perpendicular to this green one.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now we know that the acceleration in this direction is going to be exactly cancelled out

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
by the acceleration due to the tension in the rope.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So that means that the acceleration we're looking for is really just this pink component,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which any point along the path is going to be tangent to the trajectory.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now if we call this angle θ right here, we can figure out the length of this pink component

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
by just saying that it is equal to length of the resultant vector times the sine of θ.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The θ down here is actually exactly equal to θ in the diagram of the pendulum itself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So that means to figure out the length of this component,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we can use information that we already know about this larger diagram.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Since position is just the arc link right here of this imaginary circle,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
then the measure of that angle in radiant is going to be equal to the length of the arc

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that it corresponds to divided by the radius of that circle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So that means that in our case, θ is equal to arc length over radius or position over length.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So since θ equals position over length and we want the sine of θ,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we fill in our definition for acceleration as -g or negative

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity times sine of the position over length.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Okay, moving on towards symplectic Euler function.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We have to fill in this for loop with the input num_initial conditions.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
As I said in the InterVideo of the problem, we wanted the initial x to vary from 1.75 to 2.25

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the initial v to vary from -2 to 2

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
corresponding to the coordinates of every point along that green circle that I'd showed you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now a convenient way to make a variable cycle through values that are symmetric

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about an equilibrium value is to use sine or cosine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So we're going to keep that in mind.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now as you learn from the circular orbit problem of Unit 1, if we consider any point

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
along the circumference of the circle, then we can define an angle that corresponds to that point.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
These are coming from right here as a zero radian mark.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You can write the coordinates of this point then as the radius of the circle times the cosine of the angle.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's for the horizontal component and for the vertical component,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we get the radius times the sine of the angle.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
In the phase based plot that I showed you in the InterVideo, we saw that position lying along

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the horizontal axis and velocity lying along the vertical axis.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we wanted to plot the coordinates of the points on that green circle--the initial condition circle

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
where the position is going to correspond to cosine and the velocity is going to use sine.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now I created a variable called phi. You could pick any name you want I guess.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And phi effectively split the circle into 49 segments

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by marking out 50 different points along the circumference.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So every time I increases by one, we're going to step to the next point along the circumference.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Since as we saw in the phase base plot, we have a complete circle of green points.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The x values of those green points vary like this with 2 as the middle value

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and the v coordinates vary like that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You noticed that the amplitude in either case corresponds to the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
half link of the green shape in that direction.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So actually we have in a phase base plot is an ellipse for that set of initial conditions.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now that we have our starting additions figured out, we can finally use the symplectic Euler method

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to proximate the values with x and v at later sets.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This code right here is just a direct transition pretty much of the equations that I showed you earlier.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now let's go back to looking at the plot that we get things plugged in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but first let's look at our top two plots.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The horizontal axis in both of them represents time measured in seconds.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The vertical axis in the top one is x measured in meters

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and here it is v measured in meters per second.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So you can see that our initial values of x go from 1.5 to 2.25 and v from -2 to 2.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So that corresponds to this green ellipse right here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The most important thing to notice about this bottom graph, which like I said earlier represents

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
phase base is that if we look closely at each one of these ellipses they all have the same area.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now let's look at the shapes that we have down here in this bottom graph.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you look closely and do a bit of calculating, you'll notice that all these different color shapes

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
have the same exact area even though they are well shaped very differently.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
This is a great example of how phase base is conserve in the system where energy is conserve.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Now the fact that its conservation principle holds in this diagram

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
shows how the symplectic Euler method improve upon the accuracy of the forward Euler method.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
When the forward Euler method is used, it often result in the energy suddenly increasing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So it means that the area of each of these shapes down here will get progressively bigger.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Symplectic Euler method, however, confirms much better the equations of motion in physics,

00:04:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It never reflects exactly radical predictions more accurately. Great job with the first problem in Unit 2.
