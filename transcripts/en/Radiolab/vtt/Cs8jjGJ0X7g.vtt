00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey, this is jad from Radiolab.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.520
So we were not planning on releasing a podcast today, but then Friday apple,

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.120
<v 1>the federal government tonight outlining and elaborate expensive and</v>

4
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.670
extraordinary assault on us democracy,

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.710
<v 0>teen Russian nationals and three Russian companies accused of a massive effort.</v>

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.500
Unless you have been living under a rock for the past three days,

7
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:24.950
you've probably heard that the special council Robert Muller Guy,

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.360
that president Trump keeps accusing of being engaged in a witch hunt.

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.880
He has handed down some indictments.

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.910
The defendants allegedly conducted what they call information warfare against

11
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:39.570
the United States. They say the Russians were right here in the u s too.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.640
<v 1>The indictment says the Russians tried to create chaos going so far as to travel</v>

13
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.610
to the states.

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.750
<v 2>The Russians allegedly sent operatives to America traveling throughout nine</v>

15
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:50.310
states.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.491
<v 0>No.</v>

17
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.550
The picture that you get from the indictment is that there was this sort of like

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.080
shadowy network of Russian nationals that had infiltrated the country with the

19
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.340
idea of sowing chaos in the run up to the 2016 election.

20
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.830
And we just sort of wondered very simply like who are these Russians and who are

21
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.830
these Americans that were manipulated? How did it, how did it work,

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.320
how do they feel about things now?

23
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.040
So what we decided to do for this podcast just cause we were curious and just

24
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.393
cause you know,

25
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.360
it's fun for a podcast like ours to try and do fast turnaround stuff.

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.330
On occasion we decided to see what we could find out.

27
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.420
Producer Simon Adler takes it from here.

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.653
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.570
<v 2>sure. Hey Charles, are you there? Hey, how are you doing Simon?</v>

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.450
I'm doing all right. Little sleepy, but other than that I'm good.

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.400
So not too long ago,

32
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.020
I got in touch with this radio producer reporter based in Moscow by the name of

33
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.070
Charles mains. Do you want to do video? Just say hello? Uh, yeah,

34
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.880
that'd be great. Uh, I'm in a cert of my pajamas, but yeah, that's fine.

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
[inaudible] it was like three in the morning, New York time. But, but anyways,

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.750
um, the reason I got in touch with him with to have him help facilitate and

37
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:08.450
interpret an interview with this guy. Hi, my name is [inaudible].

38
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.000
Um, I am from Russia. I forgot about St, uh, St Spetters book. I'm so, I'm a,

39
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.070
I'm very bad speak English. Oh No, don't worry about it. That's why I went,

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.350
that's what you got Charles for. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, thank you. A chalice.

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.810
I'm translating. Okay, great. Uh, yeah, sure. Let's just start with like,

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.610
where are you from originally?

43
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:29.250
I'm just curious like a little bit about who you are.

44
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.600
[inaudible] the Vitaly, the spell of,

45
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.750
I mean he's a kid from a small town in Siberia.

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.930
[inaudible] small town near Kazakhstan and he said from an early age, uh,

47
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.170
it was clear that he just really didn't fit in up there cause they'll upset with

48
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.280
[inaudible]. He had blue hair for a time dressed like a goth

49
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.590
[inaudible] to be this kind of alternative character in Siberia is an easy

50
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.520
thing. I mean,

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.520
he would tell these stories about walking down the street and I'm fooling. Yeah,

52
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.830
I get that. Don't know. It's kind of tough guys with short haircuts.

53
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.590
They're calling him faggot. Oh it just showed that Dah Dah, Dah. You just

54
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.340
[inaudible]. And so when he gets a chance to get out, he does,

55
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
he moves to St Petersburg, considered one of the most liberal cities in Russia.

56
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.340
And he moved there not looking for just any job but specifically to be a

57
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.020
journalist cause that is [inaudible], which he really felt was his calling.

58
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.913
So bill here,

59
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.510
Bethlehem refers to journalists as like superheroes or Batman

60
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.570
<v 4>know. So he heads the St Petersburg and he thinks he's all set up.</v>

61
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:42.620
He's got a job with a local website. He's going to do some editing for them.

62
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:46.490
Maybe a little writing, but right away with w within short order,

63
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:47.400
I believe the story is he,

64
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.780
our business dried up and so did the newspaper and suddenly the tally is out of

65
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.670
the job. Well [inaudible] so and so, it's kind of a crisis moment,

66
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.020
uh, multiple choice, a tough.

67
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.800
So he starts looking around and he's, as he describes it, he gets up every day,

68
00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:06.170
starts sending out all these resumes,

69
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.260
[inaudible] scholars call this call doing searches.

70
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.610
Just find anybody to who will do anything that would let him use his writing

71
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:17.120
skills. Just trying to find something to do with text. Until finally,

72
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:18.830
after almost a month of this,

73
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.810
he comes across this one ad that it's not really clear what they're offering or

74
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:25.520
who's offering it, but, uh,

75
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.610
it mentions that there's some copy editing to be done,

76
00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:33.080
some writing and uh, the pay scale seems a lot higher.

77
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.570
It's if they're promising double the money that, uh, most people, uh,

78
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.260
are offered for, for working in journalism in Russia.

79
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.410
[inaudible] right away he just thought this was just weird, but you know,

80
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.610
of course he's interested, um, how could he not be? And so he places a call

81
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.880
<v 2>now it's worth noting everything that is about to happen in fatality.</v>

82
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.920
We weren't able to fact check 100%, but that being said,

83
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.630
it does line up squarely with what others have reported. So anyway,

84
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.110
fast forward a couple of days he ends up having an interview and they offer him

85
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.150
the job, which he accepts,

86
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.630
although I'll still not really knowing what the heck it is he will be doing.

87
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.260
Exactly. It's just not really clear what it, what it is. Okay.

88
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.300
So tell me about that first day like a let the younger class [inaudible] goes

89
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.850
in. You described initially just going into the, to the entering into the foyer,

90
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:23.230
the building into the entrance.

91
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.140
The building itself is cement four stories tall and the security is,

92
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.380
is oddly strict. Like when he went up to them,

93
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:36.450
they required him to hand over a bunch of documents like his passport, uh,

94
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.500
just to get in. That's his first impression. [inaudible]

95
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
potentially his boss shows up. This woman named Ana,

96
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.220
she walks him down the halls and he said the whole place had liked the feel of a

97
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.054
hospital.

98
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.100
[inaudible] long corridors with little rooms to the left and right people

99
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:58.670
behind, um, keyboards working on computers. And it's almost completely silent

100
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.730
except for the tapping of fingers on keys. Anyway,

101
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.090
eventually they, they duck into a room on, uh, shows him his desk.

102
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.390
And this is finally when he gets a sense of what exactly is going on.

103
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.350
Honest sits them down and says, we're doing news about Ukraine. Um,

104
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.510
we just want you to write articles. It was 20 articles a day.

105
00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:24.710
He had to do sort of massage the text for.

106
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.380
But the thing is these didn't have to be brand new articles. Um,

107
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.390
but instead he was told essentially take this article that's already been

108
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.140
written,

109
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.460
somebody else's article and add to it and then change the content.

110
00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:40.360
So it's 70% original. So what's important to know here is, uh,

111
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.600
this was 2014 and uh,

112
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.470
<v 5>praying within the early days of the civil war,</v>

113
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.360
the apocalyptic scene in central Kiev tonight, this morning, key f again,

114
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.220
a work to the sound of gunfire,

115
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.190
a civil war that Russia wanted to influence the outcome of and to do so they

116
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:07.610
started experimenting with this new form of propaganda. That's right.

117
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.450
<v 6>What you saw was this campaign that was going on two fronts with on the one hand</v>

118
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:15.080
you had state media, you know,

119
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.490
the sort of pro government media here being broadcast from Russia, uh,

120
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.540
into Ukraine, uh, spinning the narrative for those watching.

121
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.180
But then you have certain amount of the population that perhaps doesn't watch

122
00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:26.014
state media.

123
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.650
And this is where you get into this effort to kind of plug the holes in this

124
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:31.060
story, uh, online,

125
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.790
<v 2>no, no. Is what Vitali had been hired to do. Just, you know,</v>

126
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.360
to steal that story. So the [inaudible], you know,

127
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.130
they told him to take an article that was about Ukraine.

128
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.110
For example, according to fatale,

129
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.730
there was an incident in which a group of pro-Russian rebels had taken over his

130
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.180
school in Ukraine, essentially holding the kids hostage.

131
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.380
And when the pro Ukrainian soldiers, when they, when they stormed the school,

132
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.480
children died. [inaudible].

133
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.710
Now this actually happened and was covered by the Ukrainian media,

134
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.000
but ana, as I recall her name is Ana Vitaly. His boss says like, look,

135
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.630
your goal is to take this real news story and rewrite it,

136
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.690
leaving out the fact that there were ever any pro Russian troops there creating

137
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:26.870
the impression that the pro Ukrainian troops had stormed the school and

138
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:31.820
massacred these children for no reason at all. Uh, [inaudible].

139
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.750
And so once he had be written this article and made these small changes

140
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.620
[inaudible] site, now horse photographer would create a website with a dot.

141
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.970
UAA address. This is a Ukraine address,

142
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.130
a site that looked like a local online Ukrainian newspaper,

143
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.000
extensively written by Ukrainians for Ukrainian audience.

144
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.950
So he's being asked to write about Ukraine as if he was writing from Ukraine.

145
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.950
Yes, exactly.

146
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v 4>Exactly.</v>

147
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.960
We'll explain premium [inaudible] and Tali the way he describes it while he's

148
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.920
working on this newspapers, uh, involving events in Ukraine,

149
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.900
pretending to be Ukrainian journalists.

150
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.730
He's citing blogs that are written extensively by Ukrainians and he's pretty

151
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:16.470
sure that blogger is upstairs in the next level up inside this building in St

152
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:18.810
Petersburg. So it's a feedback loop.

153
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.140
<v 7>We'll end. Uh,</v>

154
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.420
so I'm presuming on day one you've shown up there, uh,

155
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.980
with these high minded journalistic ideals and you have to realize that you've

156
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.530
gotten yourself into something that, uh,

157
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.550
in no way lives up to those ideals.

158
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.970
How on earth did that feel? Camilo [inaudible]

159
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.620
<v 5>oh, it's mutual. And solicit to solicit a counsel,</v>

160
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.210
<v 4>go to [inaudible].</v>

161
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.730
This is where it gets this really important moment where he's trying to decide

162
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:54.300
what to do. And he says to himself that he had kind of two thoughts, which is,

163
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.650
you know, I a, you get out of there and never come back.

164
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.320
Or B, you do go back and find out more what,

165
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:04.020
what's going on there and it gets this idea that, you know what,

166
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.080
maybe I've got a scoop here, maybe I can do an investigation.

167
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.120
He sort of assigned himself to be kind of an undercover agent. Exactly.

168
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.270
<v 8>Uh,</v>

169
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.180
<v 5>okay. Uh, just to, to zoom out here for a second,</v>

170
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.100
the job that fatale had taken was with an organization known as the Internet

171
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:25.850
research agency and then called the Internet research agency, Church Agency,

172
00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:29.150
Internet research agency, shadowy Russian organization,

173
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:32.420
which we've heard so much about in these past 72 hours.

174
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.450
It's a private company established in 2013 by a Putin ally named Yevgeny per

175
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:39.170
goes in. Yep. Guinea pigs version.

176
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.370
A Russian businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin who along with being the

177
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:47.840
bearer of a rather strange nickname chef to President Vladimir Putin,

178
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:51.630
but he's also one of the Russian nationals mentioned in the Muller indictment.

179
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.720
Now in the early days when Vitali was working there, uh,

180
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.000
it was his impression that there were roughly a couple hundred people working at

181
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:03.650
the Internet research agency. But at its peak, the organization grew to,

182
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.300
uh, to employ as many as a thousand people with an annual budget of millions of

183
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.160
dollars headed by a management group and arranged into departments including

184
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.620
graphics, search engine optimization,

185
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.780
information technology and finance departments. Now, as the Tali told us,

186
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.490
it was hard to know exactly what happened in this place because everyone was so

187
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:29.990
siloed. But over his time there, he was able to make sense of some of it.

188
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.100
The first floor was filled with people just like fatale writing fake articles

189
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:36.030
for fake sites. Second floor,

190
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.440
it was known as the Social Media Department and these folks were responsible for

191
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:43.070
pumping out liens like one where Hillary Clinton is shaking hands with the

192
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:46.070
devil. The third floor was filled with people writing fake blogs,

193
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.440
the same blogs that Vitaly would pull quotes from.

194
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.090
And on the fourth floor you'd find the youtube and Facebook commenting trolls

195
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.220
along

196
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v 2>with the cafeteria.</v>

197
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.480
<v 4>[inaudible] you couldn't, one [inaudible] once was a 24 seven operation.</v>

198
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.343
They never,

199
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.060
they never stopped making news and they never spot stopped generating content.

200
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.530
Well, and who are your coworkers? It's dumb old

201
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.680
[inaudible] were quite a few people from other towns of Russia that moved to St

202
00:12:16.681 --> 00:12:19.380
Petersburg. There were some people who said, we're frankly, you know,

203
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.220
activists in the opposition, but there are a lot of people that you know, like,

204
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.290
you know, they check in, they check out for work.

205
00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:27.420
They just punched the clock and a, you know,

206
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:30.270
for them it was just like mopping the floor or you know,

207
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.380
or taking out the trash.

208
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.180
Did you feel some guilt or misgivings about what you were doing?

209
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.400
A [inaudible] glass

210
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.880
[inaudible] he describes being really stressed out during this whole period

211
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.980
[inaudible] cause while he was, you know, on the one hand,

212
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:51.981
I suppose he's gathering good material for what will hopefully be some grand

213
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.330
exposited they told right. On the other hand,

214
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.580
he just felt like he was just living this lie.

215
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.080
<v 2>Eventually after three and a half months, Vitaly did quit. And as he tells it,</v>

216
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.520
he had enough. And just didn't feel like he could learn anything else.

217
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.770
And so with his months of research,

218
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.870
he went on to write an article in Russia that really didn't make a splash at all

219
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.430
in part because the Internet research agency was already a pretty well known

220
00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.650
organization in Russia at that time. Uh,

221
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.030
essentially other journalists had just beaten him to the punch. But then

222
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.020
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

223
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.490
<v 2>in the wake of the 2016 election with accusations of Russian meddling beginning</v>

224
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.230
to [inaudible]

225
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.680
<v 10>tonight,</v>

226
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.680
a look inside Russia's disinformation campaign from 26 year old Vitale best

227
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.210
Bella,

228
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.020
<v 2>the American media took notice and Fatali got a call from NBC.</v>

229
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.160
<v 10>Is this it? This is the building. Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.</v>

230
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.160
The troll factory. Yes.

231
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.920
<v 2>Purest. And a pink sweater on, uh,</v>

232
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.960
Vitaly answered questions for this brief evening news segment.

233
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.200
<v 9>Did you create fake accounts? Yes. He says, oh,</v>

234
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.100
so you believe that this operation was backed by the Kremlin of subtle?

235
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.770
Absolutely. He says [inaudible] also believes it's still up and running.

236
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.650
<v 10>The Kremlin denies it, suggesting reports the factory even existed.</v>

237
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:14.790
My feet fate,

238
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.770
<v 4>NBC, NBC at the bully. Uh, and from that moment on, he really did</v>

239
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.350
<v 2>became the Goto guy.</v>

240
00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:25.730
If you wanted to talk to somebody who had worked inside journalists from all

241
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.460
over the world, started reaching out to him.

242
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.500
<v 4>[inaudible] asking for interviews or comments. Keep in mind,</v>

243
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.610
<v 2>these are all international journalists, none of them Russian until one day.</v>

244
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.830
Not long after all.

245
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:37.960
<v 4>Yeah. So,</v>

246
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.340
so he gets a call from this national tilt television channels saying basically

247
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:43.174
in, in an hour,

248
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.050
we're gonna run a story about you and we really want you to come on our talk

249
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:51.340
show, no bullying [inaudible] and he said, look, I'm busy. I'm working,

250
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.010
you know, you know, I can't

251
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.130
<v 6>do it. And so, you know, they run right.</v>

252
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.490
<v 2>This piece, I'm going to ask you to</v>

253
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.280
[inaudible] cogs in this TV studio on this set that looked like a cross between

254
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.790
sort of the family feud and an evening news broadcast.

255
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.650
The Trump are the hosts just start kicking Vitaly of heart and flashing images

256
00:15:11.971 --> 00:15:14.280
of him on this giant screen behind them.

257
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.220
What they've got is they kind of mind his online persona.

258
00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:24.840
They've got him hanging out in a, in a, in a club,

259
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.770
making funny faces with the camera version of

260
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.960
sub chat, start kind of digging through his political views,

261
00:15:33.961 --> 00:15:36.930
the fact that he's a supporter of the liberal opposition

262
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.580
[inaudible] you know, and, and they just, you know,

263
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:46.110
make them out to be this kind of freak and they're all laughing at him and you

264
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:49.200
know, he's, it's just a, it's just an absolute public flogging,

265
00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:52.260
a total public humiliation. Wow. Um,

266
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.790
well he got caught in his own little misinformation, uh,

267
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.900
loop there at the end. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

268
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.563
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.240
<v 6>yeah. Look, the</v>

270
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.920
[inaudible] [inaudible] what's interesting is Batali, you know,

271
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.490
the way he describes it is that, you know, in some ways when he was there,

272
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.100
it was, they were just trying to figure out the mechanisms.

273
00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:27.720
It was getting more sophisticated.

274
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.000
And as he's leaving his time is ending at the Internet research agency.

275
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.170
He says that there was just about this time and he started seeing these posts,

276
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.160
uh, for vacancies, um, in other languages,

277
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.970
<v 5>including English.</v>

278
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.050
<v 6>Well, those 2000 [inaudible].</v>

279
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.290
So in a way he is for him.

280
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:53.800
It's this moment where he sees the troll farm,

281
00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:56.590
the troll factory suddenly turning outward.

282
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.950
<v 2>Well now three years later, uh, we know a bit more about [inaudible]</v>

283
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.510
<v 5>this English initiative. In 2014,</v>

284
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.670
the company established a translator project focused on the United States.

285
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.570
And July of 2016 more than 80 employees were assigned to the translator project.

286
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.930
And many of those employees apparently took some of the moves from there,

287
00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:29.931
Ukraine Info war playbook and use the pointed them at the u s the Russians also

288
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:35.931
recruited and paid real Americans to engage in political activities from Ho

289
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.270
political campaigns and stage political rallies.

290
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.190
The defendants and their co-conspirators pretended to be grassroots activists.

291
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.650
In fact, I spoke to one reporter who told me about this incident in Houston, uh,

292
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.220
when there were two protests

293
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.710
<v 2>happening at the same time on one side of the street,</v>

294
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.470
a white nationalist protest and on the other,

295
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.190
a group of Americans for Muslims turns out both protests are covertly organized

296
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:04.800
by Russians connected to the Internet research agency.

297
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.270
According to the indictment,

298
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.750
the Americans did not know or they were communicating with Russians.

299
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.620
<v 5>And it was this phrase,</v>

300
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.700
I would have all of the ludicrous revelations of the indictment that really got

301
00:18:17.871 --> 00:18:21.050
us thinking. Who were these unknowing Americans?

302
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.430
How did they end up at the fake protests and how do they think about it now?

303
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.530
So, producer, any Macewan and I, uh,

304
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.800
we started calling around and we found three people at the center of one of the

305
00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:37.520
more famous fake protests, uh, mentioned in the indictment,

306
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.250
the so-called Florida flashmob.

307
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.730
We'll hear all about that after the break. This is Radiolab.

308
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:46.923
Will continue in a moment.

309
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.750
Hi there. This is Keirsten recording from Orlando, Florida.

314
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:17.280
So after those indictments came down against the three Russian companies and 13

315
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.340
Russian nationals, uh, who were accused of, you know,

316
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:24.120
creating fake protest across the country. Our producers,

317
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.320
Simon Adler and Annie Mcewen got interested to try and locate some people who

318
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:33.321
had gone to these protests and maybe unwittingly took part in what was a covert

319
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:37.110
Russian operation and they managed to find three people.

320
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.650
<v 12>All right. You can hear me? Yes, I can hear you fine. First up,</v>

321
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.310
a woman named Ann Marie, Margaret Thomas, who lives in Florida.

322
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:47.190
I live in Jupiter, Florida currently and is in her 50s.

323
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:49.590
She works as a real estate agent and also,

324
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.290
<v 13>oh, Shannon. Hi. Long to see you.</v>

325
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.090
[inaudible]

326
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.280
<v 12>the singer. Wow. Beautiful. She's also a huge Trump fan,</v>

327
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.700
very active on Twitter. And in early August,

328
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.050
2016 she was contacted first on Twitter, then over the phone by two guys,

329
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.010
<v 13>Joshua and Matt, UCLA students. They said they were, they were, um,</v>

330
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.830
working with Hollywood producers,

331
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.980
<v 12>Matt and Josh. And these are two people from Hollywood.</v>

332
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.160
<v 13>He's a film school, right? I don't know.</v>

333
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.290
They didn't give me that much information,

334
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.530
<v 12>but on the phone and thought Joshua's voice sounded familiar.</v>

335
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.140
<v 13>I better not, I shouldn't say who I think it is.</v>

336
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.230
<v 12>Who did you think it was? Come on just, yeah, I'm really curious.</v>

337
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.820
Who Do I think it is? John Christopher. Who's that? Who's John? Christopher.

338
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.600
<v 13>Yeah, he's really, his stage name is Johnny</v>

339
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.473
<v 14>[inaudible]. Huh?</v>

340
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.483
<v 12>Johnny.</v>

341
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.770
<v 13>Wait, this is Yani. The like orchestra new age piano. God Guy.</v>

342
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:54.761
Yeah. Yeah.

343
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:58.000
But I think she's just guessing like there is no actual evidence linking Yani to

344
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:02.490
any of this. What was the organization they were working with? Uh, they, they,

345
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.440
this was the march for Trump group and they were a grassroots organization

346
00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:10.700
started in the United States, Texas and California.

347
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.930
<v 12>What did they ask you or what did they say when they contacted you?</v>

348
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.090
<v 13>Well, they were,</v>

349
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:19.090
they said they were wanting to do rallies at a Hollywood people wanted to hire,

350
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.190
they actually want to hire three actors, one to play trunk,

351
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.920
one to play Bill Clinton and one

352
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.640
<v 12>by Hillary. Interesting.</v>

353
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.900
They basically told her that they want her to do this like performance art,

354
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.310
theater protest type thing.

355
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.350
Now at the same time she was talking to these guys on the other side of Palm

356
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.070
Beach County,

357
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.000
<v 15>Mary Lauren. I'm retired. I'm active on Twitter to a point.</v>

358
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.490
<v 12>Another Trump fan guy by the name of Harry Miller,</v>

359
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.570
who had a pretty big following,

360
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.040
<v 15>the 70,000 someone in there, but</v>

361
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.500
<v 12>he also got contacted on Twitter and over the phone</v>

362
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.550
<v 15>there was a conversation about and desire to put on a, uh,</v>

363
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.680
something like a flash mob or something and supporting Donald Trump.

364
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.540
<v 12>Sorry, who was it that contacted you?</v>

365
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.200
<v 15>Uh, I believe his name is Matt.</v>

366
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.460
<v 12>What, what did Matt say in his original sort of communication?</v>

367
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.950
<v 15>This is extremely paraphrase because I don't have a distinct memory of all of</v>

368
00:22:09.951 --> 00:22:10.700
it.

369
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.700
And initially I was very suspect of him and the reason I was suspect is because

370
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.510
he had a, uh, a strong action.

371
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.800
And at the time there was a lot of commotion about Muslims and I thought he was

372
00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:30.530
some who Islam of some kind. I was trying to set something up. And

373
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.920
<v 12>what did his voice sound like?</v>

374
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.130
<v 15>It wasn't like deal, you know, or an American, you know, with articulate.</v>

375
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.410
It was, it was broken.

376
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.570
<v 12>Well, and so he, he said he wanted a flash mob. And what did he,</v>

377
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.760
what did he say he wanted you to do?

378
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.940
<v 15>He was asking me about making a trailer with a jail type of thing on it.</v>

379
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.960
<v 12>Essentially the guy with the accent told him,</v>

380
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.800
I want you to stage an event where you have a cage and you're going to need to

381
00:22:57.801 --> 00:22:58.700
build this cage,

382
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.420
but you're going to have this cage and at the event there will be a Hillary

383
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.840
Clinton impersonator and a Bill Clinton impersonator and I want you to put them

384
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.920
in the cage like you're putting them in jail and you should do this outside so

385
00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:12.410
that lots of people can see you and they can chant, lock her up,

386
00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:15.560
lock her up and you should take lots of photos and lots of videos and you should

387
00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:16.430
send them to us.

388
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.520
<v 15>And I did eventually say yes because he had an elaborate wedge butt site and he</v>

389
00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:23.510
told me it was part of a big group of people.

390
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.360
<v 12>What did you remember the name of the website</v>

391
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.610
<v 15>being patriotic. It's dismantled according to the FBI. No.</v>

392
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.190
In fact I tried to pull it off. I can't get it either.

393
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.250
What was odd is they insisted on paying me.

394
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.020
<v 12>How did they end up paying for it?</v>

395
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.070
<v 15>They sent me to a check cashing place.</v>

396
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.140
<v 7>And how much money was it?</v>

397
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.760
<v 15>I found an estimate and I had written an estimate around $505 for it.</v>

398
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.490
But it did come from out of the country. I do do recall that.

399
00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.990
<v 7>Can you describe what this, uh, once the construction was complete?</v>

400
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.790
What your truck looked like?

401
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.270
<v 15>Yeah, I, I, I have an s three 50 Ford pickup truck.</v>

402
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.780
Big Truck. Yeah.

403
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.860
And I built a chain link fence,

404
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.660
three sides and then one side with a gate. Yeah. No, no, no. Four corners.

405
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.210
I had American flags of course.

406
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.910
<v 7>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.910
<v 15>And there was a lot of talk about who was going to go in the cage and he and,</v>

408
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.640
and he says, oh well we'll hire some actors. No one would play Trump.

409
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.470
No one would pay him.

410
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.290
<v 12>And says the two quote UCLA guys suggested that she play Hilary.</v>

411
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.450
And she agreed

412
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.890
<v 15>and I made the costume.</v>

413
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.990
I made the talking from a nursing outfit and on the back of that inmate.

414
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.800
So I went to the Hollywood master and I bought a full head mask of Hillary.

415
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.090
<v 7>And so what were like, you're told to,</v>

416
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.350
what were you told like show up at this place at this time? At this date,

417
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.360
and you just did it.

418
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.610
<v 15>I don't know if you know in Palm Beach,</v>

419
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:03.760
but it was sitting plays for in front of cheesecake factories where this

420
00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:04.430
happened.

421
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.330
<v 12>Harry was told to show up August 20th 1:00 PM. It's at the cheesecake factory.</v>

422
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.710
That's where this was going to go down.

423
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.400
<v 15>Boy, that was another thing. I kept asking him, are you going to be there?</v>

424
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.900
Who's going to wear out? Who's going to run this? But where do I go? Oh No,

425
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.230
you just go to some place.

426
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.620
<v 12>So he shows up in front of the cheesecake factory with his truck,</v>

427
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.310
with a big cage. He'd built on the back and sure enough, there were people there

428
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:32.810
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

429
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.290
<v 7>including an [inaudible]. That was Hillary Clinton. We were given a script.</v>

430
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.750
What was, what were your lines, do you remember?

431
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.310
<v 13>Okay, have you been, see, let me see. Well we were,</v>

432
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.030
I was supposed to talk about, um, my computer,

433
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:48.410
tablet and my email

434
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.460
and then I was persist. Um, tell some jokes.

435
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.760
<v 12>She was there with her very good friend Greg,</v>

436
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.040
who she convinced to be the Bill Clinton impersonator

437
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.270
<v 16>yeah. At short and needed new money at the time. So</v>

438
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.060
<v 7>what did you do, Greg, to get, to prepare to play the part of, uh,</v>

439
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.193
of Bill Clinton?

440
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.850
<v 16>I had the shave shave.</v>

441
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.670
<v 7>Do you normally have like a mustache or something?</v>

442
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.560
<v 16>I shave once back in the 70s,</v>

443
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.950
and I shaved again with when Jerry Garcia died and then I shaved when I had

444
00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:22.750
played Bill Clinton.

445
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.520
<v 7>Wait, you should, you've shaved like three times in your life. That's bad.</v>

446
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.710
How did it feel to be in this cage along with Anne and be like this sort of

447
00:26:32.861 --> 00:26:35.530
strange actor in this moving play?

448
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.280
<v 16>Uh,</v>

449
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.280
well first off it was hot and I was getting dark pollution and it was August and

450
00:26:42.371 --> 00:26:43.204
it's Florida,

451
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.260
it's like 94 degrees and all I could think of was on one hand a beer.

452
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.740
<v 13>Okay. That makes sense. I'm just wanting to be over.</v>

453
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.330
So you didn't have very much fun. Yeah,

454
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.990
<v 16>no, it wasn't a whole lot of fun. Yeah, it would just work.</v>

455
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.020
<v 12>Right. It was Annie having fun.</v>

456
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.360
<v 16>Well, yeah, I guess she was.</v>

457
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.200
<v 13>Bill was supposed to find a lady is that wouldn't be in it like standing around</v>

458
00:27:11.201 --> 00:27:12.760
like a news lady and trying to

459
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.000
<v 15>flirt with her. Hey Bill, don't look now,</v>

460
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:19.770
but I just seen Monica in jail. She was in the same apartment

461
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.370
<v 13>and they sat in the carried for a while.</v>

462
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.550
<v 12>What you see in the Facebook live video is a few dozen people in the parking lot</v>

463
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.910
outside the cheesecake factory and they're just standing around the cage with

464
00:27:30.911 --> 00:27:34.030
Annie and side of it who is pretending to be sad about being locked up.

465
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.400
<v 15>She was put a good actress, you know,</v>

466
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.850
she's just exasperated and all that.

467
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.890
We spent a day doing that, took a lot of pictures,

468
00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:46.724
had a good time.

469
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.910
<v 12>Pictures of course, ended up on social media and according to Harry,</v>

470
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.770
<v 13>that thing on the Twitter and got over 500,000 hits in 24 hours.</v>

471
00:27:54.771 --> 00:27:55.604
You know,

472
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.580
<v 7>you're aware that much of the much of the mainstream media at the moment is</v>

473
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:02.280
reporting that, that this was a Russian,

474
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.180
like how does it make you feel that there's now this possibility that you were,

475
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.690
<v 13>oh yeah, the FBI cam came here and talked to me about it.</v>

476
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.630
Okay. When did, when did you speak with the FBI? Oh, they came to my house?

477
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.600
Yeah. How long ago? Last week. What did they ask you? Well,

478
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.310
they discussed with me pretty much what you were discussing with me,

479
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.280
but not in as much depth as you did.

480
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.850
Maybe the young guy was kind of an unexperienced.

481
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.250
He was tutored and Christian Bale too.

482
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.303
[inaudible] guy.

483
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.780
<v 12>We reach out to the FBI. They responded with no comment.</v>

484
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.140
<v 7>Are you concerned that you may be part like that?</v>

485
00:28:42.141 --> 00:28:46.310
You may have been used as a puppet by people in St Petersburg?

486
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.580
<v 13>No, I wasn't using the puppet.</v>

487
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.880
<v 7>Yeah, but would you have done it,</v>

488
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:52.830
had they not reached out to you in the first place?

489
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.280
<v 13>Well, I wanted to help Trump,</v>

490
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.520
<v 7>but this is a situation where our own federal government is telling you that a,</v>

491
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:03.300
that this is essentially becoming an interstate conflict where Russia

492
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.670
intentionally, uh, manipulated people. Do you find that troubling?

493
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.510
<v 13>Well, we're not all that stupid.</v>

494
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.430
Harry Miller and me and his wife and veterans. No,

495
00:29:15.431 --> 00:29:16.900
we're not that stupid. You know,

496
00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:21.010
this whole thing has been investigated and I'm like known as the unwitting real

497
00:29:21.011 --> 00:29:21.844
American.

498
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.060
<v 12>So she's referring to a word that attorney general Rod Rosenstein used in the</v>

499
00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:29.240
press conference screen. Now these indictments, he said that these Russians,

500
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.060
<v 7>they established social media pages and groups to communicate with unwitting</v>

501
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.163
Americans

502
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.270
<v 13>and wedding.</v>

503
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.260
I W I'm the one whose idea was to put the date of Bengazi you on the prison

504
00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:45.670
uniform. I'm waiting and I'm not a Russian. I'm an American.

505
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.310
And I decided that I didn't want to vote for Hillary.

506
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.700
<v 7>Yeah. And I guess I'm not saying you're stupid at all. Like, well,</v>

507
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.720
I think what's interesting here is I don't think you or Greg north or Harry

508
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:57.140
Miller,

509
00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.770
I think that you all had really good intentions that you believed in this man

510
00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:01.970
and you wanted to go ahead and support him.

511
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.560
And I think what gets complicated here now is we find out that even though you

512
00:30:06.561 --> 00:30:09.490
supported this man, and maybe in the end of the day, you, you,

513
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:10.640
you helped him win,

514
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.940
that there was some nefarious work going on behind the scenes that led you to do

515
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:19.460
this. And I, I would have complicated feelings about that.

516
00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:21.680
And I'm just trying to figure out if you do or don't.

517
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.980
<v 13>No, because I did not believe that it'd be the case for the people that I dealt</v>

518
00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:28.290
with. I did not think it was a Russian movement.

519
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.100
<v 7>I've got an article up here in front of me and in the indictment, uh,</v>

520
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.340
they refer to Matt Schemer who is, I think the,

521
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:41.130
the Hollywood man that you talk to. They refer to him as, uh, an [inaudible].

522
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.010
<v 13>He's from Texas and he went to UCLA. He was involved to a certain point.</v>

523
00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:47.690
And then he said he was going home.

524
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.221
<v 7>Yeah. I'm,</v>

525
00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:51.390
I'm looking at a document right here saying that Matt skipper is an Adventist

526
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.040
person.

527
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.370
<v 13>I, well, maybe that's an invented name, but I,</v>

528
00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.670
he was a young guy as e a family. Like what he said, he was like,

529
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.680
maybe he did give me a bogus name,

530
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.010
<v 7>but you don't believe he was working for Russia?</v>

531
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.060
<v 13>Well, I don't know because they see lied about his name. Who knows? Yes.</v>

532
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.500
What he told me, he said his name was Matt and he was using it. And the,

533
00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.370
the email that I had was this Josh, um,

534
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.513
Josh Milton.

535
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.810
<v 7>Um, I, I'll let you know that, um, Josh Milton,</v>

536
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:28.210
they're saying is also a made up person.

537
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.530
<v 13>No, but I'm might be wrong, but I'm not always,</v>

538
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.640
I'm not usually wrong.

539
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.930
<v 15>I think it's hilarious. I really do.</v>

540
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.920
Because that obviously what happened from what I gather from this

541
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.330
is I was the one dealing with the Russian Trump.

542
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.910
How about that one?

543
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.030
<v 12>What do you, what do you think about that? How does it make you feel?</v>

544
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.980
<v 15>Here's your tickets, Shelly, because you know, I, you know, I,</v>

545
00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.320
I don't think I'm stupid,

546
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:03.820
but I don't see I real motive here on how this could change any votes.

547
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.680
And they're claiming it disrupted the, uh, the election.

548
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.720
Uh, where does this interfere with our elections? I don't know.

549
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:19.540
I don't know how that could be. I really met again, had they nice contacts me.

550
00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:22.420
I never in my whole life been up there. I'm going to page on that.

551
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.230
<v 12>Hold on, Walker up here.</v>

552
00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:28.380
He says he understands that look invisible men on the other end of the phone

553
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.310
seem to want,

554
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:33.090
was he create a visual stunt one that they could then take on the road.

555
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.590
<v 15>They wanted me to go to a New York.</v>

556
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.010
<v 12>Oh, they did. They wanted you to bring the cage to New York.</v>

557
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.010
<v 15>Yeah, I told him I wanted to watch some adverse that</v>

558
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.200
<v 7>and the whole thing to him was it,</v>

559
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.900
it just didn't matter if it were Russians or not, but to, and from Greg,

560
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.370
the guy who played Bill Clinton,

561
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.980
he thinks about the whole thing very differently.

562
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.740
<v 16>Um, well, um,</v>

563
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.540
and I known that I was working for the Russians.

564
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.860
I would have asked for a lot more money.

565
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.773
<v 7>Okay.</v>

566
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.850
<v 16>But I have never felt good about the thing because I might've had a little bit</v>

567
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.140
of influence on sound from being elected.

568
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.170
And I think that was a mistake for America.

569
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.830
And he doesn't feel that way, but I do.

570
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.480
<v 7>So is is the feeling almost assertive guilt?</v>

571
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.970
<v 16>Um, I'm not, I don't feel open.</v>

572
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:39.030
I was being paid to do a job and I did the job and I did the job as to the best

573
00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.900
of my ability. And people told me that I did the job well.

574
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.250
<v 7>Okay. Well, so how does it feel to know that you were third of use?</v>

575
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.840
<v 16>I find a little irritating. Nobody likes to be used [inaudible]</v>

576
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.060
<v 7>irritating to me feels like a bit of a mild word for how I might feel.</v>

577
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.263
<v 16>Well,</v>

578
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.410
<v 14>okay.</v>

579
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.980
<v 16>I don't know. I'm thinking that this might be played on the radio,</v>

580
00:34:01.981 --> 00:34:06.390
so I can't really use the words that I would like to use. Uh,

581
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.060
man, I'm pissed as shit.

582
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:17.801
<v 7>Well,</v>

583
00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:21.040
and it sounds like you and Anne have very different interpretations of whether

584
00:34:21.041 --> 00:34:24.400
Russia was involved or not. Uh, does that get between your relationship?

585
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.430
<v 16>Well, let's see.</v>

586
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.053
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

587
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.500
<v 16>do I love nanny? Yes, I do</v>

588
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.773
<v 7>it very much.</v>

589
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.230
<v 16>Um, do we see eye to eye on everything? No, we don't. Um,</v>

590
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.870
<v 7>we all do crazy things for love. Even dress up like Bill Clinton,</v>

591
00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:43.140
shave our beards and go in a prison cage.

592
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.400
<v 16>Oh, I've done crazier things than that, but I feel duped</v>

593
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.670
as American, not by the Russians,

594
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.680
but by my fellow Americans.

595
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.020
The Russians can't come here and vote. We voted the way we wanted to vote.

596
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.900
I don't know if I'm making any sense from that.

597
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.590
<v 7>Yeah, it sounds a little bit like you're saying that, uh,</v>

598
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.950
what's frustrating is the fact that, uh,

599
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.920
it wasn't actually Russia that started the fire.

600
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:17.830
They were just blowing on it and maybe making it a little worse.

601
00:35:17.831 --> 00:35:22.720
But the truly disheartening thing is the fact that the fire was ignited here

602
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.550
without Russia.

603
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.360
<v 16>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what I'm trying to say. I mean,</v>

604
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.400
I can't, I can't, I like that.

605
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.820
I can't talk about this anymore. Call back sometime.

606
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:53.860
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

607
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.290
<v 16>excellent. I got something to say about everything. I'm old, man.</v>

608
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.770
<v 17>Okay, well we'll make use of it.</v>

609
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.950
<v 16>All right, Greg. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, man. Bye. Bye. Bye now.</v>
