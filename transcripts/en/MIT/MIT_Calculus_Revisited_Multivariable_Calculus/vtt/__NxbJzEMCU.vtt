00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.030
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.330
Our lesson today, hopefully,
will serve two purposes.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.070
On the one hand, we will
give a nice application

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.940
of the chain rule.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.020
Now that we've had
two units devoted

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.610
to working with
the chain rule, I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400
thought you might
enjoy seeing how

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.690
it's used in places
which aren't quite that

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.850
obvious-- places that we
wouldn't expect to be used,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.520
at least.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.040
And secondly, I
would like to pick

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
as my application
one which comes up

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.520
in many, many
different contexts.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.580
And without further ado, the
topic I want to cover today

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.889
is called "Integrals
Involving Parameters".

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:06.430
Now, that sounds
like a big mouthful.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.860
Let me motivate that for you,
first of all, physically,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.440
and then in term of a couple
of geometric examples.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.220
You all know from
past experience

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.090
my great ability with
physical applications,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.050
so I won't even try to find
anything profound here.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.750
Let me just take a
pseudo-example, pointing out

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.190
what type of situation
we're trying to deal with

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.040
and leaving it to
your own backgrounds

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.380
to see places where the same
principle could have been

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.660
applied, but hopefully in a
more practical, meaningful way

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.400
for you.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730
Imagine for example,
that we have

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.830
a platform that we're looking
along in the x direction.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.320
And we've punched holes
in this platform, say,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.480
and liquid is trickling
through these various holes.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.360
The holes are all on a
horizontal line this way.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.130
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.920
to focus our attention
on a particular particle

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.510
of the liquid, and we're
going to watch it as it falls.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.720
And what we would
like to do is find

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.090
how far that particle fell,
say, during the first second

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.520
of its flight.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.750
Obviously, from a
calculus point of view,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.160
the first thing we have to do is
know what the velocity function

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.880
is, because ultimately, we would
like to integrate the velocity.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.340
Now, notice that we
would expect the velocity

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.770
to be depending on time.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.420
If this were a freely
falling situation,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.980
we'd expect the usual
gravitational type situation.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.010
Or, whatever the
situation happened to be,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.540
we would expect on the
one hand that the velocity

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.970
does depend on of time.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.030
On the other hand, because of
how the streams are flowing--

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.720
in other words, we
don't know what's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.100
happening above here
that's causing the water

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.710
to shoot out-- we don't know
what the initial velocity

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.060
is coming out of each of
these holes in the sense

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.800
that a different
opening may give rise

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.010
to a different velocity
of stream coming out.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.590
All I'm trying to
bring out here is

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.230
that as we try to
focus our attention

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.280
on a particular opening,
we find that the velocity

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.380
of the particle that will follow
it during that first second

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.460
is a function both of its
position x-- in other words,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.180
x sub 0 in this case, because
we're focusing at x equals x_0

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
and the time t as
t goes from 0 to 1.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.470
And we then simply
integrate along

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.040
the vertical direction here.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.960
We find y as a function of x_0
from 0 to 1-- v of x_0, t, dt.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.545
Once we're through
integrating, you

00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:31.380
see-- notice that
the integration

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.610
is with respect to t.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.930
So when we're
through integrating,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.450
this being a definite
integral, t no longer appears.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.160
We have a function of
x_0 alone, saying nothing

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.860
more than the distance
that the particle falls

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.280
during the first
second is a function

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.610
of the position of the
opening along the line here.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.320
Now, at any rate, the
practical application

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.280
is not so much writing
down this equation

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.690
as the inverse is the case.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020
Namely, in many
practical applications,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.280
we are given this
particular integral.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.100
And for some reason
or other, want

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.190
to determine what v itself is.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.250
In other words, we often want
to find the derivative given

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.200
the integral.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.190
All right.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.649
Let's just let it go at
that for the time being.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.670
The important point is
that I want you to see

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.530
an example of an integral.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.530
Let me just write this
here in more abstract form.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.680
It appears to be a
definite integral, a to b.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.990
The function inside
the integrand

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.990
is apparently a function of
two variables, x and y-- say,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.650
in this case x_0 and t.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.730
One of the variables is a
variable of integration--

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.960
in this case, y-- and
the other variable

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.640
is being treated as a constant.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.980
And that's where the
word parameter comes in.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.120
x is a parameter, meaning a
variable constant, in the sense

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.370
that, for this
particular problem,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.040
x is chosen to be in some
domain and remains fixed.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.490
In other words, this
is some function

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.970
of x when we're
all through here.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.640
All right?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.300
As a geometric example, imagine
the following situation.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.030
We have a surface
w equals f of x, y.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.310
We take the plane x equals
x_0 and intersect this surface

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.150
with that particular plane.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.770
We get a curve, you see.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.380
Now, we look at that
curve corresponding

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.450
to two points, P and Q,
where P and Q are determined

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.640
by the y values a and b.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.990
In other words, P
corresponds to y equals a.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.100
Q corresponds to y equals b.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.600
And now, a very natural
question that might come up

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.050
is that we would
like to find the area

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.510
of this particular plane
region, in other words, the area

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.985
of this slice between P and Q.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.600
Now, you know, the first thing
I hope that you'll notice

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.350
is that because this
shape of the surface

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.930
can be in many different
ways, the particular cross

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.690
section that we get does
depend on the choice of x_0.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.240
Different slices--
different planes x equal x_0

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.520
will give us different
curves of intersection.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.560
The point is that once we have
the curve intersection-- see,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.730
x is being treated
as the parameter--

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.130
this particular curve is
given by what equation?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.780
f is a function of x_0 and y.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.730
See, x equals x_0 for
every point on this curve.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.610
And so the area of the region
R is the integral from a

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.420
to b, f of x_0, y, dy.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.190
And the question that
very often comes up

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.040
is, how do you find the
derivative of A sub R

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.830
with respect to x_0,
noticing, you see,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.560
that A sub R is a
function of x_0 alone,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.220
the y dropping out
between the limits a and b

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.270
when we perform the
operation of integration.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.640
A third place that this
type of situation occurs

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.100
is in solving certain
differential equations.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.010
For example, suppose we're
given a particular curve

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.710
and that that curve determines
a region R between the lines

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.820
x equal a and x equal b.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.650
Suppose all we know
about the curve

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.170
is its slope at any point.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.770
We know that its
slope at any point

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.860
is given by dy/dx, or
some function of x and y,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.417
which we don't necessarily
have to go into right now.

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:09.250
And let's suppose, for
the sake of argument,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.060
that we solve this first-order
differential equation.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.050
What we'll find,
if we're lucky, is

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.840
that y is some function of
x and an arbitrary constant.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.090
Remember, once you have one
solution to a differential

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.610
equation, you have
an infinite family

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.430
in terms of a one-parameter
solution to a differential

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.370
equation.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.210
In other words, in finding
the area of the region

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.950
R in this case,
there are many curves

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.770
that satisfy this particular
differential equation.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.980
Until we know what
specific points are

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.510
being referred to over here, the
best we know for sure is what?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.750
That these endpoints
are a and b,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.490
that the integrand
is f of x comma c,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.130
and we're integrating that
with respect to x from a to b.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.150
I Freudianly put a
c in here, because I

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.690
think what I was
trying to emphasize

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.740
for you is that when
you look at this thing,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.870
observe that this integral
is a function of c alone.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.822
Namely, when you
integrate this thing,

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.280
you integrate it
with respect to x.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.120
The x drops out.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.740
All you have left here is a c.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.489
A sub R, then, is
a function of c.

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:13.030
And in many cases,
what we would like

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.320
to do is see how fast the area
changes as a function of c.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.910
In other words, how
do we change the area

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.740
as a function of changing
the arbitrary constant c?

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.410
And I have enough exercises
in the assignment to give you

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.950
concrete drill on this.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.670
All I'm trying to give
you here is an overview

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.762
of the entire topic.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.720
And the reason I want to
give you this overview

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.049
is that it's hinted
at in the textbook,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.940
but this topic is
not covered there.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.809
In fact, the reason
that I had you

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.047
read that particular section of
the textbook before the lecture

00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:45.630
this time-- you
notice that usually we

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.700
start with the lecture.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.460
This time I had you
read the textbook first,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.920
because the way the
textbook covered

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.080
this topic is
essentially nothing

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.180
more than the way we
tackled a different problem

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.040
last semester.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.430
And I want you to see that the
problem done in the Thomas text

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.380
is not a new problem-- it's
one that we've done before--

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.170
but that with the tools
that we now have available,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.740
we could've tackled a
more significant problem.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.670
And that's the one I'm
electing to do here

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.010
and what I want to show you the
key steps on, because they're

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.140
not in the text.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.230
But I will leave the
reinforcement for the exercise.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.580
At any rate, hopefully
now, when you

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.105
see an integral of this type,
it will not bother you too much.

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:27.480
In other words,
don't worry about

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.060
how do you integrate a function
of two independent variables?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.160
When you see
something like this,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.640
it means that there is some
implicitly implied domain

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.930
for x.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.800
In other words, we have
some function of x.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.180
Let's say the domain
of g might very well

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.380
be, say, all x's between
two values, say c and d.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.840
But who cares about
that right now?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.890
The important point
is that g is defined

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.410
on a certain set of values x.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.870
And what it says is to compute
the output of the g machine.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.743
For the given x, you fix that
x and integrate f of x comma y

00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:05.880
dy between a and b.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.250
Notice, you see,
during the integration,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.650
x is being treated
as a constant,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.430
so that for all
intents and purposes,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.680
this is an ordinary integral.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.780
But because x isn't a bona
fide constant, meaning what?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.900
It's a constant only in
the sense that once chosen,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.180
it remains fixed for this
particular integration.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.030
Different values of x will give
me different integrals here.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.910
And consequently, a very
natural question that comes up

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.710
is how does my function
g-- which depends on x--

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.130
how does that vary as x varies?

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.160
In other words, the key
question is simply this.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.220
First of all, given g
defined this way, one,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.120
does g prime even exist?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.260
Does dg/dx exist?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.982
And two, if it does
exist, what is it?

00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:53.940
In other words, the
question that we're raising

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.990
is, if we can find
g prime of x, how

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.440
do we do it in terms of
looking at the right-hand side?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.900
And let me not try to
guess the answer here.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.304
The answer does turn out to be,
in this particular case, one

00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:07.470
that you might have guessed.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.500
But I prefer to show you that we
don't have to guess, point one.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.610
Point two, if you do guess,
you won't always be that lucky.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.680
That's my finale
for today's lecture.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.140
But let me see if I can survive
to get to the finale first.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.510
Let me see how we'll
tackle a problem like this.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.220
First of all, to see if g
prime exists at some value x_0,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.600
what we have to do is-- way
back to the very beginning

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.370
of Part 1-- the
same old definition

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.930
for an ordinary derivative.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.780
We have to compute the
limit of g of x sub 0 plus h

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.610
minus g of x sub
0 over h, taking

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.880
the limit as h approaches 0.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.960
Notice what the
g machine does...

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.230
What the g machine does is
it feeds x into the integrand

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.960
here and integrates this with
respect to y from a to b.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.670
So if the input of my g
machine is x_0 plus h, that

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.680
means that the x is replaced by
x_0 plus h here. g of x_0 plus

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.140
h is simply integral from a to
b f of x_0 plus h comma y dy.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.700
Similarly, g of x_0 is integral
from a to b f of x_0, y, dy.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.080
I now want to form
this difference.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.430
And noticing-- again,
this is all calculus

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.630
of a single variable--
that the difference of two

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.560
definite integrals is
the definite integral

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.670
of the difference,
I can conclude

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.820
that g of x_0 plus
h minus g of x_0

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.990
is simply this single
integral over here.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.900
Now, my next step in
determining g prime of x_0

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.030
is I must divide this by h.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:44.370
Notice, by the way, that h is
an arbitrary increment, but once

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.240
chosen, remains fixed.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.940
Notice that h is
a constant as far

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.880
as this integration
is concerned.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.560
Consequently, to
divide by h, it is

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.990
permissible to bring the
h inside the integrand.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.820
In other words, technically
speaking, the h should be here,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.750
but since h is a constant
with respect to y,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.000
the integral can have
the h brought in.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.080
Why do I want to
bring the h in here?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.910
Let me again telegraph
what I'm leading up to.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.610
Obviously, when I'm
going to compute g prime,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.340
my next step is to
take the limit of this

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.000
as h approaches 0.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.380
With h in here, I
look at this and what

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.860
I hope is that by
this amount of time,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.620
at least the following
minimum amount of material

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.960
has rubbed off on you
in a second nature way:

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.560
that if I look at this
expression in brackets

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.820
as h approaches 0,
this is precisely

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.740
the definition of what we
mean by the partial of f

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.600
of x, y with respect to
x evaluated at (x_0, y).

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.460
See, this is what?

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.500
The change in f-- see,
y is held constant.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.110
We're taking this over a
change from x_0 to x_0 plus h

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.150
and dividing by h.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.760
This is a partial of
f with respect to x.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.900
That's why I want to
bring the h inside.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.330
So now, I say, OK, g prime
of x_0, by definition,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.540
is this limit.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.255
I now want to take the
limit of this expression.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.420
And by the way, notice
what I'd love to do now

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.870
is to jump right in
here and say, aha,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.285
this is just the partial
of f with respect

00:14:18.285 --> 00:14:21.310
to x evaluated at (x_0, y_0).

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.250
But the thing I would like
you to notice-- and again,

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.030
going back to Part 1 of our
course, one of the big things

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.865
that we talked about, under the
heading of uniform convergence,

00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:32.890
that it is a very
dangerous thing in general

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.190
to interchange the order
of limit and integration.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.110
This says what?

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.580
First perform the integration,
and then take the limit.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.860
What we would like to be able
to do is first take the limit

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.030
and then integrate the result.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.500
Now, we did see that, provided
the integrand was continuous,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.330
these operations
were permissible.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.150
But we'll talk about
that a little later.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.540
For the time being,
let's simply summarize

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.160
by saying if the limit operation
and the integration operation

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.631
can be interchanged, then
the derivative-- see,

00:15:06.631 --> 00:15:07.630
this thing here is what?

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.480
This is my g of x
The derivative of g

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.640
of x with respect
to x has the very

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.080
delightful form that,
essentially, all I have to do

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.370
is take the
derivative operation,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.860
come inside the
integrand, and replace

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.140
the derivative with respect
to x by the partial derivative

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.380
with respect to x.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.860
In other words, the derivative
of the integral from a

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.720
to b, f of x, y, dy
is the integral from a

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.360
to b, the partial
of f with respect

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.140
to x dy-- provided, of
course, that the limit

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.510
and the integration
are interchangeable.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.860
In particular, this
will be true if f and f

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.120
sub x exist and are continuous.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.240
And to straighten out
the range and the domain

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.830
and what have you
once and for all,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.860
notice that y is allowed
to exist between a and b.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.900
We've said that x
is going to exist

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.040
on some domain between c and d.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.920
Notice that saying
that y is between a

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.050
and b and x is between
c and d geometrically

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.570
says that f is defined
on a rectangle.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.320
See?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.970
OK.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.860
And then what we're saying
is, under these conditions,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.860
to integrate an integral
with a parameter,

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.740
with respect to that
parameter, all we have to do

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.180
is come inside the integral
sign and differentiate-- take

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.260
the partial derivative--
with respect

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.190
to what is being used
as the parameter.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.519
In this case, it's x,
which is the parameter.

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:30.560
Now, the only danger with
this particular thing--

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.500
and by the way, notice,
not only is there a danger

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.791
here that I'm going to mention.

00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:36.000
The danger is this looks
so easy, you may be saying,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.250
why did he do it the hard way?

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.050
Why didn't he just tell us this
was the right way of doing it?

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.850
And the point is it just happens
to be one of those coincidences

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.980
where the rigorous way
yields a logical answer which

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.065
is consistent with what is
probably our intuitive guess.

00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:52.940
But it's not always
going to happen that way.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.720
And the example that
I have in mind now

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.690
goes back to what we were
talking about the beginning

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.315
of the lecture.

00:16:57.315 --> 00:17:00.360
Namely, I wanted to give you an
application of the chain rule.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.810
And here's where that
application comes in.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.130
I now call this-- I don't
know what to call it.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.540
So let's just call it variable
limits of integration.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.200
Same problem as before--
it's going to cause the chain

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.540
rule to come in now.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.430
The only difference
is going to be--

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.680
and that's just a forewarning.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.366
You don't have to
know that right now.

00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:19.240
I'm going to have the
same problem as before.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.130
What did I have before?

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.180
I had that g(x) of
x was integral f

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.050
of x, y, dy between the
two constants a and b.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.240
Now, I'm going to let my
constants of integration

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.240
also depend on the parameter.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.070
See, all the constants
of integration

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:39.540
have to be are constants
as far as y is concerned.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.870
What I'm saying is what
makes this problem differ

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.810
from the previous one is suppose
that it happens that instead

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.550
of being given a nice
rectangle to play around with,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.520
I'm given a couple of curves
like this in the xy-plane.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.360
See, this would be a of x.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.860
This would be y equals b of x.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.210
See, what I'm saying now is
that not only does the integrand

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.360
depend on what
value of x I pick,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.070
but the limits of
integration as I'm

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.180
finding a cross-sectional
area of a surface, you see.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.480
The limits of the
integral themselves

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.810
depend on the choice
of x-- constant,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.820
as far as y is concerned,
but depend on x.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.070
You see, now, what happens
is that my parameter appears

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.670
in the limits as well as
just in the integrand.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.720
And now, you see, also
what this means is

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.890
if I try the previous
approach of computing g of x

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.650
plus delta x, et
cetera, I'm in trouble,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.600
because the only way I
can combine two integrals

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.530
and put them under
the same integral sign

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.470
is if they're between the
same limits of integration.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.580
Notice here, for
example, that if I

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.270
replace x by x plus delta x, I
not only change the integrand,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.590
but notice that the
limits become what?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:54.740
a of x plus delta x, b of x plus
delta x, and those in general,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.420
unless a and b happen to be
constants, will vary with x.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.180
In fact, let's look
at it this way.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.000
This is the problem we should
have started with in the sense

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.620
that constant limits
of integration

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.640
are a special case of this.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.260
At any rate, what
I wanted to show

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.000
you was that this
particular problem

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.390
can be handled very nicely
in terms of the chain rule.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.560
Namely, what we do here is we
observe that, first of all,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.510
y is not really a variable here.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.310
It's integrated out.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.210
So what we think
of is: let's think

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.330
of x as being some variable u.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.710
Let's think of b of x as
being some variable v. Let's

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.910
write down the function of
three independent variables u,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.590
v, and x.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.840
OK.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.240
What will that function be?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.100
Let u, v, and x be arbitrary,
independent variables.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.460
Look at the integral from
u to v, f of x, y, dy.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.210
This is obviously
dependent upon u.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.780
It's dependent upon v.
And it's dependent upon x.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.025
The place that the chain
rule comes in is that

00:19:55.025 --> 00:19:58.560
in our particular problem,
u and v cannot be arbitrary,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.660
but rather u must be that
particular function a of x,

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.030
and v must be the
particular function b of x.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.480
Consequently g of
x is simply what?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.720
It's h of u, v, x, where u
is a of x and v is b of x.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.860
Consequently, to
find g prime of x,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.360
what we want is h prime
of x, and to find h prime

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.240
as a function of x.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.410
See the chain rule here?

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.540
u can be expressed
in terms of x.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.430
v can be expressed
in terms of x.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.180
Obviously, x is already
expressed in terms of x.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.380
So this is really implicitly
a function of x alone.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.030
So by the chain rule, what
I'd like to be able to do

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.460
is to combine these three
pieces of information to find h

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.227
prime of x.

00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:39.810
And remember how the
chain rule works.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.518
Now, I'm not going to
beat that to death.

00:20:41.518 --> 00:20:42.970
We've just had
two units on that.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.290
Let's just say it
rather quickly.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.840
g prime of x is the
partial of h with respect

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.855
to u times u prime of
x plus the partial of h

00:20:51.855 --> 00:20:53.630
with respectively
to v times v prime

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.860
of x times the partial
of h with respect

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.790
to x times x prime of x,
which, of course, is just 1.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.730
In other words,
writing this thing out,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.730
g prime of x is simply this.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.870
What is the partial of
h with respect to u?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.590
Let's come back here for a
second and remember what h is.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.790
h is this integral.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.610
I want to take the partial
of that with respect to u.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.950
That means I have
to investigate this.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.450
Now, here's the
interesting point.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.840
Whereas u, v, and x are
independent variables,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.680
what does it mean when
you say you're taking

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.350
the partial with respect to u?

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.650
It means that you're treating
v and x as constants.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.620
Now, if v and x are being
treated as constants,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.530
what I have is simply what?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.340
I'm taking a
derivative with respect

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.960
to a variable, where the only
place the variable appears

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.369
is as the lower limit
of the integrand.

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:50.160
In other words, I claim
that that's nothing

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.400
more than minus f of x comma u.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.400
That I go inside the
integrand-- in other words,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.270
I differentiate the
integral-- that leaves me

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.930
just the integrand--
and replace the variable

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.544
by the variable of
integration u here.

00:22:06.544 --> 00:22:08.960
And because it's the lower
limit, I put in the minus sign.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.280
Now, why did I go
through that very fast?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.840
That's why I had you read
this assignment first.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.490
Notice that the
assignment in the textbook

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.580
does not touch what
I'm talking about,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.510
but rather seems to review
that topic that we covered

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.590
under Part 1--
that if you wanted

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.490
to take an ordinary
derivative with respect

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.920
to u, integral from
u to a, g of y dy,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.950
the answer would
just be minus g of u.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.770
And that's exactly
what I did in here.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.200
I treated v and x
as constants here.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.100
In other words, the only
variable in here was u.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.380
That will be emphasized
again in the exercises.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.350
In a similar way, the partial
of h with respect to v

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.920
means this thing.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.020
Notice now that u is being
treated as a constant.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.070
x is being treated
as a constant.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.360
To differentiate
this, my variable

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.410
appears only as an upper
limit on the integrand.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.110
That means I come inside
the integral sign,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.680
replace the integral by
just the function itself,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.110
replacing what?

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.620
The variable by the
limit of-- replacing

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.740
y-- that's the only
variables of integration--

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.150
by the upper limit v.
In other words, this

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.030
is f of x comma v. All right?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.310
And finally, the partial
of h with respect to x

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.970
is this integral here.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.470
Notice now that u and v are
being treated as constants.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.160
With u and v being
treated as constants,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.130
that's the special case that
we started our lecture with,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.630
namely, to differentiate with
respect to a parameter when

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.360
the parameter appears only
as part of the integrand.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.420
So how do we do that?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.900
We come inside.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.770
This is the integral
from u to v,

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.050
the partial of f with
respect to x, dy.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.130
Putting the whole thing
together-- recalling,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.760
among other things, that
du/dx, since u is a of x,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.140
is just a prime of x,
and that dv/dx is b prime

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.774
of x-- what this
says-- and again,

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:04.940
I want you to see the beauty
of the chain rule here,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.720
because at least to
my way of thinking,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.240
I don't see anything at all
intuitive about the result I'm

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.480
going to show you.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.790
And that is, as soon as you
make the limits of integration

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.840
variable, to differentiate
an integral involving

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.654
a parameter-- you see, again,
what's the parameter here? x.

00:24:22.654 --> 00:24:24.070
We integrate it
with respect to y.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.550
This is a constant as
far as y is concerned.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.560
See, intuitively,
you might say, gee,

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.330
all you've got to do is
take the derivative sign,

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.420
bring it inside, and this
should be the answer.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.920
See, it's the same
as we did before.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.590
The point is-- and this is
where many serious mistakes are

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.010
made in problems involving
integrals of this type--

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.480
is that the reason that
our intuitive way happened

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.580
to be right in the simpler
case was that these were

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.890
constants with respect to x.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.930
Now, they're variables.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.810
Well, it turns out, if you
just wrote this thing down,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.900
you would be wrong.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.510
What is the correction factor?

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.380
Again, come back to here.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.820
The correction
factor is this here,

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.030
which we've just
started to compute.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.140
Again, just saying it-- if
you wrote this term down

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.180
to get the correct answer, you
would have to tack on what?

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.810
b prime of x times
f of x comma b of x.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.270
That means what?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.790
You think of a y
as being over here.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.685
For the particular value of
x, you replace y by b of x.

00:25:24.685 --> 00:25:26.255
In other words,
you look at f of x

00:25:26.255 --> 00:25:29.130
comma y, and every place you
see a y, replace it by b of x.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.350
And then subtract
that from that a prime

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.910
of x times f of x comma a of x.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.740
Now again, I suspect
that, for many of you,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.800
it's the first time that
you've seen something

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.380
like this, because I
say, it's a topic which

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.190
I believe was a natural one
to occur in the textbook,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.830
but for some reason it
doesn't appear there.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.950
Because of the importance
of the concept,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.670
the number of times it appears
in physical applications,

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.710
the number of times that
one has to differentiate

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.680
with respect to an
integral-- I don't

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.160
know the physical applications
well enough to lecture on them,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.260
but it does occur in probability
theory, among other places,

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.790
it appears in any subject
involving integral equations

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.310
and the like-- that
I wanted to give you

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.460
the experience of seeing
what the concept means,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.960
to have you hear me say it.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.850
And then I will
spend the exercises

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.132
trying to drive home the
computational know-how so

00:26:24.132 --> 00:26:26.940
that you will be able to
do these things, at least

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.280
in a mechanical
way, independently

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.540
of whether the theory made
that much sense because

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.595
of the lack of physical
example motivation

00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:36.410
other than what I
did at the beginning.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.042
At any rate, keep
in mind, though,

00:26:38.042 --> 00:26:40.000
that in terms of our
present topic, where we're

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
talking about the
chain rule, this

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.520
is a certainly noble application
to show an important place

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.560
in the physical world where
knowledge of the chain rule

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.340
plays a very important role.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.220
And with that, I might just as
well conclude today's lecture.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.990
And until next time, good bye.
