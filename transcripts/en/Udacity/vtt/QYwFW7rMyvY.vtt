00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.470
The specifics, such as the computational power,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.740
the memory capacity, and the number and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.610
types of input, output of devices, may vary from one manifestation of a computer

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.219
system, to the next. For example, commensurate

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.880
with it's intended use, a cell phone

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.095
or a pda may have very limited

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:25.420
input/output capabilities such as a graphics display,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.010
speakers and microphones. But on the other hand, a high end supercomputer

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.460
used for running large scale scientific applications may employ thousands

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.550
of CPUs, incorporate several terabytes of memory and be connected

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.560
an array of disks with storage capacities on the order of several parabytes.
