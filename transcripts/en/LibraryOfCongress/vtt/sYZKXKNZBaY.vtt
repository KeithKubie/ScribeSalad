00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt;VOICEOVER: From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:21.170
[MUSIC]

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.130
&gt;&gt;EDDIE: One of the favorite
pieces that I learned while I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.600
was studying piano from a
braille score that I got from

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.000
the library was of Debussy's
"Clair de Lune."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
[MUSIC]

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.100
&gt;&gt;MARY: The other part of the
music services that I like is I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
can always just download
something if I didn't get around

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.500
to ordering it yet.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.130
&gt;&gt;YASMIN: I got a keyboard
several years ago as a birthday

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.400
present, and I said, "Well, how
will I play it?" So I said, "I

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.900
will call the library and find
out if they have any lessons."

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.200
So I got a few of them. I got a
good sense of what the keys were

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.570
doing and how I had to play.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.370
&gt;&gt;JOY: I was looking at BARD
this morning, and there are all

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.800
kinds of books out there to get
me back into theory, and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.600
augmented chords, and major and
minor, and all of these

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.470
wonderful things.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.900
[MUSIC]

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.270
&gt;&gt;MARY: Most of the major pieces
that I've sung are available

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.900
through NLS. So being able to,
you know, call up or look in the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.070
catalogue and see what is
available and what I would have

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.030
to supplement has been really
important.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.270
&gt;&gt;EDDIE: I, personally, have
borrowed materials ranging from

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.000
Beethoven to some more modern
composers.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.670
&gt;&gt;MARY: Being able to actually
read what the composer intended

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.470
really gives you the freedom as
an artist to then give your own

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.600
interpretation to that piece of
music. So I really think that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.630
the Music Section is one of the
best resources that NLS has.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.070
