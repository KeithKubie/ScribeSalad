00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.970
Remember that time a rocket was struck by
lightning in flight?

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.380
You probably don’t.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.570
So I’m gonna tell you about it!

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.230
Hey everyone!

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.090
Amy here with you on DNews today and we’re
doing this fun thing for DNews’ fourth birthday.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.919
We’re all updating our first episode!

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:27.390
… so yeah, mine was a recap of Apollo 11…
and there’s not much new on Apollo 11 because,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.279
well, history… so can’t really revisit
it.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.899
But you could say that Apollo 12 revisited
Apollo 11 by returning to the Moon, and it

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.190
was actually a pretty electrifying mission…

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.170
As the second lunar landing mission, Apollo
12 was tasked with doing a little more than

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.710
just getting to the Moon.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.270
One of the goals was for the crew to make
a pinpoint landing on the Moon’s Ocean of

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.000
Storms so Pete Conrad and Al Bean could walk
over and recover pieces of the Surveyor 3

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.320
probe that had landed almost three years earlier.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.410
And they nailed it!

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
The scoop from Surveyor 3 was recovered and
is on display at the visitor’s centre at

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.649
JPL in Pasadena.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.280
But they almost didn’t bring it back.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.790
In fact, they almost didn't make it to the
Moon at all…

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.910
The morning of Friday, November 14, 1969,
was a very cloudy one at the Kennedy Space

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.560
Centre, but nonetheless the Saturn V rocket’s
launch was perfect.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.970
Then, 37 seconds after leaving the launchpad,
the crew saw a flash and felt a shudder.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.890
At the same time, their headsets filled with
static and all the displays in the command

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.220
module and mission control suddenly displayed
gibberish.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.210
Then came the warning lights and alarms.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.770
It looked like the spacecraft’s power system
was so badly damaged it was running on batteries,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.500
which meant the crew was in a dying spacecraft
that had been forcibly separated from the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.380
rocket by the launch abort system.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.920
They’d be coming straight home; they wouldn’t
even go into orbit.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.810
But the crew hadn’t felt the jolt of a launch
abort, and they could still feel the steady

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.360
acceleration of the rocket, so contrary to
their gibberish data they instinctively knew

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.130
they were still riding a functioning Saturn
V.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.560
On the ground, meanwhile, observers knew exactly
what was going on.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.210
They saw not one but TWO lightning strikes
ride the rocket’s contrail all the way down

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.390
to strike near the launch pad.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.740
Flying through the clouds, the Saturn V had
become a lightning rod, generating electricity

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.740
by friction.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.069
But this didn’t help NASA flight controllers
fix the fact that they’d lost all data from

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.300
Apollo 12.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.870
One guy did know how to fix the problem though,
a 24-year-old engineer named John Aaron.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.370
He’d seen the same gibberish data pattern
during a test when a controller dropped the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.560
simulated spacecraft’s power below normal
levels.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.370
The low power had upset the signal conditioning
equipment, a box of electronics that translates

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.129
information from sensors into data on displays,
so that's why all the displayed data went

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.150
haywire but didn’t disappear.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.760
And he’d learned from that test that the
SCE would be tripped up by low voltage in

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.409
the normal setting, but in the auxiliary setting
could work in a low voltage situation.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.700
And so he passed on the command to fight director
Gerry Griffin: Try SCE to Aux.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.269
And Griffin had no idea what he was talking
about.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.159
Neither did the cap com Gerry Carr.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.900
And the crew didn’t get it either!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.281
When they got the call to turn “SCE to auxiliary,”
Pete Conrad’s reaction was “what the hell

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.281
is that!?"

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:05.719
But Al Bean somehow knew where the switch
was, flipped it, and alllllllll the data come

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.719
back beautifully.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.930
The crew laughed about it all the way into
orbit, and went on to fly a successful mission.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.790
So what did NASA do to stop another lightning
strike giving everyone involved in a launch

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.790
a heart attack?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.650
Well, because lightning struck the Saturn
V in flight they couldn’t exactly ground

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.889
it; and besides, Apollo 12’s launch really
just proved that the Saturn V was a hearty

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:24.889
machine!

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.110
But the agency did include lightning protection
for its next generation spacecraft, the space

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.989
shuttle, on the launch pad.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.510
A mast was installed on top of the service
structure so any lightning was diverted down

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.510
wires and away from the spacecraft.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.739
Because, really, you can’t do anything about
a rocket turning into a lightning rod but

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.219
not launch through a storm.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.779
You just gotta build rockets that have failsafes
to stop a lightning rod situation from turning

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:48.989
disastrous.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.010
Apollo 12 was the mission of deep space porn,
questionable tuna, and possible hypnosis to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.500
prevent cursing on the Moon!

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.439
I've got LOADS of Apollo 12 videos over on
my channel, Vintage Space, some come learn

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.439
about some weird with me!
