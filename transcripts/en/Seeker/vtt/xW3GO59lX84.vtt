What color were dinosaurs? When did animals
start being different colors at all?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.900

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm Anthony Carboni, this is DNews, and color
is a crazy useful tool for animal survival.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.339
Some are colored to blend into their environment.
Some venomous animals like snakes use bright

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:24.279
colors for the opposite reason- to specifically
say 'here I am, do not screw with me,' which

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.710
is called aposematism, from the latin for
badass. Colors can mean anything from 'yo,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.370
I am ready to mate' to 'hey, man, I'm a different
species than you, I'm not in competition with

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.290
you.' But when did all that start?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.500
Most animal coloring comes from melanosomes,
these organelles inside of cells that make

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.680
melanin- which gives color and also protects
from the sun. In a study published in Nature,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.530
scientists have been able to recover some
melanosomes from fossils of dinosaur feathers,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.690
and they found similarities to living animals
that allowed them to make some inferences-

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.990
which is fancy talk for "man, we have no idea
what millions of years and fossilization did

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.030
to these melanosomes, but here are some thoughts."

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.860
Anchiornis was black, white, and gray with
a red crest on its head.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.400
Sinosauropteryx seemed to be orange with a
striped tail. It looks like Archeopteryx was

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.280
all black.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.310
So how'd that red and orange get there- when
did all these animals start us on the road

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.360
to the multicolored animal insanity we see
today? Well, it seems like genetic mutation

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.920
started color changes in a very small way-
and then something happened in the late Jurassic

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.390
period, specifically with a type of dinosaur
called maniraptors. All of a sudden, 140-something

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.960
million years ago, all kinds of different
melanosome shapes started appearing.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.600
All flying dinosaurs belong belong to the
maniraptor group- researchers say that sometime,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.630
right before the origin of flight, when dinosaur
feathers changed from these tiny fuzzy things

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.100
to the feather-shapes we recognize now, there
was a huge explosion in color variation.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.409
That's leading researchers to believe that
melanosome diversity is linked to big, physical

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.450
changes in an animal. Feather shape and metabolism
changes to let a dinosaur fly, and its color

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.320
changes along with it. That could mean color
isn't just about an animal's environment or

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.869
behavior, it's linked to what it's physically
made to do.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560
And since melanosomes similar to dinosaurs'
can be found in living animals, we might be

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.670
able to compare them and use them to find
out new information about the physical makeup

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.340
of dinosaurs. All this stuff is speculative
right now, but it's crazy interesting to think

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.340
about- color linked to function. Like video
game enemies.
