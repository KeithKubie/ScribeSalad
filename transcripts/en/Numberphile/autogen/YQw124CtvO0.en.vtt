00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
so hard you can roll some dice order you
know<00:03:23.120><c> use</c><00:03:23.810><c> other</c><00:03:23.989><c> methods</c><00:03:24.350><c> and</c><00:03:24.590><c> so</c><00:03:24.799><c> we</c><00:03:24.890><c> gave</c>

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
know use other methods and so we gave
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.890 align:start position:0%

some some big rant big random numbers
 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.539 align:start position:0%
some some big rant big random numbers
and<00:03:27.019><c> then</c><00:03:27.109><c> you</c><00:03:27.260><c> can</c><00:03:27.799><c> see</c><00:03:27.980><c> is</c><00:03:28.130><c> that</c><00:03:28.280><c> number</c>

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 align:start position:0%
and then you can see is that number
 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.030 align:start position:0%
and then you can see is that number

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's obviously not prime so if you can
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's obviously not prime so if you can
add<00:03:33.560><c> 1</c><00:03:33.769><c> to</c><00:03:33.920><c> it</c><00:03:33.950><c> and</c><00:03:34.190><c> take</c><00:03:34.310><c> that</c><00:03:34.430><c> numbers</c><00:03:34.760><c> Prime</c>

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 align:start position:0%
add 1 to it and take that numbers Prime
 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.340 align:start position:0%
add 1 to it and take that numbers Prime

which<00:03:36.620><c> I</c><00:03:36.709><c> don't</c><00:03:36.769><c> need</c><00:03:37.010><c> to</c><00:03:37.100><c> go</c><00:03:37.489><c> into</c><00:03:37.700><c> here</c><00:03:37.880><c> but</c>

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 align:start position:0%
which I don't need to go into here but
 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.970 align:start position:0%
which I don't need to go into here but
it's<00:03:38.269><c> easy</c><00:03:38.660><c> to</c><00:03:38.840><c> test</c><00:03:39.019><c> up</c><00:03:39.200><c> a</c><00:03:39.260><c> numbers</c><00:03:39.560><c> Prime</c><00:03:39.799><c> and</c>

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 align:start position:0%
it's easy to test up a numbers Prime and
 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.370 align:start position:0%
it's easy to test up a numbers Prime and
so<00:03:40.700><c> you</c><00:03:40.790><c> can</c><00:03:40.910><c> just</c><00:03:41.060><c> search</c><00:03:41.720><c> a</c><00:03:41.840><c> little</c><00:03:41.989><c> bit</c><00:03:42.109><c> and</c>

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 align:start position:0%
so you can just search a little bit and
 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.710 align:start position:0%
so you can just search a little bit and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
Prime's are actually quite common so it
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
Prime's are actually quite common so it

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 align:start position:0%
doesn't take much time to find out large

doesn't take much time to find out large
prime<00:03:46.489><c> number</c><00:03:46.760><c> and</c><00:03:46.910><c> then</c><00:03:47.269><c> you</c><00:03:47.359><c> got</c><00:03:47.480><c> your</c>
