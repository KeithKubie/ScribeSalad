just mention two agents choice is
 

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
just mention two agents choice is

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
doing in that case the contract is just
 

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
doing in that case the contract is just

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
written so that it says do this or then
 

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.970 align:start position:0%
written so that it says do this or then
you<00:10:40.089><c> don't</c><00:10:40.360><c> get</c><00:10:40.720><c> any</c><00:10:40.930><c> pay</c><00:10:41.199><c> or</c><00:10:41.470><c> do</c><00:10:41.620><c> you</c><00:10:41.680><c> get</c><00:10:41.829><c> to</c>

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980 align:start position:0%
you don't get any pay or do you get to
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
you don't get any pay or do you get to

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
punishment or something like that so
 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.809 align:start position:0%
punishment or something like that so
it's<00:10:43.779><c> a</c><00:10:43.899><c> and</c><00:10:44.410><c> then</c><00:10:44.680><c> because</c><00:10:45.100><c> the</c><00:10:45.310><c> agent</c>

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:45.819 align:start position:0%
it's a and then because the agent
 

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:49.100 align:start position:0%
it's a and then because the agent
typically<00:10:46.600><c> is</c><00:10:46.810><c> risk</c><00:10:47.079><c> averse</c><00:10:47.410><c> and</c><00:10:47.649><c> that's</c><00:10:47.829><c> a</c><00:10:48.130><c> I</c>

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110 align:start position:0%

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.180 align:start position:0%
didn't mention the risk aversion or yeah
 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
didn't mention the risk aversion or yeah
it's<00:10:52.389><c> a</c><00:10:52.569><c> preference</c><00:10:52.839><c> are</c><00:10:53.170><c> not</c><00:10:53.350><c> aligned</c><00:10:53.649><c> I</c>

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.350 align:start position:0%
because the agent is risk-averse and the

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:07.930 align:start position:0%
that's the core part of this principle
 

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's the core part of this principle
it<00:17:08.560><c> just</c><00:17:09.010><c> basically</c><00:17:09.280><c> says</c><00:17:09.760><c> nothing</c><00:17:10.209><c> about</c><00:17:10.329><c> the</c>

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:10.689 align:start position:0%
it just basically says nothing about the
 

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:13.939 align:start position:0%
it just basically says nothing about the

so the it is always sensitive to the
 

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:19.530 align:start position:0%
so the it is always sensitive to the

Milgram<00:18:37.789><c> and</c><00:18:37.970><c> I</c><00:18:38.059><c> looked</c><00:18:38.750><c> at</c><00:18:38.929><c> this</c><00:18:39.049><c> example</c><00:18:39.529><c> on</c>

00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:39.889 align:start position:0%
Milgram and I looked at this example on
 

00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:42.310 align:start position:0%
Milgram and I looked at this example on
row<00:18:40.070><c> and</c><00:18:40.399><c> by</c><00:18:40.879><c> the</c><00:18:40.940><c> way</c><00:18:41.149><c> this</c><00:18:41.419><c> I</c><00:18:41.720><c> should</c><00:18:42.169><c> say</c>

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.379 align:start position:0%

informativeness<00:18:43.159><c> exactly</c><00:18:43.850><c> explains</c><00:18:44.179><c> why</c>

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:44.389 align:start position:0%
informativeness exactly explains why
 

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.369 align:start position:0%
informativeness exactly explains why
this<00:18:44.450><c> is</c><00:18:44.779><c> the</c><00:18:44.899><c> case</c><00:18:45.460><c> because</c><00:18:46.460><c> the</c><00:18:46.879><c> the</c><00:18:47.690><c> model</c>

00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:48.379 align:start position:0%
this is the case because the the model
 

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
this is the case because the the model
the<00:18:48.830><c> tail</c><00:18:49.250><c> of</c><00:18:49.580><c> the</c><00:18:49.789><c> normal</c><00:18:50.539><c> distribution</c><00:18:50.659><c> is</c>

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
the tail of the normal distribution is
 

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.149 align:start position:0%
the tail of the normal distribution is
hugely<00:18:52.370><c> informative</c><00:18:53.120><c> and</c><00:18:53.559><c> so</c><00:18:54.559><c> this</c><00:18:54.830><c> model</c>

00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
hugely informative and so this model
 

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:57.310 align:start position:0%

because this worked it seemed to be
 

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:28.389 align:start position:0%
because this worked it seemed to be
right<00:19:25.490><c> I</c><00:19:25.929><c> mean</c><00:19:26.929><c> I</c><00:19:27.019><c> and</c><00:19:27.230><c> the</c><00:19:27.740><c> model</c><00:19:28.070><c> was</c><00:19:28.220><c> correct</c>

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
right I mean I and the model was correct
 

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
right I mean I and the model was correct
but<00:19:28.820><c> it</c><00:19:29.000><c> wasn't</c><00:19:29.360><c> giving</c><00:19:30.019><c> what</c><00:19:30.200><c> we</c><00:19:30.320><c> wanted</c><00:19:30.679><c> so</c><00:19:30.950><c> I</c>

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:31.870 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't giving what we wanted so I
 

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't giving what we wanted so I
I<00:19:32.870><c> invite</c><00:19:33.830><c> people</c><00:19:33.860><c> to</c><00:19:34.399><c> work</c><00:19:34.580><c> on</c><00:19:34.759><c> me</c><00:19:34.879><c> with</c><00:19:35.360><c> me</c>

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:35.570 align:start position:0%
I invite people to work on me with me
 

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:40.210 align:start position:0%
I invite people to work on me with me
and<00:19:35.840><c> we</c><00:19:36.730><c> this</c><00:19:37.730><c> was</c><00:19:38.470><c> you</c><00:19:39.470><c> talked</c><00:19:39.710><c> about</c><00:19:39.799><c> ten</c>

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.220 align:start position:0%
and we this was you talked about ten
 

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.669 align:start position:0%
and we this was you talked about ten
days<00:19:40.429><c> I</c><00:19:40.610><c> think</c><00:19:40.669><c> we</c><00:19:40.970><c> spent</c><00:19:41.809><c> about</c><00:19:42.110><c> the</c><00:19:42.169><c> week</c><00:19:42.440><c> or</c>

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
days I think we spent about the week or
 

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:45.700 align:start position:0%
days I think we spent about the week or
so<00:19:42.860><c> and</c><00:19:43.129><c> we</c><00:19:43.309><c> sort</c><00:19:43.730><c> of</c><00:19:43.850><c> figured</c><00:19:44.240><c> out</c><00:19:44.450><c> it</c><00:19:45.409><c> was</c><00:19:45.679><c> a</c>

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:45.710 align:start position:0%
so and we sort of figured out it was a
 

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
so and we sort of figured out it was a
simpler<00:19:46.190><c> problem</c><00:19:46.429><c> only</c><00:19:46.820><c> but</c><00:19:47.029><c> don't</c><00:19:47.240><c> worry</c>

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:48.450 align:start position:0%
simpler problem only but don't worry
 

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
simpler problem only but don't worry
I<00:19:48.480><c> think</c><00:19:49.320><c> actually</c><00:19:49.470><c> we</c><00:19:49.770><c> spent</c><00:19:50.040><c> three</c><00:19:50.220><c> hours</c>

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
I think actually we spent three hours
 

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.150 align:start position:0%
I think actually we spent three hours
but<00:19:51.320><c> yeah</c><00:19:52.320><c> so</c><00:19:53.010><c> a</c><00:19:53.510><c> very</c><00:19:54.510><c> simple</c><00:19:55.050><c> answer</c><00:19:55.290><c> the</c>

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah so a very simple answer the
 

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.330 align:start position:0%
but yeah so a very simple answer the
Lila<00:19:56.430><c> incentive</c><00:19:57.150><c> is</c><00:19:57.300><c> optimal</c><00:19:58.020><c> in</c><00:19:58.290><c> our</c><00:19:58.770><c> model</c>

00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
Lila incentive is optimal in our model
