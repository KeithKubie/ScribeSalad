00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.680
choice of what they colorize and what
they don't and if I had any problems

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:30.690
they don't and if I had any problems
 

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.020
they don't and if I had any problems
with the film there's two problems one

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.030
with the film there's two problems one
 

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.520
with the film there's two problems one
is the exact same problem with the first

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:34.530
is the exact same problem with the first
 

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.590
is the exact same problem with the first
film and that's the Twite story goes on

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600
film and that's the Twite story goes on
 

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.810
film and that's the Twite story goes on
too long which is so strange it's so

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820
too long which is so strange it's so
 

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.579
too long which is so strange it's so
strange that in both films that's a

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:40.589
strange that in both films that's a
 

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:42.380
strange that in both films that's a
problem and they're maybe cuz they're

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:42.390
problem and they're maybe cuz they're
 

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.600
problem and they're maybe cuz they're
both in the middle I don't know maybe I

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.610
both in the middle I don't know maybe I
 

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.950
both in the middle I don't know maybe I
just finally start to get a little tired

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:45.960
just finally start to get a little tired
 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.040
just finally start to get a little tired
but yeah that's in both films I'm always

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.050
but yeah that's in both films I'm always
 

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.140
but yeah that's in both films I'm always
like really a little bit my watch when

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.150
like really a little bit my watch when
 

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.329

like you know you're getting close to
the end or at the middle uh so that's

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.050
the end or at the middle uh so that's
 

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.329
the end or at the middle uh so that's
one problem and the other problem which

00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339
one problem and the other problem which
 

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:02.060
one problem and the other problem which
sadly is a major one it doesn't end on a

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.070

problem is that a lot of characters are
returning characters and going into this

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:26.670
returning characters and going into this

characters you know callek in the first
film they'd always be a new character

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:31.890
film they'd always be a new character
 

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.800
film they'd always be a new character
with each one and a lot of them are

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:33.810
with each one and a lot of them are
 

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.240
with each one and a lot of them are
returning there's only one or two new

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.250
returning there's only one or two new
 

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.750
returning there's only one or two new
ones and they are great they are cool um

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760
ones and they are great they are cool um
 

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.190
ones and they are great they are cool um

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.329
mission or whatever you know before he
has his purpose like in the first film

00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339
has his purpose like in the first film
 

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:59.630
has his purpose like in the first film
so and maybe that could be a draw for

00:13:59.630 --> 00:13:59.640
so and maybe that could be a draw for
 

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.329
so and maybe that could be a draw for
some people and yeah I think very

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339
some people and yeah I think very
 

00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:05.930
some people and yeah I think very
obviously if I see watch 10 minutes of

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940
obviously if I see watch 10 minutes of
 

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.700
obviously if I see watch 10 minutes of
the first film if you don't like it

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:07.710
the first film if you don't like it
 

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.410
the first film if you don't like it
you're not gonna like this one either

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420
you're not gonna like this one either
 

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.990
you're not gonna like this one either
and and if you're wondering if you can

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000
and and if you're wondering if you can
 

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.160
and and if you're wondering if you can
see this film without seeing the first

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.170
see this film without seeing the first
 

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.400
see this film without seeing the first
one I wouldn't recommend it you can

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.410
one I wouldn't recommend it you can
 

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.500
one I wouldn't recommend it you can
technically but a lot of what makes it

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:18.510
technically but a lot of what makes it
 

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.630
technically but a lot of what makes it
work is knowing who these people are

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:20.640
work is knowing who these people are
 

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.120
work is knowing who these people are
going to be or who they were in the

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.130
going to be or who they were in the
 

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.800
going to be or who they were in the
previous film so I think it does make a

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:24.810
previous film so I think it does make a
 

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.720
previous film so I think it does make a
difference you can still follow it

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:26.730
difference you can still follow it
 

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.690
difference you can still follow it
enough but it's it's better if you see

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700
enough but it's it's better if you see
 

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.329
enough but it's it's better if you see
the first one and I saw with a great

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339
the first one and I saw with a great
 

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.829
the first one and I saw with a great
crowd people were laughing at all the

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839
crowd people were laughing at all the
 

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.269
crowd people were laughing at all the
right moments they were cheering at all

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279
right moments they were cheering at all
 

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:38.090
right moments they were cheering at all
the right moments they were you know

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.100
the right moments they were you know
 

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.710
the right moments they were you know
they're even laughing at moments that

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720
they're even laughing at moments that
 

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.510
they're even laughing at moments that
maybe were supposed to be taken

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:41.520
maybe were supposed to be taken
 

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.120
maybe were supposed to be taken
seriously but that's the great thing

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.130
seriously but that's the great thing
 

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.040
seriously but that's the great thing
about it it's a film you go into and

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.050
about it it's a film you go into and
 

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.310
about it it's a film you go into and
it's you don't have to take it seriously

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320
it's you don't have to take it seriously
 

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.230
it's you don't have to take it seriously
it you can watch it either as this

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240
it you can watch it either as this
 

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.570
it you can watch it either as this
die-hard comedy or this diehard action

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:53.580
die-hard comedy or this diehard action
 

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.690
die-hard comedy or this diehard action
filming you can enjoy it either way uh

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:55.700
filming you can enjoy it either way uh
 

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.890
filming you can enjoy it either way uh
so I loved it and my guess is anyone

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:00.900
so I loved it and my guess is anyone
 

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.420
so I loved it and my guess is anyone
that really likes the first film will

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:02.430
that really likes the first film will
 

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.670
that really likes the first film will
probably get into this there's not a ton

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680
probably get into this there's not a ton
 

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.600
probably get into this there's not a ton
of new stuff but the world is still just

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.610
of new stuff but the world is still just
 

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.480
of new stuff but the world is still just
as grand just as great even more clear

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:11.490
as grand just as great even more clear
 

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.070
as grand just as great even more clear
there are some parts where they cut back

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:13.080
there are some parts where they cut back
 

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.660
there are some parts where they cut back
to the original film and you can tell us

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:14.670
to the original film and you can tell us
 

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.160
to the original film and you can tell us
a little bit of a grain in this so they

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.170
a little bit of a grain in this so they
 

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.250
a little bit of a grain in this so they
they updated the the cameras and the

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260
they updated the the cameras and the
 

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.530
they updated the the cameras and the
equipment too so it looks even better

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540
equipment too so it looks even better
 

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.620
equipment too so it looks even better
and it's it's just so beautiful on the

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:24.630
and it's it's just so beautiful on the
 

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.240
and it's it's just so beautiful on the
big screen I may even go back and see it

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.250
big screen I may even go back and see it
 

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.280
big screen I may even go back and see it
again because it is just so beautiful to

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:28.290
again because it is just so beautiful to
 

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.290
again because it is just so beautiful to
look at the ligers I think there's a

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300
look at the ligers I think there's a
 

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.939
look at the ligers I think there's a
little bit more than just

00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:31.949
little bit more than just
 

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:34.309
little bit more than just
style over substance I think there is

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319
style over substance I think there is
 

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:36.979
style over substance I think there is
still that simplicity to carrying out a

00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:36.989
still that simplicity to carrying out a
 

00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:38.720
still that simplicity to carrying out a
mission what you're fighting for what

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:38.730
mission what you're fighting for what
 

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.569
mission what you're fighting for what
you're dying for and it's it's not a lot

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579
you're dying for and it's it's not a lot
 

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:45.220
you're dying for and it's it's not a lot
but it's just enough to satisfy like

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.230
but it's just enough to satisfy like
 

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.169
but it's just enough to satisfy like
both an action film and a film noir it

00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:48.179
both an action film and a film noir it
 

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:51.859
both an action film and a film noir it
it hits just enough um at least for me

00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:51.869
it hits just enough um at least for me
 

00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:55.069
it hits just enough um at least for me
