00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.346
Here's my solution. The loop creates 24 petals. For the cylinder, I positioned

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.209
it, so that its tip is at the origin. I then know that any rotations I do to the

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.879
petal will keep this tip there. The trickiest bit is that I first want to rotate

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.318
the petal, so that it's horizontal. Then, rotate it in increments of 15 degrees

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:19.674
around the origin. That's why I use the z-axis for rotation, then the y-axis.

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:24.112
Remember that oiler angles are applied in the order z, y, x. After the rotation

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:27.442
is done, I then move the petal up to its final position at the flower's height.
