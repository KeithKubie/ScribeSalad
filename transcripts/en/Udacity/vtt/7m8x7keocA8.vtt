00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.763
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Our slope is negative 3, or negative 3 divided by 1. It terms of direction,

00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:09.104
we know we need to travel down 3 units and then right 1 unit. From our y

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:13.674
intercept we travel down 3 units and to the right 1 unit. We wind up at 1,

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:18.650
negative 4. So this point is certainly on our graph. Once we have two points, we

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.074
can connect our line and draw it in. We can see we have some other points on our

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:27.581
graph, like negative 1, 2 and negative 2, 5. But these aren't any of these other

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:31.971
points, so they don't work. If you also plugged in these values for x and y into

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.316
our equation, you would find that you'd get a statement that wasn't true. So

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:40.626
these points aren't on the line because they don't satifsy our equation. If

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:45.115
you're still having some trouble with slope, remember you can always refer back

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:49.605
to the directions. You start at the point, and move down 3 and right 1. Drawing

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:51.177
your arrows to help you out.
