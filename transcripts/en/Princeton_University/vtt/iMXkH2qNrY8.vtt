I think it's something 
that may change

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.069
year to year, month to month, 
day to day

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.600
really, and it's really 
important that we

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.250
continue to update 
the data and we

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.769
continue to have 
this dialogue about it

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.990
and around it. 
It'll only take a few

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.549
minutes and that's 
really important that

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.870
we begin to 
address these issues.
