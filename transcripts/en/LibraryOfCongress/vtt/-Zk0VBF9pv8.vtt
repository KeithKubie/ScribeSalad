&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.380
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.990
On behalf of the Prints and
Photographs Division of the Library

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.650
of Congress and its Center
for Architecture, Design,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.670
and Engineering, it's my great
pleasure to welcome you all

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.100
to today's lecture, "Tracking
Time: Twin Towers and Motor City,"

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.580
by the distinguished American
photographer and documentarian,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.560
Camilo Jose Vergara,
followed by a book signing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.600
of his newly published book,
Detroit Is No Dry Bones.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.900
My name is Mari Nakahara.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.080
I am a curator of architecture,
design, and engineering at the P

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.020
and P we call -- Prints
and Photographs Division.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.440
I have been in this position for
the last one year and nine months.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.690
In comparison with my predecessor,
[inaudible] -- he's there --

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.040
his career is, was 40
years, and he retired April.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.630
I am still a baby.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.530
I'm still trying to learn
many things of the Prints

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.510 position:56%
and Photographs Division collection,
especially related to architecture,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.010
design, and engineering,
which actually pertains

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.070
to about four million items.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.230
In my early stage of the learning,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.570
Mr. Vergara's photographs
caught my eye.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.300
Having a background as
an architecture historian

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.310
and as a former resident
of New York City,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.870
I have been paying attention
to changes in the city.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.470
When I visited Detroit,
the hometown of my husband,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.420
in 2007 for the first time,
I was very much fascinated

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.620
by the buildings in that city.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.640
Beautiful Art Deco buildings,
and then I couldn't find

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.580
out why the city actually
deteriorated that much.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.870
Then I got so much interested in
knowing the history of that city.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.630
Mr. Vergara's photography resonated
with these personal curiosities.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.130
This summer, when the library
received from Mr. Vergara a series

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.870
of World Trade Center photographs,
I actually caught my breath

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.160
for a moment, recalling the time
and the difficulties that I went

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.430
through in New York City in 2001
as a new immigrant to this country.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.970
That became a trigger for
me to host today's event.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.700
This is the first event,
lecture event which I coordinated

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.340
as a curator for architecture,
design, and engineering.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.460
Let me introduce Camilo
a little bit.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.010
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm having trouble--

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.760
[ Laughter ]

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: I hope I don't
have any connection trouble.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.700
[laughs] Camilo Jose Vergara
was born in Chile in 1949

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.090
and is a formally trained
sociologist and writer as well

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.910

which is available for
purchase after this lecture.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.340
The website which you are
seeing here, Invincible Cities,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.510
has made his work better known

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.740
through a special map-based
interface.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.150
I played around a little bit.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.220
I strongly suggest you do the same.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.720
It's really interesting.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.020
Chronological order.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.960
The cities and the locations,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.000
you can see how the
city has been changing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.950
A MacArthur Fellow Genius Award

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.180
in 2002 recognized the exceptional
stature of Vergara's work.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.650
In 2013, Vergara became
the first photographer

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.040
to receive the president
National Humanities Medal.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.070
In 2013, Vergara selected the
Library of Congress, thanks to him,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.500
to be the permanent home for
his photographic archive.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.410
Previous acquisition of
Vergara's work were the series

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.420
of Silent Cities, which
is documenting cemeteries

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.310
across the United States
between 1976 and 1989.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.900 position:56%
And Twin Towers Remembered, which
is recording that World Trade Center

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.600
in New York City between
1970 and in 2001.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.030
As of today, approximately 8000
photographs have been transferred

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.560
to the library, and the full
archive is expected to offer

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.490
about 10,000 images spanning
the 1970's through the 2010's.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.660
Before introducing Camilo,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.370
please note that this event is
being videotaped for the broadcast

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.240
on the library's website
and the other media.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.770
We encourage you in the
audience to ask questions

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.890
and offer comments during the
question and answer period.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.090
But please realize that in

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.510
and transmitting your remarks.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.510
Finally, please join me in
welcoming Camilo Jose Vergara.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.610
[ Applause ]

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.960
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Thank
you very much, Mari.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.730
Couple of things.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:46.420
She made me five years younger,
so that, very grateful for that.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.720
[laughter]

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.560
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: So you can just--

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.860
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Yes.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.150
I'm also very happy
to see Helena here,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.990
and to see Floyd [assumed
spelling], and certainly Mari

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.290
and Phil [assumed spelling] that's,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.790
that are doing this wonderful work
putting this exhibition together,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.340
this collection together.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.270
And every time I come here,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.480
I find this place friendlier
and friendlier.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.790
I just, it just, it's amazing when
you start doing photography all

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.770
over the country and start
going to different places

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.610
to present your work, after you
go back, and back, and back,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.640
you just feel at home
in the different places,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.180
and it's just a wonderful feeling.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:46.560
So I want to start with the
section from Detroit here,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.970
then show a few pictures of
the World Trade Center series,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.730
and somewhere along the line,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.200
I will explain how the title
came about that you will see.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.680
So Detroit Is No Dry Bones.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:12.870
My first encounter with the city of
Detroit was stepping into a feeling

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.870
of unbelief, and it
was unbelief because,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.010
not that I hadn't seen skyscrapers
before because I had been

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.020
to Chicago, and I had seen them
there, and I had seen briefly

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.700
in New York, but I had never
seen an abandoned skyscraper.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.570
And I had never seen 12
abandoned skyscrapers.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:42.370
[laughs] You know, that
was, what's going on here?

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.940
And, you know, when I asked that
question, I'd take a picture

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.190
because I'm kind of slow
in figuring out things,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.450
so I figure I'd take a picture,
and then I'll take another picture,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.210
and then slowly, you begin to
maybe not figure out how all

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:06.490
of this came about, but just
have some sense of direction

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.590
of what is happening between the
time you first became acquainted

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:16.380
with it and then the time sort
of you lived off, you know.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.980
That you, you're through.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.710
You end. I just, I
would look at buildings.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.670 position:56%
This is the United Artists Building.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.740
The first photograph was a
photograph that was taken

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.720
from the hotel that was
at the, at that time,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.100
was a Salvation Army
building called Harbor Light.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.930
And it was taken in '91.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.340
That's about 25 years ago.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.660
Building doesn't exist anymore, but
I sort of almost saw that I wanted

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.000
to do that, retake that picture
year after year after year,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.150
and then the building
was knocked off.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.870
And it was, before
that was cinder block,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.060
so I had to stop, like,
at 2002 or '03.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.460
And since then, this whole area
has been revitalized and rebuilt.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.760
The whole empty front, you know.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.090
It's not, it's still empty, but
in, within a couple of years,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.010
all of that's going to,
the picture is going

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.350
to be a completely different one.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.180
Some of the abandoned
buildings, even this one,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.380
may be rehabilitated someday.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.550
You would find odd things.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:36.660
So I decided that one of my
jobs was to sort of keep track

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.220
of things that get left out.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.400
So like this man, who
was the caretaker

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.650
of a 32-story skyscraper called
the Broderick Building in Detroit,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.890
and that building, you can see
this, we're on the roof there.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.840
And he told me at one
time, you know, we were 15.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.890 position:56%
There were 15 people that maintained
this building, and at this point,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.320
must've been around '91, '92.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.920
He was the only one, and
he could, he was not all

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.410
that energetic, you
know, at that time.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.450
So, but every time I went to
Detroit, I would find him,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.990 position:56%
and we would go to the roof, or we'd
stop in different floors and look

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.260
around at this collection.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:40.320
It was this large skyscraper that
you can see in the first picture

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.140
that had been left behind.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.950
People had just left, and there
were lawyers' office, you know,

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.950
where all the archives were
full with stories of divorces,

00:11:53.950 --> 00:12:00.380
and dentists' office that had the
state of the mouth of thousands

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.910
of people because there
were many dentists' office.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.550
And they had a collection of
equipment, that was ten years old

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.890
or 20 years old, you
know, that was rusting.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.110
And I found that extremely
interesting.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:21.080
There was also city offices
in some of these buildings

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.880
and even records, you know.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.470
The parole office could
be in a building,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.020
and then you have all these
parole records left behind.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.850
There was a section of Detroit.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.560
It was like the first wealthy
section that was called Brush Park.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.020
And it was so derelict.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:47.300
This is in 1987, and I just
thought there's nothing

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.590 position:56%
that could happen here but this,
it's just going to return to nature.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:59.620
It was a house that was, a mansion
that was built by a lumber baron.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:06.500
Detroit was in a strategic
place, so when the lumber came

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.880
from upper Wisconsin, you
know, through the lake,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.230
it would come to Detroit, and
that's what got Detroit started

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.930
in developing a carriage industry.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.330
First, there were wagons, you
know, and then they, railroad,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:30.070
into the railroads, and
finally, into cars, so.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.400
So here, we're going to see
the evolution of this place.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.570
This is '91, and you can see
the weeds get even bigger.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:44.510
You can also see, and
here it's about 2000.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.210
And that's today.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:53.940
And I think the incredible thing
is just not only shows the building

00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:00.130
coming back, it shows how so
much of the, what was built

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.910
around it has disappeared,
is not there anymore.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.190
And it shows a blonde woman here.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.680
So you can fill in the rest.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:17.460
I mean, they used to be first
an area of rooming houses.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.600
I mean, first an area of
very wealthy people, then it,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.630
they became rooming houses,
and the wealthy people went

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.710
to other neighborhoods
with larger houses.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:37.180
Then it was a place for derelicts,
and people who, homeless people,

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.260
and the few people that
sort of hang onto it.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.990
And then it's sort of coming back
again as a kind of middle-class,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.460
and in some cases,
upper-class neighborhood.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.630
Well, that one didn't
have the same look.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:59.230
This one, for those of you who've
seen Beverly Hill Cops, number,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.060
the cop number one
that was shot in 1984.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.380
This, you'll see this at the
beginning of the picture.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.520
Well, that's there no more.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.280
New buildings were built there.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.580
I have the picture.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.640
I'm not showing it here now because
they are, compared to this, I mean,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.400
these were beautiful
buildings that have been lost.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.030
Again, if you get far from the
downtown and you go, in this case,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.980
to the East Side of Detroit,
you see there is a church,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:38.600 position:56%
and then the churches would organize
these sort of sales of used clothes.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.760
And here it's all laid
out, you know,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.060
and you can imagine all the coats.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.800
There's hundreds of coats and
those two women selling it.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.430
And I thought of going back and
see what that looked like today.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.290
I called the church too.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:02.340
I wanted to know, I was
very surprised to know,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.630
find out that they actually
didn't even remember the name

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.170
of the two women there.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.160
You know, so that's what
it looks like today.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.370
This is another set of
two pictures separated

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.540
by about the same number
of years, over 20 years.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.540
This is the first one.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:26.290
Street, it's near Eastern Market
for those of you who know Detroit.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.730
It's in the East Side too.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:34.230
And what you see here,
one of my great interests,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.170
it's what happens in between.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.470
It's the efforts.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:43.240
I mean, those places didn't
just sit there and decay,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.120
but there were efforts
from the city to do things.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.730
There were efforts from people
who lived there to do things.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.870
And I thought it was important
to keep track of those things,

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.060
not just wait until the
whole place was level.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.640
And so a new population,
new buildings,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.070
new everything came about.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.430
So here you can see
that at one point,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.360
the city may have put
planters and new trees.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.660
You see the planters there.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.290
It was big supermarket here.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.550
And this is basically
what it looks like today,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.300
but you still can see
the planters, you know.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.880
So you can do, like, a kind
of an archaeology of places.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.420
This is the Packard Plant,
which is probably the largest

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:40.620
of the car plants there, which is,
at one point during World War II,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.780
they built airplane engines there.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.380
They built Rolls-Royce
engines for --

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.670
lots of discoveries were
made there, advances.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.790
One of them was soundproofing
buildings because they had

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.700
to test these aircraft engines,
which, you know, of course,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.350
they would render you
deaf in no time.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.290
So they had, they did a
lot of insulation also

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:14.980
because of the temperatures rose
so much, they had special ways

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.440
to ventilate it and
air condition it.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.620
Again, it was, the core of the
factory was built by Albert Kahn,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.080
who was a great Detroit architect.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.970
So here you have it in '91.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.300
And at that time, the city
even thought that buildings

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.350 position:56%
like this could be recovered,
reclaimed, made into something else.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.900
So the idea here, we
had one industry

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.470
that at one time employed
30,000, 35,000 people.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:53.180
We could have 200, you
know, small shops here,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.340
and each one of them
would employ 100.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.560
And then we'll be in business.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.160
It actually didn't happen
that way, but it was sort

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.260
of interesting to see
what would come.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.250
And, you know, there would
be a laundry [phonetic].

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.450
There would be a place
that would have used shoes.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.370
There'll be a place
that had cardboard.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.500
Another place where they
took cars to take apart.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.170
You know, stolen cars.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.060
And then they, you can see the
building sort of crumpled part

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.740
by part, and at this point --
and this is I think this year --

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.240
it was taken over by some
Spanish entrepreneur that wants

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.560
to make it, bring it back.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.350
So he puts the name there.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.630
I don't know where he went, to
Kinko's, and made this sign.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.440
[laughs] So here is the Packard
sign, which it's, it was fancy

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.220
and substantial at one point.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.480
And then he put a picture here
that has old Packard cars.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.340
So that's the Packard plant.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.390
There were other plants like
that, and this is one of them.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:05.050
It's a, it's made airplane
-- I mean, not airplane --

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:12.590
car engines, automobile engines,
and there is the name, Continental.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.070 position:56%
So they continue buildings like this

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.620
as the other building
continued to have a life.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.080
They have a life in the internet

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.140
because you have kids
actually go there --

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.370
and I don't know why they do this
-- they skateboard on the roof

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.680
and they do things that you think
they're all going to get killed,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.740
and they, you see those,
and you too [phonetic].

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.350
Also, they go with drones, you
know, so that they fly the drones,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.600
and the drones show you all
the crevices of the building,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.570
which is sort of fascinating
to watch.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.750
I was just, I like what's happening

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.450
to the parking lot there,
the way it's cracking.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.000
And it looked like almost
like the surface of the Moon.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.300
There were buildings.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.010
This is part of the ruins of
Detroit, and what attracted me

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:10.200
to that -- it was a very, very
exciting type of ruins to me,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.640
and those were the ruins of the
buildings that, in my childhood,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.270
in some little town
in Chile, you know,

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.720
I would look at pictures of them.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.230
But they were like the buildings

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.490
that would be built
in Mars, you know.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.060
I thought that was the future.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.820
That was, you know, and
I believe in the future.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.020
I thought the future was going
to be wonderful and there'd be,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.400
going to be buildings like this.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.580
But I never thought that I was
going to face them as ruins.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:45.350
So this, buildings like this, and
I think there's another one here.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.090
Well, this is a little earlier.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.360
But they were built,
this was built before.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.970
The one before was built
right after the World War II

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.100
when architects spent some
time without building too much

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.500
because it was, the war was there.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.650
So they kept dreaming of, you
know, this exciting, new city,

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:16.760 position:56%
this new civilization that was going
to be built after the war was over.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.980
This, on the other
hand, is an old diner --

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.210
one of many that were built,
like, right around the time

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.630
of the Depression, right
before the Depression.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.630
There would, I think the company

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.180
that built them was
based in Wisconsin.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.070
I don't know what the name
of it was, but they built

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.870
like 30 of them in Detroit.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.280
I mean, Detroit was a boom town.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.140
They needed cheap places to eat.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.910
And then this is like I'm
encountering this building, like,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.510
in its last night almost, you know,
because then I started going back,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.280
and it's now abandoned, but you
can see there it looks almost

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:07.670
like there is a congregation
of ghosts

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.850
that are having coffee
and burgers there.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.620
Except that, they're invisible.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.420
But the light means that there is
still some life in the building.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.650
Again, there are other
buildings that get this new life

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.680
in different ways, you know.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.270
It's that at one point, like with
the building I showed you before,

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:40.440
you know, where Eddie Murphy
paraded in front of it in 1984,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:48.340
this made 8 Mile, the movie 8 Mile,
and you can see Eminem pass by

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.590
and with some kind of a water
gun, or something, or paint gun.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:57.770
They just shoot at the steer.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:05.350
So before they did the,
they shot that scene,

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:11.360
the designers for the
movie repainted the steer.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.400
If you go near the Rouge Plant,
which is on the West Side

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.570
of Detroit, you see scenes
like this, which are,

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:30.290
to me, were extraordinary.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.840
I just thought that
[laughs] that'd be a house

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.380
where they wouldn't go
trick-or-treating to.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.750
[ Laughter ]

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:45.280
Then there was this development
that I captured in Camden,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.450
and Chicago, and other cities.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:54.030
And that's, you know, you have a
building that has two families,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:59.980
and then one side is occupied
and the other side is abandoned.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.750
And both of them continue
their life,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.460
their movement into the future.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.220
And I'm very interested in
seeing what's going to happen.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.030
So you can see the one that's
occupied put his fence on, and,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.390 position:56%
you know, sort of protecting itself.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.870
Except that the problem is
that if somebody squats here

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.160
and builds a fire to
stay warm in the winter,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.720
the whole things can burn.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.390
Here you see, oh, another
example of one of those pairs.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.820
It's not that the house that is
occupied is in very good shape,

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.590
but it's certainly
better than the other one.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:43.290
And here it's like extreme
case of someone that's holding

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:48.310
out between two abandoned houses
and puts the American flag,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.430
and it's certainly making an effort

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.900
to stay there and preserve
the house.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.030
I thought that those stories were
important, that those stories need

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.490
to be told, and that
also, they are stories

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:09.790
that are very easy to
ignore or not to see.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.930
Then I look at the
landmarks of Detroit,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.090
of which there are
many, and very striking.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.960
This is a conservatory where there
is a great collection of orchids,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.520
and it's in an island
that's called Belle Isle,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.340
which is a very beautiful place.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.860
I, I'm not sure, but I think
Albert Kahn designed that.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.390
Maybe Floyd knows.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:41.250
And this is the Fisher Mansion, and
there are several Fisher Mansions.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:47.000
Fisher was a very wealthy man,
very wealthy family from Detroit

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.290 position:56%
that did the carriages for the cars.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.140
So they would do tens
of millions of them.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.440
So you can imagine what
a big thing that was.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.470
And they, you know, houses
like this were built by them.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.360
And this is the decoration
of one of them.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.320
It's in an area called
Boston-Edison.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:19.840 position:56%
Then again, what the, what I realize
this, in this Detroit, and I'll get,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.650
later on, I'll get into
gentrification and so on.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.080
And the tremendous contrast
between the people who were there,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.150
and live there, and stay there,
and their values, and so on --

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.610
I remember reading
somewhere the only super,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.400
Jesus is the only superstar.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.870
And I thought, I mean, everywhere
you go, there is Christianity.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.170
There's a church.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.810
There is something or other.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.270
You look at the kids that are
coming in, and they're, you know,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:56.890
opening up bakeries, and bars, and
restaurants, and shops, and so on.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.900
And it's a very, very
different thing.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:06.620
You don't see any reference
to this other life of Detroit

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.650
where Christianity is important.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.230
As you can see, it gets
too hot in the summer,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.310
so you bring your church
out [phonetic].

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.680
Plus, it's also a way to pick
up, you offer people some food.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.250
They sit. They listen to you.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.880
Maybe they'll become
members of the church.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:29.370
Then this sort of thing,
which builds, this sort of,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.500
it's a very, very strange thing.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.010
It sort of creates an
aura of authenticity

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.010
around the city of Detroit.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.260
So Detroit, it's seen
by many people.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.550
You know, this is the real thing.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.920
This is the place because
you see things like this.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.270
I mean, you see the hand.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.070
You see people do it by hand.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.790 position:56%
People put their things that are not
mediated and not going to be found

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.050
in hundreds of other places.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.630
Everything, you know, at
least in this place is kind

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.480
of unique, one of its kind.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.780
Oh, like that, you know.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.620
So Christ, why not put him in
the Upper Peninsula, you know?

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:19.060
Walking in Northern Michigan.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.340
Or if you have an abandoned
building, you know,

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.600
why don't you put stories
from, you know,

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.770
the life of Christ or something?

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:40.850 position:56%
And then there are these other quite
sophisticated signs that you see.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:46.100
And there is no place for
them to go, so in some sense,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.510
I felt that it was my job to go
there and photograph, you know,

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.340
the ones that I saw,
and put them up,

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.790 position:56%
and make sure that people knew them.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.500
Then this, there is this
other difference here.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.550
I mean, this need to
construct a history,

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.250
to tell a history, you know.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:10.690
We begin with the Egyptians,
so here it's the Egyptians.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.420
You know, and then
here it comes Mandela,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.200
and slavery gets put in the middle.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:26.050
And it keeps moving to the right,
and it ends up with Coleman Young,

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.770
which was a very influential
mayor of Detroit.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:35.200
And under his, he being the mayor,
they built the Renaissance Center,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.710
which is the building
that you see here.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.440
And also, the People Mover.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:46.820
Now, in the sort of gentrifier
version or their, you know,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.990
the other version of Detroit, none
of those two things would appear

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.470
because they are consider
as huge boondoggles --

00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:00.230
you know, things that fail,
that just waste of money.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.620
But for their black population,
because they were doing,

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:09.550
they were built and put there at
a time when there was a, the city,

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:15.680 position:56%
there was black control of the city,
and the city was sort of a center

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.940
of what you call Black America.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.030
So that's a detail
from that picture.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.140
There is something really very
powerful about this, you know.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.850
Just you see all these faces
here, and you see it fading out.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.810
I mean, certainly didn't look like
this when it was first painted.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.280
Then the idea that you have,

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.210
this idea that you have
to tell your history.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.720
I mean, no gentrifier coming to
Detroit says, look, you know, my,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.130
here is my grandpa, you know.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.690
He came from Italy and he
brought, he used to cook pasta,

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.730
or he had, we have Garibaldi here.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.070
Maybe the old immigrants do that.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.960
They used to do that, of course,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.300
because they had statures
[inaudible].

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:15.810
But today, this urgency, this
need is felt in graphics like this

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:20.010 position:56%
where you see the Renaissance Center
on top, you see the American flag,

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:24.680 position:56%
"The Fist" of Joe Louis's fist here.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.590
And then you see here, you see
Malcolm X, King, and Coleman Young,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:35.160
and the two black artists that
in the, lifted their fists

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.950
in the Olympics in Mexico City.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:43.310
So that is a statement.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:49.190
And I would go to sort
of out of the way place,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.620
really out of the way place.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.250
If you want to know where
this is, you know, you just,

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:58.920
it'd be quite hard
to find by chance.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.520
But to me, there were
statements that needed

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.790
to be preserved, as well as this.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.090
I think this is wonderful.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.640
It's on the cover of the book,
on the back cover of the book.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.040
This is a view of Mahalia Jackson.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.500
And I doubt that you could get, you
know, sort of a better portrait,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.090
you know, not -- it's,
of course, not there.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:25.130
It disappeared a long time ago.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.100 position:56%
But I'm glad I have a picture of it.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:35.420
Then there is all this kind
of naïve signage paintings

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.600
that people put for purposes.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.410
I mean, they give dance
classes here in this place.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:48.390
Here is a place that fixes cars,
and they hired a homeless man.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.600
It says, look, we got
some paint here.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.580
Why don't you do something?

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.520
He said he was an artist, so he
did the history of transportation.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.520
[laughter] You know, which for
Detroit is just what you need.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:11.410 position:56%
And how do you leave in a city with,
you know, you have a daycare center.

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:13.990
All of your kids are black.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:16.990
Snow White happens to be Caucasian.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:19.470
So how do you deal with that?

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:27.200
Well, you paint her brown, or you
paint her green, or you paint her,

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.940
you know, it's always a color.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:39.790
So you go there and you ask
these questions, you know.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.390
[inaudible] try to find out if
this has anything to do with race.

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:46.320
And they tell you, no, it doesn't
have anything to do with race.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.440
It just, you know, kids like this

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.510
because it reminds
him of chocolates.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.250
[ Laughter ]

00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.010
They are the inventions that people
make to sort of cope with the fact

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:04.300
that there are over 3000
bus stops in Chicago

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:10.290
that have nowhere you can sit and
wait for the bus, you know, so you,

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.360
in here, you may get rained
over, but you still have a place

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.930
that you can sit on, that
somebody came up with that.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:25.220
And I thought that if I was
writing something about inventions,

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:30.460 position:56%
I would love to write a story of who
thought this up, and went looking

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:36.110 position:56%
for the tires, and found that, I
mean, of course, then the city finds

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.760
out that there is this, and
they feel ashamed of it,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:44.050
and they dismantle it, so this
thing only lived for a few weeks.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.810
But to me, it's, it was, it's one

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.100
of the most important
pictures in my Detroit series.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.080
What's behind is an
old police station.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:36:00.460
Now, there are other
immigrants that come to Detroit.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.760
Some of them are immigrants.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.320
Some of them are children
of immigrants,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.780
and they're Greeks and Albanians.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.820
And their specialty,
it's to buy some

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:16.370
of the failed Kentucky Fried
Chickens, and McDonald's, and,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.760
you know, all those
big franchises that go,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.950
try to make a go and can't do it.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:30.420
So they built it, and then they put
like a hat on top of it that's made

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.010
out of a material called Dryvit.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.920
And you can make almost
anything you want with it.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.960
You can build the Parthenon
if you want with Dryvit.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.770
Won't last very long, and
if a car hits it, you know,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.040
you'll have it all coming down.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.760
But Detroit has the most
extraordinary examples

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:56.310
of this type of, if you want to
call it architecture or design,

00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:02.570
is all over the United States, but
Detroit, it excels in doing it.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.670
This is a, you can
still see the lights

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.440
from the original White Castles.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.680
You see those.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.310
Then Detroit, because it got so,
it began to get so much attention,

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:21.650
you know, and the eyes
of the world were there,

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.710
and you could do something
on the streets of Detroit,

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.620
and it was better than
having something

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.280
in a gallery, in an art gallery.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.890
So then this works in two ways.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.950
First of all, these are students
that did a thesis is building.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.900
There were students at a place
called Cranbrook Academy,

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:51.930
which is in very wealthy suburbs
of Detroit, north of Detroit.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.910
Bloomfield Hills, I
think it's called.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.060
And so they built this
house for about $60,000.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.170
A family lived there
about six months,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.120
and then it flopped
and became abandoned.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.910
And then, of course,
the taggers come along.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.110
So this is GASM, you know, tag.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.870
All over Detroit is his tag.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:16.190
And then, of course, there was
another, there was a local artist

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.630
that would put dots in
abandoned buildings,

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.580
and his name is [inaudible].

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.170
So [inaudible] put the dot there.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.880
So a few years passed by.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.250
Some development came
out of the center,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.660 position:56%
and this is not far from the center.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.070
And it's in, like, the largest,

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:37.050
one of the largest
empty lots in Detroit.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:42.500
So they figured that's what
it's going to be rebuilt next.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:51.470
So somebody started an Airbnb
there and redecorated the house

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:58.000
by inviting a muralist from
Brooklyn that has some name,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.770
and I guess it's doing some
castles and fantasy in that place.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.070
This is recent.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.370
It's like a year old.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.560
You can see the size
of the lot around it.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.670
It's probably going to
be all built very soon.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:19.210 position:56%
But in the meanwhile, you can have
your honeymoon there if you want to.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.560
[laughter] You, and you get
that view there, and so,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.780
I mean, if you're brave enough.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.250
So this is another.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:35.420
It's a homage to a graffiti artist
from Houston, Texas called NEKST

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.230 position:56%
who put his name all over the place.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.590
He's all over Philadelphia.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.440
He's in Houston and so on.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.370
And he happened to die.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:50.260
So there is a way in which this
artist that they, at least him,

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.720
and you can see some of
their, they are on the web.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.320
They have little films about, you
know, when they go out tagging.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:05.030
And, you know, here he's
opening a bottle of champagne.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:10.080
Now, the problem was that he
was using that menacing knife

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.190 position:56%
to open the bottle of champagne, and
what that, the result of that was

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:20.970
that a city inspector drove by and
he says, "This is inciting crime."

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.330
So then the lady that owned
the building hired somebody,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.880
and that's what [laughter]
it looks like today.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:34.510
And, well, the building, the mural
continues to be very popular,

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.210
but for the wrong reason.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:44.090
People go and see what happened
to the masterpiece, you know.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.390
And here we come to,
"Detroit is no dry bones."

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:53.750
So what happens, the condition of
Detroit becomes famous all over,

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.020
so there are four designers
from Holland that come

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.050
to Detroit with a great idea.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:07.120
What if we convince ministers,
pastors to change the word,

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.750
put the word "Detroit" wherever
they put the word "God"?

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.440
So, of course, the
project didn't do very well

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.780
because the pastor didn't want
anything to do with such an idea.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:27.040
But they went to this church, and
the minister was having a sermon

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.790
that day, and it was
about God is no dry bones.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:38.060
So then, well, you know, that was
their chance to put "Detroit."

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.360
So they put "Detroit."

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:45.160
So four white women from, well,
of course, from Holland did

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:52.350
that very neat writing and
very neat sign right there.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:57.430
And it kind of, to me, it
brought together, you know,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:02.840
sort of black culture, a city
that is falling apart and decaying

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:10.770 position:56%
in many parts while at the same time
is resurging, and the, and this,

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:17.360
you know, this attention that
it's getting and the fact

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:25.700
that people would come as far away
as Rotterdam or some city like that

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.640
to do a sign the way you see it.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.870
Again, of course, Detroit
got Banksy and they --

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.200
I'm getting close to the end?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.600
Oh, there's probably two or three.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.280
Okay. We'll have a problem
with the Trade Center, then.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.040
How much of that one?

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.340
Okay.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.640
&gt;&gt; Fifteen.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.940
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Okay.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.730
Okay, so the story here is
it's, this is another one

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.820
of those wonderful buildings that
were built after World War II

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.200
and designed after World
War II, and they were like,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.550
this is what the future
is going to be like.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:08.210
So it's there, and it's, you know,
the sign is, it's still standing.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.570
And then what happened is that
Banksy happened in Detroit.

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:17.840
So he goes and he find this
to be a wonderful place

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.320
to do a piece of his work.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.730
So he puts it there, and
within a couple days,

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.160
the whole wall has disappeared.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.660
So now there's a big hole in there.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.930 position:56%
I mean, I want to give you a sense
of there are things that I generated

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.310
from the inside, like all those
religious images that I showed you

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:44.020
at the beginning or
the idea of history.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.830
And then there is another type
of religious images, and that,

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.920
those are generated by people
from a church in Indiana

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.700
or people in a church in Illinois.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.040
They say, we need to do
some good in the world,

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.390
so why not go into
Detroit and do something?

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:05.620
So they see abandoned buildings and
then they want to beautify them,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.010
to make them more attractive.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:14.010
So this is like a church from
Indiana or Illinois that comes

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:19.780
to Detroit and, you know, one
of the leaders is an artist.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.690
And then they get some of the
local kids to collaborate.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:27.470
And they paint these abandoned
buildings, and, you know,

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.880
one of them is religious.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.040
The other one is ice cream.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.700
But there are, you know,
these are the product

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.220
of a very different culture
and they are the product

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.260
of this tremendous
attention in Detroit.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.890
Then there are volunteers
that come, you know.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:50.290
They say volunteers that work for
Starbucks, or work for Ford Motor,

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.840
or work for Google,
or some other place.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.520
They say, we want, they
give them a day to go

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.550
to Detroit or two days, you know.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:03.060
So they get, and then they
try to create a little park.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:13.880
And then there are the gentrifiers
that do try to recreate something

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:20.790
that it's, like, has a flavor
of what Old Detroit was,

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:25.030
but as a friend of mine says
-- he grew up in Detroit --

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.640
there was nothing like
this in Old Detroit.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:34.120
Building that was a factory,
then it was an art gallery,

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:43.070
and now it's a bakery, which is,
which combines writing by hand,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:48.420
seats that are taken from
abandoned schools in Detroit,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:57.290
little architecture
details that were found,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.810
and then attracts a group of people

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:02.320
that is a very mixed
group of people.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.860
And, of course, there's a
couple taking a selfie there.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.570 position:56%
[laughs] You know, here you have an
old white bread [phonetic] building,

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.050
and there's a casino
that was built using

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:18.320
that building rather
than demolishing it.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.160
And this is an image of the
Old Detroit, of the Detroit

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.440
of prosperity, of the
Detroit of money,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.340
of the Detroit that,
of the '20's, you know.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.660
You see they're putting the
money into the vaults there.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.800
And the Detroit that was white too.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.750
So here it's the designer
is a designer

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.420
that did a lot of work in Detroit.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.120
His name was Corrado Parducci.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:54.270
So black artists from the area
react and they say, this is,

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.510
that stuff is not ours, you know.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.810
Here is ours.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:07.780
Rosa Parks lived here, so Rosa
Parks replaces some of the other,

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:15.080
or it's placed there, you
know, as being the right image,

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.290
the right portrait to put there.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.070
And that's Motown.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:23.500
It's the, you can help yourself
to some postcards I have here

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:30.120
of the same postcard, and, yeah,
right, that entrance, which had,

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:37.560
you know, it's quite a small museum
but well attended and very popular.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:46.220
Then there is a local folk artist
that has her view of Detroit

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.640
where the local funeral
home becomes as big

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.820
as the General Motors
World Headquarters,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.950
the old one that's
right there in the back.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.980
So it's, like, similar to what
we saw with Snow White is that,

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:06.200
you know, you can't, you have
to play around with the symbols

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.620
to just arrange them
in a different way.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:16.260
Detroit was, and it, it's
a very spread-out city.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.400
It's 139 square miles.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.580
It's, it reached at one point
almost two million people,

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.260
and now it has a little
under 700,000.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.020
So there is a lot of land,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.040
and people cultivate
that and grow crops.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.410
So it's this man, it's
a picture from '87.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.930
And this is my last
picture for Detroit.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:45.890
I don't know if we have time
to go into the Trade Center.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.190
&gt;&gt; Very quickly.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.490
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: What?

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:49.790
Very quickly?

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.090
Okay.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:52.390
&gt;&gt; Very quickly.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:53.690
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: So this is like
the symbol, a symbol of Detroit.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.990
A very important train station.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.430
Brought the president of the
United States for the inauguration.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.740
I believe it was 1913.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:07.030
And many people went to, you
know, service the war and so on,

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:08.790
you know, from that train station.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:11.590
Got hundreds of trains every day.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:16.150
It's been abandoned for
a while, so, any case.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.680
So the Twin Towers,
it's a simple thing.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.340
It's just, I first became
interested, you know,

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.050
because I was up on the projects.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.530
I would photographs
from the projects.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.410
I wanted to get an air view.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.930
I didn't have money for a
helicopter or anything like that.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:43.970
So I would go to the public housing
projects and photograph from there.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:50.400
So here you can see New York
from about 1994 I think.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.340
And this is 2001.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:58.010
So what you see in 2001, there
is no World Trade Center.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:02.670
And that's like, you
know, a few months ago.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.300
But what this showed, it showed
big areas in the foreground,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:12.170
so you could see how the
whole city was changing.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:17.600 position:56%
At the beginning, I was just
attracted to that because, you know,

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.110
it was, tallest building in my
town was three stories high,

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:28.460
and I wanted to know what one that,
say, 112 stories would be like.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.260
I also had, like, an
attitude, you know,

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.530
so you've, you are in your 20s.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.160
You feel, you know,
you are being left out.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.370
Nobody cares about, and so you
figure, well, you too, you know.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.250
You may be building the
tallest building in the world,

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:51.010
but there it's a homeless person
sleeping right in front of it.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:56.550
So all of this at the old piers in
Jersey, and they have disappeared.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.760
This is the beginning
when it was built.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.740
And this is like the New
York of the French connection

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:08.070
that doesn't exist
anymore, which you can,

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:10.430 position:56%
it was in a state of disintegration.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:16.910
So much of it, you know, that
part of it, part of the impulse

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:22.070 position:56%
to photograph it was that, you know,
it wasn't going to be there anymore.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:26.700
And the irony here didn't scathe
me that this was Liberty Drive,

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.540
and then when the building went up,

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.200
the new building was
called the Freedom Tower.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.650
So I took the pictures that
every tourist would take.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.300
So this is from the Manhattan
Bridge, and from that very angle,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.320
like, if you go there today,
they'd say, chain-link fence.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.860
But there is a hole where
you can put your camera

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.730
and you can take this picture.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.610
The only difference is that I kept
taking the picture every year.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.770
So this is 79.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.830
That's the day of September 11th.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:06.230
And that's, like, a
few months later.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:10.670
This is, like, 2005/2006.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:16.390
And that's 2010, you know.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:20.080
And then you begin to see
other buildings going up.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.650
And you begin to see a
very different skyline.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:31.350
There is the new what they call
them One World Trade Center.

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.810
That's at night.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:37.460
And that's like the way
it is today, more or less.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.310
And that's going to
continue changing.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:45.710
I mean, it's basically, it's
a very, very different skyline

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.690
from what we saw many years ago.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.210
And I'll go quickly
through the other series.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:57.020
This I like very much because it
shows the church, the chapels,

00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:02.860
St. Paul's Chapel that is
from the 1750's, more or less.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.040
And it's kind of there, and
it stays put, and everything

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.740
around it kind of disappears.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:15.110
You know, here is the Trade
Center goes, and new, you know,

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.440
some new building goes there.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:24.740
And then the new One World Trade
Center is starting to go up.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.550
And there it's completed.

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.230
So this is my presentation.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.510
I thank you very much.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:38.530
[ Applause ]

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.040
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank
you very much, Camilo.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.810
We would like to take a couple
questions if you have any.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:45.110
We have five minutes.

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:47.720
Reese [phonetic].

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.100
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] apartment buildings?

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.980
Because what happens
if it's a high-rise

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:59.300
or garden apartment building and
one of the tenants abandons it?

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.070
Then the whole building
disintegrates?

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:03.140
You kind of showed duplexes,

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.310
but I wonder if it's a big
building, how can you do it?

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.950
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Well,
there are several pictures

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:13.800
of some big apartment
buildings from Detroit.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.550
There were some quite
beautiful buildings

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:19.990
and some very large
apartment buildings.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:23.700
And it's sort of a slow process,
you know, the disintegration

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.720
of an apartment building.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.210
It's not, it doesn't
happen overnight.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.890
I mean, sometimes a big fire is,
you know, it just takes care of it.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.850
I mean, if the roof goes,
there you are, you know.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:42.960
So it's, but I do, I follow
many apartment buildings.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.900
Yeah. So go ahead.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.890
&gt;&gt; Yes. I'm from Detroit,
although I left there in '72,

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:57.010
but I still go back to
visit my mother there.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:00.100
She'll be 91 next month.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.400
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Yeah.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:07.140
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] But the old Packard
Building, I worked there the summer

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.110
of '65 as a college student.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:14.210
The defense department was there.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:23.800
I worked with the defense
department, and I remember going

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.140
from one building to
another building,

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.510
and going through the
abandoned parts

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:36.380
of the car company,
and how scary it was.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.340
You would go through
there, and you'd see chassis

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.510
and engines just laying around,
and I would always be looking

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.880
for the rats to come out.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.290
But it's completely
gone now, like you said.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:53.500
Someone has said they're going
to investigate and rebuild it.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:59.400
But I don't know if that's
really going to happen.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.700
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Yeah, no.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.040
There were raves at one time.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.260
You know, they had music inside.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:13.350
The sort of interesting thing
is that one thing from Detroit

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.810
and from the rest of the country
from the very poor areas is

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:25.160
that what survives and thrives is
the music that's created there.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.350
The visuals, not, you know.

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:31.960 position:56%
It's like, what's inside the
storefront churches that disappears,

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.160
but, you know, we all know
the Supremes, and Motown,

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.930
and techno music, and so on.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.230
Go ahead.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:43.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When you started taking photos in
Detroit, did you know you were going

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:49.320 position:56%
to keep coming back and documenting,
or did that happen later?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.800
Like, when did you decide
these would become series?

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.150
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Well, you know,
it's partly I think, you know,

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:59.430
with reference to the ending,
is just that the first picture

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.480
that I take just tries
to be a complete picture

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.890
of whatever's in front of me.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.920
And then, you know, the picture
is like a question, you know.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.200
What's going to happen
to this place?

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.920
So, you know, I feel like
I have to go, you know.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.200 position:56%
So, I mean, you kind of arrange your
finances and you figure, you know,

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.500
who is going to put me up?

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.430
Is somebody going to lend me a car?

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.280
Who is going to, you
know, what I'm going

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.750
to eat, and that sort of thing.

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:30.290
And then you figure you have
enough money, so you go back.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:34.370
And, you know, that's kind
of my way, and I'm very, see,

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:38.120
I haven't been able to do
Cleveland because, basically,

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.370
there was no base that I
could stay in Cleveland.

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:41.670
There was no place.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.890
I would have loved to have
done Cleveland or, you know,

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.500
some of the cities of the South.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.800
But that's the idea.

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.900
I mean, and I think I've had very
good luck with American historians

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.450
and people interested
in American culture,

00:57:57.450 --> 00:57:59.290
and architecture, and so on.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:03.200 position:56%
I've had lousy luck with people who
do art photography and want to show,

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.510
you know, great, their, you
know, moment [phonetic],

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:10.410
and the National Gallery, and
all those places, you know.

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:12.010
I've had a couple of places --

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:15.530
the Getty or some other places
have had a few pictures.

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.140
So it's like a fragmented.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.470
It's a divided approach to
photography that if you wanted

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:24.360
to make it as a photographer,
you know,

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:31.250
all the stuff I'm telling
you is completely irrelevant.

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:35.560
Why do you want to put for your
photograph in the first place?

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.370
Why you want to give us the year?

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:40.690
Why do you want to tell us
something about the evolution

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.380
and the history of the place?

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.970
Just show us a great picture, you
know, that, an amazing picture.

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.260
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Okay,
well, thank you very much.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.560
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Okay.

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.550
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: And at the end,
that you may want to see more

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:55.120 position:56%
of Camilo's pictures, and if you can
actually show it, we have a Prints

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:59.580 position:56%
and Photographs Division online
catalog, and especially for the WTC,

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.940
we have a kind of sequence

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.450
for the same [inaudible]
upload a little bit, quickly.

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:11.660 position:56%
So if you go to the LOC.gov/pictures
and then do the search,

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:20.370
and then you can see all of
these World Trade Center series

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:21.670
by location.

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:23.800
So please play around
and you will see more

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.810
and more pictures of the Camilo.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.110
[laughs] Great, cheers.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.720
And thank you for coming
to this lecture,

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.740
and books are available outside of
this building and in the hallway.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.040
Camilo is ready to sign
on the book for you.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.340
So thank you again, and thank you.

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.640
&gt;&gt; Camilo Vergara: Thank you.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.940
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank you.

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.540
Visit us at LOC.gov.
