Mellon we thought that a panel session

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869
Mellon we thought that a panel session
 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.109
Mellon we thought that a panel session
on art and technology was ideal for many

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119
on art and technology was ideal for many
 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.450
on art and technology was ideal for many
reasons first and foremost is that these

perfect theme but equally what's

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269
perfect theme but equally what's
 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.939
perfect theme but equally what's
important to me about this subject is

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949
important to me about this subject is
 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.979
important to me about this subject is
that if you go back through humanity

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
that if you go back through humanity
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.420
that if you go back through humanity
that you know through the history you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430
that you know through the history you
 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.240
that you know through the history you
know millions of years ago and you look

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250
know millions of years ago and you look
 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.580
know millions of years ago and you look
at sort of how human beings evolved it

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590
at sort of how human beings evolved it
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.590
at sort of how human beings evolved it
seems that there are two things that the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600
seems that there are two things that the
 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.840
seems that there are two things that the
human beings did that make us uniquely

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850
human beings did that make us uniquely
 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.999
human beings did that make us uniquely
human one of them is we develop

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009
human one of them is we develop
 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.890
human one of them is we develop
technology unlike really any other

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
technology unlike really any other
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.410
technology unlike really any other
animal species we developed technologies

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420
animal species we developed technologies
 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.050
animal species we developed technologies
that you know help us eat help us hunt

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
that you know help us eat help us hunt
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.120
that you know help us eat help us hunt
and that makes a lot of sense and then

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130
and that makes a lot of sense and then
 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.700
and that makes a lot of sense and then
we do this other thing we make art which

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710
we do this other thing we make art which
 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.950
we do this other thing we make art which
seems to have less evolutionary value

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960
seems to have less evolutionary value
 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080
seems to have less evolutionary value
yet it turns out we do it anyway and we

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
yet it turns out we do it anyway and we
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.359
yet it turns out we do it anyway and we
do it with great passion and in fact we

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369
do it with great passion and in fact we
 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.010
do it with great passion and in fact we
build as I tell my daughters who are

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
build as I tell my daughters who are
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.190
build as I tell my daughters who are
artists and my wife I say you know not

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
artists and my wife I say you know not
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.109
artists and my wife I say you know not
only did we we do this art but we build

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119
only did we we do this art but we build
 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.030
only did we we do this art but we build
these museums and people spend millions

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040
these museums and people spend millions
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.010
these museums and people spend millions
and millions of dollars to an art so

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020
and millions of dollars to an art so
 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.480
and millions of dollars to an art so
there must be something very very

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490
there must be something very very
 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.340
there must be something very very
important to human beings about art and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350
important to human beings about art and
 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.889
important to human beings about art and
again that was thinking about this panel

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899
again that was thinking about this panel
 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.700
again that was thinking about this panel
I thought it would be really interesting

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710
I thought it would be really interesting
 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.340
I thought it would be really interesting
to to kind of look at that so Carnegie

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
to to kind of look at that so Carnegie
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.560
to to kind of look at that so Carnegie
Mellon's a unique institution because it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570
Mellon's a unique institution because it
 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.030
Mellon's a unique institution because it
has great strengths in both of these

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040
has great strengths in both of these
 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.520
has great strengths in both of these
areas and as I think as you'll see with

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530
areas and as I think as you'll see with
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.709
areas and as I think as you'll see with
tonight's panel the crossover between

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719
tonight's panel the crossover between
 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.109
tonight's panel the crossover between
art and technology at Carnegie Mellon is

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
art and technology at Carnegie Mellon is
 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.060
art and technology at Carnegie Mellon is
stronger than ever and the boundary

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
stronger than ever and the boundary
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.300
stronger than ever and the boundary
between the two is blurrier than ever so

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310
between the two is blurrier than ever so
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.570
between the two is blurrier than ever so
I want to show you a little video and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580
I want to show you a little video and
 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.590
I want to show you a little video and
though tonight's panel isn't

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600
though tonight's panel isn't
 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.810
though tonight's panel isn't
specifically about computer-based art it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820
specifically about computer-based art it
 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.950
specifically about computer-based art it
is interesting to trace back to the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
is interesting to trace back to the
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960
is interesting to trace back to the
beginning of when it became possible to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
beginning of when it became possible to
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.850
beginning of when it became possible to
both interact within use computers to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
both interact within use computers to
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.430
both interact within use computers to

know there's just so much data sharing

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880
know there's just so much data sharing
 

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.970
know there's just so much data sharing
and sourcing going on right now and

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:11.980
and sourcing going on right now and
 

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.020
and sourcing going on right now and
that's just going to continue I think to

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.030
that's just going to continue I think to

know so much of our realities is going

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:20.770
know so much of our realities is going
 

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.860
know so much of our realities is going
to actually be augmented you know so

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:22.870
to actually be augmented you know so
 

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.140
to actually be augmented you know so
much it was going to be digital where we

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:25.150
much it was going to be digital where we
 

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.380
much it was going to be digital where we
can share and communicate and create our

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:28.390
can share and communicate and create our
 

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.800
can share and communicate and create our
own stories together and over time it

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:31.810
own stories together and over time it
 

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.710
own stories together and over time it
doesn't have to be real time it could be

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720
doesn't have to be real time it could be
 

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.410
doesn't have to be real time it could be
well real time but the spread spread out

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:37.420
well real time but the spread spread out
 

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.300
well real time but the spread spread out
over time so I just think that there's

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.310
over time so I just think that there's
 

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.040
over time so I just think that there's
so much cool stuff happening right now

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.050
so much cool stuff happening right now
 

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.250
so much cool stuff happening right now
that will continue to put people in

them right thank you okay now what I'd
like to do is I have questions directed

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:56.140
like to do is I have questions directed
 

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.410
like to do is I have questions directed
for each of the panelists and hopefully

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:58.420
for each of the panelists and hopefully
 

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.570
for each of the panelists and hopefully
relevant to really what each of them has

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:00.580
relevant to really what each of them has
 

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.490
