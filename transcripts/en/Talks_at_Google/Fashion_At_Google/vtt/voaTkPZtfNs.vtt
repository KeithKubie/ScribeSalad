00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.920
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay, so this is the first
inaugural Fashion@Google talk and I'd like

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.880
to introduce to you Sheena Matheiken. She
did a pretty unique, interesting project that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.020
became very popular and she's gonna tell us
all about it today.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.080
And, yeah, hold down the applause. It's alright
she's -- [laughs]

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080
[someone cheering]

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080
[laughing]

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.080
&gt;&gt;female voice: More, more.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.080
Okay, here she is, Sheena Matheiken.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.600
&gt;&gt;Sheena Matheiken: So I wanna tell you a
little story about a little black dress and

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:47.059
where it all started and how it started. And
not unlike a lot of creative endeavors, this

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:56.079
project, dubbed "The Uniform Project" also
started in a place of dissatisfaction, deep

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:05.790
seated dissatisfaction mainly from being in
a career that you're unhappy with, that has

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.439
let, oop, sorry. I have something on my screen,
sorry.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.000
Mainly dissatisfaction with a lot of things,
a certain apathy, creative stagnation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.900
I worked in advertising for a long time and
I had sort of hit a point of complete creative

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.869
death as you call it, and wanted to sort of
step out of that and do something different

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.490
and also something a little bit more consequential,
but didn't really know how to go about it.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.560
So started thinking about this and tried to
figure out what am I really learning from

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.619
the industry I was in. And probably one of
the best lessons I learned which was very

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.840
well captured by Hugh MacLeod was that if
you, as you can see, if you talk to people

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.310
the way advertising talked to people, you
will get punched in the face.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.219
So what do you do with the skill sets I had
and how could I turn it around and stop manipulating

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.450
people into buying things that they didn't
want or didn't need and instead use it for

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.060
something a little bit more meaningful for
me? [clears throat] And that's where it began.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:23.790
So I started looking at the whole notion of
charity which I found really problematic because

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.489
there was something wrong with the models
of philanthropy. I felt that it was a very

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.819
paternalistic, patronizing approach to the
notion of giving which Oscar Wilde actually

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.190
speaks about it very eloquently. "It is much
easier to have sympathy with suffering than

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.890
it is to have sympathy with thought."

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.310
And this really struck a chord because it
really, I found it really, really relevant

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.319
in today's context because now we're in a
time where, because of the Web, everyone's

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.890
a lot more aware of social issues and there's
definitely, there's a ground swell of wanting

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.410
to do something about it and people sort of
coming together and there's a lot of trends

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.959
happening in digital philanthropy. And there's
what we call the clicktivism culture which

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:21.470
sort of in itself is problematic because it
is, it had sort of replaced an easy way to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.400
like sort of absolve yourself by, "Okay, I'll
make a quick donation here, quick donation

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.489
there. It's all done." And it was, it didn't
really get to the root of the problem which

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.659
was that it was impersonal, like there was
no real connection to what you were giving

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.760
to or where it was going, none of that really
existed.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.080
So this whole model of giving that I found
really problematic because it was again this

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:54.530
top down, the privileged giving to the underprivileged.
And it just doesn't seem right in this day

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.110
and age because we were so much more connected
today and there is no us and them -- it's

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.970
more us, a lot of us.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.240
So it was more about creating a sharing model
where the grounds for the, it was an even

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.380
playing ground and it was more of whatever
it is, whether it was an idea, it was a concept,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.900
it was a cause, it was a philosophy. It was
more about sharing it than sort of dictating

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.820
it or handing it down. And so these were the
ideas I had floating around in my head. Obviously

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.490
not as well articulated. This is in hindsight
looking and kind of making sense of where

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.080
it all came from.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.330
So then I started thinking about, "Okay how
do I do this?" But the main issue I had with

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.310
charity also was that it was so serious, everyone
approached it, it was somber, there was weight

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.870
to it, that you were doing something good.
And did it have to be that way? Why couldn't

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.970
it be fun? Why couldn't it be just something
people get excited about? And that's where

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.460
I started thinking about a medium that I found
fun, which was fashion.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.460
But you start thinking about fashion and you
realize, okay, this is a hugely problematic

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.860
field, a hugely problematic industry. And
I'm taking a quote slightly out of context

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.430
but it still really applies: Marcel Duchamp
said, "Living is more of a question of what

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:25.050
one spends than what one makes." And we have
become, it's so true because we are today

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.419
a culture that is defined by what we consume
not by what we create. So fashion by definition

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.460
is a toxic industry, probably the most toxic
in terms of the landfill it creates and the

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.460
overconsumption.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.910
But I was really more interested in fashion
from one of its core values which was really

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:57.699
about self expression. And I do think that
there is, it is probably the most approachable,

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:03.509
most accessible and radically democratic form
of self expression, fashion, which is accessible

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.240
to anybody, everyone does it, it's part of
your daily routine. So that's where it struck

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.169
a chord. I'm like, "Okay, I'm gonna use a
daily routine. Take this act of dressing up

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.840
every day and do something fun with it."

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.620
And that's sort of how it all started. So
I decided to give myself a creative challenge.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.160
And I said, "Alright I'm gonna challenge myself
to wear the same little black dress every

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.410
day for 365 days." And I would reinvent it
every day, make it look different without

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.620
buying anything new. So I was only allowed
to accessorize with found things, pre-owned,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.710
donated, thrifted, vintage, all those categories.
These were all pre-defined.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.961
And I designed the whole challenge to become
a fund raiser for a foundation called The

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:58.819
Akanksha Foundation which is based in India
and they support education for underprivileged

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.699
children in India.

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.300
And this is a foundation I knew about through
a friend of mine and they have an incredibly

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.820
progressive education model. They proved to
the government that it is not a money issue

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.449
necessarily. They'd spend exact amount that
the Indian government spends in a public school

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.020
on a child, and they use the same amount of
money to create a completely different education

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.610
model to show that it's really -- the challenges
of education isn't just a money issue it's

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.800
about the methods you teach and it's a question
of resources, [clears throat]. Excuse me.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.199
So they've proven to be incredibly successful
in 20 years and now have developed their own

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.099
curriculum, are building their own schools.
So it's a great progressive, wonderfully,

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:49.050
enabling initiative which is why I chose to
support Akanksha.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:55.970
So that was the set up, and then I started
in May 2009 was the beginning of the project

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.190
and we made a little movie that sort of sums
it up. So I'm just gonna play it and then

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.750
we can take it from there.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.900
[slow, pensive music getting faster and upbeat]

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.290
[lyrics start at Day 32]

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:24.699
"Well you didn't wake up this morning
'cause you didn't go to bed

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:33.479

This is the day (this is the day) your life

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:24.380
&gt;&gt;Sheena Matheiken: So how did we do this?

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:31.920
It was all set up pretty straight forward.
We designed a website. I would post pictures

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.470
everyday of the dailies, and you could donate
through PayPal directly to the cause. You

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:44.260
could comment -- we created all these fun
tags to comment. You could tag them "baddie",

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.160
"brave", "cute", "ugly", "try harder", or
make up your own tags which became incredibly

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.149
popular with the community of followers because
people got very excited about comin' up with

00:12:54.149 --> 00:13:01.560
their own sort of pop culture references,
very interesting things in ways, sorry excuse

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:08.610
me, to define the outfits. So it was actually
really fun.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:13.910
And all I did really was to start blogging
about it and Tweeted it every day, Facebooked

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.670
it every day. Friends picked it up. Soon blogs
picked it up, and it completely became viral.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:24.350
And people started writing about it and then
the press picked it up and we didn't do any

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.490
PR or anything. It was just purely viral,
purely through bloggers who found it interesting.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:36.889
And that's how it picked up. And by the end
of the project, we had raised over $100,000

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:41.709
for Akanksha which put over 300 kids in school.

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:50.100
And the other part of this whole exercise
was the dress itself which there was huge

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:56.270
demand by the end of this. In the course of
the project people kept asking us, excuse

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.600
me, "Are you gonna make the dress? Are you
gonna produce the dress?" So there was a lot

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:06.800
of, it was a very interesting dilemma for
me because the whole purpose of this project

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.670
was to, one side of it was to sort of make
a statement about overconsumption. So to be

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:21.040
faced with this new sort of demand for a product
that we had created inadvertently was interesting.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.540
And so through the course of the project,
a few people had come together to help me

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.709
and we had sort of really become the team,
The Uniform Project Team. And we really started

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:37.140
thinking about, "What does that mean? Like
do we produce? Do we actually produce a product

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.610
and put this out?"

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.399
And we put a lot of thought into it and we
recognized that it was a very meaningful thing

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:50.610
to do to actually create a limited edition
set of dresses which we produced and we put

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:55.110
it out and a portion of it also went to the
fund raiser. So it helped us raise more money

00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:03.540
and it sold out really, really quickly. And
we also got hundreds and hundreds of accessory

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:11.519
donations from all over the world. Which initially
I had put up this link almost as a joke as

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:17.120
part of the site on top of you'll see there's
a little "Donate Accessories" button, which

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.850
was really to encourage my friends to give
me shit to wear. Oops I just cursed. So because

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.839
I knew I couldn't get through the whole year
with just the stuff in my wardrobe.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:35.990
But it turned out that I was speaking to a
lot more people than just my friends and my

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:41.589
inbox was bombarded with people wanting to
send us stuff to wear, for me to wear. So

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:46.500
we had to go through and pick a lot of stuff
out and carefully curate it because the whole

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.870
purpose of this was not to accumulate more
stuff.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.930
So what we did at the end of the year was
auction off all those donated accessories

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.699
and that money went to the foundation as well
which again got snatched up by the community

00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:05.740
which was fantastic. And got over two million
hits over the course of the first year and

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.100
now we have a great following online that
continues [clears throat] to follow us.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:21.720
So by May 2010, last year which is when I
finished the project, this was the big gaping

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.740
question -- what do you do now? What do I
do with this? We had inadvertently created

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.339
this sort of a movement almost, but a brand
that people sort of associated with. We had

00:16:34.339 --> 00:16:39.380
made product so there was potential for this
to become a business, but we didn't wanna

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.440
really lose the integrity of why this was
successful. And we were really trying to put

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.420
a lot of rigor into thinking about what we
were as a brand and what it meant.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.040
And I'd be really wary to stand here and tell
you the recipe for success and why this worked

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.410
because I don't think we really know hundred
percent. I think the minute you figure it

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:06.920
out, you kinda lose the fun of it. And I think
but there are to quote Idris Mootee who the

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:15.589
founder of Idea Couture who is a pretty incredible
expert on branding and branding strategy.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:20.180
He says that, "brand is more than the sum
of its parts." And there's so much truth to

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:28.339
it in that you can't really -- you can identify
the components but when you add it all up,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.600
it doesn't necessarily have to work. So there's
something much bigger than the sum of its

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.760
parts that go into these things.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.510
So for us it was more about identifying what
those things were but also to identify what

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:46.840
are the things that we had most fun with and
why was it fun for people. And what were the

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.660
values that made it what it was? And so we
identified a bunch of things that it was about

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.560
really and that made it, the values that really
made it sticky and fun for people and that's

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.850
sort of where we started thinking about what
do we do next.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:09.429
And when I think about The Uniform Project
or what it was, and we've asked a lot of people,

00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:14.380
these are things that came to us, like this
is the stuff that our community told us. It's

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.179
visual, it's viral, it's personal, it's accessible,
it's participatory, it's simple, it's social,

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:21.070
it's addictive.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:27.400
So from there we decided let's not reinvent
anything, let's do what we're doing and take

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.430
what I did and ask other people to do it.
So why not open it up, open up the platform,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.090
have more women do this because we kept getting
requests for people wanting to do it. And

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.630
but how to you curate it because it's not
just about anyone being able to do it. How

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.299
do you still keep it interesting?

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:51.309
So we launched our second year early, sorry,
late last year as called "The Pilot Series"

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:56.780
where we have now one woman taking on the
challenge for one month and they pick the

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.039
cause and we work with them on the dress design.
It's still the little black dress.

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:07.789
The idea of the black dress is so integral
to this whole theme because for us, from a

00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:14.720
fashion standpoint, it is such an iconic fashion
staple. It is at the center of most -- a lot

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.340
of women in their wardrobes have a little
black dress. It is the perfect jumping board

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:25.600
to build off of. So that is the idea and the
whole exercise is really about the art of

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.250
accessorizing and doing it responsibly and
smartly and creatively.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.260
So this is the challenge. Now we have different
women taking on the challenge every month.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:40.169
We release the dresses every month as well.
And we have -- every month there's a new face

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:46.150
on the site and it keeps growing. We have
a few -- we're looking into scaling this even

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.560
further and we have a few other things we're
working on as well currently.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:57.750
So the real journey for us is really just
getting started. And it's really an evolution

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.820
and it's an exploration right now of where
we could go and that's really the most exciting

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.620
part that's come out of this for me personally
is that it has actually led me here to be

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.030
able to leave what I used to do before I quit
my job, and now I'm doing this full time which

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.030
is amazing.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.350
And I have this incredible team that's come
together and we've formed a business and it's

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:23.010
got a really strong social component to it.
We're really strong on our philosophy about

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.570
maintaining that social innovation side, the
social responsibility side, and continuing

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.010
to do something that remains fun at its core.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:39.300
So that's really where we are. And I, again
I'm quoting Idris Mootee again but this is

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:46.679
just such a great slide that I totally stole
it from one of his presentations. It's really

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:53.120
the most important thing is those three dots
'cause a story has to evolve, it has to continue,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.720
and it has to grow whether it's a brand or
a business or a philosophy or an idea. It

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.559
has to keep growing. So like that's the most
exciting part of all this for us and that's

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:08.240
where we are.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.270
And that's it.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.270
[pause]

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.270
[applause]

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:23.032
And here's some information if you'd like
to reach out to us.

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.032
[applause]

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:25.032
Cool.

00:21:25.032 --> 00:21:26.032
&gt;&gt;commentator: [unintellgible]

00:21:26.032 --> 00:21:27.032
I don't know. Do you guys have questions or
anything?

00:21:27.032 --> 00:21:28.032
&gt;&gt;female #1: Where'd you get the first dress
from? Did you make it?

00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:29.032
&gt;Sheena Matheiken: Oh right. So the dress,
yes, we designed it ourselves. I had the idea,

00:21:29.032 --> 00:21:30.032
I knew exactly what I wanted. Oh sure.

00:21:30.032 --> 00:21:31.032
[laughs]

00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:35.650
I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted ů
This was sort of based on one of my staple

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:41.220
dresses So you know what works for you. But
I wanted it to be reversible so it's actually

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.640
reversible. I can wear it front to back and
it's a button down so I can wear it open as

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.460
a tunic, I can layer it, it has pockets. So
it's really a pretty classic A-line standard

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.730
dress which is now on our site. We have a
new iteration of it. We've added a detachable

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.620
collar to it. So I think utility, versatility,
simplicity, those were like key elements of

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620
all our dresses which we try to maintain always.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.620
[pause]

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620
Yes.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:25.980
&gt;&gt;female #2: Can you talk more about the sustainability
aspect 'cause it was obvious to me that it

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.580
was a project to show what sustainability
could be versus what I think most people think

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.580
it is?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.841
&gt;&gt;Sheena Matheiken: Right. That's a very interesting
question. I think when I started this, I was

00:22:32.841 --> 00:22:41.360
very, very conscious of the existence of the
eco-movement. I wouldn't necessarily say I

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.471
was part of it. I mean I wasn't really part
of the fashion industry at all so for me it

00:22:45.471 --> 00:22:50.820
was a very personal thing. But I was already
in the habit of shopping vintage and I shop

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.530
at thrift stores and vintage, and so it was
a natural sort of progression of, extension

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.380
of what I was doing.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:04.049
But what I learned through the year was that
there was this really substantial movement

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:11.440
happening. And in the course of the first
year, a lot of ethical designers and sustainable

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.340
designers came to us 'cause they found it
really, they were excited about what we were

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:23.090
doing because there's -- the people who are
at the front lines, the creative folk at the

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:30.010
front lines of that movement, there was almost
a dissatisfaction on their end to not be just

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:35.540
labeled as "eco" because there was a stigma
attached to that movement because it was labeled

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:42.190
as Birkenstocks, granola, fashion which just
wasn't inspiring. And which is why mainstream

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.250
wasn't accepting it as a movement.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.750
So I think the more creative, ethical designers
were really about keep it creative, keep it

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:55.780
inspiring 'cause at the core of fashion for
women is desire. You wanna walk into a store

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.350
and see something and see that's it beautiful
and pick it up. You're not gonna walk into

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:05.340
a store and go, "What's organic here?" You're
not gonna do that. So you still have to inspire.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.210
You still have to create beautiful garment.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:14.770
So personally for us it was great because
we suddenly got access to the right kind of

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:20.610
ethical designers who came to us 'cause they
got it. They got that this was about expression

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.720
and we had to sort of uphold that and the
rest is a given. I mean to me it should be

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:32.360
a given. Like sustainability as far as production
goes and ethical practices go, it should be

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.460
a given. Like you have to be responsible in
the way you produce and create things.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:43.200
So now we're actually building something based
on that with these designers. We're in the

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.751
process of creating a platform for ethical
designers which is in the works so that's

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:47.751
 -- I don't know if that really answers your
question. Okay.

00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:48.751
Cool.

00:24:48.751 --> 00:24:52.200
&gt;&gt;female #3: Would it work for you?

00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:00.169
&gt;&gt;Sheena Matheiken: Well I think you have
to look at it from two sides. I was out to

00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:04.400
make a point. It's an extreme. Obviously no
one's gonna wear the same dress for a whole

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.400
year. It's a creative exercise. So there is
a certain sort of stretch of the imagination

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.690
and stretch of your resources happening there.
I'm not saying that's what you should do every

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.240
day. It's not a literal iteration. So that's
the one side.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.460
And the other side is I mean I'm down to my
basics again. Everything that came into my

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.000
wardrobe is gone because they were all donated
accessories and to be really honest with you

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.200
I don't have that many clothes. I don't think
about it. I actually don't think about dressing

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.159
up a lot at all.

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:38.190
I get up. It's like literally, "What am I
wearing today?" and I'm out. And I think that's

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:43.070
how a lot of people are and that's sort of
 -- but it's not that I don't have fun with

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:48.530
it. And it's really like, throughout the process
in the first year, 'cause I did still have

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.110
my full time job, it was very important for
me to keep that daily routine spontaneous

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:58.169
so I didn't plan ahead accept for the crazy
days like Halloween and the Mermaid Parade

00:25:58.169 --> 00:25:59.860
and things like that when I got crazy.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:04.429
But for the most part, it was deliberately
kept spontaneous, excuse me, because that's

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:09.140
how most people get ready in the morning.
And I think there's a lot -- there were -- very

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.809
often I would get stumped and I would just
sort work with something that I never thought

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:18.870
I would use in that way and it would end up
working. So I think there's a lot you can

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.990
stretch given the few accessories that you
do have.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.419
And I think that's actually a really interesting
point because now we're doing it for one month

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:32.900
and you can see how the women do it differently,
but they have limited -- most of them don't

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.390
go out and buy a lot of new stuff just for
that month. You're kind of working with what's

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.860
in your wardrobe a lot so.
