00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.387
SPEAKER: Please welcome
Richard Wolff to Google.

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:10.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.270
RICHARD WOLFF: OK, thank
you all for spending time,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.350
a little bit, with me.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.090
Let me tell you
exactly what I'm going

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.880
to do, and then try to do it.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.810
I want to tell you about the
economic system in which you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.700
live.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.670
And like any object of people
trying to figure things out,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.340
there have been
differences about how

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.699
to understand economic
systems from the beginning.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.490
I don't want to bore
you by taking you back

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.900
to any economics class you may
remember having had in college.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.560
If your experience
was like mine,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.660
this is a memory you'd
rather not bring back.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.640
For good reason, usually.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.500
But if some of it is
still in your mind,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.260
you may recall that people like
Adam Smith, and David Ricardo,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.912
and Karl Marx, and John
Stuart Mill, and John Keynes,

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:11.370
and a whole lot of other people
whose names you've probably

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.350
heard all tried to
analyze the economy.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.390
But they ended up,
many of them, doing it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.590
in radically different ways.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.810
And I mean really different.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.150
They didn't see
the same thing when

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.470
they looked at the economy.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.630
They didn't understand the
mechanisms that make it work.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.130
They didn't understand in the
same way where it was going.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.950
That is, it's been a
field characterized

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.560
by fundamental differences.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.190
As big a difference
as whether you believe

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.410
the sun goes around the
Earth or the other way

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.370
around and many other
examples that I could give.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.430
And that's never changed.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.770
Economics has been
what philosophers

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.630
call an agonistic field, a
place in which different ways

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.510
of understanding the economy
contest with one another,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.750
fight it out.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.010
Some win, some lose.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.490
And those losers sometimes
come back and win later.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.560
Let me give you an example
that you may know about.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.830
Because of the Great
Depression of the 1930s,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.010
the confidence in
the capitalist system

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.740
being able to solve its problems
as they arose collapsed.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.160
From 1929 to 1941,
the United States

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.180
had unemployment rates
hovering around 20% to 25%.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.690
That's five or six times the
unemployment we have now.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.340
And what we have
now is a problem.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.290
Try to imagine that.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.030
Those were years,
the 1930s, when

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.950
the total output of
goods and services

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.770
shrank each year from what
it was the year before.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.740
It's not surprising
that people who

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.570
were living in a
capitalist system

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.500
worked like that, raised
lots of questions.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.950
And then there were those who
believed, "on no, it's OK.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.360
It's just a temporary thing,
nothing to worry about.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.140
The system is wonderfully
configured in such a way

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.300
that it can solve its
problems and it will.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.620
Just wait six months, a year,
another year, and so on."

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.720
But there were too many people
suffering too much to wait.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.210
And one, a brilliant
one, a fellow in England

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.660
named John Maynard Keynes,
basically had the courage

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.180
to stand up and say, "the
system isn't working,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.800
and if we continue to
keep our faith in it,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.860
despite the fact that it
isn't working in obvious ways

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.990
that we can see every day,"--

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.980
he mentioned, by the way, people
sleeping in doorways in London.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.950
He was British.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.850
People out of work in huge
numbers, people whose wages

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.090
were going down, not up
et cetera, et cetera--

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.037
He said, if we don't
face it, there's

00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:51.870
going to be a revolution
and we're not going

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.670
to have any capitalism at all.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.580
He liked capitalism,
but he felt that letting

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.730
things be handled by
the private sector

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.640
was self-destructive lunacy.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.040
And he developed an
analysis which we now

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.290
call Keynesian economics.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.260
But it saw the economy
radically different from what

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.550
preceded it.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.430
And that Keynesian became
the dominant economics

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.149
in the world, for most of
the period roughly the 1940s

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.529
to the 1970s.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.750
And then it was all
pushed out, and we

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.530
had a return of what
existed before the 1930s.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.560
It was almost as if the
memory of the Great Depression

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600
and all the troubles it had--

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.120
and by the way, if
you're interested,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.460
John Steinbeck is a good
one to read, give you

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.960
a feeling of the
Great Depression,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.900
if you've never read that,
or seen the movies of "Grapes

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.360
of Wrath," "Of Mice and Men."

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.620
In the 1970s, it all
went the other way.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.010
The Keynesians were
dethroned, and we

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.380
started looking at the economy
again in a different way.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.560
That's the time of
Reagan and Thatcher.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.830
The private economy,
which had been excoriated

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.170
for failing in the
Great Depression,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.870
was suddenly
rehabilitated and made

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.940
the be all and end all that
would solve everything.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.880
'70s, '80s, '90s.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.350
It would have continued, except
in 2008, this capitalist system

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.380
we live in crashed again.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.590
The second time in 75 years.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.786
We're talking a major collapse.

00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:28.160
For those of you
who don't follow

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.370
these things, in
the autumn of 2008,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.820
September to December,
here in New York,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.830
we came that close
to an economy that

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.810
would have stopped functioning.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.230
By stopped functioning, I
mean the kinds of things

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.550
you don't think can happen.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.500
But we came that close.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.190
No milk, no bread,
no buses, no nothing.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.290
Terrible.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.200
We're still in the
after effects of that.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.380
Here we are, almost
a decade later.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.880
Like the Great Depression, it
has raised again the question,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.720
"gee, what about this
economic system?"

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.160
Only, now we have to ask
it in a different way.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.000
And that's really what I
want to talk to you about.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.200
Because we can't go back
and repeat our own history.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.860
We can't now say, oh, let's
bring the government back in,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.680
the way Keynes believed
you needed to do.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.340
Fix this capitalist system,
manage this capitalist system.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.560
Because if you
leave it to itself,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.410
if you leave it to the
business community,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.380
look what happened
in 1929, and look

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.920
what happened in 2008 again.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.470
And these are cataclysms.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.260
You read every few weeks now
about an election, like the one

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.710
a couple of weeks ago in France,
in which the entire society is

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.100
being roiled around
by the consequences

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.010
of an economic system that
isn't working real well,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.790
and is producing new kinds
of political characters.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.420
Even here in the
United States, we

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.670
have what at least
most of us think

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:09.180
of as a pretty weird political
scene these days, don't we?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.630
And that's not just because
a particular fellow got in.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.700
It's because of
all the conditions

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.690
that made it possible
for him to get in

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.960
and to do what he's doing.

00:07:21.822 --> 00:07:23.730
OK.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.830
So let's talk about
this capitalist system,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.160
remembering that people
have always disagreed.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.280
The debates were not
only between those

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.500
who loved capitalism
and felt it should

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.440
be handled by the private
business community

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.710
being able to do its thing.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.110
"Deregulate, let the economy
work" versus the Keynesians,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.760
who loved the system
but said in order

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.343
to make it work, the government
has to come in and make things

00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:53.550
happen, because left to
itself, the system collapses

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.940
like in 2009 and 2008.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.480
Turns out, those were not
the only two perspectives.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.130
There's also a perspective that
says the problems of capitalism

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.190
go far deeper than
whether or not

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.710
there's more or less
government intervention.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.060
For such people, this
whole issue is secondary.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.870
What's their point of view?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.380
And it's the one I want to
present to you a little bit.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.535
Their point of
view is that if you

00:08:24.535 --> 00:08:26.910
look at the capitalist system,
with or without government

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.220
intervention, all the
key levers of power

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.510
are in the hands of the people
who run that institution which

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.210
is now the place where
most production of goods

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.780
and services happens.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.500
And that institution is
called the corporation,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.530
the capitalist corporation.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.150
We are discussing this in
one of them, aren't we?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.810
It is a powerful
institution, as you all know.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.730
And so this approach says, let's
take a look at how it works

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.320
and see what consequences
come from that.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.090
Before I do it, I need to
tell you honestly and clearly

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.630
where this approach comes
from this, this looking

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.260
at the organization
of production

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.960
as it is done in a
corporation which

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.070
is the dominant form
of modern capitalism.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.660
The origin of this
way of thinking

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.650
is in the hands of
critics of capitalism.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.460
This point of view comes from
people down through a couple

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.790
hundred years of capitalism
has been the dominant system

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.400
in the world.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.490
It's not very old.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.670
Like every other system,
slavery, feudalism,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.950
any of the others,
capitalism has always

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.700
had people who love it
and people who hate it.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.640
Just about like everything else.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.290
Critics, admirers,
celebrants, skeptics.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.700
And what I'm about
to tell you is

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.340
there's a tradition, which
some of you I'm sure know,

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.120
of criticism of capitalism.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.970
It has many contributors,
but the name

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:14.220
that has come to dominate
is the name of Karl Marx.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.850
And this is often called
Marxian economics,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.310
in the sense that it's
influenced more or less

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.500
that varies from individual to
individual by the critical way

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:32.242
that Karl Marx developed
his analysis of capitalism.

00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:34.200
I'm not sure whether I
should take a moment now

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.950
to remind you all of
who Karl Marx was,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.730
but then again, maybe
it's worthwhile.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.700
Karl Marx was born in 1818.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.510
That's very important, because
that's the first generation

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.160
after the French Revolution.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.830
And Marx was a
tremendous admirer

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.380
of the French
Revolution, the slogans

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.720
on the banners of the
French, "liberty, equality,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.690
fraternity," those were the
three words of that revolution

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:06.440
in 1789, were absolutely the
love of the whole generation

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.605
of which Marx was a part.

00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:11.480
And they all understood
the French Revolution

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.320
pretty much in the same way,
that what the French did

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.680
was to get rid of
feudalism, the old system,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.010
and bring in capitalism,
the new system.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:26.100
And that by doing so, they would
bring in liberty, equality,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.200
and fraternity.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.140
Or to use the modern
language, a democratic system.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.070
Marx came a little later.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.220
So Marx was able, by the
time he becomes a young man,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.760
to see about 50 years worth
of development of capitalism

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.260
in Europe.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.980
It began in England, moved to
France and the Low Countries,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.070
and then spread eventually
to the whole world.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.640
Marx was 50 years in.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.275
Now, he looked around
Western Germany,

00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:00.010
that's where he was born,
France, where he lived a bit,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.069
and then in England, where he
lived most of his adult life.

00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:04.610
He looked around
and he-- by the way,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.860
that's the England of Dickens.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.560
So if you want to understand
what he was saying,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.520
remember "Oliver Twist."

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.620
The England of his time
was certainly capitalist.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.150
Feudalism was gone.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.600
So was Paris.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.260
So it was Frankfurt.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.420
Marx acknowledged
that capitalism was

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.380
a dynamic, developing system.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.310
But where was the liberty,
equality, and fraternity?

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.710
Nowhere.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.550
There wasn't any.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.835
Again, if you want to see
what I mean, read Dickens.

00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:41.910
He'll describe to you the
absence of liberty, equality,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.940
and fraternity in 25 ways.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.550
Or, if you want
the French version,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.650
Balzac, or Zola, or
any of the others who

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.470
were writing about
these periods.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.990
So Marx, young radical that he
was, from an upper middle class

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.120
family, educated at
the university, which

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.120
means he's one of the
3% or 4% of the people

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.830
who had such an
education at that time,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.140
he drew a conclusion.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.180
The French Revolution was
wonderful for bringing

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.840
in capitalism, but
capitalism, it turned out,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.160
was not the vehicle or the
means to bring people liberty,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.660
equality, or fraternity.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.930
And so his life work was to
answer the question, "why not?"

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.440
What is it about capitalism
in the 19th century,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.680
which is when he lived,
that prevented it

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.190
from bringing the liberty,
equality, fraternity,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.307
democracy, all those
wonderful things?

00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:48.015
And I'm going to tell
you his conclusion,

00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:50.790
and then we're going to go
back and see how he got to it

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.850
and why he got to it.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.850
His conclusion was
that capitalism was not

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.510
only unable to bring
it, but that capitalism

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.250
was a fundamental obstacle
to ever achieving it.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.010
And that therefore the human
race, if it wanted liberty,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.130
equality, fraternity,
and democracy,

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.460
would have to devise a system
other and different from

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:20.320
capitalism, or else spend its
entire lives bumping up against

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.060
the limits of a system that
cannot allow for, has never

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.130
allowed for liberty, equality,
fraternity, or democracy.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.280
Not really.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.680
OK, so how does
Marx get to this?

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.040
And why am I going to present
an analysis of it to you?

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.450
Well, let's go back to the
corporation, that instrument,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.510
that institution through
which goods and services are

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.060
produced.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.560
Everything.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.726
Everything Google makes is
the product of the Google

00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:55.980
Corporation, which the Google
Corporation makes sure we know.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.240
As all other
corporations do likewise.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.570
It's the institutional form
in which the work gets done.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.640
The more materials, the
tools, the equipment

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.760
to produce the output, which is
then marketed around the world.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.090
That's how it's done.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:17.190
And in Marx's image, in Marx's
head, therein lies the problem.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.990
How is that organized?

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.190
Let's look, he said,
closely into this.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.770
And then, he did.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.750
And again, I'm going to
save us a lot of time

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:35.230
by summarizing what he found
and why it's so relevant.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.080
His analysis goes
something like this.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.860
The workplace, the
corporation, but by the way,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.840
it applies if you're
not incorporated,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.690
if you are an unincorporated
business, or a partnership,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.290
or a family outfit, the
analysis applies there too.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.290
But since most production
in the United States

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.420
is organized in corporations,
and more and more

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.570
around the world too, that's the
appropriate institution for me

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.250
to focus on.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.370
In the corporation,
something very interesting

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.050
happens every day.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.390
The key decision-makers
are two groups of people.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.050
One group are the
shareholders, the people

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.930
who literally, in the
way capitalism works,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.510
own the corporation by
owning shares of it.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.610
They're literally
shares of ownership.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.510
Shares, however, are only owned
in the main by rich people,

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.280
or by a few institutions.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.730
To give you just one statistic
here from the United States,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.440
1% of shareholders own
about 2/3 of the shares.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.460
If you ever wonder who the
1% are that folks talk about,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.950
that's as good a group as any.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.620
They are the major shareholder,
as we call them in economics.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.060
They're literally a handful of
people in most corporations.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.630
That is, your grandmother
may have left you

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.340
when she died 11
shares of something,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.830
but you're not a
major shareholder.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.180
This may come as a shock.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.300
I don't want to upset you, but
you're not a major shareholder.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.760
A major shareholder
owns millions of shares.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.825
It can be a bank.

00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:12.950
It can be a wealthy person.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.609
It can be a foundation
and a variety of holders

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.730
of these major shares.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.390
But it's a tiny group.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.069
20, 50 people,
groups, institutions

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.280
own all the shares.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.920
Except for the handful
that grandmothers

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.239
leave as parting gifts.

00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:35.530
And the way a corporation
works again, for those of you

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.160
not familiar, once a
year, there's an election.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.070
And the shares
vote for something

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.080
called the board of directors.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.330
That's usually a group
of 12 to 20 people.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.800
They're on the
board of directors.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.175
If you ever
wondered, some of you

00:17:53.175 --> 00:17:54.830
may have had as a
career objective

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.810
to become a member of
the board of directors,

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.680
you probably noticed that
that's a good place to be.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.460
And so I'm about to
tell you how to do that.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.660
You have to get elected
by the shareholders.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.620
That's how everybody got there.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.580
Once a year, the
shareholders have a vote.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.870
And here's how the vote works.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.890
You get one vote for
every share you own.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.870
So if your grandmother left you
11 shares, you get 11 votes.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.850
If you are Chase
Manhattan Bank, and you

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.390
own for your various
accounts 27 million shares,

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.140
then the vice president you
send to the annual meeting

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.120
of the shareholders votes
the 20 million shares.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.870
You could think that
you're just like him,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.500
but you understand you're not.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.320
If 1% of the people own
the bulk of the shares,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.490
that's the 1% who decide
all these elections.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.840
And that's indeed how
it normally works.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.870
So the 12 or 15 people that
are on the board of directors,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.390
they make the decisions.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.700
Sometimes with more influence
from the major shareholders,

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.649
if they muddle in there,
sometimes with less.

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:05.690
But it really doesn't
matter, because even if you

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.890
add together the 15
to 20 individuals who

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.320
are on the board of
directors to the 10 or 20

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.260
or 30 individuals who
are major shareholders,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.210
those people, that 50
people, more or less,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:26.240
make all of the key decisions
for every corporation that

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.300
works like this,
which is 99% of them.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.110
Let me be clear with you, so
we all are on the same page.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.220
This board of directors
decides what the company

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.780
produces, what objects are made,
what services and goods are

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.350
produced.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.930
Number two, how they
will be produced,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.570
what technology will be used.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.980
Number three, where the
production will take place.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.140
And finally, what to do with the
profits that all of this work

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.850
generates.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.550
This board of directors
and the major shareholders

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.210
make all those decisions.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.410
Those are the key decisions
any enterprise ever makes.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.310
Meanwhile, there
is a large number

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:19.730
of people, 500, 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, hundreds of thousands,

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:26.830
millions, who are employees
of the corporation.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:32.200
They all, of course, have
to live with the decisions

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.870
that the board of directors and
the major shareholders make.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.430
Well, let's give you an example.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.010
"We're going to close this
factory or office here

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.240
in New York, and we're
going to move it to China.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.830
Have a nice day."

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.950
Or "we're going to
substitute these machines

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.600
for these working
people and lay them off.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.730
Have a nice day."

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.120
"We're going to take the profits
to which the labor of all

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.550
the employees
contributed, and we're

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.860
going to decide to use
it for an advertising

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.440
budget or beautiful
new shrubbery

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.950
outside the main office
or whatever it is we want,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.240
because that's who we are.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.980
We make the decisions."

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.850
Who's the "we?"

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.250
The board of directors,
15 to 20 people,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:24.320
and the major shareholders,
another 20, 30 people.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.330
Marx finds this
intriguing, and so do

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.950
I. This is an
interesting way to make

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.430
the fundamental economic
decisions of a society.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.850
Because what you are
essentially doing and saying,

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.090
whether you face up to
it or not as a culture,

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.450
is that there's going to
be a tiny group of people

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.840
who make all the key decisions
that everybody else has

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.640
to live from on and with.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.000
But now to drive the point
home, the mass of people,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.210
the employees to begin with, but
the larger community in which

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.060
every corporation
lives and functions,

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.430
they all have to live
with the consequences.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.360
But they are excluded
from participating

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.440
in making the decision.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.790
Let me say that again to
make real sure it's with us.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.550
The mass of people in
our economic system

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.300
are required to live with the
consequences of the decisions

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.260
made by the corporate
leadership's decisions

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:37.390
from which they are excluded
legally and in practice,

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.970
de jure and de facto.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:48.990
Whatever else you call this
system, it is not democratic.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.700
In the communities
where we live,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.220
we insist upon having votes.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.320
We say that the mayor,
or the governor,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.840
or the senator, or the
president makes decisions

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.610
that we all have to live with.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.850
And therefore we, who have
to live with the decisions,

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.840
must be able to
participate in making them.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.210
But when we go to work
in a capitalist system,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.720
we cross the threshold
into the office, the store,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.370
or the factory, and we
put all of that aside.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.400
We don't demand it,
We don't require it,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.630
and we don't have it.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.110
Now back to Marx.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.620
Herein, in that situation I just
described summarily for you,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:36.120
Marx said lies the reason why
capitalism, despite its hopes

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.660
and dreams of the people who
brought us capitalism, that it

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.690
would usher in liberty,
equality, fraternity,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.730
has proven itself
unable to do that.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.670
Because it turns
out Marx, argues,

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.970
that if you put the power
of directing what goes on

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.560
in the economy in the hands
of a tiny number of people,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.430
you can't really be
surprised if they

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.960
make the decisions that keeps
them in that charmed place,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.470
can you?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.550
So why are we surprised to
learn, as I'm sure many of you

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.350
know, that over the last
40 years, for example, here

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.350
in the United States,
just to take an example,

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.410
corporations,
boards of directors

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.380
and major shareholders,
have decided

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.910
to take the profits that
everyone helped to produce--

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.420
by the way, do we how
we know that everyone

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.400
helps to produce the profits?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.170
You know how that happens.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.090
That happens every
year, the proof of it,

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.090
at the Christmas party.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.980
That's when the chief executive,
a little wobbly from too much

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.920
punch, gets up on
a chair and thanks

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.540
everybody for the contribution
every person in this firm made

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.730
to our successful year.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.420
And then having thanked you, the
chairman and the other members

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.890
of the board go
off and decide what

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.320
to do with what you
kindly helped to produce.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.850
So it shouldn't
come as a surprise

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.510
if the last 40 years turns
out that what has happened

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.970
is that those corporations,
those boards of directors

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.340
and major shareholders,
decided to take

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.150
a huge part of the
profits that were earned

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:24.160
and give it to themselves,
in the form of dividends

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.830
to shareholders, which
is what they are,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:32.020
and spectacular pay packages
to the chief executives who

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.740
are on boards of directors.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.210
This should surprise nobody.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.050
But let's take some other
examples that are remarkable.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.150
Corporations have
decided, and Google

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.980
is an important player in this,
to do what we call an economics

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.570
automation.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.030
Over the last 30, 40
years, we have really

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.390
replaced huge numbers
of jobs that people

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.446
hold by computers and robots.

00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:02.010
It's very interesting.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.060
That is driven by profit.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.800
The boards of
directors calculate.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.310
They bring in
economists like me,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.970
and they calculate what we
would pay for workers and all

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.870
that versus what it would
cost to buy and maintain

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.490
these computers, these robots,
whatever the automation

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.700
form is.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.560
And they make the
decision based on what's

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.240
better for their profits.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.017
Because that's how
corporations work.

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:26.850
That's what they do.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.490
And then they make an
interesting decision.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.510
If the machinery is more
profitable, they buy it.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.280
They install it.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.760
And they turn to the workers
and they say, "you're fired.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.810
Have a nice day."

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:49.110
And those workers go off
and have maybe a nice day.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.620
Probably not.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.640
They are fired.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.260
They are unemployed.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.610
We have no idea--

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.450
I take that back.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.650
We do know what happens to them.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.260
In stunning numbers,
they get depressed.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.490
They get sick.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.110
They start desperately
looking for jobs.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.000
If they don't find
them pretty soon,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.560
they start being
willing to accept

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.560
jobs that they are
overtrained for,

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.150
jobs they are underpaid
for, etc, etc.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.670
Then they may get angry.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.080
They may do violent things.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.700
The social costs of all
of this are staggering,

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.710
and always have been.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.400
But that's none of the
problem of the corporation.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.760
It bears in a capitalist
system no responsibility

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.960
for that at all.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.940
If there are costs of
laying all those people off,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.190
those are the problems
of those people,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.040
of their friends and
relatives, neighbors

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.950
and the communities in
which they live to struggle

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.810
with as best they can.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.050
Marx says this is
really interesting.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.230
Because in many situations,
it is easy to show,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.672
don't need to be a
Marxist for that,

00:28:05.672 --> 00:28:08.810
that the social costs
of the unemployed

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.360
are much larger than
the profits gained

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.480
by the private corporations
who made the decision

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.370
to fire these people.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.100
But because the private
corporations got the profit

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.330
without having to pay the cost,
it was profitable for them,

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:28.480
even though it was socially
an unprofitable move to make.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.870
That's the way the system works.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.750
OK, now let's put
it all together.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.050
Marx argues that leaving
things in the hands

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.650
of the capitalist corporation,
and you can see now

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.580
why a bit more government
intervention or a bit less

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.237
is really beside the point.

00:28:49.237 --> 00:28:51.320
Because with more or less
government intervention,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.900
you're not changing the basic
way the capitalist enterprise

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.510
is organized, with a
tiny group of people

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.570
making all the key
decisions, and doing so

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.030
in a way that replicates
their situation,

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.200
understandably and unfortunately
replicates that of everybody

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.710
else too along the way.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:18.360
In fact, let's even push it
further, as Marxists should.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.500
If the government
doesn't just regulate,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.060
but let's suppose the government
goes a step further, fires

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.970
all the private
boards of directors,

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:35.240
takes the property away from
the shareholders, and says

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.360
this is now a
government enterprise,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.860
and then puts into
the board of directors

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.050
not individuals elected
by shareholders.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.490
They're all gone.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.550
But officials designated
by the state apparatus.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.174
You 20 people will
now run this factory.

00:29:53.174 --> 00:29:55.590
That's a little bit like what
happened in the Soviet Union

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.480
in 1917.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.100
That didn't work
out too well either.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.330
And why?

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.850
Because it didn't change
the internal structure

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.530
of that enterprise.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.260
Yes, instead of
privately elected people,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.280
as in private capitalism,
they had state officials.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.170
Interesting change,
but that doesn't

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.880
change the fundamental problem.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.970
And Marx pointed to
that as the issue--

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.170
the way this is organized
is fundamentally

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:26.130
antagonistic to ever
getting liberty, equality

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.100
or fraternity or
democracy, if that's

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.330
what you're interested in.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:38.560
Now, this is a very powerful
way of analyzing things.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.320
But Marx was a very
sophisticated thinker,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.070
and wanted to drive it home
in the most intimate way

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.080
that one can--

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:55.180
by looking very closely at the
employer-employee relationship.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.430
And again, this is an
elaborate piece of work he did.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.140
It takes some time
to work through it.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.990
I'm going to give you
a heroic short summary,

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.950
but I think you'll
understand it real well.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.720
Let's start with the employee
who's looking for a job.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.280
Could be me.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.210
Could be you.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.480
And you go and you meet an
employer who's got a job.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.090
And you sit down,
and you discuss it.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.160
And the employer explains you
to come Monday through Friday

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.340
at 8:30, and you stay till 4:30.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.614
Whatever it is.

00:31:24.614 --> 00:31:25.530
You'll sit over there.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.340
You'll do work with this
machine on that piece of paper.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.530
Whatever it is.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.370
And then you get to
that touchy point.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.570
How much are you
going to get paid?

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.030
And to make my
example very simple,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.650
let's just use the
number $20 an hour.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.830
You're going to be
paid $20 an hour

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.710
for whatever it is
you just came to work.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.020
At that point, Marx
says let's stop.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.280
Stop the film.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.130
Stop the whole
thing, and let's be

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:56.500
clear about what happens here,
because everybody kind of knows

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.790
it, and yet hasn't faced it.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.750
And I suspect that's still true.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.030
Having been a professor
of economics for 50 years

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.300
helps you to get the sense
of whether it's true or not.

00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:15.820
You know-- Marx
makes it very clear,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.120
but you know what
I'm about to say.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.570
That the only
reason any employer

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:30.370
will ever give you $20 for
an hour of your work is this.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.550
That hour, adding you to
whatever the payroll already

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.400
is, hiring you, in
that hour you're

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.550
going to make more goods or
services for that company

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.460
to sell than they would have
if they didn't hire you.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.330
They know that.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.796
That's why they hiring you.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.170
You're either going to make
a better quantity or a better

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.890
quality of whatever
it is they produce.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.270
And the company's calculation
is, it is worth it for me

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:02.800
to hire you for $20 if and only
if the extra hour of your labor

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.540
will yield to me, the
employer, more than $20

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.750
worth of extra output
for me to sell.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.940
If it doesn't, I won't hire
you, because it would be absurd.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.160
I would give you $20,
you'd work for an hour,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.880
I'd sell the result of
your extra work for $19,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.270
and I'd be down $1.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.200
I got an MBA.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.169
I know that's not good.

00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:29.210
I'm not going to do that.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.410
But this has enormous
implications.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.060
First of all, and this
is tough on Americans.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.497
It means that if you spent
a lifetime telling yourself

00:33:42.497 --> 00:33:44.080
you're never going
to work for anybody

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.910
who doesn't pay you
what you're worth,

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.800
I've got real bad news for you.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.730
That never happened,
and it never will.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.470
That kind of
statement to yourself

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.200
is your way of avoiding to deal
with the system in which you

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.060
live.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.840
And I feel for you.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.055
You need help, but not
the kind I provide.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.699
You live in a system in which
the basis of the corporation

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:11.139
is that difference.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.630
Or to use Marx's
language, the worker

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.889
produces a surplus
over what he gets.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.409
And that's the name of
the system is to get it

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.530
and to accumulate it.

00:34:24.314 --> 00:34:25.710
Wow.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.469
So what have we
got in capitalism?

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.300
We've got a system
that has delivered

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.290
us two extraordinary qualities.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:41.010
It has delivered us
stunning instability.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:46.820
I always use the same joke at
this point in what I present.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.400
If you lived with a
person as unstable

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.870
as this economic system, you
would have moved out long ago.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.320
In 1929, it crashes.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.640
The crash lasts 11 years.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.170
In 2008, it crashes.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.064
We're still in it.

00:35:05.064 --> 00:35:06.730
For those of you who
don't know, there's

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.813
an agency in the United
States called the National

00:35:08.813 --> 00:35:10.510
Bureau of Economic
Research, which keeps

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.310
track of the business cycles.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.700
It's a polite term we
call for instability.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.370
Between the end of the
Great Depression in 1941

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.610
and the beginning of
what we're in now, 2008,

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.700
there were 11 more
economic downturns.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.350
Every president of
the United States

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.570
has been a president
over a downturn.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.670
That's how unstable
the system is.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.700
And every president has
promised during the downturn

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.890
that if we just do
whatever the things are

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.460
he thinks we ought to do, we
will overcome that crisis,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.610
overcome that downturn,
and never have another one.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.560
Every president promised it.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.520
No president has ever
delivered on his promise.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.530
That's why we're in one now.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.360
They all promised.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.650
They can't do it.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.380
The system's instability
has been with it

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.220
from the beginning.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.480
We average an economic downturn
every four to seven years

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.440
in capitalism.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.060
For 300 years, no matter
where capitalism has come to,

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.790
that is what it brings with it.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.520
Keynesian economics was an
attempt to cope with it.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.680
Didn't work out.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.930
We're still trying.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.460
We're still debating it.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.310
We live with a system
that periodically throws

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:28.620
millions of people out of
work, undoes their family life,

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.460
undermines their
educations, transfer--

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:38.550
it's unbelievable what we
expect and what we accept.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.990
And the other thing capitalism
has done, stunningly,

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.540
is produce an inequality
that is mind-bending.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.480
Of course, it's easy to see
why, if the boards of directors

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.950
and the major
shareholders decide

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.980
what to do with the profits and
give a lot of it to themselves.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.100
Bingo, we've
explained inequality.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.290
No mystery here.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.690
We don't need to do
a lot of studies.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.360
That's been answered,
that question.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.310
But the problem is,
it's the system that

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.470
produces the inequality,
not this or that law,

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.880
or this or that rule, or this
or that political candidate.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.180
This is a systemic problem,
like our instability.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.370
The agency that keeps
track of inequality

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.930
in the world, the best
one is Oxfam in England.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.240
Some of you may know about it.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.540
They issue a report every
year about world inequality.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.280
The famous number
this last year was

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.480
that something on the
order of 86 of the richest

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.420
people in the world
together have more wealth

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.510
than the bottom half of the
population of the planet.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.260
That's about 3 and
1/2 billion people.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.170
Folks, this is a level of
inequality that takes us back

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.540
to the pyramids.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.580
Capitalism's
achievement is a level

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.720
of inequality and instability
that should have long ago made

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.460
people question what are
we doing staying in, living

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.750
with, accepting, especially
uncritically, a system that

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.980
works like this.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.140
But now a personal note.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.310
If any of this strikes you as
remarkable, or new, or maybe

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.380
hopefully even
interesting, I'm a product

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.260
of the American economic system.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.137
And I'm a product of the
American education system.

00:38:27.137 --> 00:38:29.470
I was born in the United
States, lived here all my life.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.120
This economic analysis I've
just summarily presented

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:44.480
to you in 40 minutes, I
had to acquire on my own.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.670
Why?

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.280
Because the institutions of--

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.520
they like to call it
"higher learning,"

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.660
I always used to wonder what
then would be lower learning

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.530
and then put it aside.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.980
Institutions of
higher learning, they

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.880
didn't teach me any of this.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.010
Let me stress that--

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.827
none of it.

00:39:08.827 --> 00:39:10.410
So let me tell you
about my education,

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.400
because it'll help
drive the point home.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.930
As an undergraduate,
I went to Harvard.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.680
I graduated magna cum
laude from Harvard.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.360
That's supposed
to mean something.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.520
Then I went to Stanford
out in Palo Alto

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.320
and got a master's
degree in economics.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.840
And then I switched
because my professor

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.980
that I loved there died,
and I finished at Yale,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.730
where I got another
master's in economics,

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.200
a master's in history,
and a PhD in economics.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.260
I'm loaded with the right
degrees from the right places,

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.580
aren't I?

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.050
Now listen to this.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.620
Never in my education in
those three institutions

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.650
in an economics
course was I ever

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.760
assigned one word of Karl Marx.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:00.060
There is no excuse, no
justification, nothing.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.380
You know what that's about?

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.090
Fear.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:08.020
My professors were afraid
to assign it, to read it,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.280
to think about it, to
discuss it, or to debate it.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.730
It was the Cold War
when I went to school.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:20.810
And we, the Americans, were
arrayed against the Russians.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:25.203
Like some are today and
others clearly not so much.

00:40:25.203 --> 00:40:27.670
[CHUCKLING]

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.490
Well, it's very hard
to keep this straight.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.900
You have to know what color,
who's got what jersey.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.000
Otherwise, you get
confused as to who

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.290
the friends and allies are.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.690
It is very confusing.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.210
My professors were not confused.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.400
It was real clear.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.250
So we weren't told
anything about any of this.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.410
We were taught
neoclassical economics.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.110
That's, capitalism
is wonderful, fixes

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:54.295
itself, nothing to worry
about, go back to watching TV.

00:40:54.295 --> 00:40:56.170
And the Keynesians, who
said, no, no, there's

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.211
something to worry about.

00:40:57.211 --> 00:40:59.620
Let the government come in.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.470
But the notion that there
was a critical alternative

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.220
to this way of
thinking, that came up

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.010
with a different analysis and
a different way of thinking,

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.190
and a different set of ideas
of what we need to do next?

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.260
Oh no.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.630
None of my teachers ever
said one word about it.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.680
Try to understand.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.080
This is like a taboo.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.671
They couldn't discuss it.

00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:28.170
Some of you have
been wondering, why

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.810
when we have economic troubles
here in the United States

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:35.100
we seem so clumsy
about solving them?

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.010
We have had to
pretend in economics

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.070
that we don't have any
problems, that we don't have

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.190
a fundamentally troubled system,
that we don't have anything

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.826
to worry about.

00:41:45.826 --> 00:41:47.700
Which means you're not
real good at fixing it

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.530
when it breaks down.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.350
For that, you'd have to face
that it has lots of flaws.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.780
You'd have to look at
how it broke down before

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.150
and see what it is
that might be amiss.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.650
We don't.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.880
So you live in an
economic system

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.450
that is now run by people who
have no idea about everything I

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.820
just told you.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.430
It's painful.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.840
I've had to teach all my life
the conventional neoclassical

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.370
Keynesian.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.350
But I'm also taught this other.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.120
I know what my
colleagues do, but they

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.311
don't understand what I do.

00:42:23.311 --> 00:42:24.720
And I'm not the only one.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.140
I'm not suggesting that.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.820
But I'm a critic of this system,
because it makes sense to me

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.430
that a system that works
in the way I've described

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.330
deserves some criticism.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.560
And I even dare to suggest
that intelligent folks like

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.250
you could thrive on
hearing the criticism

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.140
and thinking about it.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.920
Accept all of it?

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.550
Of course not.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.740
But think about it, engage it?

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.340
Come on.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.160
If you wanted to understand
the family up the road that

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.120
had two parents and
two kids, would you

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.690
decide to interview one
of the two children,

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.620
not two, especially
if you knew that one

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.620
that the children
thought it was the best

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.050
family in the world,
the other child

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:11.930
thought this was a basket case
of psychological dysfunction?

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.910
Probably, most of
you will understand

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.960
you've got to talk to
both of the children,

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.550
then you make up your own mind,
hear what they have to say.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.490
Hear the people who
think capitalism

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.550
is the best thing
since sliced bread,

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.670
but maybe also take a dare.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:33.980
Listen to the people
who think it's critical,

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.500
who think it's a
system that never

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.590
could do what it had promised.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.120
And finally, and I'm going
to conclude with this,

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.710
a system that is in
no way necessary.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.060
What are we accepting?

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.140
It's not inevitable.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.040
It never was.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:00.510
Oh, true, the people who like
capitalism love to say it's

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:04.740
the end of history,
it's the final stage.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:09.042
But the people who
articulated slavery said that.

00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:14.720
And the people who articulated
feudalism said that.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.020
So of course, the people
who run capitalism say that.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.010
But the burden is on them.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.440
Every system we know
of in human history

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.190
has been born, evolved
over time, and died.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.610
We know capitalism was born,
and we know it's evolved.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.260
You know what the next stage is?

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.690
Well, I won't go into it.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.560
You can figure that out.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.100
What would be an alternative?

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:46.520
Well, in a way, everything
I've said gives you the answer.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.470
If we have a system
that's unstable,

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:50.090
if we have a system
that produces

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:54.120
unspeakable inequality,
a system that

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.420
makes it profitable to fire
large numbers of people,

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.720
even if the social costs
of their unemployment

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.840
exceed the profits that
the automation achieved,

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.400
all of the things I've told you
and many more, those are all--

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.700
every one of them--

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.690
the results of how
decisions are made

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.530
inside the productive units
of our economy, the factories,

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:23.620
the stores, and the offices,
by a tiny group of people

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.874
who are not accountable
to the people they employ.

00:45:27.874 --> 00:45:29.540
The people they employ
are the majority.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.730
The people who are not
accountable are the minority.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.310
That's why it's not democracy.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.320
It's the antithesis.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.790
Well, then the solution
jumps right out at you.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.550
Democratize the enterprise.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.100
Make the decisions,
something that

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.060
is done one person, one vote.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.180
Everybody who works
in an enterprise

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.030
has an equal say
in deciding what

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.760
to produce, how to
produce, where to produce,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.070
and what to do with the
profits that they all

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.050
helped to produce.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.600
What a wonderful,
interesting idea.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.600
Democracy in the workplace.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.760
Just think of a society
in which you have not

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.160
just democracy where you live,
but democracy where you work.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.690
If it was good for the one,
it's good for the other.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.520
Maybe getting rid of
the kings who told us

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.610
what to do where we
live is like getting

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.820
rid of the board of
directors who tells

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.680
us what to do where we work.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.210
Because you know
it kind of matters.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:37.750
Being at work is what you
do most of the adult life

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.120
you have, is going to work.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.780
If democracy is a value
that means something to you,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.240
it should have been
instituted long ago where

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.801
you work, because that's where
you spend most of your time.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.740
Instead, you accept what?

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.950
To live in a society you
like to call democratic,

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.500
even though the place where
you spend most of your time

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.930
is the antithesis of that--

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:03.980
your workplace.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.600
The alternative is very old.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.840
Democratizing the workplace
is not a new idea.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.750
No, no, it's ancient.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.200
Nowadays, it's
called worker co-ops.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.240
It's as good a name as any.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:21.990
What does it mean?

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:27.060
A group of people getting
together and making a decision.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.750
We're going to
produce something,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.760
a software program,
hamburgers, haircuts.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.350
It doesn't matter.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.030
And here's how we're
going to do it.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.820
We're going to be a collective.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.640
We're going together
to decide how

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.477
to produce, where to produce,
when to produce, all of that.

00:47:45.477 --> 00:47:47.310
And we're going to
debate it, and then we're

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.830
going to make a decision
by majority vote.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.850
That's what we're going to do.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.830
We're going to run it that way.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.710
Human beings have been trying
to do that for a long time.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.780
What you may not know
is that human beings

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.940
have done it often.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.000
You may not know that human
beings are doing it right now

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.540
all over the place, including
in the United States.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.480
And one of the reasons
it's a perennial effort

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.050
is because the systems that have
existed, slavery, feudalism,

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:21.740
capitalism, provoke
people to be critical

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:27.440
and to find their way sooner
or later to this alternative.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.280
I'll give you just two examples
as I bring this to a close.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.100
The most famous example
is a corporation in Spain.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.660
Some of you may
have heard about it.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.350
It's called the Mondragon
Co-operative Corporation.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.340
Here's the story
of this company.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.670
In 1956, Spain, which is
where this company exists

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:52.440
and is based, Spain was
a very poor country.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.600
It had gone through
a horrific civil war,

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.670
and then there was World War II.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:58.440
Spain was a poor
country to begin with,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.720
and it was devastated
by the Civil War,

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.610
and then by World War II.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.020
So in 1956, it was
a very poor country.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.600
And in the Basque Region, that's
the northern part of Spain

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.030
on the southern side of
the Pyrenees Mountains

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.690
that separate Spain from
France, the Basque people, who

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.320
are their own kind of
ethnicity, if you like,

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.700
they have their own language
and culture, very, very poor.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.760
They're Roman Catholic, as
are most people in Spain.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.620
And they had a local priest.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.840
And he made a famous
joke one day at church.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.690
He said, if we
wait to have jobs,

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.180
for some capitalist or
some employer to come here,

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.220
we'll all die of old age.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.590
So what I suggest,
he said, is that we

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.000
become our own employer.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.690
In other words, set up a
worker co-op, which he did.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.570
Six workers and a priest.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:54.140
Fast forward to today,
Mondragon Corporation,

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.700
Mondragon Co-operative
Corporation,

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.090
is the seventh largest
corporation in Spain.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.280
It has 100,000 workers.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.700
It is the biggest success
story of the Spanish economy

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.160
in the last half century.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.340
It is a collection
of 150 to 200,

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.340
depending on how you
count, worker co-ops.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.340
In every one of its businesses,
it's a conglomerate.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.470
Services, manufacturing,
and so on.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.440
In every one of its businesses,
the workers collectively

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.620
decide all of these issues.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.770
What to produce, how to
produce, where to produce.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.540
Stunningly successful.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.930
Outcompeted dozens of
capitalist enterprises

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:37.100
who could not make it work
in competition with them.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.830
They are so successful now that
they have their own university,

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.470
the Mondragon University,
which will teach courses

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.080
to anybody who is interested
in how to organize a co-op, how

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.180
to finance a co-op,
how to manage a co-op,

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.840
how to deal with the personal
problems of co-ops, etc.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.580
It's a well-developed
program, very successful.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.730
Two interesting rules
that might excite you.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:03.440
Rule number one, the workers
together hire, and fire,

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.135
and evaluate the managers.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.870
I know I have to
let that sink in.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:15.590
Other words, it's the
opposite of what you have.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.150
The workers decide whether
the managers were successful.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.640
And if they weren't,
they're gone.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.260
They also have another rule.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.580
The highest paid person cannot
get more than eight times

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.760
the income of the
lowest paid person.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.150
That's how they solved
the problem of inequality.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.460
Just gone.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.170
Not an issue.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.690
There is some inequality.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.010
8-1 is still a
hefty ratio, but I

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.430
assume you know that the
ratio of corporate CEOs to low

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:50.200
paid workers in American
corporations is around 350-1.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.060
Which is why we have the
inequality that we have.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.016
And there are many
more examples.

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:02.150
A worker co-op would solve its
problems in a different way,

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.690
be a different economic system.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.610
Here's an interesting thing.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.880
Imagine a corporation
confronted with the notion,

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.130
gee, why are you
hiring Americans

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.320
who you have to pay a
large amount of money to?

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.190
Why don't you move to India?

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.735
You can pay much less.

00:52:16.735 --> 00:52:19.770
The capitalist
corporation, as you know,

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:21.802
has been doing lots of that.

00:52:21.802 --> 00:52:24.220
In a worker co-op?

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.640
Unlikely.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.470
The workers would
be voting to destroy

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.190
their jobs, their
company, the benefits

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.072
to the community of
having the jobs there.

00:52:33.072 --> 00:52:34.280
They're not going to do that.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.110
You wouldn't have seen
the exodus of jobs

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:40.340
from this country for
the last 30 to 40 years.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.280
It's really different.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.870
Much less inequality, much less
loss, and the whole, everything

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:53.450
would be changed if we were able
to have a rational discussion,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.360
debate here in
the United States,

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.800
about a capitalist economic
system versus a worker

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.460
co-operative system.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.980
Maybe we would even be able
to imagine an economic system

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.900
starting out as
capitalist, but which

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.930
makes room for a
large worker co-op

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.350
sector across many industries.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.600
And you know what the
rationale for it would be?

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.690
Freedom of choice.

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.380
Let Americans have the choice.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.480
Do you want to work in
a top-down hierarchical

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.110
corporation?

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:28.970
Or would you rather work
in a democratic workplace?

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:30.650
Would you like to
buy from the one?

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.050
Would you like to-- for
Americans to have that choice,

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.080
there has to be a sector.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.700
We have to spend some money and
make room for worker co-ops.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.980
And there is a country
who's doing it right now,

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.590
committed to doing it anyway.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.290
And that will be my final
point, just to make clear

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.890
that the reality of
this is not some fancy

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:55.431
in the future utopian dream.

00:53:55.431 --> 00:53:57.680
The second biggest political
party in Great Britain is

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.990
called the Labour Party, the
leader of the Labour Party

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.930
a man named Jeremy Corbyn.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.660
His party has committed--
they're running in a national

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.860
election right now--

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.810
his party has committed
that it-- and they've

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.000
run governments before.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.340
They're like the
Democratic Party here.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.830
The Republican here is the
Conservatives in England.

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.900
So he's committed that
if the Labour Party wins,

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.230
they'll pass this law part one.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.650
Any existing business in
England can continue as it is,

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:29.810
but if it decides to
close, and/or if it decides

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.360
to sell itself to
another business,

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.350
and/or if it decides to go
public, to issue shares,

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:39.920
it must, before doing
any of those things,

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.700
give its own workers the
right of first refusal.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.190
That's a legal
term meaning it has

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:50.030
to offer to sell itself to
its own workers as a co-op

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:53.130
before it can do anything else.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.520
Part two of the bill
answers the question,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.690
where would the workers get the
money to buy their own firm?

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.840
Answer-- the government
will lend it to them.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.320
The British are committed to
building a worker co-op sector

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:12.750
precisely because of the
problems, limits, failures

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.120
of a capitalist system.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.790
But the most important thing
is not the particular arguments

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.170
for this.

00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:24.100
The most important thing is
for you to face up to the fact

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.070
you live in an economic system
that isn't the beginning

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:30.160
and end of anything, that
is part of an evolving

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.480
history, that has very
serious flaws and faults,

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.860
and that there's an
enormous literature,

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.310
including concrete
real experiences people

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:44.150
have had all over the place in
doing better than capitalism.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.150
To insist that you don't
have to think about it,

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.380
you don't have to
debate it, you don't

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.520
have to listen to people
who tell you about it,

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.478
you don't have to read
the books that are there

00:55:51.478 --> 00:55:58.620
for it is a kind of self imposed
censorship that doesn't do

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:03.750
anybody any good, unless you
really want the current system

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:08.130
to continue no matter what
the cost and no matter where

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.260
it takes us.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:15.640
And I don't believe most of
you in this room feel that way.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.784
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:56:18.784 --> 00:56:21.264
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:25.728 --> 00:56:27.280
If there's time.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.890
SPEAKER: Yeah, we have just a
couple minutes for questions,

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:31.390
I think.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.210
Go up to the mics, please.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:37.389
Go ahead.

00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:37.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.140
Thank you for your talk.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.300
I really enjoyed it.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.840
I was just wondering if you
could speak maybe briefly to,

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.790
you offer up democracy as kind
of the solution to the system.

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:50.290
I'm wondering if you could
speak to the efficacy of it

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:53.080
specifically with
relation to dealing

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.520
with the problem of capitalism.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.880
Why hasn't democracy as
a governing system dealt

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.120
with this problem,
and why won't it

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.550
have similar inefficiencies
in the workplace?

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:05.780
RICHARD WOLFF: Sure.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.320
I'll try to be as
brief as I can.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.610
Marx tried to grapple with
exactly that question.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.870
And basically, he
and the many who

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:17.840
have come since and
tried to work with it

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.890
make the argument that
in the practical life

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:28.130
of a capitalist corporation is
a systemic disregard, negation,

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.920
rejection of democracy.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.710
And that in fact, the way
the corporation works,

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.080
how it rewards
disproportionately

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.720
the people at the
top, etc, etc, it

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.170
creates conditions
that undermine what

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.307
political democracy there is.

00:57:44.307 --> 00:57:46.640
And the best way to see that
in this country, and again,

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.270
I'm not sure most of you know
it, is that we in America,

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.400
and in many other
countries, we see

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.560
our elections bought and sold.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.190
You can buy the advertising
that you need or you can't.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.040
If you can't, your
effort to run politically

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.480
is basically stymied
from the beginning.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.820
It's not a coincidence
that most of the candidates

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.940
either are millionaires
or depend on millionaires

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.440
to donate to them.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.880
And the likelihood
of millionaires

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.550
that are going to donate
to a critic of capitalism

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:21.530
is slim in a country like this.

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:23.960
Unless and until a movement
develops, that of course

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.330
can change all of that.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.040
And in a way, the
Bernie Sanders ability

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.670
to raise large amounts of
money from small donations

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:33.680
is the beginning of
signs in this country

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:37.940
too that in a sense
the jig is up.

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.930
But the system is
itself undemocratic,

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.240
and it undercuts
because it has to.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.300
Let me put it in the
most dramatic way I can.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.530
If a society produces greater
and greater inequality,

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:54.020
you all understand what that
means-- tiny group of people,

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.728
a lot of stuff, and
a lot of other people

00:58:55.728 --> 00:58:57.980
who are just barely
making ends meet.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.880
The people who have a
lot, they aren't stupid.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.970
They understand the
danger of democracy

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:06.740
and of universal suffrage.

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.870
Because sooner or later,
if a tiny group of people

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:11.390
have all the wealth and
everybody doesn't, everybody

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.600
is going to think the one
thing we have is the vote.

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.830
The one thing we have
is political democracy.

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:22.970
And we can use our numerical
majority in politics

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:27.320
to undo what capitalism
has achieved in economics.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.672
We can do that by taxing.

00:59:28.672 --> 00:59:30.005
We can do that by expropriating.

00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:32.300
There's a lot of
ways of doing that.

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.470
The rich understand that.

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.390
They've got to make--

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.800
they've got to neuter
the political system.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.550
They can't let it function
in the appropriate way,

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.720
because it's too
dangerous for them.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.220
And so they buy it.

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.690
That's been the solution.

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:48.650
And I think that problem
has never been solved,

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.280
not by this law or that law.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.980
Because you could find a way
for these inequalities of wealth

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:59.060
to represent themselves
in the political system.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.190
The notion of worker
co-op is not a notion

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.980
that there will be pure
efficiency, whatever

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.870
exactly that is.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:08.450
Economists do not agree on
what efficiency is, or means,

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.470
or how to measure it.

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.820
But put that aside.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.030
There will be inefficiencies
in a worker co-op.

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:16.280
They will be different
from the inefficiencies

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.620
that capitalist
enterprises have,

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.910
just as the inefficiencies
of capitalism

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:24.680
were different from those that
feudalism had, and from those

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.210
that slavery had.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.150
Inefficiency is part of
every economic system,

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:32.060
always has been and is now.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.730
It is not efficient to
have millions of people who

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.890
want a job and don't have one.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.091
If you want an introduction
to capitalism's inefficiency,

01:00:40.091 --> 01:00:42.590
I can introduce you to the fact
that every capitalist system

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.930
suffers from millions and
millions of people that are

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.580
unemployed or proportionately.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.070
That's not an efficiency.

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:51.200
That's a waste of people,
a waste of potential,

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.970
and a waste of resources.

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.850
Other systems have
different inefficiencies,

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:59.210
but weighing them is
not a basis upon which

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:04.785
you're going to decide between
systems and it never was.

01:01:04.785 --> 01:01:06.160
AUDIENCE: Thank
you very much for

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.995
the interesting and
thought-provoking talk.

01:01:08.995 --> 01:01:13.922
So in your overview of Marxist
analysis of capitalism,

01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:16.545
you alluded to what I believe
is called the labor theory

01:01:16.545 --> 01:01:17.670
of value that he developed.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.490
RICHARD WOLFF: Yes.

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.705
AUDIENCE: So that's an idea
I've got the impression that has

01:01:21.705 --> 01:01:25.510
come in for a lot of criticism.

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:30.592
Maybe I'm oversimplifying
here, but the idea

01:01:30.592 --> 01:01:34.610
is that goods have a certain
value, the company underpays is

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:36.390
workers in order
to extract profits

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.000
from the difference
between the value

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.658
and what it pays the workers.

01:01:39.658 --> 01:01:43.195
That idea doesn't take account,
for instance, of the prices

01:01:43.195 --> 01:01:45.820
that the consumers are
willing to pay for the goods.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.559
So I was wondering how that--

01:01:47.559 --> 01:01:48.350
RICHARD WOLFF: Yes.

01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:52.580
Well, don't take
this personally.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.100
Your question bespeaks
the very absence

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.780
of teaching this material that
I was referring to before.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.940
If you actually read
Marx, and by the way,

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.420
it's not that difficult,
I guarantee you.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.390
If you read Marx, you'll know
that he makes a distinction

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.490
between values and prices.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.100
He talks about prices
and what causes them.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.100
He talks about values, which
for him, are something else.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.920
Nor is he the only major
economist who did that.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.210
Smith and Ricardo also did that.

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.520
So he tried to use
his analysis of value

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.850
to say whatever
else a commodity is,

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:31.160
a thing produced
in capitalism, it

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.550
has in it a congealed
amount of labor.

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.040
Every society has
to make a decision,

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.980
whether it's conscious of it
or not, how much labor will

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.030
we allocate to making food, how
much will be made to clothing,

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.720
how much--

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.719
because you only have a
certain amount of labor,

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.320
and you have a set of desires.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.700
And so every society allocates
labor one way or another.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.580
For Marx, the value
of a commodity

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.940
simply meant the amount
of the total labor

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.740
a society had that was allocated
to the production of that good.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.490
That's a definitional
logic, which he then

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:11.000
used to explain why
prices are what they are.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.780
But there was no equation
of price to value.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.060
Let me go back to the first
part of your question.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.643
Has there been lots of criticism
of the labor theory of value?

01:03:18.643 --> 01:03:19.820
Absolutely.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.280
There's been lots of criticism
about virtually everything

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.470
Marx ever wrote, because of what
happened in the years since.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.020
But that's true of
every theory of value.

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.900
For example, the
mainstream one that

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.510
is taught in the United
States has a different name.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:36.968
I don't know if
you've heard of it.

01:03:36.968 --> 01:03:39.110
It's called the utility
theory of value.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:43.910
Things are valuable because
of the amount of utility

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:47.000
they provide to the consumer.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.480
Try, please, to measure that.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.350
Please, come on.

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:56.390
You're all smart folks.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:59.600
You think that's an easier
concept to nail down,

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.180
the utility theory of value?

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:07.760
Exactly how much joy does that
ice cream provide for you?

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.390
How much money are you
willing to part with?

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.060
Will that vary with the
temperature outside?

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.750
Will it vary with the amount
of calories you're counting?

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.860
What?

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:23.240
Every economic theory begins
with a set of basic hypotheses

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.420
upon which it builds its system.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.920
Marx started with
labor, because for him,

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.630
that was the key
variable to focus on.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:35.900
Neoclassical economics,
which developed in the 1870s,

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.580
for those of you who know, was
itself a reaction against Marx.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.470
They hated the labor
theory of value

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:44.930
because it was
associated with Marx.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.180
They forgot, so let
me make sure you all

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:51.110
know, that Marx did not invent
the labor theory of value.

01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:53.490
Marx took the labor
theory of value.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.460
This may come as a shock to some
of you, but just do the work.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.890
You'll learn.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:00.200
Adam Smith and David
Ricardo, champions

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.750
of capitalism, that's where
the labor theory of value

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.590
comes from.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:07.160
Marx thanked them
profusely for it,

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.450
and then uses it to do things
they never wanted to see done.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:13.820
This happens often in science.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.980
The people who
develop a concept then

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.550
get very upset with where
their students take it.

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:21.650
Marx was a student
of Smith and Ricardo,

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.690
took the labor theory
of value in a way

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.890
that was critical of capitalism.

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:29.030
They had used it to
celebrate capitalism.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.310
But if you see a lot of
criticisms of the labor

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:33.980
theory of value, be careful.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.550
What these are criticisms of,
because Marx's labor theory

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.670
of value is not the same as
Ricardo's and not the same

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:44.510
as Smith's, and has more to
do with this notion of how

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:47.750
labor is allocated in a
society than anything.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:52.440
Marx was not-- let me
put it another way.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.280
When I teach in the
American University system,

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.830
we begin by assuming
all students want

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.380
to understand the great
mystery of economics,

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.860
which is why is the price
of something what it is?

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:08.180
Why is the price of a hamburger
$5 and the price of a Mercedes

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.300
much more than that?

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.910
And we begin.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.880
That's very nice.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.780
Perfectly good to
make an economics

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.290
built on that question.

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:18.110
I'm going to now exaggerate,
but to make my point.

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:22.190
Marx wasn't interested in
that, and I'm not either.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.080
I got many more
interesting things

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.540
I want to understand about
this economy than why

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.300
the prices of things
are what they are.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.430
I understand if
you're a capitalist,

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:36.020
you are very concerned
about prices.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.180
But if you're somebody else,
you might be interested,

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.230
but you might have much
higher priority subjects.

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:46.690
Marx is coming at it
with a different agenda,

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:48.910
and so he starts in
a different place,

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.990
then takes it in
a different way.

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:55.930
By the way, just a footnote for
some of you scholarly types.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.850
In 2012, a colleague of
mine, Stephen Resnick and I,

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:03.010
we did a lot of work together,
published a book called

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.890
"Contending Economic Theories."

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.090
It was an attempt to create
for the English reading public

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.520
a book that
systematically compares

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.790
neoclassical Keynesian
and Marxian economics so

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:20.740
that a generation of students
would have something to find.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.600
If you are at all
interested, that's

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.160
the title, "Contending Economic
Theories, Neoclassical,

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.820
Keynesian, and Marxian."

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:33.640
And the publisher is MIT Press
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.320
Why MIT?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.970
Because it is the home of the
most prestigious tradition

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:43.580
in economics, Paul
Samuelson, Robert Solo,

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.160
all kinds of people were there.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.960
And we wanted very much to
introduce the profession

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.610
through a publisher
that they all

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:55.060
respect to deal with an
argument that most of them

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:56.170
do not understand.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:05.424
So you make a point that
capitalism is going to die,

01:08:05.424 --> 01:08:07.980
and we're probably going to
be better off if we kill it

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.270
sooner than let it die.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.610
Now--

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.184
RICHARD WOLFF: You said that.

01:08:14.184 --> 01:08:15.160
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.109
That's my interpretation
of your work.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:18.053
RICHARD WOLFF: Gotcha.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.261
AUDIENCE: I'm a good student.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:19.779
All right.

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:23.450
Now, you also said you
don't teach the generation

01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:25.149
the issues.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:28.029
And I'm curious about yourself.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:33.510
Do you think there is potential
to get quicker to a better

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.804
solution if we were to
teach the younger generation

01:08:36.804 --> 01:08:38.220
things properly
and make it clear.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.627
And when I say
education, I'm not

01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:43.040
talking about the education
of yesterday, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.380
I'm talking about the education
of today and tomorrow,

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.600
the YouTube and the like.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.460
RICHARD WOLFF: Absolutely.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.310
I couldn't say it as
strongly as I want to say it.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:57.529
Yes, that's why I'm here.

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.500
That's what I now do.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.870
I try to teach critical thinking
in the realm of economics.

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:08.229
Look, let me be as
blunt as I know how.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:11.290
This country has been
like a bear hibernating

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:12.135
for half a century.

01:09:12.135 --> 01:09:13.930
It's very serious.

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:16.529
For half a century,
since the 1950s,

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:19.479
end of World War II
basically, this country

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:24.640
has been so freaked out
about its Cold War struggles

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.240
with socialism, communism,
and all the rest

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.740
that it took the pathetic
position of a three-year-old.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.920
You know, a three-year-old
sees a scary thing,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.040
puts his or her hands in
front of his or her eyes,

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.310
and believes that the
scary thing is now gone.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:44.334
And it takes a little
further maturity

01:09:44.334 --> 01:09:46.250
to recognize that you
can put your hand there,

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.260
the thing's still there.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.260
And when you move
your hand, boom.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:54.160
We are in a society that
has not dealt seriously

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.750
with the criticism of
capitalism in 50 years.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.100
I once had a graduate student.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.360
I said, go read the
congressional record,

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.120
the literal record
of every debate

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.330
in the House of Representatives
in the Senate, and find me

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:10.555
a debate over the pros
and cons of capitalism.

01:10:10.555 --> 01:10:13.910
Couldn't find it.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.320
We have not allowed
a political leader,

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.060
we have not allowed
economics as a profession,

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.350
which is my profession,
to have people like me.

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:27.860
I'm gonna be real
personal and honest.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.950
I'm a professor.

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:32.710
I have been a professor all
my life in the United States,

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.530
despite my criticisms.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:40.450
And that's because I'm
like a game player.

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:45.160
When I'm in trouble and I need
help, I wave my pedigrees.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.130
You all know what I mean.

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:54.550
I went to the right
schools, so I'm in the club.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:59.980
Even though I say strange
things, I'm critical.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.050
That's sad.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.850
And our country
and our society are

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:07.760
weaker because we do not have a
tradition of critical thinking,

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.180
which we badly need
in a system that's

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.690
working as poorly as
the current one is,

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:16.210
and is likely to continue.

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:18.700
Those of you who
remember what I said,

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.610
that the average in the
history of capitalism

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:26.980
is four to seven years
since the last downturn,

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:31.240
our major downturn
was in 2008 and 2009.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.290
Now you do the addition.

01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:33.670
Four to seven years?

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:34.920
Uh-oh!

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.370
We're due for one.

01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:38.630
And Wall Street waits one.

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:42.600
You think we have trouble in the
United States with Trump now?

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.400
Make Trump plus a recession
over the next 12 months,

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.830
and try to ask the
question again.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.670
This is a system whose
instability rocks it.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.120
And yes, I think education
that would open people

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.470
to the enormous, and productive,
and sophisticated literature

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.410
that explores these
critical perspectives would

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:09.836
be an enormous contribution
to solving the problem.

01:12:09.836 --> 01:12:10.664
Yeah.

01:12:10.664 --> 01:12:12.080
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.640
I find it very refreshing,
because I'm from China.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.630
And six years ago, when I
came to the United States,

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:25.250
I really hated my
country's system.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:29.240
Now that I look back, I
see the great achievement

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.210
that my country has made, I
find that oh, probably there's

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.090
some problem in
the United States

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:39.800
or in the Western
world in general, which

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:46.970
is those capitalistic countries
have great economic systems,

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:49.670
but the political system
is really backward,

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:54.830
or it hasn't been
updated regularly.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:13:00.905
So you can see this
from the amount of debts

01:13:00.905 --> 01:13:02.300
that the United States has.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.930
I think it's like 9
trillion US dollars.

01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:12.770
In China, we have $4 trillion
US dollars in people's savings

01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:13.410
as of now.

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:16.880
So the economy is
really booming.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.090
But what I find in your
talk is, your perspective

01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.030
is a little bit too extreme.

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.720
I think what my
country did well was

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.950
we find a really good balance
point between efficiency

01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:37.250
and equality.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:40.860
Actually, those two are
two different forces.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.440
So if you have
better efficiency,

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.350
it's really hard to get quality.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:52.254
So my question is, how
would you suggest--

01:13:52.254 --> 01:13:54.710
in the current States,
you have this government.

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.460
You have this political
system in your hand.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.710
How would you
suggest those people

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:04.950
who make those
decisions move forward

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:09.200
into more of an
appropriate point

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.030
where equality meets efficiency?

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:19.310
And if any one of you, if you
haven't been to China, please

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:20.590
go there.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.760
It's an amazing world.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.077
I wonder if you have
ever been to China?

01:14:26.077 --> 01:14:27.035
RICHARD WOLFF: Not yet.

01:14:27.035 --> 01:14:29.840
AUDIENCE: OK, I think
it's the right time

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.895
to visit China right now.

01:14:32.895 --> 01:14:34.145
RICHARD WOLFF: Let me respond.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.870
Some facts and then an
interpretation of what's

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.970
happening in your country.

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.890
Facts do underscore
what you have said.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:49.150
For example, the real
wage in the United States

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:52.390
has been stagnant
now for 35 years.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:55.480
Let me drive home what that
is, so you all understand.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.390
Real wage in economics
is a very simple measure.

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:01.250
You take the amount of money
a person gets on average,

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:04.480
and you adjust it for the prices
that the person has to pay,

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.320
because obviously if you get 10%
more wages but all the prices

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.030
go up 10% you're not better off.

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:13.420
You can't buy any more with
your extra 10% of money

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.570
than you could before, because
the prices have gone up.

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:19.970
The term "real wage"
takes that into account.

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:23.350
So it measures what you
really can buy with whatever

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.390
the wages are that you get.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:29.500
When you do that, the American
real wage over the last 35

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.710
years is the same.

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.660
I'm going to be
starker with you.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.480
Real wages in the United
States are the same today

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.940
they were late in the 1970s.

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.640
The only reason
Americans have been

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.750
able to consume a rising
amount in the last 70 years

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.341
is because of two
things they did.

01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:52.840
And for those of
you who don't know,

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.110
this is your life
I'm talking about.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:16:01.080
Number one, a vast
social change happened.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.390
And it is about
women, particularly

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:07.060
white in our country,
white women who

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:12.130
have left in the millions
lives as homemakers,

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:16.300
wives, mothers, and so on,
and become members of the paid

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.210
labor force, so much so that
your generation, I would guess,

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:20.770
simply assumes it.

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.510
But that's new.

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:25.820
That's how the family
had enough money

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.930
to sustain the illusion
that they were participating

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.280
in the American dream.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.470
Because every household,
every married couple

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:37.760
now had a second
major money earner.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.900
But it turned out
it wasn't enough.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.350
It wasn't enough, because
when mother or wife went out

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:50.000
to work in massive numbers, she
needed her own outfit for that.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.680
She needed a second
car, because we

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.200
don't do public transportation
in this country.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.120
It's against our
religion, and so on.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.320
That was an attempt at humor
there, what I just did.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.790
OK.

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:03.980
So the second thing
American working class

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:10.380
did to sustain the illusion
was, you all know, debt.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.240
We borrow for our house.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.760
And we borrow for our car.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.960
We borrow for the credit card.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.010
And in a stunning innovation
of American capitalism

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.470
over the last 25
years, we borrow

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:26.160
to send our children
to college, producing

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:31.260
a level of indebtedness that is
explosive, and which explains

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.890
part of why we crashed
in 2008, and why it

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:38.460
is taking so long to recover.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:42.430
We can't handle our
economic system.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:48.090
By contrast, real wages in
China have increased many times

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.460
over the last 20 years.

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.960
There's no comparison.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.100
The working class standard
of living in China

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:58.500
is zooming by
comparison to here.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.650
China's GDP grows in the
neighborhood of six to nine,

01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:04.050
depending on how you
count, percent a year.

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:08.920
We're lucky if we get to
2 to 3% year after year.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.840
That's why the two economies
are getting closer and closer.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.975
Because we're slow,
and they're fast.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.330
Now, you can pretend
all you want.

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.620
And boy, Americans
are good at that.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.350
But that's the reality.

01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:27.380
And somewhere, you
have to deal with that.

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.104
Number two point in response.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:37.300
China is taking advantage,
understandably, of something

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.820
much bigger than China.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:44.650
There is a decision made in
the centers of capitalism

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:48.130
that the places in the world
where capitalism was born

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:50.830
and grew to its modern power--

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:54.820
and those places are Western
Europe, North America,

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:56.950
and Japan--

01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:00.370
those places, as capitalism
grew in these areas

01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:03.480
where it first got
going and became big,

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.534
and that's where it put
its industry, that's

01:19:05.534 --> 01:19:07.450
where it put its warehouses,
that's where it's

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:09.490
put its offices and its stores.

01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:11.110
It's what you all know.

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:12.195
You're living in New York.

01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:17.860
But along the way, it had to
come to terms with the working

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.359
class.

01:19:18.359 --> 01:19:21.190
And what it did was
offer them higher wages.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.290
And so the wages here rose.

01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:25.180
Not as fast as the
profits, but they

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:28.840
rose to keep the system going.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.120
Because the inequality, if
you let it get too much,

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.780
blows the system up.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.600
So a point was reached
around the 1970s

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.970
when something happened
to change everything.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:41.130
American capitalists looked
at their working class,

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:43.042
paying them the
kinds of salaries

01:19:43.042 --> 01:19:45.000
that enabled the American
working class to have

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.360
the standard of
living it enjoys.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.150
But they also
discovered in the 1970s

01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:55.170
the jet engine and modern
telecommunications.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:57.030
And suddenly something
was possible that

01:19:57.030 --> 01:20:02.040
had never been possible before
for corporations, capitalists.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.730
To say to themselves the
following-- why the hell are we

01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:10.750
in the United States, or
Britain, or France, or Japan?

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:15.100
We can now supervise production
in a factory in China,

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:19.210
or India, or Brazil with
modern telecommunications

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:21.790
as easily as we could
before supervise

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:24.390
the factory across the street.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:27.540
And we can fly anywhere in the
world in a matter of hours.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.910
So our managers can--

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:36.620
we don't need the American
working class, whom we overpay.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.050
And we're out of here.

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:41.060
We're leaving.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.180
Capitalism, over
the last 40 years,

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:49.640
has abandoned the countries in
which it was born and reached

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.900
its maturity.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.250
And where did it go?

01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:56.370
To the countries in the world
that gave the greatest reason

01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:57.270
to bring them.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:00.250
China, number one.

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:03.780
A disciplined working class,
a pretty well educated working

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.740
class, a politically
controlled working class,

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.240
and cheap working class,
by comparison to the West.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.890
And of course, the
capitalists maximizing profit,

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:21.270
because that's what this
system works with, they went.

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:25.680
They're still going
in massive numbers.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.420
China is where
capitalism is succeeding.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:37.810
And we here in America are
facing a very, very traumatic

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.280
problem.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.250
Our capitalism is declining.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:45.310
There are pockets that are not.

01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:47.710
Google's probably one of them.

01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:51.790
But the larger society in
which Google too has to survive

01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:54.760
is a society that
is experiencing

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.620
cutbacks of job opportunity,
cutbacks of income,

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.960
cutbacks of government services.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.050
Everywhere, Western
Europe, and North America,

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.930
and Japan, the political
implications we're

01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:10.330
just at the beginning
of understanding,

01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:15.010
but it's going to traumatize
and trouble all of our lives

01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:17.200
for the rest of our lives.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.070
China is where
capitalism is new, where

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:24.250
it's going, where it's growing.

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:29.640
We live in a part of the world
of capitalism where it isn't.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.540
And that we are
not prepared for,

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.920
because that no one has
prepared the American people

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.440
or the people of
Western Europe or Japan.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.930
Which is why the
trauma of politics

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:46.720
is becoming so turbulent,
as this is slowly

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.330
dawning on people.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:53.160
And they look to blame somebody.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:58.650
A favorite one is, of
course, immigrants!

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:02.330
Let's pretend it's all them
who somehow are to blame.

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:05.358
We'll just kick them out!

01:23:05.358 --> 01:23:08.620
It won't solve anything.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.160
We'll kick out the
old politicians

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.740
and bring in Mr. Trump.

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.360
Doesn't solve anything either.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.626
Dump Mr. Trump?

01:23:14.626 --> 01:23:16.070
It won't solve anything either.

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:18.530
Because you're not dealing
with what the underlying

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:23.770
realities are that have
provoked all of this situation.

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.340
But I do believe
that China is mostly

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:31.470
the beneficiary of the
transformation of capitalism,

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:32.640
and will suffer.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.860
It's already suffering,
but will suffer

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.850
as capitalism moves its center
to those parts of the world it

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:43.470
brings with it all of the
history of turbulent class

01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:46.920
struggles that we know
from what happened

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.350
in Western Europe, North
America, and Japan.

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:52.590
So I would be a
little more cautious

01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:55.740
about the future of
Japan, but without denying

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.460
that they are where
capitalism is it ebullient,

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.320
where capitalism is growing.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.880
We aren't.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.180
We only sustained the
illusion the last 40 years

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.040
by having women go
to work and borrowing

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.420
like there's no tomorrow.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.180
But you don't need an
advanced degree in economics

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.040
to understand if
the wages are flat,

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.000
the real wage that
American working class has,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.150
while it borrows more
and more, a day will

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:26.560
come when you don't have enough
wealth to service the debt

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.700
to pay it off.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.070
And when that
happens, it crashes,

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.220
and that's what 2008 was.

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:36.760
If capitalism was what's coming
to China, as I believe it is,

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.520
both Chinese and foreign,
then the instabilities

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.890
and inequalities of
capitalism everywhere else

01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.800
will descend upon China too.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.390
Just a footnote.

01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:53.470
Last year, there were more
new millionaires in China

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:56.390
than there were
the United States.

01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:59.050
This is in a country that's much
poorer than the United States.

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:02.700
You've got to wonder
where does that go?

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.969
But that's the typical
story of capitalism.

01:25:05.969 --> 01:25:07.010
SPEAKER: Wait, I'm sorry.

01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:08.593
We don't have time
for more questions.

01:25:08.593 --> 01:25:10.030
RICHARD WOLFF: OK.

01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:11.440
SPEAKER: Thank you for coming.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.065
RICHARD WOLFF: Thank
you all very much.

01:25:13.065 --> 01:25:15.008
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:15.008 --> 01:25:18.300
SPEAKER: I wanted to
mention, we do have books--

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.450
"Democracy at Work."
