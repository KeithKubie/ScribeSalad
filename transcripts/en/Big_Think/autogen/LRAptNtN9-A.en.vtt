this is stupid overlap between the two
 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.190
this is stupid overlap between the two
that no one understands and the lack of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200
that no one understands and the lack of
 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.740
that no one understands and the lack of
distinction between art and design and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750
distinction between art and design and
 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.040
distinction between art and design and
art and non-art is so puzzling to people

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050
art and non-art is so puzzling to people
 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.019
art and non-art is so puzzling to people
and everybody wants to be an artist

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029
and everybody wants to be an artist
 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.019
and everybody wants to be an artist

almost nothing better you can you could

almost nothing better you can you could

almost nothing better you can you could
be in almost any culture basically

be in almost any culture basically
 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.090
be in almost any culture basically
because art is terribly important as a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
because art is terribly important as a
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.690
because art is terribly important as a
survival mechanism for any culture as a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700
survival mechanism for any culture as a
 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.029

who can create art as such are those who

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090
who can create art as such are those who
 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.169
who can create art as such are those who
are highly respected and that basically

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179
are highly respected and that basically
 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.799
are highly respected and that basically
occurs in sophisticated cultures as well

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
occurs in sophisticated cultures as well
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.259
occurs in sophisticated cultures as well
but the only purpose of art is that it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269
but the only purpose of art is that it
 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.489
but the only purpose of art is that it
is the most powerful instrument for

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499
is the most powerful instrument for
 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.180
is the most powerful instrument for
survival that art is so persistent in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190
survival that art is so persistent in
 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.060
survival that art is so persistent in
all our cultures because it is a means

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070
all our cultures because it is a means
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.940
all our cultures because it is a means
of the culture to survive and the reason

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950
of the culture to survive and the reason
 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.470
of the culture to survive and the reason
for that I believe is that art at its

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480
for that I believe is that art at its
 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.000
for that I believe is that art at its
fullest capacity makes us attendant but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010
fullest capacity makes us attendant but
 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.610
fullest capacity makes us attendant but
if you look at a work of art you can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620
if you look at a work of art you can
 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.600
if you look at a work of art you can
reengage reality once again and you see

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610
reengage reality once again and you see
 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.600
reengage reality once again and you see
the distinction between what you thought

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
the distinction between what you thought
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.720
the distinction between what you thought
things were and what they actually are

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730
things were and what they actually are
 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.540
things were and what they actually are
because of that it is a mechanism for

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550
because of that it is a mechanism for
 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.030
because of that it is a mechanism for
the species to survive and because of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040
the species to survive and because of
 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.330
the species to survive and because of
that it is terribly important in human

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340
that it is terribly important in human
 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.910
that it is terribly important in human
consciousness I also believe that

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
consciousness I also believe that
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.660
consciousness I also believe that
curiously that beauty which is very

curiously that beauty which is very
 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.050
curiously that beauty which is very
often something we confuse with art is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
often something we confuse with art is
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.840
often something we confuse with art is
merely a mechanism to move us towards in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
merely a mechanism to move us towards in
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.520
merely a mechanism to move us towards in
attentiveness you realize we all have a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
attentiveness you realize we all have a
 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.169
attentiveness you realize we all have a
genetic capacity and need to experience

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179
genetic capacity and need to experience
 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.030
genetic capacity and need to experience
beauty but beauty is not the ultimate

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
beauty but beauty is not the ultimate
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.710
beauty but beauty is not the ultimate
justification for art it is merely the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
justification for art it is merely the
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.580
justification for art it is merely the
device by which we are led to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
device by which we are led to
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.910
device by which we are led to
attentiveness

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
attentiveness
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.610
attentiveness
anyhow this is all very complex and I've

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
anyhow this is all very complex and I've
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.680
anyhow this is all very complex and I've
been thinking about it most of my life

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
been thinking about it most of my life
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.670
been thinking about it most of my life
and now I finally feel that I can

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
and now I finally feel that I can
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.930
and now I finally feel that I can
distinguish between what is art and what

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
distinguish between what is art and what
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.170
distinguish between what is art and what
is not and my distinction is if it moves

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
is not and my distinction is if it moves
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.750
is not and my distinction is if it moves
you to attentiveness it is art if it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
you to attentiveness it is art if it
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.180
you to attentiveness it is art if it
doesn't it's something else

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
 
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550
 
well you know the odd thing about us to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
well you know the odd thing about us to
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.010
well you know the odd thing about us to
examine the art world so call and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020
examine the art world so call and
 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.080
examine the art world so call and
examine the real where the art world is

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
examine the real where the art world is
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.960
examine the real where the art world is
concerned primarily with money and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
concerned primarily with money and
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.460
concerned primarily with money and
status and that's linked to people's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
status and that's linked to people's
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.130
status and that's linked to people's
need to elevate themselves and also to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
need to elevate themselves and also to
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.290
need to elevate themselves and also to
invest in objects that will have a good

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
invest in objects that will have a good
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.170
invest in objects that will have a good
return of course that is not the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
return of course that is not the
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.470
return of course that is not the
standard by which people really

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
standard by which people really
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.040
standard by which people really
interested in not with judge art and I'm

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050
interested in not with judge art and I'm
 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.850
interested in not with judge art and I'm
always amused by the definition of fine

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
always amused by the definition of fine
 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.830
always amused by the definition of fine
art because I never knew what the word

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
art because I never knew what the word
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.820
art because I never knew what the word
find meant until I looked it up and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
find meant until I looked it up and
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.450
find meant until I looked it up and
found out that fine as apply so art is a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460
found out that fine as apply so art is a
 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.500
found out that fine as apply so art is a
term used in metallurgy it means that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
term used in metallurgy it means that
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.300
term used in metallurgy it means that
you apply heat to metal of sufficient

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310
you apply heat to metal of sufficient
 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.310
you apply heat to metal of sufficient
intensity so that the impurities are

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320
intensity so that the impurities are
 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.850
intensity so that the impurities are
burned off well with that definition you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860
burned off well with that definition you
 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.970
burned off well with that definition you
begin to understand something about the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
begin to understand something about the
 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180
begin to understand something about the
subject and also you say well what are

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190
subject and also you say well what are
 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.660
subject and also you say well what are
the impurities of art what my belief is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670
the impurities of art what my belief is
 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.430
the impurities of art what my belief is
that the impurities of art are

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
that the impurities of art are
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.220
that the impurities of art are
everything that does not contribute to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
everything that does not contribute to
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.490
everything that does not contribute to
its function of producing attentiveness

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500
its function of producing attentiveness
 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.370
its function of producing attentiveness
and of course those impurities are

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380
and of course those impurities are
 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.540
and of course those impurities are
largely status and money and then you

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550
largely status and money and then you
 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.640
largely status and money and then you
look at what's reported and talked about

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
look at what's reported and talked about
 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.680
look at what's reported and talked about
in the art world and it's always about

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690
in the art world and it's always about
 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.460
in the art world and it's always about
the money the leading issue that people

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
the money the leading issue that people
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.460
the money the leading issue that people
care about in the world of art is what

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
care about in the world of art is what
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.849
care about in the world of art is what
the Bernard so for 40 million dollars at

the Bernard so for 40 million dollars at
 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.570
the Bernard so for 40 million dollars at
a time which broke old records and so

a time which broke old records and so
 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.380
a time which broke old records and so
well who cares about what the bonod sold

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390
well who cares about what the bonod sold
 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.770
well who cares about what the bonod sold
for in terms of art that's one of the

for in terms of art that's one of the
 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.470
for in terms of art that's one of the
impurities except that it is the focal

impurities except that it is the focal

point and the central issue in art as it
 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.890
point and the central issue in art as it
is observed in our culture today

there have been a million encounters at

there have been a million encounters at
least but certainly one of them was when

that produced a lifetime of exploration
