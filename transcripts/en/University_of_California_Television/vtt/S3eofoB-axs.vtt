00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.529
- [Woman] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.383
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.432
(light instrumental music)

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.733
- Good afternoon.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.590
First I'd like to thank the Charles M.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.542
and Martha Hitchcock Foundation
and the Hitchcock family

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:53.105
for making it possible for us today to

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:56.432
hear from Dr. Sylvia Earle.

00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:59.690
I met with Sylvia a few minutes ago

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.913
and I asked what she'd like
me to do to introduce her.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.167
She said, "Oh, just say here's Sylvia."

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.410
(audience laughing)

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.320
If you were here yesterday
to hear Dr. Earle's talk

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.682
you heard Professor Lester
describe her long list

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.603
of accomplishments and honors.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.870
Most of these are also
listed in the program

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.710
and I will not attempt
to enumerate them all.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.693
Here's a black lightening version.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:32.108
Dr. Sylvia Earle is an
oceanographer, explorer,

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:36.431
author, lecturer, and experienced
field research scientist.

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:38.880
She is the president of Sea Alliance,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.160
a non-profit whose mission
is to create awareness

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.050
of the ocean's importance to life,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.303
explore global waters, and
inspire conservation action.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.770
In 1992, Dr. Earle founded
Deep Ocean Exploration

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.160
and Research, which pioneered technologies

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.753
for ocean scientific
research and exploration.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.570
Early in her career she
led the first team of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.229
women aquanauts during the Tektite project

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.178
and among her several diving records,

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:11.130
she was the first person
to dive solo to a depth

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.063
of 1250 feet without being
connected to a support vessel.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.350
Dr. Earle is an accomplished
scholar who earned

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.030
her undergraduate degree
from Florida State University

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.520
and her masters and PhD from Duke.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.677
She's authored more than 180 publications,

00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:29.630
many of them documenting
the aquatic plant life

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.963
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:37.071
Dr. Earle was the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200
Administrations chief
scientist for 1990 and 1992

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.380
and is currently an explorer in residence

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.550
at the National Geographic Society.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.430
It's this last position that
characterizes Dr. Earle.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.430
She is, and foremost, an explorer.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.510
She's had more than 100
expeditions world wide

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.049
and while she's quick to tell us

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.801
that less than 5% of the Earth's
oceans have been explored,

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.270
I can find hardly a stretch of
ocean anywhere on the planet

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.493
that she hasn't visited.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.220
Whether it was when she
was first learning to dive

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.920
in the '50s in Florida

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.100
or on the underwater
missions living and working

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.526
on Tektite and Aquarius,
she got to live up close

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:24.916
and personal and very deep
with a diversity of life

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:27.653
that is found in our oceans.

00:03:30.813 --> 00:03:35.720
She's logged over 7,000 hours underwater

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.383
in connection with this research.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.740
Fortunately for us, she has and continues

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.651
to take us along on her
exploratory journeys,

00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:46.893
using them to inspire and
energize all generations,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.460
but most importantly the young.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.610
With her passion for
conservation of the blue planet

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.700
and a love for science.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.430
Today Dr. Sylvia Earle
will talk to us about

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.610
exploring the deep frontier.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.307
Here's Sylvia.

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:05.307
(audience clapping)

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.754
- I think that's the best
introduction I've ever had.

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:22.970
(laughs)

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.234
So thank you and thanks for
coming in on this beautiful

00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:30.993
afternoon to take a few
dives into the deep.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.185
I hope if you haven't
already mastered the fine art

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:38.980
of slipping on fins and face mask

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.447
and scuba tank is nice.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.563
Rebreathers are even nicer.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.097
The submarine will also
do, but whatever it takes,

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:50.420
don't miss the chance
during this little time

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.340
that you have on the blue
speck in the universe

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.196
that we call Earth,
should be called ocean,

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:59.340
to explore it yourself.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.360
If I could do just one
thing it would be to inspire

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.590
everybody to go see for
themselves what's out there

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.211
in the ocean.

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:09.871
The biggest problem with the ocean

00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:11.490
isn't what we're putting in to it,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.550
although that's a big problem.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.920
It isn't what we're taking out of it,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.313
that's a big problem too.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.020
But far and away the biggest
problem is the complacency

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.370
that comes with not
knowing, with ignorance,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.590
with just being unaware

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.522
of the nature of the
ocean, how important it is

00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:33.883
to everybody with every breath we take,

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:37.340
every drop of water we drink,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.470
that yes, there is concern growing

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.173
about taking care of whales.

00:05:42.173 --> 00:05:45.390
Yes, there is awareness about the melting

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.390
of the polar ice and just
the loss of so much so fast.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.290
But there is still this impression

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.290
that I have experienced most of my life,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.930
that the ocean is so big,
so vast, so resilient,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.590
that there isn't much we
can do to hurt the ocean,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.423
harm the ocean, and if there is pollution

00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:11.160
or if we have lost a few
species here or there,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.579
or if coral reefs go bye
bye forever, so what?

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.820
Well, if you get out
there and see for yourself

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.047
the answer to that question
comes into focus pretty clearly.

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:28.741
On our watch, during out
time, decisions will be made

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:33.290
or not made, that will
have a profound impact

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.690
on everything that follows.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.060
We live in a time that
will determine the fate

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.033
of whales, the fate of coral reefs,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.750
the fate ultimately, perhaps
of our species, ourselves,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.264
based on the awareness that
it matters to take care

00:06:51.264 --> 00:06:55.270
of the living world, the wet world.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.030
To take care of the ocean,
because that's where

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.625
most of the action actually is.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:05.625
Knowing that is within
everyone's grasp today,

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.460
but not everyone takes
advantage of the opportunity

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.840
that is all around us,
to gain that insight,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.654
to gain that knowledge and to

00:07:14.654 --> 00:07:19.654
allow that to shape the
decisions that we make everyday.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.893
That all stacked together
make the world flow

00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:24.783
in the direction that it will go.

00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:29.093
So I appeal to you, go get wet.

00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:34.291
My idea that I hope everybody
ultimately will take

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:39.240
to heart for an education
program that is absolutely

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.541
vital for kids coming along.

00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:44.910
Yeah, I mean, there's
this no child left behind

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.920
and there's the other take on
that no child left indoors.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.493
I think no child should be left dry.

00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:52.490
(laughing)

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.680
And that means all of you too.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.008
'Cause everybody, it doesn't
matter how many decades

00:07:58.008 --> 00:08:00.214
you've been around,
there's a child in there

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:03.275
waiting to discover the undiscovered

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.960
or to see for the first time yourself.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.280
I get asked sometimes how did
you get to be an explorer?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.163
How did you get to be a scientist?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.030
And I say to kids, it's really easy.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.030
You start out like you, as a
kid, and you do what kids do.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.075
You ask questions.

00:08:25.075 --> 00:08:28.000
Who, what, why, where, when how

00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:33.281
and you don't stop and
you maintain that same

00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.402
three year old sense of
wonder over everything

00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:39.259
you look at and it's fantastic.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:41.730
Whether it's a ladybug or a mushroom

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.440
or the sun coming up in the
morning and disappearing

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.766
over the horizon at night,

00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:50.400
it's that sense of wonder and appreciating

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.380
that we're alive during
this extraordinary part

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.500
of history, making history.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.943
If you want to chose a time,
choose now and never lose

00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:04.943
that curiosity that comes
naturally when you're born

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.260
and somehow people have
a way of letting it get

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.840
inundated with everyday life.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.421
So that's how you get to be a scientist.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:20.140
You don't let that happen
or to be an explorer.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.470
You just continue doing
what three year olds do.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.370
You just never quite grow up.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.620
I know there's some
scientists out there and some

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.281
would be scientists, I think
there's a kid lurking there,

00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:34.880
doesn't matter what you
call yourself these days.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.199
All of us have

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:42.199
maybe a heightened responsibility
to get to know this world

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.822
and understand how fast it's changing

00:09:47.822 --> 00:09:52.822
and do what we can to
secure an enduring future.

00:09:52.823 --> 00:09:55.688
Not just for the rest of our lives,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:10:00.688
but because of the tipping
points that are just right there

00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:05.074
on the edge with CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:10:05.074 --> 00:10:07.260
acidification of the oceans,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.520
the loss of many creatures
on the land and in the sea,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.735
whole ecosystems at risk,

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:16.730
but most of all we're at
risk if you really get

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.886
right down to what matters.

00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:23.886
So I didn't know about these
things when I started diving

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.210
back in the 1950's.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.599
All I knew is that I loved diving.

00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:29.920
I loved science, that I wanted to be,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.870
I didn't know what to call
it when I was five years old,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.623
but I did know I had to do
something with critters.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.587
Later I understood that's
biology, that's science.

00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:43.690
So I made the choices along the way.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.564
Not because I was consciously
trying to get anywhere

00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:50.564
in particular, but because I
did what I had the latitude

00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:52.650
with parents who encouraged this

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.210
and with teachers who didn't discourage it

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.558
so much along the way, to follow my heart.

00:10:58.558 --> 00:11:02.791
That's what I also advise
to kids coming along.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:06.000
Do what you really love.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.296
If it's music, fine, but
let the natural world

00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:13.010
be a part of your life as well.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.693
You want to go into politics, great,

00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:19.404
but never lose sight of the
fact that you are a part

00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:23.210
of the living world and
it's your job in part,

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.840
to take care of the system
that takes care of you.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.320
It should be as vital
as learning your letters

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.850
and your numbers as a kid.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.555
You gotta take care of the natural world

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:36.890
that takes care of us.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.294
If everybody did it, we might
not even need national parks

00:11:41.294 --> 00:11:44.480
to hold the line against
the loss of diversity

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.260
or to protect water sheds.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.247
We might not have to do,
what I find myself now

00:11:49.247 --> 00:11:51.550
running flat out to try to achieve,

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.570
which is protected areas in the sea.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.930
To at least save something of
what remains of that heritage

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.120
that goes back to the beginning of Earth.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.559
That we have a chance
to squander the assets

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:09.480
in such a short time or to
keep them and give some hope

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.273
that they'll be around giving
us life far into the future.

00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:19.170
Today I've just brought a
few video clips that I want

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.350
to share with you to
help tell the story of,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.823
my personal story in part, but
exploring the deep frontier.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.310
It's the ocean, it's most of the world,

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.629
so how are you gonna cram exploring

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:36.800
most of the world into a few minutes?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.310
Well, this is not going to be perfect.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.410
But it's going to be a
glimpse of some of the things

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.410
that maybe hit on the
issues that right now,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.200
at this critical point in
time, can make a difference.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.530
If we really pay attention
and use our collective,

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.791
our individual and our collective powers

00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:04.303
to ultimately address
peeling back the unknown,

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.313
gaining the knowledge that we need,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.065
getting it into the minds
and hearts of as many people

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:14.652
as we possibly can to
shape the way forward

00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:17.677
through policies, through
everyday decisions,

00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:22.677
through whatever it takes
to try to leave this planet

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.680
at least as good as we found it.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.817
At least as good.

00:13:26.817 --> 00:13:31.817
Maybe we can actually turn
things toward making it better.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.629
So yesterday I began with a little clip,

00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:39.130
thanks to Google, that
takes you around the world

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.196
in a few seconds, to look
at some of the places

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:46.116
that have been explored,
that need to be explored.

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:51.116
So I'm gonna do it again, but
with another series of places.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.610
So watch this.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.443
Muah ha ha.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.973
There we go, you made the world turn.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.470
And you can do this too, of course,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.140
that's what's so cool about
being alive right now.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.350
Couldn't do this when I was a kid,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.540
couldn't do it five years
ago, to go explore places

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.450
such as here, the Gulf of
Mexico, the Flower Garden Banks.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.800
A little speck in the
Gulf that is protected

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.963
out of all that mass of water.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.093
Or to fly over eastward from there.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.620
Look at the lemon sharks as
they gather off the Bahamas.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.783
Or let's fly out to the Patagonian shelf.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.850
A place that currently

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.960
is at risk

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.070
from squid fishing, among other things.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.030
That Patagonian Shelf
is one of the richest,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.930
most productive parts of the ocean.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.810
It's where orcas come ashore

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.450
to munch on elephant seal pups.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.938
It's a place that is known
mostly from the shoreward basis

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.923
or from fishing fleets,
but little is known

00:15:08.923 --> 00:15:12.570
in terms of scientific exploration.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.010
The Coral sea, right now,
the Australian government

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.060
is considering establishing right adjacent

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.691
to the Great Barrier Reef,
what could be the biggest

00:15:22.691 --> 00:15:26.100
marine protected area in the ocean so far,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.563
if they make the decision
in that direction.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.260
There's this big

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.370
Barry grouper, I mean,

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:39.960
it's a big Napoleon wrasse.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.990
If you go to Australia you'll be able to,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.136
or go to Google, you can hear
with an Australian accent

00:15:46.136 --> 00:15:50.350
Barry the Napoleon wrasse
telling you why it really matters

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.823
to save the Coral Sea.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.243
But this image of the Trieste,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.930
the submersible that once

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.900
and never more took people to
the deepest part of the sea

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.670
in 1960, 51 years ago.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.180
Oh!

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.530
Once people went to the
deepest place in the sea,

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.560
seven miles down.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560
Nobody has been back since.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.923
Well, vicariously,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.270
actually Japan had a deep diving

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:28.700
ROV, Kaiko, that several times went down

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.746
to the bottom of the Mariana Trench

00:16:30.746 --> 00:16:35.746
and came back but it was lost
in a storm several years ago.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.670
Woods Hole has come up with a
wonderful piece of equipment,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.620
Narius, that has made nine
trips to the deepest part

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.733
of the ocean and brought
back confirmation of what

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.900
Jacques Picard and Don Walsh
saw with their own eyes

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.220
51 years ago, that
there's life down there.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.720
There's life throughout the water column,

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.499
from the surface to the greatest depths.

00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:59.870
Even at the bottom, where
the pressure is 16,000 pounds

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.193
per square inch.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.470
Amazing.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.170
How could we have waited
so long to go back?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.440
And we still can't do it,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.146
although Jim Cameron and Richard Branson

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:17.712
and teams of engineers that
they are paying for privately,

00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:21.497
are working to try to overcome the issues

00:17:21.497 --> 00:17:24.030
to go to full ocean depth.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.220
As I did point out during
my remarks yesterday,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.220
India is engaged in now the
development of a deep diving sub

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.760
not to go to full ocean depth,
but to go to 6,000 meters,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.578
like China going to 7,000 meters.

00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:44.712
France has a 6,000 meter submersible.

00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:48.653
Russia as three, United States has zero.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.000
We've got to fix this, I think.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.130
It isn't just like a race to the bottom,

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.730
as some would portray the idea.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.263
But rather it's a race against time

00:17:59.263 --> 00:18:04.136
to try to understand the
ocean from the inside out.

00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:08.590
We now live in a time
of profound ignorance

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.950
of the nature of the ocean.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.330
Although we've learned more
in the last half century

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.053
than during all preceding
history about the ocean,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.380
less than 5% has really been
seen, let alone explored,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.274
let alone really mapped with
the same degree of accuracy

00:18:23.274 --> 00:18:26.390
that we have for the moon, Mars, Jupiter.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.643
What are we thinking?

00:18:27.643 --> 00:18:30.594
What are we thinking?

00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:35.594
Why are we, why are we ignoring the ocean?

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.209
Except as a source of things to take out

00:18:38.209 --> 00:18:41.060
or a place to put things
that we don't want

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.403
close to where we are.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.050
Why is it taking us so
long to respect the ocean

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.532
for what it gives us everyday, life.

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:55.532
I want to take you to a
place that I really love,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.780
for a lot of reasons,

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.675
but one of the special
ones is that this is where

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:04.610
the first glimpse of what
it was like to see the ocean

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.640
from the inside out,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.423
as much as half a mile
beneath the surface.

00:19:07.423 --> 00:19:09.263
It's still the skin of the ocean,

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:13.130
but this goes back to the
1930's when William Beebe

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.770
and engineer Otis Barton,
in the little submersible

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.585
called the Bathysphere,

00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:21.152
designed by Otis Barton.

00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:24.420
These two guys crammed
inside this steel ball

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.783
on the end of a cable.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.793
Conditions that today OSHA
would definitely not approve.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.350
Lloyds would definitely
not have insured this.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.140
ABS, not certified, nope not at all.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.300
But they did it.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.940
Let me show in this little
glimpse of the waters

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.840
off Bermuda around the Sargasso Sea

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.610
in a recreation and partly, this is real,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.820
part of it's recreated by
the National Geographic.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.310
You can find this on tada,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.503
Google Earth, Google Ocean.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.330
If you go to Bermuda, look
for the little blue dot

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.633
that you can touch and open
up this little sequence.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.970
Intensely blue, the waters
around Bermuda are warmed

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.480
by the Gulf Stream, one
of the world's largest

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.720
and swiftest ocean currents.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.990
Humpback whales pass through
these waters each year,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.193
migrating from polar feeding grounds.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:25.320
These waters are also known
to legions of luminous,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.026
deep sea creatures and
intrepid undersea explorers.

00:20:29.026 --> 00:20:31.209
(dramatic music)

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:34.460
In the 1930's, zoologist William BeeBe

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.945
and engineer Otis Barton,
descended a thousand meters

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:42.183
into the depths around Bermuda
for a first view of life

00:20:42.183 --> 00:20:45.113
in a place the sunlight never reaches.

00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:49.730
(dramatic music)

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.160
Beebe compared what he
saw to naked space itself,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.430
out far beyond atmosphere,
between the stars.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.951
With a blackness of space,
the shining planets,

00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:02.543
comets, suns and starts,
must really be closely akin

00:21:02.543 --> 00:21:05.393
to the world of life as
it appears to the eyes

00:21:05.393 --> 00:21:07.290
of an old human being,

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.173
in the open ocean, one half mile down.

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:17.313
For Beebe and Barton, the
comets, suns, and stars

00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:22.130
were living creatures, reflecting
rainbows of iridescence

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.171
or flashing, sparkling and glowing

00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:27.323
with their own living light.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.750
Fireflies and glowworms
are famous light makers

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.336
on the land, but in the deep sea,

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:39.510
about 90% of the creatures, jellies, fish,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.410
bacteria, shrimp,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.780
squids and many others,

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.543
have some form of bioluminescence
to signal one another.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.483
Scientists say these
bursts of starry light

00:21:51.483 --> 00:21:55.383
may be the most common form of
communication on the planet.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.971
In the open sea, jellies
are also among the most

00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:03.873
abundant forms of life.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.380
The Gulf Stream current can
carry these oddly beautiful

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.591
drifters along at about
160 kilometers a day.

00:22:13.591 --> 00:22:16.174
(eerie sounds)

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:20.859
Buffered by the Gulf Stream,
is a magically quiet,

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:23.767
gently rotating mass of sargassum weed

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:27.930
that expands over more than
5 million square kilometers

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.033
of open waters.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.680
Isolated by walls of fast
moving currents between

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.042
Bermuda and Puerto Rico,

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:40.425
the Sargasso Sea hold a
liquid jungle of creatures,

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:43.160
which have evolved over the ages to exist

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.843
in floating forests of
golden brown sargassum.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.420
Within its leafy, sunlight masses,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.730
are camouflaged such creatures
as loggerhead turtles,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.803
file fish,

00:22:57.206 --> 00:22:58.090
and sea hares

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.543
and the speckled brown Sargasso crab.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.911
For scientists, it's a living laboratory,

00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:10.603
strategically located in the open sea.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.819
For creatures that live
in the undersea caves,

00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:18.591
among the reef and in
the great depths below,

00:23:18.591 --> 00:23:21.363
Bermuda is simply home.

00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:26.174
(eerie instrumental music)

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.444
In the end, I suppose you
could say that the ocean

00:23:35.444 --> 00:23:37.603
is home for all of us.

00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:40.450
That is, that we're all,
one way or the other,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.030
we're sea creatures.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.560
Every bit as much as that little sea horse

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.220
or other creatures that we think of as

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.220
distinctly oceanic but
imagine us without the ocean.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.500
It's unthinkable.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.300
I mean, we are as hooked in,
as dependent on the existence

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.300
of the ocean as any coral reef
or sargassum mat community.

00:24:04.765 --> 00:24:07.900
It's something that, again,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.773
we miss that in our education.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.380
Some people never acquire it.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.924
I feel especially blessed to
have been soaked in the ocean

00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:20.460
long enough to kind of get it that,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.520
this is it.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.750
Earth is blue.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.082
We have to take care of it.

00:24:25.082 --> 00:24:27.493
It's up to us.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.540
A few years ago I began to

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.090
work with some of my fellow explorers

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.090
at the Explorers Club in New York,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.020
dreaming of going to one
of those great places

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.977
that might highlight the
condition of the world today.

00:24:45.977 --> 00:24:49.010
That is, let's go to the real North Pole.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.853
I mean, of course people
have been to the North Pole.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.410
Perry went there in 1909, didn't he?

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.540
Yes he did, but he didn't
get to the real North Pole,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.543
because the real North
Pole is way below the ice.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.127
The Arctic Ocean harbors the North Pole.

00:25:08.127 --> 00:25:11.790
So talking with Anatoly Sagalevich,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.650
who designed the MIR subs with Don Walsh,

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.770
who was a pilot of the Trieste,

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.970
working with Fred McLaren, who
was a pilot or the captain,

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.417
of the Queenfish, the nuclear submarine

00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:27.629
that goes under the Arctic ice, or did,

00:25:27.629 --> 00:25:31.367
back in the 1960's to record
the thickness of the ice

00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:34.903
and the nature of the configuration
of the seafloor below.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.610
So we had these big
ideas but first one thing

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.490
and then another thing

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.900
and then something else happened
to cause the great dreams

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.383
and schemes to go awry.

00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:54.060
Then came August of 2007.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.703
I had a message on my cellphone.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.742
It was from Anatoly Sagalevich

00:25:58.742 --> 00:26:02.040
and it went something like this.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.030
Sylvia, this is Anatoly Sagalevich.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.128
I'm calling you from
the North Pole. (laughs)

00:26:10.128 --> 00:26:13.977
I have just come back
from diving 4,200 meters

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.770
beneath the ice.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.550
Then there was a pause and
I could hear the clinking

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.860
of glasses, I'm sure it was
vodka in the background,

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.360
lots of hooping and hollering.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.629
We missed you.

00:26:26.629 --> 00:26:30.210
This was a great achievement for science.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.421
Then more laughing and
clinking and celebration

00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:33.680
in the background.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.680
Then the killer comment,
but it was our achievement.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.628
Muwahaha. (laughing)

00:26:40.628 --> 00:26:44.900
This is Russia, establishing
with a titanium flag

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.633
in the heart of the Arctic.

00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:50.410
Just a little notice to
the rest of the world

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.409
that they're laying claim
to much of the Arctic

00:26:52.409 --> 00:26:56.253
by going there with their MIR subs

00:26:56.253 --> 00:27:01.067
and by establishing the
hope, sort of a precedent,

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:04.860
to help show that they're
part of the Arctic

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.470
that goes out, according
to the law of the sea,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.516
200 miles but beyond that,

00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:11.840
perhaps, an extension of
the continental shelf,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.783
a natural extension they
would like to demonstrate.

00:27:15.783 --> 00:27:18.866
So I'm going to show you a little clip now

00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:20.950
of going to the Arctic.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.640
Again, one of these little
tours that you can see

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.744
if you go to Google, the
Ocean in Google Earth.

00:27:26.744 --> 00:27:29.571
Find the little blue dot
that will take you ocean tour

00:27:29.571 --> 00:27:31.560
and then a series of about

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.794
a dozen place like this,
with clips that will

00:27:33.794 --> 00:27:36.062
take you on a little expedition.

00:27:36.062 --> 00:27:40.347
This one includes a
glimpse of the MIR subs

00:27:40.347 --> 00:27:44.813
as they make their historic
descent to the real North Pole.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.930
Gleaming starkly white,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.561
the frozen Arctic Ocean
crowns the top of the world,

00:27:54.561 --> 00:27:57.693
above 66 degrees north latitude.

00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:03.598
(rumbling)

00:28:05.832 --> 00:28:07.815
In the Arctic, above the ice and below,

00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:10.850
wildlife prospers, in
what might seem to be

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.313
an inhospitable environment.

00:28:15.413 --> 00:28:19.300
But it's exactly what is
required for polar bears,

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.133
ring seals,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.830
and the snowy white beluga whales,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.173
the highly vocal canaries of the sea.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.167
Narwhals, the legendary
unicorns of the sea

00:28:45.167 --> 00:28:48.480
and bowheads, the great ice whales,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.463
thrive there and nowhere else on Earth.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.616
In the cold, dark waters of the Arctic,

00:28:56.616 --> 00:29:00.346
life abounds as it has
for millions of years,

00:29:00.346 --> 00:29:03.209
unknown, unseen,

00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:06.133
and still largely unexplored.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.297
Under the ice, and actually
within the ice itself,

00:29:11.297 --> 00:29:14.493
life is surprisingly rich and diverse.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.487
Photosynthesizing
organisms cast a green glow

00:29:18.487 --> 00:29:20.807
across the sweep of the ice.

00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:25.254
(instrumental music)

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.460
Arctic birds, fulmars, guillemots,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.288
kitty wicks, and ivory gulls,

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:36.650
survive on a diet rich in Arctic cod,

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.021
while murres dive down
as deep as 100 meters

00:29:39.021 --> 00:29:41.988
in search of fish and squid.

00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:45.071
(instrumental music)

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.886
Walruses look elsewhere for meals,

00:29:50.886 --> 00:29:54.394
using their great tusks
to plow into the soft

00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:57.669
underwater terrain to
extract clams, worms,

00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:59.803
and other tasty morsels.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.523
Deep within the heart of the Arctic,

00:30:04.523 --> 00:30:08.930
4,200 meters down, is the North Pole,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.200
visited for the first time in August 2007

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.500
by six explorers in a pair
of Russian submarines,

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.940
MIR I and MIR II.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.080
For hours they observed and
documented the seafloor,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.434
struggling to understand
the nature of polar life

00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:29.283
far below the surface.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.820
The struggle to reach the North
Pole at the Arctic surface

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.868
has lured hearty explorers for centuries.

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:41.020
- [Man] Let's go, hoi, hoi, hoi.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.560
- [Sylvia] Robert Perry
and Matthew Henson,

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.793
claimed the first successful
expedition in 1909.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.030
Other explorers to the
Arctic Ocean have sought

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.110
the fabled northwest passage,
direct shipping route

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.873
form Europe to Asia across the polar ice.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.835
Today, global warming is
melting the ice cap so fast

00:31:05.835 --> 00:31:08.824
that scientists expect the
passage to become a reliable,

00:31:08.824 --> 00:31:12.313
summer shipping route
within a few decades.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.906
That's good news for shipping,
but bad news for polar bears,

00:31:19.906 --> 00:31:23.211
Arctic seals, and the
people of the Arctic,

00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:26.072
whose cultural heritage
is inextricably linked

00:31:26.072 --> 00:31:30.510
to living in a realm
dominated by ice and snow.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.830
(dramatic music)

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.010
Keen interest is now focused on the Arctic

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.516
and its nature, particularly
because of the magnified

00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:42.278
importance of the frozen
norther waters in shaping

00:31:42.278 --> 00:31:44.540
global climate and weather,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.101
the circulation of ocean currents,

00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:49.773
and ultimately the
wellbeing of human kind.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.320
That last sentence, the
wellbeing of human kind

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.433
is truly what it's all about in the end.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.471
That's what's missing from much that is

00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:14.100
really the focus of attention
for the ocean these days.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.170
It's where can we go to catch more fish

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.690
or where can we go to
find new deposits of oil

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.189
and gas or how can we

00:32:23.189 --> 00:32:26.310
actually mine the deep sea.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.740
One of the latest and
greatest causes for concern,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.210
using bulldozer-like
techniques to scrape the crust

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:38.100
from the ocean floor to
get those rare minerals,

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.340
rare earths that are needed for those

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.340
really important things like
cellphones and computers

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.943
and things that we now
have become addicted to.

00:32:47.778 --> 00:32:49.551
Some really clever engineers
ought to think about

00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:50.430
two things.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.690
One, how do we recover
these rare materials out of

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:58.690
recycled throw away cellphones
and computers and stuff

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.890
instead of just letting
them just disappear.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.460
Or come up with some alternatives.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.860
Why do we need these rare earths anyway?

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.230
I know for getting them
smaller and smaller,

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.555
but there must be some
solutions, some end runs,

00:33:13.555 --> 00:33:16.646
that will enable us to avoid

00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:19.190
doing the equivalent
of mountain top removal

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.066
to get the seams of coal out
of Virginia and West Virginia,

00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:26.253
to take big chunks of the
ocean to get little handfuls

00:33:26.253 --> 00:33:29.913
of something that we value now.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.374
It somehow we need to get
our priorities straight

00:33:34.374 --> 00:33:38.580
and understand the real value of the ocean

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.160
should be recognized every
time we take a breath,

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.738
every time we take a bath,

00:33:43.738 --> 00:33:46.242
every time we take a
drink of water, whatever,

00:33:46.242 --> 00:33:50.653
to link it back to why the ocean matters.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.091
I've had such a good
experience here over the last

00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:59.285
few days, meeting with
students, meeting with some

00:33:59.285 --> 00:34:01.661
of the faculty, the scientists,

00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:04.150
who are doing the important work

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.785
of dragging information,
these secrets from nature,

00:34:08.785 --> 00:34:13.640
out of whatever it is, using your talents,

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.860
using your minds, using your life,

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.096
to try and answer some
of the questions about

00:34:18.096 --> 00:34:20.440
how does the world work.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.246
Little pieces here, little pieces there,

00:34:22.246 --> 00:34:25.620
a connection between
this and that and soon,

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.180
you've got some greater understanding

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.260
that really informs the
world about why it matters

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.110
and what we need to do to take care

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.980
of the world that takes care of us.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.990
I'm really honored to have a
chance to touch base with you

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:44.194
and I hope this is just, really,

00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:49.080
a reintroduction to some of
you, an opportunity to go

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.060
into some of these issues more deeply

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.060
and to make this the beginning
of an ongoing relationship.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.770
I'm going to go now to an
image, a couple of them,

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:05.383
that will be the basis for some comments.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.770
The Gulf of Mexico, that's where I first

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.140
put a face mask and fins on.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.490
In fact, even before
1953, the year before,

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.380
my brother, conspiring with the son

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.105
of our next door neighbor,
borrowed our next door neighbor's

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.430
copper diving helmet.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.953
He was a sponge diver.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.650
This was in Dunedin, Florida.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.344
Tarpon Springs is just up the coast,

00:35:34.344 --> 00:35:38.120
famous for sponge diving
community that goes back

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.873
to the 1930's or so.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.250
We dragged this equipment, I
was a kid sister who tagged

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.878
along to go to the Weeki
Watchee River to dive in,

00:35:47.878 --> 00:35:51.293
using a little gasoline
powered compressor.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.617
Just the helmet part,
not the big canvas suit

00:35:54.617 --> 00:35:57.500
and not the lead weighted shoes,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.260
so my feet kept floating up,

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.090
but it was enough just to get underwater

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.150
to breath underwater, to see fish.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.700
I thought I was there to look at the fish.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.241
I found that the fish were
really fascinated with us,

00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:11.916
with me, came swimming around.

00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:16.010
It was my introduction
to breathing underwater

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.440
and the next year, armed
with one of the two

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.785
systems that were first
brought into the country,

00:36:22.785 --> 00:36:27.785
that Harold Hum, a professor
at Florida State University,

00:36:27.972 --> 00:36:32.745
made available to this class
of eight little tadpoles,

00:36:32.745 --> 00:36:36.260
students in a class in marine biology,

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.877
who were given the chance to try,

00:36:38.877 --> 00:36:43.030
not just SCUBA but also a DESCO face mask

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.280
with a hose going back to the surface.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.906
Again, with a compressor enabling us to

00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:53.410
swim around at you know, 50,
60 feet under the surface.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.919
It was a gift.

00:36:54.919 --> 00:36:57.580
I learned quite a lot
about marine biology,

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.760
but mostly I got hooked on wanting to go

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.356
see for myself.

00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:05.370
Over the years, the Gulf of
Mexico has been my laboratory

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.203
if you will.

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:10.370
The place where I came to love
the systems that were there,

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.697
the fields of seaweed

00:37:11.697 --> 00:37:15.725
and the rocky outcrops,
the coral reefs from down

00:37:15.725 --> 00:37:18.630
in the Tortugas, all the
way up to those that are

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.070
offshore from the Mississippi River.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.300
The Flower Garden Banks
that I first heard about

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.080
from reading Skin Diver magazine.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.885
It was about 1975.

00:37:29.885 --> 00:37:33.100
I didn't know about their
existence when I finished

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.797
my dissertation at Duke in 1966.

00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:39.170
I thought I knew something
about seaweeds in the gulf,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.810
but I didn't know about
this tongue of the Caribbean

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.170
that came far into the Gulf of Mexico

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.060
and not only brought tropical algae

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.770
but a whole suite of
organisms, including corals.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.040
There's so much that we
still have to learn about

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.350
the Gulf of Mexico, about
what's in the deepest place,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.443
the Sigsbee Deep off Yucatan.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.960
Since that first breath of air that I took

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.970
in the Weeki Watchee River and later

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.893
off St. Marks in the
northern Gulf of Mexico,

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.770
I've had hundreds of
dives in various places.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.057
Now, including the western Gulf.

00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:24.770
I spent the night in the
deep rover, one person sub,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.170
off Veracruz.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:30.900
Went down at sunset and came
up at dawn the next morning.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.470
All night just sitting on the reef,

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.290
it was like a portable
underwater laboratory.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.210
But I was in one sense by myself,

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.690
all alone in this clear
bubble, sitting on the reef

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.060
a hundred feet down.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.638
In another sense I was just
in the midst of a metropolis

00:38:45.638 --> 00:38:50.638
of life, watching this great speckled

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.470
moray eel come in, slither around,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.890
and disappear and 20
minutes later it'd come in

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.150
from another area, just
looking and seeing,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.980
then snapping up the
little creatures that were

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.720
attracted to my lights.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.470
It was an experience, that again,

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.800
I wish all of you could
share and could enjoy.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.800
And why not go out off St.
Clemente, off Monterey,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.230
and not be content with
being on the shore,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.918
being on the boat, but
why not jump over the side

00:39:21.918 --> 00:39:25.230
and go down a thousand
feet where the krill live

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.723
in a sparkling world of bioluminescence?

00:39:27.723 --> 00:39:31.610
It's all there for you to do.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.969
I was so excited about wanting to do this

00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:38.320
and I never could and
still haven't been able to

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.820
wangle away to get down in the Alvin.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.377
I tried about 30 variations
on the theme of submarines.

00:39:43.377 --> 00:39:48.100
The Alvin still eludes me
and now it's going through

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.935
a renovation and won't be back in business

00:39:49.935 --> 00:39:51.583
for at least another year.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.989
So one of my good friends
over the years has come to be

00:39:56.989 --> 00:40:01.390
astronaut, sky walking
astronaut, Kathy Sullivan,

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.753
who succeeded me as the
chief scientist at NOA.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.190
We go diving, she has as I say,

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.389
her ups and down.

00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:13.110
She's a sky walking
astronaut but she also loves

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.973
submarines and she's a dedicated diver.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.852
I rib her sometimes about
how, as an astronaut,

00:40:19.852 --> 00:40:24.700
she just had to be a really good geologist

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.743
and really have a passion for flying.

00:40:29.004 --> 00:40:31.405
You know, somebody built
the spacecraft for her.

00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:34.470
They paid her a salary, not very much,

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.169
but they did pay her a salary.

00:40:36.169 --> 00:40:39.007
They made it possible
for her, encouraged her,

00:40:39.007 --> 00:40:41.090
to go off in the sky.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.640
When they came back, of
course, was and should be

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.203
recognized as a hero.

00:40:45.203 --> 00:40:48.540
Those of us who go down
in the ocean, well,

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.858
I wanted to go

00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:53.628
and I got frustrated
waiting to go in Alvin.

00:40:53.628 --> 00:40:57.203
So I did what most
scientists are loathed to do,

00:40:57.203 --> 00:41:01.593
I started a company with engineers,

00:41:01.593 --> 00:41:04.700
Deep Ocean Engineering,
deep ocean technology

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.840
going back to 1980, inspired
after I had a chance

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.783
to walk on the ocean floor in the gym suit

00:41:09.783 --> 00:41:12.970
and realize, you know,

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.573
you don't have to stop
at 100 feet or 500 feet.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:19.693
If you wrap yourself in
a one atmosphere shell,

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.740
like Bruce Robeson figured this out too,

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.870
using the little systems
that were developed,

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.610
mostly for the oil and gas industry,

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.610
but he borrowed them off of
the shelf where they had been

00:41:33.704 --> 00:41:37.270
used by oceaneering
for pipeline inspection

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:38.610
and rig maintenance.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:41.750
Used the wasp and use the deep rover,

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.016
the system that the company
I started ultimately built

00:41:44.016 --> 00:41:47.620
to do scientific
exploration with scientists,

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.460
from most U.C. Santa Barbara,
but up and down the coast,

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.240
mostly from California but not entirely,

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.900
looking at what it was
like in the water column

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.593
off Monterey.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.633
But you know,

00:42:02.929 --> 00:42:06.180
it's so frustrating not
to have ready access

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.883
when you know engineering
wise, it's possible.

00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:13.710
So I started the company
not knowing anything about

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.650
accounting or law

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.660
or the tax code.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.690
Oh, or personnel issues

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.350
or you know, all the things
that when you have a startup

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.193
company, like making payroll,

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.100
that you have to know
about and think about

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.430
and finally make happen.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:37.549
So I did my MBA the hard
way, by starting the company

00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:40.980
and being responsible for those things.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.264
And wrangling, working with engineers

00:42:43.264 --> 00:42:45.330
to come up with design.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.161
Working with Graham Hawks,
working with colleagues

00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:51.120
that we pulled in to solve the problems.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.150
Like okay, you're in a submarine,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.650
but there's a thing that
you want to get out there.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.960
You use this cranky
little manipulator to go

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.700
like a pair of pliers, grab a hold of it,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.707
and oh, you squished the very
thing you wanted to catch

00:43:06.707 --> 00:43:08.733
and bring back and oh,

00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:11.720
it's so (groans) frustrating.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.230
As a diver you can be gentle.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.910
But with a submarine and a mechanical arm,

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.623
it's not so easy.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.118
But why can't we use our
clever minds to figure

00:43:22.118 --> 00:43:23.458
these things out?

00:43:23.458 --> 00:43:26.665
Actually, in recent
times people have begun

00:43:26.665 --> 00:43:29.520
and are succeeding in figuring them out.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.560
At Harbor Branch in Florida,

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.760
with a Johnson Sea Link, at MBARI,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.232
certainly at Woods Hole.

00:43:36.232 --> 00:43:40.130
At Scripts with underwater
vehicles that can simulate

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:44.393
the human presence using
remotely operated systems.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.980
Ah, but here we are

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.830
in 2000 and,

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.173
this time last year, it was 2010.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.220
Gulf of Mexico, where when I
began diving many years ago,

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.921
images such as this were rare.

00:44:08.921 --> 00:44:13.921
Since then, on the order
of more than 30,000 wells

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.920
have been drilled in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.095
Platforms established to
recover the fossil fuels

00:44:22.095 --> 00:44:25.023
that are deep within
the heart of the Gulf.

00:44:26.713 --> 00:44:30.670
Nothing inherently bad with doing this.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.940
In fact, I have nothing
but the utmost respect

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.304
for the engineering
feats that are involved

00:44:37.304 --> 00:44:40.630
with designing, developing,
and accomplishing

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.635
what's been accomplished
in the last 50 or so years,

00:44:43.635 --> 00:44:45.928
to extract from the heart of the Earth,

00:44:45.928 --> 00:44:48.966
these amazing materials.

00:44:48.966 --> 00:44:51.780
I've had an inside look
serving on the board

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.210
of a company called Orix Energy,

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.360
that was a little company based in Texas,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.530
but working in the Gulf
of Mexico to do just that.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.270
Extract oil and gas reserves

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.930
out of the deep see in the Gulf.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:08.210
They were pioneers in really
working in the deep sea

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.727
and subsequently, on the
board of Dresser Industries

00:45:11.727 --> 00:45:16.490
that built much of the equipment
involved with pipelines.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:17.940
How do you transport oil?

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.502
I mean, I really got an up
close and personal education

00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:26.763
about the skills involved in finding

00:45:26.763 --> 00:45:31.650
and then developing this
really, like a space station

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.600
at sea that independently can support

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.300
and that's like a hotel
facilities, but with engineering

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.980
capabilities that rival anything
that we've put into space.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.777
It's miraculous what we're able to do

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:51.100
to find and recover and extract

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.606
and market and power our
civilization all over the world.

00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:58.850
I've served on the board of

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.832
several other entities

00:46:01.832 --> 00:46:06.666
during the years that
I've gotten those great

00:46:06.666 --> 00:46:09.535
parallel education as a biologist,

00:46:09.535 --> 00:46:12.700
as a scientist, working with engineers.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.260
I'm not an engineer.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.200
But I have immense respect
for those that actually

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.863
can accomplish this.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.839
I found this stunning.

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:26.160
First of all that we got this image,

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.631
and secondly that it took
us so long to get this image

00:46:28.631 --> 00:46:33.037
after the Deep Water
Horizon began spilling oil

00:46:33.037 --> 00:46:36.387
from the well that was drilled

00:46:36.387 --> 00:46:41.203
at a starting depth of a
mile beneath the surface.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.764
It took a remotely operated vehicle system

00:46:45.764 --> 00:46:48.390
to go down and capture this image.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:53.390
Soon the whole suite of little
remotely operated vehicles

00:46:54.094 --> 00:46:57.420
were brought to get
images of what was down,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.576
what was happening on the deep sea floor.

00:46:59.576 --> 00:47:01.780
What was frustrating though is

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.925
that we couldn't get a
submarine with people,

00:47:04.925 --> 00:47:08.020
with scientists, with observers,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.160
with engineers, with politicians

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.120
who want to see what it's like down there.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.660
To take them down themselves
and see for themselves

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.010
what is it like on the ocean floor.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.940
What's happening away
from where this gusher

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.818
is taking place?

00:47:23.818 --> 00:47:26.414
This is about all we got to see,

00:47:26.414 --> 00:47:29.513
right on the gusher itself.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.400
What was happening a hundred
or a thousand feet away?

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.823
We still don't know.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.796
When a call came out for
equipment that could go there.

00:47:37.796 --> 00:47:42.420
All right, where, United
States is there other than

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.670
with the oil and gas
industry, equipment available

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.520
that can go a mile beneath the ocean?

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.540
It should be easy.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.893
I mean Woods Hole does
have equipment to do that.

00:47:52.893 --> 00:47:57.440
Scripts, there are a few
place other than just with,

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.563
and BARI, of course.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.420
University of Hawaii has
two Pisces subs that can go

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.703
to 2,000 meters.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.373
And the Alvin.

00:48:12.396 --> 00:48:16.410
Russia volunteered to
bring the MIR sub or subs,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.560
both of them were available
to go down and check it out.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.709
Let's go see what's happening in the Gulf.

00:48:21.709 --> 00:48:25.140
Somehow it never happened.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.990
Jim Cameron convened a meeting
privately, in Washington,

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.010
of the best experts he
could muster to say,

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.870
okay, everybody with assets,

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:38.290
everybody with ideas, how
are we going to go out

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.934
and see what's happening to stop this from

00:48:40.934 --> 00:48:43.970
going any further and to
asses what's happening,

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.273
to get a grip on it.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.860
He was not taken very
seriously by the government

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.140
or by maybe the scientific community,

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.955
but it was an earnest attempt
to get people together

00:48:54.955 --> 00:48:58.716
to really put our heads together.

00:48:58.716 --> 00:49:02.643
At the time it seemed, when
it first began in April

00:49:02.643 --> 00:49:07.470
of 2010 and on into June and on into July,

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:11.078
that we would try almost
anything to stop the flow

00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:15.900
of oil and gas from the
bottom of the ocean.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.160
One thing we didn't have the
capacity to do in this country

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.539
was to whip out a convenient
ROV from the Coast Guard

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:24.370
or from NAO.

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.007
They don't have an ROV at
the Coast Guard or NOA.

00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:29.731
Or a submersible in the
garage with the Coast Guard

00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:31.183
or with NOA.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.653
It just doesn't exist - yet.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.000
Maybe now that we know that

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.570
these things happen, we
need to have the capacity

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.347
to respond.

00:49:46.347 --> 00:49:49.775
Even without emergency
situations like this,

00:49:49.775 --> 00:49:52.910
what about just exploring the ocean,

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.163
knowing what's there in the first place?

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.720
Well, as I say,

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.720
I sort of got to of the
traces as a scientist a bit

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.260
starting a company.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.260
First in 1980 and 1981
and then off to Washington

00:50:10.815 --> 00:50:14.050
in 1990 as the chief scientist of NOA.

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.240
But when I came back I
started another company,

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.242
Deep Ocean Exploration and Research,

00:50:19.242 --> 00:50:22.800
that was a modest little entity.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.470
Mostly consulting until
1997 when my daughter,

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:32.470
Elizabeth Taylor and Ian
Griffith her pal and also

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.529
her husband, also the father
of two of my grandchildren,

00:50:36.529 --> 00:50:38.750
took the company over.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.020
They own it and operate it.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.168
It's over in Alameda and since
then some wonderful things

00:50:44.168 --> 00:50:45.580
have bene happening.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.817
I hope that you will accept
the invitation to check it out.

00:50:49.817 --> 00:50:53.418
Go over to Alameda,
meet with the engineers,

00:50:53.418 --> 00:50:56.970
inspire them with some thoughts about

00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:00.370
not only how to craft

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:04.870
the various devices that we
could use to solve the problems,

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:06.653
to explore, to understand,

00:51:06.653 --> 00:51:10.973
and to react to catastrophes
when they happen.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.020
It's a company founded
with the idea of certainly

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.513
making a living, but beyond
that to make a difference.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.690
Vehicles such as this.

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:26.644
One of them made its way
down to Scripts recently

00:51:26.644 --> 00:51:30.250
as a scientific tool in the box,

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:34.020
to be able to explore
and understand the ocean.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.147
Right now, around the world,

00:51:37.147 --> 00:51:39.428
mostly in the oil and gas industry,

00:51:39.428 --> 00:51:44.030
there are literally hundreds
of remotely operated vehicles.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.220
Some of them active, some
of them have been retired,

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:52.220
but just mostly brought into
service for exploitation

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.410
of the ocean.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.950
We need variations on the
theme, capitalizing on this

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.950
investment to explore the ocean,

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.180
to understand the ocean,

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.640
to figure out what's really
valuable about the ocean.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.220
Not just the things that we
can extract and use and sell,

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.380
but the things that keep us alive.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.833
How we need to protect those systems.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.780
Here's one of my dream machines.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.780
Still on the drawing board,
but taking the distillation

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.885
of much that has been invested
in the Johnson Sea Links,

00:52:28.885 --> 00:52:33.170
in the development of
systems such as the Alvin,

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.130
new batteries, new technologies
for pressure hulls,

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.120
new electronics, new cameras,

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.950
new lights, you name it.

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.811
We've come so far so fast,

00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:49.811
the capacity to design and
build access to the sea.

00:52:50.016 --> 00:52:53.070
What's holding us back?

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.320
What's gotten in to our
heads that we have invested

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.610
heavily into aviation and
aerospace in the 20th century

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:05.034
and we're still doing it and
it's paid off handsomely.

00:53:05.034 --> 00:53:07.280
We're still neglecting the ocean

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.550
and it's costing us dearly.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:15.550
The magnitude of our ignorance
is really costing us dearly.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.163
Well, here's another slick little machine

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:23.819
that is not just on the
drawing boards, it exists.

00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:27.880
Looks like, I don't know
exactly what it looks like.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.540
Um, I'll tell you what it is. (laughs)

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.630
It's a machine to go
through a 22 inch bore hole

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:40.260
in the ice in Antarctica.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.410
Funded by the National Science Foundation,

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.070
for scientist at Northern
Illinois University,

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.873
Ross Pal and his colleagues.

00:53:47.873 --> 00:53:50.237
They want to know what's
going on beneath the shelf ice

00:53:50.237 --> 00:53:51.270
in Antarctica.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.220
We know it's disappearing.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.066
Is the melt ice flowing
underneath the ice shelf?

00:53:58.066 --> 00:53:59.540
Let's go find out.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.237
Sure, let's go find out
it's a kilometer thick.

00:54:02.237 --> 00:54:04.850
How are you gonna get there?

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:08.510
Well, you bore a hole, which
in itself is a big challenge.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:09.680
How do you do that

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.520
through a kilometer of
ice 22 inches in diameter

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:18.520
and then send a robot
down through the ice?

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:22.700
It's a little far to send
a human, at least today,

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.182
maybe someday.

00:54:24.182 --> 00:54:29.182
Then swim under this ice shelf

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:33.550
that is believed to be and
has, I guess to some extent,

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.770
confirmed to have some water beneath,

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:38.520
ut we don't know how deep
or what the salinity is.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:43.520
But to go through the ice
and then emerge at the bottom

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:48.280
and then take this slim
pencil like formation,

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.057
this shape, and like the transformer toys

00:54:51.057 --> 00:54:53.010
that are all the rage today,

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:56.790
open up with manipulators, cameras,

00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:01.320
lights, and a suite of sensors

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.999
that will take measurements, take samples

00:55:03.999 --> 00:55:07.713
and stay out there for a week
or so, sending information up

00:55:07.713 --> 00:55:10.320
by a fiber optic link to the surface,

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.657
where scientists can shiver
in a tent looking at images

00:55:14.657 --> 00:55:16.560
brought back real time.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.451
Looking at data brought back real time.

00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:23.250
With luck they'll bring
the machine back eventually

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.913
and have it fold up again
into this nice sleek form

00:55:25.913 --> 00:55:30.369
and make its way back up
through the hole in the ice.

00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:33.163
So there are solutions.

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.180
What's lacking is imagination.

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.460
And maybe, what can I call it?

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.665
The guts to leap out of the box

00:55:43.665 --> 00:55:46.573
and do something while there's still time.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.231
We can all make a difference
one way or the other.

00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:54.300
Everybody has power, the question is

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.960
how are we individually and
collectively going to use

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.723
our power at this critical point in time?

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:07.381
We don't have a lot of time
to make decisions that will

00:56:07.381 --> 00:56:10.360
have a magnified impact on the future

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.450
about will there or will
there not be coral reefs

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.283
going forward?

00:56:14.283 --> 00:56:18.050
Will there or will there not
be tuna fish going forward?

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:19.650
Will there or will there not be rock fish

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.994
here in California where
some populations have been

00:56:21.994 --> 00:56:25.634
reduced down by more than 90%?

00:56:25.634 --> 00:56:29.150
This is really up to us and why aren't we

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:30.505
really excited about this?

00:56:30.505 --> 00:56:32.788
We have a chance that nobody before

00:56:32.788 --> 00:56:36.790
could possibly know because
we didn't have the information

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.900
we now have and going forward
in another 20 or 30 years

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.660
we'll miss the window,

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.263
the time that is open for us.

00:56:47.094 --> 00:56:50.630
One thing that I find encouraging is

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.560
something, a glimpse that I will show,

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.953
one example of why I'm encouraged.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.900
America's Cup, a sporting event that has

00:57:05.131 --> 00:57:08.603
been regarded as high end,

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.950
multi zillionaires, playboys if you will,

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:18.299
playing with toys, these beautiful yachts,

00:57:18.299 --> 00:57:22.290
but calling on engineering skills

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:26.550
that are at the cutting
edge of today's technology

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.588
in terms of materials, computer modeling,

00:57:29.588 --> 00:57:33.470
looking at what it takes
to get the last little bit

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:37.020
of speed out of wind and
you want to win a race,

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.583
of course, but how do you get there?

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.920
Huge investment of funds
have been committed

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.920
over many years to fine
tune ships that go fast

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.450
just powered by the wind.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.860
But nothing like what is happening now

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.600
using catamarans and
materials that didn't exist

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.750
when America's cup began in the 1800's

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:08.560
and didn't exist on through
most of the 20th century

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.760
and some didn't exist
until right about now,

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.317
being brought into focus and use.

00:58:14.317 --> 00:58:16.360
That in itself is exciting.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.693
Imagine getting these
gazillionairs to invest

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:24.900
in the technology to show
us how to harness the wind,

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.900
get the maximum use out of
something that is basically free

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:33.130
and an alternate source of power.

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:37.303
Well, actually the Cook
Islands in the South Pacific,

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:43.390
they along with 11 other
South Pacific nations,

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.900
have decided that they
want to actually go back

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.832
to some of their traditional
ways with voyaging canoes

00:58:50.832 --> 00:58:54.924
to harness the wind using new materials,

00:58:54.924 --> 00:58:56.931
using solar panels,

00:58:56.931 --> 00:59:00.368
using their ancient
navigation but they can also

00:59:00.368 --> 00:59:04.253
tune in go GPS, why not, it exists,

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:10.150
to reengage transport among
the islands with canoes

00:59:10.237 --> 00:59:12.851
powered by the wind
they way they used to do

00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:16.640
over the centuries that
have passed without an ounce

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.820
of oil involved.

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:23.820
To look to using the sun and
wind to power their societies.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.253
This summer, in July actually,

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:34.120
the leader of the Cook Islands

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:39.120
came to San Francisco and
met a group of voyaging

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:42.570
canoes that started in
New Zealand this spring.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.240
Made their way across
the Pacific to Hawaii

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.920
and from Hawaii came to San Francisco.

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.609
They were here in July and now
they made their way down to

00:59:50.609 --> 00:59:53.380
Monterey and off to San Diego,

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.130
where they'll spend the winter.

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:59.340
Young men and women
learning the ancient ways

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.983
and embracing the new technologies.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.840
The Prime Minister of the
Cook Islands has vowed

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.770
that by 2020 they will be completely free

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:12.090
of using fossil fuels.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.680
They will embrace the wind and sun

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.510
and they will really
dedicate their efforts

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:21.710
to bringing back the ancient
ways for transporting goods

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.880
and people among the islands.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.910
It's there to be done.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:27.482
It isn't like we don't
want any of the new stuff.

01:00:27.482 --> 01:00:30.100
We're just going to go
back to the old ways.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.427
No, it's a merger of respecting the past

01:00:33.427 --> 01:00:37.940
and embracing the present so
that there's a better future.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.590
So they're vacas, they're sailing canoes,

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:44.340
they're voyaging canoes have
solar panels for heaven sakes.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.340
They like to have coffee,
Pete's and Starbucks too

01:00:49.455 --> 01:00:52.860
while they're at sea and they can do that.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:56.230
But at the same time,
they don't need an engine

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:57.520
to get from here to there.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.020
They don't need oil or
gas to power their way

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.570
across the Pacific.

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.823
I met with them when they came to Hawaii.

01:01:03.823 --> 01:01:06.060
I met with them when they
came to San Francisco.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.710
I saw them when they were down in Monterey

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.025
and I'm going to go to
San Diego in November

01:01:10.025 --> 01:01:11.490
to meet with them again.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.294
I hope that I connect with
them in the Galapagos,

01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:16.640
when they take off in the
spring as they make their way

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.460
back across the Pacific
with a message of hope

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.360
for the ocean.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.910
That's cause for hope.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:31.080
I mean, it is, that there
are people who really do care

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.740
and are using their power
to make a difference.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.740
America's Cup, coming to
San Francisco in 2013,

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:39.664
two years from now,

01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:44.664
it's amazing that they
have dedicated their event

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.820
and all the events leading up to it

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.671
to the sustainability of
the sea, to healthy oceans.

01:01:50.671 --> 01:01:53.623
Next week here in San
Francisco they will launch

01:01:53.623 --> 01:01:58.060
this announcement, this campaign,
Healthy Oceans campaign,

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:01.241
using the power of sport

01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:04.770
to celebrate the athletes
who are involved,

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.074
to celebrate the technologies involved,

01:02:08.074 --> 01:02:10.107
to celebrate this great race,

01:02:10.107 --> 01:02:15.107
but also to realize that
we're in another kind of race

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.537
that we can't afford to lose.

01:02:18.537 --> 01:02:21.953
I want to share this little
video clip of the America's Cup

01:02:21.953 --> 01:02:24.549
ships out here in San Francisco Bay.

01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:28.110
I had a chance to go on
one and I kept looking

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.023
for the engine.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.250
We were screaming along, I don't know,

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.976
it wasn't at their top
speed, but it felt faster

01:02:34.976 --> 01:02:39.650
than being in one of these
high powered motorboats

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.030
going across the surface.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.570
It was just the wind.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.193
So take a look at this.

01:02:45.947 --> 01:02:50.530
(dramatic exciting instrumental music)

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.000
So how cool is it that
America's Cup is coming

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.490
to our backyard here?

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.123
I say our backyard 'cause
my backyard is in Oakland.

01:05:57.336 --> 01:05:59.440
The idea that they're
going to put the spotlight

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.120
on the ocean and really want to encourage

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.380
youngsters to embrace
sailing, to embrace the ocean,

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.510
to care for the ocean.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:13.289
This is an opportunity
to magnify the message.

01:06:13.289 --> 01:06:15.830
This is one kind of race.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:18.540
There's another kind of race
that is not really a race

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.605
but it's called that if
you look at the newspapers

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:23.613
about the race to the
bottom with Richard Branson,

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:29.120
with Jim Cameron, with others who are

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.350
saying we've got to get
to the bottom of the ocean

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:32.633
and who wants to be first.

01:06:32.633 --> 01:06:37.070
This should be a race to see who can do it

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:42.070
really in a way that is
effective working system

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.420
or systems.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.150
We need to have the technology
to explore the ocean

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:47.428
from top to bottom.

01:06:47.428 --> 01:06:51.947
I mean, I started these few
minutes of time shared with you

01:06:51.947 --> 01:06:54.100
of the image of Trieste going down

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.570
to the Mariana Trench in 1960.

01:06:56.570 --> 01:07:00.210
Here it is, 2011,

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:02.110
and still,

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.641
only two humans have
glimpsed what it's like

01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:07.590
from their personal view point.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.290
It shouldn't be necessarily a race

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:11.696
who's gonna get there next.

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:13.970
Nobody can get there first anymore.

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.370
It's been done.

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:18.159
But to get there with the kind of system

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:21.260
that will enable a thoughtful view.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.755
To be able to stop and to look around

01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:26.394
and to take samples, take photographs,

01:07:26.394 --> 01:07:29.330
and bring back the news,
not just of the bottom,

01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:33.694
but throughout the full
seven mile water column.

01:07:33.694 --> 01:07:36.890
If you can go there, this is the key,

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:39.690
you can go anywhere in the ocean.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:42.721
You're not inhibited or prohibited anymore

01:07:42.721 --> 01:07:45.610
from going to a place
that is a little too deep

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:47.283
because you can go to the deepest place.

01:07:47.283 --> 01:07:50.620
You can go to the various trenches.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.365
You can go to the deepest
place in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:07:53.365 --> 01:07:56.890
If there's a spill a
mile deep, no big deal.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.570
Just take your little vehicle and shew,

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:01.030
go down there and take a look.

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.173
Check it out, solve the
problem, figure it out.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.200
What are we waiting for?

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.538
This is the time as never before.

01:08:10.538 --> 01:08:15.538
When we have magnified power
and a magnified opportunity

01:08:16.674 --> 01:08:19.960
to leave the world a better place.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.221
Thank you.

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:23.971
(crowd clapping)

01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:30.733
- [Man] Thank you for providing critique

01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:34.760
of the race to the bottom
because as you probably know,

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.549
the race to the poles in
the late 19th and early 20th

01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:43.360
century was really empty
of scientific knowledge

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.540
and achievement.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:48.490
It was great for the press,
great for the national egos,

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:49.960
but it produced very little, right?

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.250
Okay, good.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.383
Now, why yesterday though,

01:08:56.652 --> 01:08:59.883
did you not raise the
question of aquaculture?

01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:04.960
Is that to you an invasion

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.990
of the great blue

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:12.558
wild oceans that is
intolerable or is it a solution

01:09:12.558 --> 01:09:17.558
to the depredations that
have been carried on

01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:21.321
in the name of exploitation?

01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:23.333
Where do you stand on this?

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:29.220
- Well, I think intelligent aquaculture

01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:33.516
has a great future because just as when,

01:09:33.516 --> 01:09:36.881
after 10,000 years we've
sort of boiled down

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:40.090
the options of mostly what we consume.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:44.130
It's three plants,
three kinds, four kinds.

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:48.950
Four, rice, wheat, soy
supply 80% of our calories.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:50.502
Flat out, around the world.

01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:55.502
About a hundred plants otherwise
supply most of the rest.

01:09:55.530 --> 01:10:00.173
A little bit and feed the
animals that we also consume.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.380
It's like 2% wild life, but
that number has to diminish

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.483
because we've just used up the ocean.

01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:14.760
We can still have a
library of life out there

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.884
to choose from, just as we do on the land.

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:20.380
There are 250,000 different
kinds of flowering plants

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.888
and we have boiled it down to this many

01:10:22.888 --> 01:10:26.050
that we use as sources of food

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:28.160
and mostly medicines and things.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.190
But there's this cornucopia
of life that we haven't

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:36.190
even begun to value with the
proper attitude and respect.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.662
And animals too, for what it's worth,

01:10:38.662 --> 01:10:41.520
but low on the food chain.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.100
We shouldn't be raising carnivores.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.050
What are we thinking raising
salmon for heavens sakes?

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:49.280
Even when you take the best
figures that the salmon

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.410
farmers will cite, well they'll say,

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.140
it's only four to one.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:57.140
We take four pounds of
wild fish to get the pound

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.160
of cultivated fish, well
that should be unacceptable

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.020
from the get to because it's
a recipe that doesn't work.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.634
You take more from here to get to there.

01:11:08.634 --> 01:11:11.568
You'd soon go bankrupt if
you tried to run a business

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.630
that way, but the fish
that are out in the ocean

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:14.851
are free, right?

01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:16.790
You just have to go catch them.

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.301
So they're not accounted
for with the proper weight.

01:11:20.301 --> 01:11:24.120
Or if it's not, it's actually
not four or five pounds,

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.202
because you're not putting
on the balance sheet

01:11:26.202 --> 01:11:29.360
how many plants did it take
to make the small creatures

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.122
that made the next size
up that made the creatures

01:11:31.122 --> 01:11:33.750
that you feed to the salmon?

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:34.860
If you peel it back that way,

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.203
it's a much bigger figure.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:40.740
For a pound of chicken it's
about two pounds of plants.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.480
A pound of catfish or tilapia,

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.020
it's about two pounds of
plants, 'cause they go to market

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.303
in about a year, from an egg
to market in about a year.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.760
With cows, it's about 20 pounds of plants

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.760
to make a pound of cow and
it's less than two years,

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.210
it's a year plus a bit.

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.859
Pigs also pretty efficient,

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:04.369
converters of the sunlight's
energy through pounds,

01:12:04.369 --> 01:12:07.440
plants to make protein.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.466
But think about a salmon
or think about a tuna.

01:12:11.466 --> 01:12:15.700
A blue fin tuna isn't one
year old or two or three.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.020
It takes 14 or so years,
according to Barbara Block,

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.528
to get a blue fin tuna
to the point where it's

01:12:22.528 --> 01:12:25.043
able to make more blue fin tuna.

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:29.780
If you let them go they
might live to be 30 or so.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.650
We don't really know
what the upper limit is,

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.713
maybe 25 or 30.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.920
But the big old tunas
that were 1,000 pounds

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.350
are really rare these days.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:43.510
They grow pretty fast but the
eat a lot, they eat a lot.

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:45.823
They're high energy.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.180
Their body temperature is
above the water temperature.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.113
They're basically warm blooded fish.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.540
They consume a lot and the burn a lot.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.490
So if you do the numbers and
it's a rough calculation,

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.123
but considering, let's
say a 10 year old tuna,

01:13:02.123 --> 01:13:05.013
not yet mature, but 10
years old, pretty big fish,

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.330
several hundred pounds perhaps,

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:09.876
that eats other fish that eats other fish

01:13:09.876 --> 01:13:12.780
and maybe other fish and
then down to the plankton.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.335
Where it's, you know within
the plankton you may have

01:13:15.335 --> 01:13:19.130
three or four levels of
the food chain going on

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:23.600
with big plankton eating smaller plankton

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.900
that eats smaller plankton
that eats the plants.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.150
Or maybe it's simpler than that.

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:28.553
You get krill that eat the plants.

01:13:28.553 --> 01:13:31.583
Whatever it is it's complex
right at the bottom.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.568
Think in terms of thousands
of pounds of plants

01:13:35.568 --> 01:13:38.028
to make one pound of tuna.

01:13:38.028 --> 01:13:41.221
Even a six year old tuna
still, thousands of pounds,

01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:44.670
maybe it's on the order of
a hundred thousand pounds

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.043
to make a 10 year old blue fin tuna.

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:49.720
It's not a very efficient use

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.360
of the planet's resources, if you will.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.778
It's a luxury food, no
matter how you slice it.

01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:59.460
And that's true with most
carnivores that are out there

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.293
in the sea.

01:14:00.293 --> 01:14:01.392
Swordfish, high energy.

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:06.110
Speed around, takes several
years for them to mature.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.114
Big investment.

01:14:07.114 --> 01:14:12.005
So cultivating carnivores
should be a nonstarter

01:14:12.005 --> 01:14:15.490
and yet, oh, the effort
going in for salmon.

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:17.590
And they're trying to raise cod,

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.980
they are raising cod in
Scotland and in Norway.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.260
I mean, what are we thinking?

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.222
We know enough to know,
after all this time,

01:14:25.222 --> 01:14:28.090
that you need to go low on the food chain.

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.843
I am a great fan of tilapia.

01:14:29.843 --> 01:14:34.843
It doesn't taste like tuna, but chicken.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.150
What does chicken taste like?

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:40.210
It tastes like onions or lemon or garlic

01:14:41.634 --> 01:14:43.410
or whatever it is you put on it.

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:45.390
The great thing about tilapia,

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:47.850
it doesn't taste like much of
anything until you do to it

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.133
what you want it to taste like.

01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:55.550
So when you get fish and chips,

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:57.278
what the heck are you getting?

01:14:57.278 --> 01:15:02.220
It might be wood chips deep
fried for all you know.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.850
Tastes...

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:08.850
And maybe it is fish beneath
all those layers of stuff.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.800
But they don't tell you what kind it is.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.860
At least you have some
thought that when you get

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:16.401
Kentucky Fried Chicken that it's chicken.

01:15:16.401 --> 01:15:18.805
You don't get Kentucky Fried Bird.

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.290
(audience laughing)

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.990
Or a cheeseburger, a hamburger,

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:25.203
it's probably beef, probably.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.453
But you don't get a mammal burger,

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.550
but you get fish and chips.

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:35.501
You get the catch of
the day, which you know,

01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:39.140
we don't care much what
it is, just so it's fish.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:43.090
So why not raise tilapia or
catfish for the most part?

01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:47.632
If you have endless amounts
of money and investment

01:15:47.632 --> 01:15:50.770
to raise sturgeon or tuna

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:53.920
or whatever for an
occasional treat and realize

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.112
it's gonna cost a lot.

01:15:55.112 --> 01:15:57.400
But we aren't paying the
real cost when we buy

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.260
farmed salmon 'cause we aren't paying

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.391
the cost to the ocean, we're not.

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:04.899
It's this big empty part
of the balance sheet

01:16:04.899 --> 01:16:07.090
that we haven't...

01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:09.418
We'll pay, I mean, we are paying,

01:16:09.418 --> 01:16:13.840
but it's not made
immediately apparent to us

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.890
how much we're paying.

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:17.010
So I like closed systems.

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:18.700
I like what they're doing out in

01:16:20.278 --> 01:16:22.730
the Island School in the Bahamas,

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:24.520
where they have like a figure eight.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.760
Here they're raising tilapia
and they're not crowding them.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.960
They're raising enough
so that the fish are kind

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.385
of happy, they got room to swim around.

01:16:31.385 --> 01:16:35.380
They eat plants and
they fertilize the water

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.433
and the water goes around to a garden.

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:40.900
The vegetables grow over here,

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.316
fertilized by what the
fish do to the water

01:16:43.316 --> 01:16:47.056
and the cleansed water
then goes back to the fish.

01:16:47.056 --> 01:16:48.523
Big figure eight.

01:16:48.523 --> 01:16:53.043
Cook University in Australia,
they're really pioneering

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:56.790
some really cutting edge aquaculture.

01:16:56.790 --> 01:17:00.970
Closed systems like aquariums.

01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:03.680
Now we know, what we
didn't know 50 years ago

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.587
about taking care of
fish, keeping them alive,

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:08.843
giving them what they
need and not killing them.

01:17:10.124 --> 01:17:12.570
You know one of the big
problems with shrimp

01:17:13.753 --> 01:17:16.280
and the salmon farms and the other farms

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.840
that are popping up here and there is

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.295
they crowd them too much,
they feed them more than can

01:17:21.295 --> 01:17:25.313
eat at once and a lot of
excess food goes into the sea.

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:28.980
They use antibiotics, pour it on.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.511
That comes back to us too.

01:17:30.511 --> 01:17:33.200
It's just...

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.420
We know how to do it right
and we've got a lot of recipes

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.090
for doing it not right.

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:42.166
We need to get out of the old way,

01:17:42.166 --> 01:17:45.660
this way that salmon
farms are now managed.

01:17:48.524 --> 01:17:51.270
When you know it's wrong
why don't you just stop?

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:53.785
Just stop and move in the right direction.

01:17:53.785 --> 01:17:55.671
I mean, that's what we need to do.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.462
I don't think we need
to go out in the ocean

01:17:58.462 --> 01:17:59.593
for the most part.

01:17:59.593 --> 01:18:01.642
I do see there is a place for it,

01:18:01.642 --> 01:18:05.390
in places like close to
shore where it's already

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:06.570
messed up one way or the other,

01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:10.720
and maybe planting oysters
or something can help

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.627
clean the water at the same time

01:18:12.627 --> 01:18:16.490
you get muscles or clams or oysters,

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.067
but do you really want to eat them?

01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:19.990
When they been out in the ocean?

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:21.453
You know what you put in the ocean.

01:18:21.453 --> 01:18:24.090
All the stuff you don't want in you.

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:27.030
I'd rather have a closed
system where you can control

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:28.330
what they eat.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:30.409
You know what they have in
their bodies that you don't mind

01:18:30.409 --> 01:18:32.130
having in your body.

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:35.990
Wild fish, you have no idea
where they've come from,

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:38.681
what they been eating or what
you will then be consuming.

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:41.423
Great fan of aquaculture done right.

01:18:42.768 --> 01:18:45.433
Long answer, but it's a big question.

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.380
- [Kerri] Hi, my name's Kerri Tremain

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.260
and I have a question about
Dewar but I can't resist

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.330
a little ironic footnote here

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.950
and that is that these
lectures are sponsored by the

01:18:56.950 --> 01:19:01.458
Hitchcock family and they
were owned a piece of property

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:04.495
in Napa as well as in San Francisco,

01:19:04.495 --> 01:19:08.733
which is the both Napa State Park.

01:19:08.733 --> 01:19:13.010
That park is among 70
parks that are being closed

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.350
by the state of California
within the next year.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:18.570
So even as we're hoping to expand our

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:22.492
marine protected areas, we
seem to be retreating on our

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.773
ones on land, at least here in California.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.686
I had the privilege of seeing the

01:19:30.686 --> 01:19:35.020
ROV, the Antarctic ROV,
Liz showed it to me.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.150
My favorite thing about
it was that she said

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:41.920
it was constructed out of a
very well tested technology,

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.373
that being sewage pipe.

01:19:45.932 --> 01:19:47.183
- Right on!

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:53.100
- [Kerri] And also she
explained that once it was

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.340
through the ice it was
capable of sending out

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.670
radio signals that allowed
other ROVs to come in

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:01.410
from the side, which seemed
particularly interesting.

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:03.140
So my question is very simple one,

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:07.800
which is has it been deployed
at this point or used?

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.167
I couldn't tell from your talk.

01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:11.365
- This ice vehicle, they call it the,

01:20:11.365 --> 01:20:14.375
one of the names for it
at least, is the isopod.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.833
Some of you will appreciate that.

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:22.730
This long, slim, wonderful creature that

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:28.050
has been developed to solve this problem

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:29.600
of getting through a hole in the ice,

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.027
limited by the ability to
make a hole in the ice.

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:34.367
The dimensions were set.

01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:38.210
Couldn't be any bigger than
just so so it could slide

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:39.734
through and then come back up

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:42.670
but then unfold into all
these wonderful things.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:46.810
Well, the money came through,
National Science Foundation,

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:47.911
to build the vehicle.

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:50.788
But what they didn't have the money to do,

01:20:50.788 --> 01:20:52.620
and it's been a big problem,

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.620
is for the fuel to get across the ice

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:00.270
to the ice shelf, where
they can deploy it.

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:02.264
So one whole season was lost

01:21:02.264 --> 01:21:04.760
because they didn't have the resources.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.837
They got the machine,
but they can't deploy it.

01:21:07.837 --> 01:21:09.780
That's still an issue.

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.050
So you can...

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:14.470
It's like old nursery rhyme thing,

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:15.820
yes my dear you may go swimming,

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.198
but don't go near the water.

01:21:17.198 --> 01:21:18.780
It's a conundrum.

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:21.510
Yes this thing can swim, but
it can't get to the water,

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.270
can't get to the ice patch that it needs.

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:28.362
So there have been tests
planned and tests scrapped

01:21:28.362 --> 01:21:31.041
to go to Lake Tahoe.

01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:34.610
In fact, there was a test a
year ago to go to the Arctic

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:36.270
and you know, one thing or another,

01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:38.643
it just ugh, perverse,

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:41.090
a system exists, you can
go look at it and watch it

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:43.760
run through its paces of
opening up and closing

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.330
and deploying the manipulators

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:47.543
and turning on the lights

01:21:47.543 --> 01:21:49.950
and showing you this really cool camera

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:51.670
that will probably have to
be replaced because they'll

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:55.240
be a better one in two months
or three months or whatever.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.580
But you know, it's,

01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.945
the one good thing is

01:21:58.945 --> 01:22:00.420
things do get better.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.733
Better instrumentation,
the longer you wait.

01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:06.250
you just, after a while, you just (sighs)

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:09.514
how much, my mother used to
say patience is a virtue,

01:22:09.514 --> 01:22:13.010
acquire it if you can,
it's seldom found in women,

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:14.323
never found in men.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.250
Well, this one, everybody's
losing patience.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:21.370
Not with the engineering,

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:25.610
but with just bringing
to closure enough money.

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:29.470
You've given us the machine,
you've given up the mandate,

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:31.850
now help us get it there.

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:33.690
This was supposed to be
in the water last year.

01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:35.447
Supposed to be in the water this year.

01:22:35.447 --> 01:22:38.610
They are hoping that by next year...

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:41.172
Maybe there'll still be some
ice in Antarctica next year.

01:22:41.172 --> 01:22:43.099
(laughing)

01:22:43.099 --> 01:22:44.820
If they wait long enough, you know,

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.340
they can deploy this for other purposes.

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:50.620
But come and see, it's really fascinating.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.680
The great thing I love
about this little entity,

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.230
DVR Marine is that

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.350
instead of saying here's the machine,

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:02.890
now go use it, they say what do you need

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:06.764
and we'll try to help
you solve the problem.

01:23:06.764 --> 01:23:10.100
That's the right synergy, I think,

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:14.125
between science and technology,
getting the engineers to

01:23:14.125 --> 01:23:17.288
listen to the scientists and
get the scientists listen

01:23:17.288 --> 01:23:20.420
to what's possible and what's unrealistic.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.658
There are lot of things I can wish for

01:23:21.658 --> 01:23:25.010
that are not realistic
but you get brought down

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.900
to reality when you talk to the engineers

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:29.660
who know their stuff and
together you can hammer out

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.860
something that can
really make a difference.

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:35.640
I think this, again,
it's one of the reasons

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.112
I'm so glad to be alive
just at this point in time

01:23:38.112 --> 01:23:41.850
because you never know
what's around the corner,

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:45.380
what new cool thing is
going to be discovered

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:48.730
or developed or what you can do

01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.983
to latch on to to make one
of your dreams come true.

01:23:53.338 --> 01:23:55.820
- [Woman] We would like
to thank Dr. Earle again

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:58.559
for her lovely lectures
and thank you for all

01:23:58.559 --> 01:24:00.144
of your insights.

01:24:00.144 --> 01:24:01.501
- Thank you.

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:04.501
(audience clapping)

01:24:06.817 --> 01:24:09.984
(instrumental music)
