00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; And I'm thrilled to welcome David Plouffe
to Google.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.980
David spent the last two decades helping get
Democratic candidates elected to public office.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.260
And as many of you know, he was Barack Obama's
campaign manager during the primary and general

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.770
election in 2008.
David's leadership style exemplifies many

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.050
of the qualities we value here at Google:
He's data-driven.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.530
He has a laser-like focus on the user or,
in his case, the voter.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.020
He challenges the status quo.
And he lets the results of his work speak

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.159
for him.
With those qualities, David built a billion-dollar

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.380
startup that accomplished what the vast majority
of the world said was simply impossible.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.320
He's written an excellent book, "The Audacity
to Win."

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.839
And we're thrilled to have David here at Google
today.

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.539
Thank you for coming.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.719
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.839
David Plouffe: Thank you, Glenn.
Can you guys hear me? Okay.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.030
Glenn, actually, used to work with my wife,
who plays a number of starring roles in the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
book.
So it was a big part of helping our family

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.540
survive way back when.
It's good to be with you guys.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.070
I don't want to prattle on too much here,
so we have time for discussion.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.390
So I thought I would just highlight some of
the main --

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.390
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.580
David Plouffe: Yeah, oh my goodness.
[laughter] I like avoiding videocameras, so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.310
 -- but that was not purposeful.
Some of the main sort of principles that thread

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
throughout the book.
Obviously, if you guys want to end the discussion,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.320
we can talk about some of the great characters
and moments of the campaign -- you know, Reverend

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.120
Wright and Bill Ayers and Joe the Plumber
and Sarah Palin, or anything that's on your

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.760
mind today.
And I think one of the important things about

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.620
the book is -- as we're in another one of
those moments when Washington is kind of in

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.030
a frenzy and misreading things -- I think
it's good to remind of the stability in the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.630
approach in the leadership style of the president
as he keeps his eye firmly focused on the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.460
goal, not kind of the furor in politics of
the moment, which was really one of the reasons

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.610
we won the election.
I'd start by saying, One of the big principles

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.020
 -- both of the book and our campaign -- was
that we were successful in large measure because

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.040
we defied convention.
Probably something that you guys try and live

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.850
and breathe every day here.
But we were a startup business in the beginning.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.250
Barack Obama was highly unusual.
And that almost everybody who runs for president

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.630
in both parties has planned to do it for years.
They spend time in Iowa, New Hampshire, and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.790
they build up fundraising apparatus.
Nowadays, you build up e-mail lists.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.890
We started this campaignn with nothing. Nothing.
He hadn't even had a competitive Senate race.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.950
So he hadn't gone around the country and raised
money like most people do.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.500
And as hard as that was -- and it was hard
in every way imaginable -- we had to, you

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.340
know, get bank accounts set up and figure
out our computer system and office space and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.819
who was going to staff and get familiar with
the states that were going to determine our

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.580
fate.
We profited from that period, because we did

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.120
not have a dusty playbook on the shelf about
how we -- or anyone -- should run for president

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.900
in the year 2008.
And so, throughout the book, I highlight areas

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.230
where we defied the convention.
And there are big examples of that and small

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.060
examples of that.
Probably the biggest one is the reason we

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.510
won -- is that we tried to do something that
rarely has anyone in politics achieved, certainly

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.680
at the presidential level -- was that, we
tried to change the electorate.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.100
We tried to change our consumer base.
And that wasn't just an idea, it was a necessity

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.300
for us.
We simply would not have won the Democratic

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.520
primary had the people who always came out
to vote in primaries and caucuses done so.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.030
We had to make it younger and more diverse
and had to get independents and Republicans

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.910
to participate.
And it was a really, really hard thing to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.530
do.
And we won the Iowa caucuses, which takes

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.099
up a big part of the book -- almost entirely
based on expansion of the electorate, you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.470
know?
People over 65 had historically turned out

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.230
at twice the rate of people under 30 in Iowa
caucuses every time it had been held.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.160
And we changed that.
And on election night in Iowa, as many people

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.340
turned out under 30 as over 65.
That's why we won.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.190
And if we had lost Iowa, Barack Obama would
have been a small footnote in political history.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.030
It meant everything to us, and we kept our
eyes focused on that prize.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.169
And you know, by the way, Google played a
role in that.

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.630
Because we found out that these voters -- younger
voters, people who had been checked out of

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.290
politics, people who might vote in general
elections but not primaries -- they needed

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.620
basic information.
It needed to be very easy for them to find

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.630
out where to participate.
And one thing we did in Iowa, and then it

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.281
worked -- and we did it in every primary and
caucus, and Hillary Clinton did not.

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:16.780
And then, we did in the general election;
John McCain did not -- was, we did a lot of

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.250
advertising just so that it would be easy
for people to find out where to participate.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.350
You know, a lot of states with caucuses and
primaries, we had a look-up tool that people

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.729
came in through Google -- just a basic look-up
tool.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.790
"I live here, where do I participate?" No
one else was providing that service. No one.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.070
Not Democratic parties, not election officials
 -- at least, not easily.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.949
I think it enabled us to have probably produced
millions of additional votes in the general

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.100
election.
And so, we learned not to forget about the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.970
blocking and tackling.
Because these people did not know how and

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.979
when to participate.
And that was the thread that carried us all

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.580
the way through the general election.
Was, Don't just focus on the poetry and the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.350
music and all the, you know, great rhetoric;
get them there.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.280
Because, obviously, if they did not vote -- and
there were people, if something happened to

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.620
them -- they got busier at work, a child care
issue -- they were the people least likely

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.130
to vote.
And so, in a lot of states out west, of course,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.570
we don't have Election Day anymore.
We have Election Month. We have Early Vote.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.160
And that's what we focused on -- back to Glenn's
point about data.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.911
I didn't care about the raw numbers in Early
Vote.

00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:32.800
What I cared about is, Are we voting those
less-frequent, young voters?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.840
Are we turning them out?
Because those are the people you didn't want

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.380
to have to wait on Election Day to see if
they came out.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.150
You wanted to get their vote in the bank.
So that's a big thread -- the change in the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.830
electorate.
And listen, the general election ended up

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.820
not being close.
We assumed it would be. Historically, it is.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.870
But on Election Day, we won.
The people who voted in the Bush/Kerry election

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:03.789
in '04, the margin was Obama 50, McCain 49.
Absolute dead heat.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.520
And of course, the electoral colleges, we've
learned, would have been close as well.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.550
But amongst those people voting in their first
election -- or their first election in a long

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.321
time -- we won 71 to 27, sixty percent of
those people under thirty.

00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:19.800
You may never see another number like that
in the history of American politics.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.419
That that big of an advantage in that cohort.
So that was the big defying of convention

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:27.910
that we did.
And of course, what made it hard is, the political

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.639
commentators, the pundits, the media -- fortunately,
our opponents -- didn't believe it could happen.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.639
Did not believe it could happen. And that
was hard.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.270
Because we had to muscle through and convince
people that we had the right strategy.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.850
Our belief that we could win states like North
Carolina, Indiana, Virginia, even Florida,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.960
was a big part of our success.
You know, politics is a competition.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.169
And we dictated the campaign to John McCain.
Because, by the end, he was worrying more

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.960
about holding on to those Bush states that
they swore weren't going to be competitive

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.610
than trying to beat us in Kerry states like
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania etc.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.580
So, it's a chess match.
And by the end of the election, we had checkmated

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.770
the king, because we were dictating the terms
of the debate to him.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.610
And one thing I hope, if you read the book
 -- those of you that do -- you'll learn is,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.889
the election is not as it's portrayed commonly
in the media. Okay?

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:25.639
It's not about the clever ad that you put
on TV or the national polls or even state

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:30.240
polls, okay?
The way we viewed the election was, It's a

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.649
puzzle to get to 270 electoral votes.
And beneath that kind of topline puzzle is

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:39.870
your theory of how you're going to win the
states to get you to 270.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.909
And that's what we lived and breathed every
day.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.709
We had a theory of how we're going to win
every state.

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:46.750
Okay, How many people do we have to register
in North Carolina?

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.560
How many Republicans do we have to get?
How many Independents?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.690
How many women between the ages of 25 and
50 with a college degree do we need to win?

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.090
All of that. And that's what we tracked.
And the way we were able to track it is, we

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.330
had volunteers out there doing millions of
contacts every day so that we were getting

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.560
data back.
And that was our Bible; that was our north

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.800
star -- not any of the stuff that was really
talked about ad nauseam publicly.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:19.230
So that was a big risk.
We also believed strongly in two areas: both

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.040
grassroots volunteer work and technology -- that
you really can't talk about one without the

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.360
other.
And combined and married together, they became

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.209
one of the most powerful forces in political
history in this country.

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:38.320
And you know, the reason it worked for us
was that -- from the very, very beginning,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.290
most political campaigns -- and I would argue
still too many private sector companies -- do

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:51.050
not have those two things: Technology and
the power of people talking to people at the

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.720
core of their mission. And we did. Okay?
We were going to be a grassroots campaign.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.630
We're going to lose.
And our theory was, "So many people in their

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:06.630
lives live all, or most of it, through technology."
And if their intersection with our campaign

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.209
was somehow an exception to that -- as politics
normally was; people did not use the digital

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:16.760
space to do much more than raise money -- we
would lose.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.339
And we did not try and set out to build the
best political website in the field or even

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:24.180
in history.
Our view -- and we got a lot of great guidance

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.340
from people out in this area of the country
who, when no one else was for us -- there

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.200
weren't a lot of people jumping on the Barack
Obama bandwagon in the beginning, but a lot

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.250
of people in your field were.
And so, our view was, "Well, we have to have

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:43.200
a website and a social networking site that
 -- when people are on Amazon or they're searching

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.801
on Google or they're on Facebook, whatever
site they're on, NewYorkTimes.com -- their

00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:53.720
experience with us can't be terribly deficient.
If it is, they're never going to come back.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.980
And I think that's the way you have to look
at it.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.490
And we tried to build a website that became
a home for people so that they could do anything

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.709
they wanted to there for us -- organize for
us, raise money for us, get information.

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:09.440
We tried to drive people there to watch big
moments in the campaign.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.370
You might remember when we announced our vice
presidential pick, we did it by text message.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.390
But in that text message, we said, "We've
picked Joe Biden.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.180
Watch the first event, Saturday at two o'clock
on Barack Obama.com."

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.860
Not on TV. On our website.
And it became a home for people.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.940
And our social networking site became a very,
very powerful thing, where millions of people

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.850
got involved in a campaign and organized in
their states for us long before we had a staff

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.440
person on the ground.
You know, some of the smartest things we did

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.870
in the campaign were just, Stay out of people's
way and let them do their thing -- and they

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.529
did their thing.
And that's why we were able to beat Hillary

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:51.730
Clinton in the primary in places where she
had all the political support and 30 point

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.870
leads.
It's because we had people on the ground in

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.890
Durango, Colorado and in St. Paul, Minnesota
and in Mobile, Alabama, organizing for us.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.370
Long before I even focused on it, they were
making it happen.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.920
And then, once we got on the ground, we were
able to really focus things.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.380
So the grassroots and technology played such
an enormous role.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:16.420
Now, it obviously helped us fund our campaign.
That's the thing the press and observers pay

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.290
a lot of attention to -- and it was important.
Money matters in politics.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:26.320
We raised 750 million, 500 million of it online.
Most of that from average Americans -- four

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.800
million of them -- who gave us an average
of $85.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.770
We've never seen that before in politics.
We didn't take any money from lobbyists or

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.630
PACs.
We took it from people.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:40.241
And almost all of those people volunteered.
And we tried to build campaigns, and I talk

00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:44.709
a lot about this in the book.
We tried to build campaigns in each battleground

00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:47.930
state that, in and of themselves, could help
deliver us victory.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.709
So in the state of Florida or the state of
Ohio, or the state of North Carolina, we decided,

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:58.260
"What is everything that we can humanly do
to win this election?" So in Florida, it was

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.350
$38 million.
Think about that, you know?

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.120
That is probably -- by a factor of ten -- more
money than has ever been spent in Florida

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.630
in presidential politics. State after state.
And you know, it was down to the dollar, and

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.370
we actually shared those budgets with our
donors so they understood what the money was

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.860
going to.
It wasn't just a black hole.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.300
We tried to build trust with people so that
they understood, when they were giving time

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.740
or money, what it meant.
And I think any organization that's trying

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.060
to get people to give time -- whether it's
in Google and they're asking you to do something

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.700
outside of your normal course of business
or nonprofits or political campaigns -- you've

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.550
got to explain to people how what they're
doing fits into the overall message.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.880
And that's what we did.
And so, when someone went out there and knocked

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.519
on doors for four hours and registered 12
voters in Raleigh, North Carolina, they understood

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.980
what it meant.
Because they said, "Okay, I've been told to

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.870
win North Carolina.
We have to register 200,000 people.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.190
And I just did my part and hundreds of people
like me today did."

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:02.430
So the money was important, but what the grassroots
did -- only enabled by technology -- was,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.060
it organized our campaign, okay?
In ways big and small.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.149
And I talked about expansion of the electorate.
We always believed that the best way to get

00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:17.019
somebody to vote -- obviously, they had to
have some interest in Obama, some belief in

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.010
him.
But we always thought the most likely reason

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.959
a 45-year-old African-American man in Philadelphia
would register and vote for the very first

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:29.089
time was because his friend or his family
member was going to do so, and said, "I'm

00:14:29.089 --> 00:14:31.750
going to register and vote.
You should too."

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.339
Why did so many young people get involved?
It was almost always because one of their

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:39.360
friends was getting involved and said, "Hey,
I'm going to go down to the Obama office in

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.750
Durango, Colorado.
Why don't you join me?" And so, the grassroots

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:50.370
movement out there registered the voters,
persuaded the voters, recruited the volunteers.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.750
And it wasn't just the numbers.
We had more volunteers than we've ever seen

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.730
in American political history and may ever
again, except for 2012.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:04.389
It was who they were that made a difference.
When I -- or any of you, who have a known

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:09.389
political persuasion, talks about politics
with our friends or family members or colleagues,

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:15.240
no one listens to what we say, because they
already know what we're going to say.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.220
But 50 percent of our people had never been
involved in politics before -- had never given

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.220
time or money to a campaign.
So when they talk about politics, people lean

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.990
in a little bit more closely.
Say, "John, I've never heard you care about

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.100
politics. I want to listen."
20 percent of our core volunteers were Republicans

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.480
and Independents.
So when a Republican says, "I've never voted

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.901
for a presidential candidate who's a Democrat
going all the way back to John F Kennedy,

00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:43.709
I voted for Richard Nixon in that race, but
I'm voting for Obama -- let me tell you why."

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:48.089
People want to listen to that.
So it was the diversity, not just in age or

00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:53.709
ethnicity, but in those people who hadn't
been involved in politics who we thought were

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:55.770
so powerful.
And then, there were message deliverers -- and

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.630
this is something you guys understand better
than I do.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.970
You know, it wasn't too long ago in this country
where -- if you did a press conference or

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.890
spoke to several network and cable news anchors,
you were reaching most of the voters in this

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.540
country.
Obviously, not anymore.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.399
Particularly, the expansion electorate we're
talking about.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:16.420
They do not watch cable news -- any of them.
None of them. None of them.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.060
They very rarely watch the networks.
They certainly don't read the national news.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.320
And they don't always get information online.
Some of it is they just talk to each other

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.040
through e-mail, through social networking,
through phone calls, from conversations.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.480
And that's what we believed in: That there's
no more powerful communication -- whether

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.042
it's to get someone to try a new brand or
a new product, or to consider voting for someone

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:42.050
 -- than a human being talking to a human
being.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.339
And ideally, it's someone from their community,
someone they grew up with, someone that's

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:50.089
lived on their block their whole life.
Particularly when you knew we were going to

00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:53.470
get attacked in very personal and character-based
ways.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:59.630
The best way to convince, you know, the independent
diner owner from Indiana that Obama wasn't

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.151
trying to, you know, completely destroy the
tax system here and, you know, was going to

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:11.270
protect America and did see America like we
all did, unlike what Sarah Palin said, was

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.639
to have someone on that block say, "I've looked
into this.

00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:15.879
Don't believe it. Let me tell you the truth."
Okay?

00:17:15.879 --> 00:17:18.979
And that was something that got very little
attention in the campaign, but it made all

00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:23.109
the difference in the world.
And technology allowed us to do that, because

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:28.360
on a day that Joe the Plumber, you know, arrives
on the scene, the debate for a period of days

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.489
was about tax cuts and "Was Barack Obama socialist
or not?" -- as silly as that is, okay?

00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:38.009
So it doesn't do any good if our volunteer
on the ground in Ohio is talking about health

00:17:38.009 --> 00:17:41.749
care when the debate for the moment has turned
to tax cuts.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:45.169
Now, in a campaign, it's easy for us to say,
"Okay, this is what Barack Obama is going

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:47.019
to say today.
This is what Joe Biden is going to say today.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.340
This is what people like I are going to say
today."

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.399
It's harder to get 13 million people on the
same message.

00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:57.519
But we're able to do that obviously through
e-mail -- some texting -- so that people were

00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:03.109
as current in the campaign as any of us were.
And that was probably the hardest thing we

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:06.909
did, but it was really important.
And to make sure we were in alignment -- something

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:10.409
I talk a lot in the book about.
And I think -- I look at a lot of people who

00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:15.149
are trying to communicate today, and they're
not in full alignment.

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:19.390
And what does that mean?
Well, from our standpoint, it meant: If Barack

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.729
Obama was in Denver, Colorado giving a speech
about health care -- the television ad, the

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:27.110
radio ad, the Internet advertising, the e-mails,
and the volunteers at the door and on the

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.220
phones, better be talking about health care
that day.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.029
Because if you are not in alignment and you're
not compounding your message activities, you

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:37.850
are missing a huge opportunity.
And I'm amazed at how many people are communicating

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.779
today where they'll have a new TV campaign
or the CEO is giving a speech and the digital

00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:47.200
messaging is not in alignment.
In today's world, you never know how you're

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.529
going to reach somebody.
It's really, really hard.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:56.049
And our view was, you had to fill every space
and you had to be saying the same thing.

00:18:56.049 --> 00:19:00.250
And that meant in a battleground state -- and
those of you living in San Francisco, or the

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.470
area -- you did not witness the presidential
campaign.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:07.269
But if you lived in Terre Haute, Indiana or
Roanoke, Virginia, you did.

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:12.580
And we tried to be obviously on your television,
broadcast and cable, on demand -- we did a

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.820
lot of on demand and got millions and millions
of people watching lengthier programming.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.470
That was a huge asset.
We were all over radio, including on traditional

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.559
radio. A lot of faith radio.
A lot of radio that sports men and women listen

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:29.130
to, to go right after McCain and his base.
We did an enormous amount of Internet advertising

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.399
obviously, more so than anyone had ever done
as a balance.

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:35.399
But we also wanted to be at community events.
We wanted to be at your doors.

00:19:35.399 --> 00:19:38.950
We wanted to be in your e-mail and your cell
phone -- not to annoy you, but you never know

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.049
when you're going to be able to capture somebody.
And so, that's got to be compounded.

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:47.419
So that's a thread of the book in the campaign
that I think was really, really important.

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:52.149
And then, last thing I'll say on a big point
was -- and you know, this maybe crossing into

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:57.580
kum bah yah land, but -- you guys are an entity
that believes in culture of the organization

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:03.580
and we did too.
And first of all, the volunteers in our campaign

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.790
were extension of our staff.
We didn't, you know, it wasn't like the volunteers

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.809
are a nice addition.
They were our campaign.

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:13.710
We made strategic decisions based on what
we thought they could mean to the campaign.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.039
We wouldn't have targeted Indiana and North
Carolina, for instance, if we didn't have

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:20.010
a strong enough grassroots campaign, because
we thought there was no way we could win either

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.859
one of those states without what we had on
the ground.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:27.809
So we had a great communication network and
esprit de corps with our volunteers, starting

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.940
with Barack Obama.
You know, there was a lot of discussion of,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.669
"Okay, well.
What you guys did with technology with volunteers,

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:37.190
other campaigns should do that."
Well, I happen to think everybody running

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.809
for office should try and get people involved
in our campaign.

00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:42.609
But it's not that easy. You can't manufacture
this.

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:47.539
The reason it worked is, Barack Obama had
a relationship with 13 million Americans.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:52.169
And it strengthened and solidified so that
they got inspired to give time they did not

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:55.049
have to give and money they did not have to
give.

00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:59.070
And the tactics and the technologies and the
tools and the strategies would have been pointless

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.100
without that.
But that relationship was strong, and we trusted

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.409
them.
And I think most of our volunteers really

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:10.289
believed that Barack Obama and his campaign
really believed in them -- that what they

00:21:10.289 --> 00:21:14.970
were doing mattered.
But also, you know, for all of us in the campaign,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.720
you know -- campaigns are tough.
And we went through moments of great challenge

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.210
and triumph.
All of '07, no one thought we could win.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.509
We lose the New Hampshire primary; it looked
like we had lost our chance.

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:26.710
We go through the Reverend Wright thing, which
was deeply challenging.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.749
Obviously dealing with the furor around Palin
challenged us as well.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:35.549
And he was at his calmest and his best and
his most dogged during those moments.

00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:38.840
And calmness kind of infiltrated the entire
organization.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.419
And I can't tell you how important that is.
And I think it's important today, as you're

00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:46.070
trying to sort through all the challenges,
and -- I would still argue -- huge opportunities

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.619
we have in this country, if we only have the
courage to take advantage of them.

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:55.090
That calmness -- which should not be mistaken
for a lack of urgency -- was really important.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:01.619
The other thing: We were very metrics-driven.
And we had strategy/message, which were the

00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:05.649
two pillars of any political campaign.
Google probably has different pillars.

00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:08.639
For us, it's, "What's your electoral strategy?
What's your message?"

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:13.409
We were not a democracy in that regard.
And that's what we were going to do.

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:16.649
We weren't arrogant.
We weren't sure they'd work, but our view

00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:20.029
was, you had to commit yourself to a path.
Campaigns are short.

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:23.849
What's your path? What's your theory of success
and stick to it.

00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:28.570
And we tried to educate people in the campaign
 -- from senior staff down to the volunteer

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:34.019
what that was, so that decision making became
uneventful.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:39.729
As a leader, that's the thing I'm most interested
in, by the way -- making decision-making uneventful.

00:22:39.729 --> 00:22:43.729
So that there's clarity on things.
Things either support your strategy and your

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:46.840
message or they don't.
So 98 percent of the things that cross your

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.200
desk are easy yes's or no.
And people in the organization did understand

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.229
why.
Even if they disagree, they understand that

00:22:53.229 --> 00:22:57.960
there's a theory behind it.
And it is not subjective.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.389
And we were that way in terms of measuring
performance.

00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:05.950
And you guys are more into data than I am,
but we measured people's performance in the

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.479
campaign -- by the way, including volunteers.
We had to relieve some volunteers of their

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:13.629
duty, because we weren't getting the job done.
But it was based on numbers.

00:23:13.629 --> 00:23:18.019
How much money were we supposed to raise in
this city this day?

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:21.900
How many volunteers were we supposed to recruit?
What kind of press coverage were we supposed

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.359
to get in the local market?
How many votes were we supposed to bank today?

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:31.919
All of that was laid out.
So that, as we viewed the campaign, we didn't

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:37.559
say, "Hey, we had a good day today, because
the pundits on CNN said we did."

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:41.460
We had a good day today, because we hit our
metrics in most places.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.580
And so then, when we're able to talk to -- when
we had to have conversations with people about

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.549
their performance, they could be done in a
very, very objective fashion.

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:54.769
And if we needed a course-correct, I think
our employees understood that it wasn't based

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:59.139
on some subjective thought about their performance.
It was based on cold, hard numbers.

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:04.929
So none of that's as exciting as, you know,
dealing with Sarah Palin or, you know, some

00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:08.989
of the advertising we did.
But politics, at the end of the day, is about

00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:11.809
a lot of blocking and tackling.
It's about having a clear strategy.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:16.719
Now, none of the stuff I've mentioned matters,
obviously, if you don't have a wonderful candidate.

00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:21.469
And that's the thing that really threads through
the book most importantly of all is that -- someone

00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:26.219
who had never been on this national political
stage, who every time he went to a county

00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:30.710
or a town in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina,
it was always the first time he had been there

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.460
his entire life.
And never had a negative ad run against him.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:40.399
Had never been through a tough, rigorous proctological
exam by the press. [laughter]

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:44.509
None of these things had happened.
And yet, over a two-year period, in what is

00:24:44.509 --> 00:24:48.929
a flawed process in many ways: You could say,
"It's too long. It's too expensive." It can

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:53.929
be too banal.
It is enormously transparent, particularly

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:58.200
with technology where people can fire up their
computers and watch any video, any interview,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.080
any speech a candidate's given.
And increasingly, that will be done on mobile

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.259
devices.
You cannot hide who you are.

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:09.960
And over that two-year period, he built a
grassroots movement and fed it and nourished

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.580
it, the likes of which we'd never seen.
He ran that obstacle course, which is highly

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.029
brutal, and grew in stature for the American
people.

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:23.109
Most people diminish over time in a campaign
like that. He grew.

00:25:23.109 --> 00:25:29.139
And at the moments of greatest crisis -- Reverend
Wright, losing New Hampshire, the economic

00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:32.419
crisis, McCain saying he's not going to debate.
All these moments.

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:35.249
We couldn't take a poll to decide how to deal
with it.

00:25:35.249 --> 00:25:40.989
It was his instincts and judgments and performance
that led us out of the wilderness.

00:25:40.989 --> 00:25:45.909
And so, I think that's something that comes
through clearly in the book is that, you know,

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:50.379
I think there's far too much attention paid
to our campaign in terms of the tactics and

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:53.889
the strategy.
None of that matters without a candidate who

00:25:53.889 --> 00:25:57.529
met his time and met his moment.
And that's what we had in president Obama.

00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:04.830
So with that, I'd be happy to entertain anything
you guys have on your mind.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.749
And don't be shy. Yes, sir.

00:26:06.749 --> 00:26:09.889
Q Just wondering how the campaign tactics
differ between a caucus state and a non-caucus

00:26:09.889 --> 00:26:10.889
state?

00:26:10.889 --> 00:26:14.739
David Plouffe: Difference between caucus and
non-caucus state.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.570
Well, very different.
Obviously, caucuses historically have lower

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.639
turn out.
How many of you have been to a caucus?

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:23.200
Wow. What state?

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.370
Q I was a volunteer down at Texas.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.840
David Plouffe: Texas caucus.
Well, caucus basically in most states, you've

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:39.580
got to show up at one time -- so 6:30, 7:00.
You separate into groups -- publicly -- so

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.470
your neighbors are there.
And you go in the corner.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.119
Here's the Obama group.
Here's the Clinton group.

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:48.879
Here's the Edwards group.
So you publicly state your preference.

00:26:48.879 --> 00:26:52.519
And then, in most states, if your candidate
doesn't get 15 percent of the people in that

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:56.919
group, then you get to vote twice essentially.
So you've got to know who's everybody's second

00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:01.129
choice is.
In a lot of states, like Iowa, they also conduct

00:27:01.129 --> 00:27:04.580
party business before you get to the voting.
So someone's got to make like, a two-hour

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.059
commitment to be there.
That's why turn out is really low.

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:15.039
Now, there became a mythology that caucuses
were our territory and primaries were hers.

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:20.539
I can tell you in every state where there
were caucuses -- our initial polling, we were

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:23.830
getting clobbered.
And had the people who normally turned out

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.359
in caucuses turned out, we would have gotten
clobbered.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:31.190
Caucuses were where we had to expand the electorate.
Now, because turn out had been so low, you

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:35.269
had a greater ability to expand the electorate,
because in a primary, you can only go from,

00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:39.669
let's say, here to here.
And caucus you go from here to here.

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:42.060
So that's what we set out to do.
So the expansion of the electorate.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.769
And then, it's organizing.
I mean, you've got to be on people -- like

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.739
white on rice, all the way through -- to make
sure they go.

00:27:48.739 --> 00:27:51.379
And we did a lot of demystifying of the caucus
for people.

00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:54.899
We put out videos.
We did trainings to say, "It's not as bad

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:58.159
as you think.
Just show up and everything will be okay."

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.580
And so, you have to have -- there are people
called 'precinct captains'.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.460
There are volunteers, okay?
There are people who are teachers.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.749
People who work at Google.
People who run businesses who say, "I will

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:13.059
be the Obama precinct captain, and I will
take responsibility for convincing the people

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:17.859
in my precinct to support him to turn out.
And on caucus night, I will run that precinct.

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:20.690
I will have it organized."
It's an enormous amount of responsibility

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.440
for a volunteer.
And so, it's very different.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.489
I happen to think caucuses are wonderful,
because I believe in grassroots politics.

00:28:27.489 --> 00:28:31.460
I think it made us a stronger campaign in
the general, because we were so organized.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.769
You have to organize in every precinct.
So that was the difference.

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:35.769
Yes, sir.

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:44.759
Q So you were talking about how you have this
huge network of supporters to react really

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:49.909
quickly to topics -- [inaudible]

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:56.849
David Plouffe: Sure. Well, one of the things
we tried to do was -- Listen, there would

00:28:56.849 --> 00:29:01.059
be moments of the campaign where we were leaning
into a health care comparison with McCain

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:05.601
or a debate on diplomacy with Hillary Clinton,
and then we wanted everybody in the campaign

00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:09.460
to be talking about that. Okay?
Back to my point about alignment.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.649
But one thing we tried to do -- even in moments
like that -- but just general like, when we

00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:19.809
were in Iowa, and we were trying to build
in Iowa -- the thing we tell people is -- who

00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:22.629
said, "Well, I've decided to support Obama."
They tell us.

00:29:22.629 --> 00:29:26.499
"Well, go get more people to support Obama."
"But what do you want me to say?" "Well, say

00:29:26.499 --> 00:29:30.840
what you're going to say, because if you're
reading off some script, it's not going to

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.960
be authentic."
It's always more authentic when someone speaks

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.630
from here.
And so, even on health care, we wanted them

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.299
to be able to have the best sentence down
about Obama's health care plan and how it

00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:44.349
differed with McCain.
But it was always best if they said, "And

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:47.789
listen, I care about this, because my sister
was denied coverage by the insurance companies.

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:51.769
And we have to get change now."
That was always more powerful than a stale

00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:53.899
script.
So we did something a little bit unusual.

00:29:53.899 --> 00:29:58.580
We encouraged people to speak from their heart
 -- to not be automatons.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:05.909
And obviously, we did a lot of user-generated
 -- both, you know, text commentary and video

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:09.379
commentary throughout the campaign.
And it was a great way for people to express

00:30:09.379 --> 00:30:13.359
themselves.
And it also -- there was an authenticity to

00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:15.799
it.
One of the things we did -- we shared a lot

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:20.399
of videos and other -- we captured a lot of
the work that was going on out there in the

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:23.960
country and shared it with people.
Because not everybody who was out there volunteering

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.460
in Anderson, Indiana would necessarily, you
know, I think relate to what I was doing on

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.600
a given day or David Axelrod, but they relate
to what the volunteer in Denver, Colorado

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.119
was doing and say, "Hey. Boy, they put on
a great canvas. I can do that too."

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:41.019
So we tried to let a thousand flowers bloom
and let people talk from the heart.

00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:43.990
And even in our advertising -- and this was
a challenge, because some of the firms that

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.070
we brought in to work with us, you know, they
were used to kind of scripting everybody.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.669
"This is what I want the person to say." And
we didn't want that to happen.

00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:55.739
People always put things in a more compelling
way if you just let them talk.

00:30:55.739 --> 00:30:59.049
And it always sounds less political.
So when we did ads with people in them, we

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:02.909
just let them talk.
And you know, it was always better than if

00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:05.589
we had said, "Hey, why don't you say this?"
Always better.

00:31:05.589 --> 00:31:11.089
And you know, Listen, authenticity -- people's
B.S. meter is highly sensitized, particularly

00:31:11.089 --> 00:31:16.059
younger voters. Particularly younger voters.
And you guys probably find this.

00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:21.070
And if we were not dealing authentically,
you know, they'd let us know.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.909
And that's why, if you look at the videos
we did throughout the campaign -- I'm just

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:29.779
talking about videos that we e-mailed out
to people, to our supporters, to get them

00:31:29.779 --> 00:31:33.719
motivated -- whether they were from me or
from Barack Obama -- they weren't scripted.

00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:37.099
You know, he'd come off the stage at a rally
just talk to the camera.

00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:41.499
You know, we have some sense of, "Hey, we're
doing a big voter registration effort."

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.700
Or Early Vote effort.
So he'd talk about that, but then, he'd just

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.450
talk.
And I do the same thing.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:51.539
And you know, I did one where -- I remember
the first couple I did, I just did them on

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:55.669
a Mac laptop camera and, you know, a couple
of people in the campaign said, "Hey, you

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:58.549
know, Plouffe, we're running for president
and you look like your in the hostage video.

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:03.039
[laughter] You know.
Can we professionalize this up a little bit?"

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:07.250
So we tried one where we went to an office
and lit it and shot it with an HD camera,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.729
and our supporters hated it.
Because it was like propaganda to them.

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:13.849
They wanted to be let in the campaign.
They wanted me to roll out a debate prep at

00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:17.360
2 a.m. in the morning and flew to Ohio, kind
of groggy-eyed and speaking to the camera

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.679
about what was going on.
And so, we learned a lot from that -- that

00:32:20.679 --> 00:32:23.849
authenticity you know.
And listen, at the core, remember Barack Obama

00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:28.209
was challenged a lot in the campaign.
He doesn't speak enough in sound bites.

00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:31.649
He's trusting voters to have an adult conversation,
of all things.

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:34.989
He's too professorial.
Now, he wasn't going to change who he was,

00:32:34.989 --> 00:32:38.779
because he said, "This is who I am." that
authenticity.

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:43.249
I think candidates always get in difficulty
when they kind of adjust something core to

00:32:43.249 --> 00:32:46.249
who they are.
And we had a candidate who that just wasn't

00:32:46.249 --> 00:32:48.279
a debate.
Whether it would have been a smart thing to

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:50.879
do or not, it just wasn't entertainment.
Yes, sir.

00:32:50.879 --> 00:32:59.179
Q Two questions. One, what do you think happened
this summer when the conservatives I would

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:06.990
say won the grassroots effort on health care
[inaudible]?

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:16.839
David Plouffe: Well first, I would heavily
disagree with the notion that they won.

00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:21.679
People on Fox and CNN were talking about them.
That's not reality, okay?

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:27.339
Reality is what is happening on the ground
throughout the country.

00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:31.789
And I think that, in the campaign, the truth
is, the organizing that we did that is so

00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:36.621
kind of mythologized now, it wasn't appreciated
during the campaign.

00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:40.529
It wasn't until people saw the election results.
They said, "Hey, all those volunteers actually

00:33:40.529 --> 00:33:44.789
made a difference."
And what happened -- and we have been organizing

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:49.450
on health care going back to the spring.
We've had millions of Americans making phone

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:54.519
calls, sending out e-mails, you know, visiting
Congress.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:34:02.230
Now, some of the tea-baggers in a few town
halls, you know, the truth is, this is not

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.440
an interesting story to the media.
Eighty supporters of Barack Obama showed up

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.629
at a town hall today to express support for
health care.

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:14.000
In their view, "Boring."
But people yelling and screaming, that's exciting.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.039
So, but if you look at health care reform,
it has remained remarkably stable in terms

00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:22.980
of support, okay?
Now, there's a lot of people opposed to it,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.740
a lot of people supporting it.
The components of it actually have grown in

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.779
support.
Why is that?

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:31.069
Because if you look at historical health care
reform efforts -- whether it was Bill Clinton,

00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:37.760
whether it was Richard Nixon, whether it was
Harry Truman, whether it was both Roosevelts.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.680
You know, by this time health care reform
had been stripped bare because of all the

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.769
attacks.
And support for health care has remained pretty

00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:48.740
stable.
Why is that? Because my view is, people are

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.919
talking to each other about this.
And they're saying, "Okay, death panels. Do

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:56.099
we believe it or not? We don't."
"Am I not going to be able to see my doctor

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:57.880
anymore?
Well, let me think about that. Let me share

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.769
information. I don't think so."
So I think they did a good job of capturing

00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:08.940
the media's attention, but I don't think structurally.
And listen, the members of Congress -- certainly

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.490
the Democratic members of Congress -- know
what's happening on the ground.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:16.539
The vast, vast majority of them have heard
from our side on this.

00:35:16.539 --> 00:35:21.190
The vast majority of town halls were flooded
with people supporting health care reform.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.579
So I think they did some clever tactically
things.

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:28.050
I don't think that what you're seeing right
now, by the way -- the canvassing, the phone

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.289
calling -- it's not happening on the other
side.

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:35.000
So they did a good job of kind of capturing
the fascination of the media, but I don't

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.693
think structurally.
For me, personally, you know I have a young

00:35:37.693 --> 00:35:40.880
family -- we went through two years, as everyone
else did in the administration.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.850
Everyone had to make their personal decision.
It just didn't make sense for me.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.950
I had an infant daughter born two days after
the election on top of our son.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.099
I just couldn't go in for two years. Maybe
longer.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:55.329
I mean, I don't really have a huge desire
to work in the White House.

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.990
I have a huge desire to help him.
I'm under no illusions that, at some point,

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:03.230
I'm probably going to -- the gig will be up
and I'll have to hand back over my life and

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.640
I'll be happy to do so.
So I'm just doing what I can on the outside

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.990
for a couple of years, and then we'll see.
But I think, listen, the truth is -- You know,

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:16.510
it's funny, I was on a radio show here earlier
today with Ron Owens.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:20.839
And he was playing some clips of Obama's speeches
during the campaign.

00:36:20.839 --> 00:36:28.180
And it is remarkable that he is trying to
do exactly what he said he was going to do.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.550
And there is a belief out there that it should
be easier than it is.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.510
But let me tell you something.
The reason he ran for president was, he believed

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.380
on health care and energy -- to some extent
on education.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.849
Washington was failing the country.
If we do not stop spending twice as much money

00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:46.440
on health care as our competitors, if we do
not lead on green technology and jobs -- as

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.460
we did in the industrial, information revolution
 -- and, if we don't reform our education

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.890
system, 25, 50 years from now, there is no
guarantee this country -- the United States

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.190
of America -- will be as strong as it is today
or has been.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.059
We have to renew ourselves.
And Washington wasn't getting the job done,

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:05.170
because Washington is very short-term.
It's very political.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:09.470
It's always easy to say, "No, not this year.
Not now."

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.029
And that's what he's delivering on.
And this is a really, really hard thing to

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:14.261
do.
Because think about it: As he's trying to

00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:18.660
triage the economy, along with the private
sector obviously, he's trying to do these

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.250
long-term structural things.
Long-term, meaning the benefits of health

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.569
care are going to take a long time to settle
in.

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:29.660
The investments in energy are going to take
some time to materialize.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:35.940
The education changes take some time to materialize.
So you're asking Congress and the country

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.200
to do things that the positive benefit won't
be apparent in the next election, or the one

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.290
after that, or the one after that.
And that's what Washington has refused to

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.900
do.
So I think that one of his strengths, by the

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:56.339
way, is during August -- during the 'tea bag'
moment -- we went through some tough moments

00:37:56.339 --> 00:38:01.450
in the campaign where the kind of commentariat
questioned us.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:07.240
He and his organization do not view their
success or failures through the prism of that.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.650
They have goals.
They have metrics internally that they're

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:14.050
trying to get to.
Because if you govern based on the kind of

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.910
politics of the moment -- listen, Fox News
is doing well ratings-wise.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.690
But let's remember this -- their average viewership
at night, so during the the great you know,

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:27.119
three hours of Reilly and Beck and van Sustren,
it's only two and a half million people.

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:31.380
Think about that. 140 million people voted
in the elections.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.980
Less than two percent of the election. That
is not reality.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.210
But it is viewed as reality in Washington.
And so, it's something you have to have a

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:42.680
lot of discipline and strength not to overreact
to, in my view. Yeah.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:53.950
Q So I think education and health care are
two of the _____ spinned by most of the time.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:54.950
I was definitely an Obama supporter after
the primary.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:39:01.790
But one thing, after watching the debates,
that all the candidates seem to have a very

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:11.119
similar view on was same sex marriage.
For me, I thought [inaudible] I was kind of

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.500
surprised that McCain had the same position
on that.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.500
Can you talk about, you know, [inaudible]

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.900
David Plouffe: Question about same sex marriage.
Well listen, I think most candidates in both

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.569
parties had the same view.
You know, in the president's case and Hillary

00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:28.070
Clinton's case and most of our Democrat competitors,
it was full rights, but, you know, personally

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:32.190
not supportive of marriage.
You know, my personal view is, this is something

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:37.369
that, you know, there's a generational divide.
And you look at people under 30 -- Republicans,

00:39:37.369 --> 00:39:42.279
Independents, and Democrats -- and you know,
support levels obviously are much, much higher.

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:48.940
I do think, by the way, you don't see some
of these social issues driving other elections

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.049
like they used to.
And I think that's a positive development.

00:39:51.049 --> 00:39:54.920
So people say, "I may have a strong feeling
about gay marriage one way or the other, guns,

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.460
abortion, but I'm not necessarily going to
cast my vote for president or senator or governor

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.150
based on that."
And I think that's a good development.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.990
Partially because I think, you know, we're
facing some really serious challenges.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.650
People are feeling it in their lives.
So, I do think, you know, signing hate crimes

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.740
legislation that had language for ten years
is really important.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.400
There's been some really important reforms
made in terms of federal law and employment

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.799
around the rights of same sex partners.
And I think we just have to continue to make

00:40:20.799 --> 00:40:23.890
progress, but it's really hard.
And you know, it's a civil rights issue.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:31.290
So I think people are right to be impatient.
But we've got that. We've got huge crises

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.400
around the world brewing.
We've obviously got an economic calamity the

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.700
likes of what we haven't seen since the Great
Depression.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.190
And it is truth is, everywhere is feeling
it.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.039
But, you know, for those of you that have
been out in the middle part of the country,

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:45.170
you know it's -- these people are feeling
it.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:50.200
You've got unemployment rates in some of these
communities of 15, 18, 20, 22.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.539
And you know, this is big stuff.
And they've lost health care.

00:40:54.539 --> 00:41:00.010
And because the economy has changed in fundamental
ways and the job market has, in a lot of these

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:05.049
communities, you know, there is no easy pathway.
It's not just, "Okay, the economy is going

00:41:05.049 --> 00:41:09.119
to bounce back, and then, I'll get rehired."
So this is really tough stuff they're dealing

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:11.500
with.
And you know he's getting accused of -- by

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.420
some people -- of not doing enough things.
By many other people, of trying to do too

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.420
much.
And so, it's hard to please everybody, but

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:26.460
I can assure you this.
He did not run -- is that? [pause] I'll use

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:41.420
the podium. [pause]
You'd probably expect me to say this, but

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.690
he did not run for the presidency to occupy
that office, or to win reelection as a central

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.200
principle.
It was to try and tackle tough problems.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.319
And not everyone's going to agree.
Many people won't agree with everything he's

00:41:53.319 --> 00:41:56.529
doing -- his priorities, the specific policy
solutions.

00:41:56.529 --> 00:41:59.029
But I think that's going to serve the country
well.

00:41:59.029 --> 00:42:03.710
Because otherwise, you're going to get cowed,
and you're not going to think long-term, and

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:08.220
we've had too much of that in Washington already.
Yes, sir.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:14.509
Q [undecipherable]

00:42:14.509 --> 00:42:28.859
David Plouffe: No, he would. I mean, I think
that some of the e-mail messages we sent out,

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:34.390
he would look at them all.
He wrote a few. He edited most.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.121
Listen, he was the best writer in our campaign
in a campaign full of great writers.

00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.750
He's one of the best writers in the country,
in my view.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.690
So, you know, he obviously authored most of
our important speeches.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.910
But yeah, he would.
And he would often say, you know, particularly,

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.990
you know, he was out there with people.
So he'd be in a state, and volunteers would

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.200
come up to him and say, "You know what?
I keep getting these e-mails about how you

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.369
won't salute the flag or, you know, you're
a Muslim or all these things.

00:42:58.369 --> 00:43:02.779
And you know, the campaign's not making it
easy enough for us to respond."

00:43:02.779 --> 00:43:06.079
So sometimes he'd come back with feedback
and say, "Hey, you know.

00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:10.539
Why don't we make an adjustment on the website
so it's easier for people?" Now, he's someone

00:43:10.539 --> 00:43:15.250
who lives a lot of his life through technology.
So that was really terrific.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:21.140
Because, you know, he was online all the time
and he had a lot of interaction with our volunteers.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:27.980
So yeah, he provided us a lot of guidance
in that regard.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980
Yes.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.730
Q I'm hoping you could address the decision
to hold Camp Obamas [inaudible]

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:39.690
David Plouffe: Yeah, well. For those of you
who don't know, we started things called 'Camp

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:43.500
Obamas', where we invited people who had expressed
an interest in the campaign -- first, to come

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.319
to Chicago, and then, we did them regionally
to learn about organizing.

00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:52.670
We had, by the way, we had tens of thousands
of people who essentially were full-time campaign

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:56.589
employees, but weren't on our payroll, who
said, "I'm going to take four months or six

00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:59.440
months off work. I'm going to quit my job."
They wanted to learn how to organize.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.099
And in the beginning, it was a big challenge.
You know, one of the reasons we won was our

00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:08.180
focus.
We were focused on Iowa, and to a lesser extent,

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.769
New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada.
Well, there's 46 other states.

00:44:12.769 --> 00:44:17.910
And even in the beginning, when we were pretty
small, we had a really robust, excited group

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:22.109
of supporters that grew.
And so, honestly, it was as much challenge

00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:24.461
as opportunity to figure out what to do with
all these people.

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:27.819
By the way, the thing we'd always say, and
it would frustrate people.

00:44:27.819 --> 00:44:32.839
"I want to help. I'm in St. Louis. What can
I do?"

00:44:32.839 --> 00:44:35.400
"You can get ten more people to sign up on
the website."

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.190
And sometimes people think that was a blow-off.
Nothing was more important to us than growing

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:44.190
that list, because those were people that
we could convert to volunteers and donors

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.180
and precinct captains.
But people wanted to do more than that.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.130
And so, we said, "Well, let's do these 'Camp
Obamas'."

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.970
And they just flourished.
So we had all these people that understood

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.269
how we organized, that we valued it.
See, that's really important.

00:44:56.269 --> 00:44:59.220
I started off as a canvasser, a field staffer,
organizer.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.750
Back then, we were called 'field scum.' You
know, it wasn't something that was really

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:09.619
 -- it was kind of secondary to the campaign.
Everybody, I think, who helped us in the campaign

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:13.910
understood that we valued organizing, largely
because the president valued organizing.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.800
So these Camp Obamas were a great way to surface
great talent.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.910
So we hired a lot of our staff out of them.
We had a lot of people who said, "I'm going

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.559
to go give you a month on the ground." and
they were better schooled.

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:25.730
And you know, it made a huge difference for
us.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:29.720
I mean, listen, I told the very young kids
who were part of our campaign how spoiled

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.869
they were.
Because to be involved in a campaign like

00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:37.880
this, when anything was possible, because
of the people, okay?

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.569
Virginia. We wanted to talk to 20 percent
of the Republican electorate, because we thought

00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:50.040
they might beat for us.
Every Independent in certain demographic areas.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.619
Every Democrat.
Try and register every African-American voter.

00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:57.530
Every young person.
Think about that. We could do that, human

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.370
being to human being.
So our campaign really was the art of the

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.769
possible.
And I think -- because of the people.

00:46:03.769 --> 00:46:07.559
And we had good strategies, and I think we
pushed the envelope in a lot of ways, but

00:46:07.559 --> 00:46:10.019
it was all about the people.
So the Camp Obamas -- and, by the way, it

00:46:10.019 --> 00:46:17.460
tells you that, most of the people who came
to the campaign came through a digital portal.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.140
And we communicated with them digitally.
And many of them organized on our social networking

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.309
site.
They raised money on our site.

00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:28.910
But still, most of the key persuasion work
was done offline.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:33.519
And interestingly enough, we ended up building
kind of a real estate empire out there.

00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:39.930
We had thousands and thousands of offices
and 90 percent of our supporters lived within

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.849
ten minutes of an Obama office -- I mean,
everywhere.

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:48.000
And the reason we did that is, we found that
people wanted to have that connection.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.349
Even if they made most of their phone calls
for us at home, they wanted to be able to

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:54.290
go in at the office.
And so, it was an important lesson that, even

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:58.079
as this is going to become -- politics will
become more and more technologically-driven,

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:03.490
I think you've got to have that component.
Because there still is no substitute for human

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.039
being looking a human being in the eye.
And this is something we could measure.

00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:12.200
The door knocking that was done was always
much more productive than the phone calling

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:17.869
or the e-mailing.
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to know why,

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:20.840
you know?
You develop a relationship with someone and

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.990
you actually, you know?
You have longer conversations, more intense

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.650
conversations.
You elicit more information, and you build

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:30.700
a relationship.
And I'd say, even in Iowa, you know one's

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.450
phenomenon, our supporters -- many of them
who went through Camp Obama -- were so dogged.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:39.499
It was like, you know, windchill below zero
in Iowa the last three or four days.

00:47:39.499 --> 00:47:44.079
And we were all over the streets.
And you know, we weren't seeing our opponents

00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:46.200
as much.
And some Iowa caucus-goers who were undecided

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.599
said, "I've decided to be for you, because
if you're nuts enough to be out here in this

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:53.660
weather, you clearly believe in this guy."
And even a small thing like that made a big

00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:02.369
difference in the caucuses.
Yes.

00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:04.900
Q Talking about metrics around things that
were here in 2008 election, in 2012 is going

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:09.230
to be really, really context where do you
think it's going to apply?

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.950
And where do you think it's not going to apply?

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:17.180
David Plouffe: Well, you know, we're not -- largely
through a presidential dictate -- not really

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.269
focused on '12, because you know, I think
that's right.

00:48:20.269 --> 00:48:23.289
We got big problems, and you don't want to
be thinking about the election.

00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:26.789
So I just have some kind of topline, macro
thoughts.

00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:31.569
That campaign will be different in many ways,
and I don't think we know today How it will

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:34.930
be different.
The one commonality will be -- because any

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.160
effort Barack Obama is involved in will have
people at its core -- we will of course, want

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.900
to get people involved as we did.
And have the grassroots play such an important

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.920
role.
You know, the issue environment -- where the

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:52.839
economy is -- could determine which states
are more easily won or lost.

00:48:52.839 --> 00:48:56.779
I know that technology is going to change
in fundamental ways.

00:48:56.779 --> 00:49:03.349
And it's not, you know, I don't know if it's
12, could be -- could be '16, could be '20.

00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:07.700
But it won't be too long that people will
look back at what we did in this campaign,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.130
sending people e-mails they opened up on their
desktop or their laptop -- it's going to be

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:15.559
like Jurassic Park.
And so, we know that things are heading to

00:49:15.559 --> 00:49:20.339
a place where more and more people are going
to do most of their e-mails and their video-watching

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:25.609
and sharing and searching for information
on their mobile device.

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:29.799
And I salivated that, because I think about
what had happened if 30 percent of our supporters

00:49:29.799 --> 00:49:35.609
were reading our e-mails, getting our videos,
while they were walking around in restaurants

00:49:35.609 --> 00:49:40.130
sitting here -- the ability to share that
instantaneously, to look at an ap and say,

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.839
"Hey look, the Obama office down the street
is short four canvassers?

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:47.180
I'll go canvas."
I mean, things like that just are going to

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.140
make participatory democracy even greater.
Now of course, the atmospherics of that election,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:56.210
the history's been made.
And you've got a record to run on.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.599
So it'll be different in many ways in that
regard.

00:49:58.599 --> 00:50:02.240
But I know that one thing we'll be committed
to is running a grassroots campaign.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.140
And my hope is that the Republicans study
that book and the 2008 election.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:12.499
Because I assure you, we will have some new
chapters in store.

00:50:12.499 --> 00:50:17.130
One more. Yes, sir.
No Sarah Palin questions. This is amazing.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.130
[laughter]

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:24.500
Q Going back to the nomination, back to February/March
2008, [inaudible]

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:29.180
David Plouffe: Well, it's something I write
about in the book.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:35.079
You know listen, this was not a fun way to
live, but we lived all of 2007 and we used

00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:41.309
the first 35 days of 2008 with the full knowledge
that she was in all likelihood the winner,

00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:45.869
that we had one narrow path, and that a lot
of things had to go right for us to win.

00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:48.920
And I think that made us a very, very good
campaign.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.410
We knew what we're up against.
So we win Iowa -- we didn't think we were

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:56.550
going to win.
We thought that was our -- essentially the

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:00.720
gate had been open.
And we'll see how far we can run.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.529
But it was an opportunity then, to see if
we could begin to erode her leads.

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:08.750
We lose New Hampshire.
I think the biggest surprise of the entire

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.641
two years is that Barack Obama is the President
of the United States having lost a New Hampshire

00:51:12.641 --> 00:51:16.009
primary.
I can assure you that was not in our playbook

00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:20.859
about how to win.
And I think there was a lot of commentary

00:51:20.859 --> 00:51:23.960
and a lot of people believed that the race
was then over -- that we had had our moment

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.819
in Iowa, but order had been restored, Hillary
came back, and won New Hampshire.

00:51:27.819 --> 00:51:30.900
And I think some of that commentary is a little
extreme, but it's hard for me to argue with

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.660
it.
We were up against it then.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:38.410
And the way we were able to recover is we
got -- and I spent a lot of time in the book

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.759
writing about South Carolina.
South Carolina, for a lot of reasons, gave

00:51:41.759 --> 00:51:45.670
us more momentum than we could have realized,
coupled with an endorsement from Senator Kennedy

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:50.210
two days later that was more about what he
said than that he endorsed -- you know, linking

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.570
us to his slain brothers in a way he had never
done before, taking on some of the attacks

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:59.240
that were being made against us, in relation
to what they had said about his brother Jack,

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.589
was just enormously powerful.
And then, we go into February 5th, including

00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:06.920
California.
And that was the day we lived in fear of,

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.960
the entire campaign.
She's sitting there with leads of 15, 20,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.529
30 points.
We couldn't campaign in those states, because

00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:17.279
there was ten days between South Carolina
and February 5th.

00:52:17.279 --> 00:52:21.950
We did a half day in California.
And we knew we needed time on the ground to

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:24.650
win.
And we had raised more money than we thought,

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.499
so we were doing some advertising, but it
was still pretty modest.

00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:31.220
And we knew we had better organization, which
is something we didn't expect in all of states,

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.130
including the ones we lost.
But would that be enough?

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:39.340
And remarkably, because I think -- and you
know, this is hard for our supporters in California

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.279
 -- we didn't come bunker in out here, even
though it was a big state.

00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:46.490
We knew we were going to lose it, but we thought
the delegates were going to be pretty close,

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:51.369
so we went to places like Idaho and Kansas
and Georgia and tried to run up the margin,

00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:56.750
because in our primary system, the only way
to experience a real delegate yield is to

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.720
win a landslide.
And so, February 5th -- my favorite story,

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.210
New Jersey -- it's a big state. She wins by
11 points.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.920
It offers like, 130 delegates. She only nets
11 out of the equation.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:15.210
So the delegates are pretty even.
Little, tiny Idaho only offers 18 delegates,

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:19.019
but we won an 80 to 20.
We get 15 delegates, she gets three.

00:53:19.019 --> 00:53:22.990
We gain more delegates out of winning Ohio/Idaho,
than she did in New Jersey.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:28.380
She wins California, you know, by nine points.
We actually won Election Day, by the way,

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.930
but we got clobbered in the early vote.
She nets, I think, 33 delegates.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.880
We erase that in Colorado in Minnesota, and
that's the story of February 5th.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:42.760
We cobbled together a bunch of smaller states.
So the first time I thought that, all things

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.170
being equal, Barack Obama should win the nomination
was -- to use a term that gained some notoriety

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:52.009
in the campaign -- about 3 a.m. on February
6th.

00:53:52.009 --> 00:53:56.130
And then, we went off and ran 11 victories
off in a row.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:00.730
And we gained an upper hand.
And then, because I made some mistakes and

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:05.400
we didn't close well, we ended up losing the
Texas primary, and the campaign dragged on

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.249
for three months after that.
But the outcome was known.

00:54:10.249 --> 00:54:12.710
Unless something cataclysmic happened, we
were going to win.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:16.140
So that's when it was.
It was when we survived the day that was the

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.509
greatest threat to our candidacy.
And, you know, after New Hampshire, the other

00:54:20.509 --> 00:54:24.260
thing I find most remarkable.
You got to remember, you guys -- well, you

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.829
don't have many competitors.
You have some. [laughter]

00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:35.009
But, you know, politics is a competitive enterprise.
John McCain had three additional months.

00:54:35.009 --> 00:54:40.369
Think about that. He was the nominee on March
4th, because we didn't win Texas.

00:54:40.369 --> 00:54:42.940
We didn't clinch our nomination till June
3rd.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:48.490
We gave him three months.
And we figured, "Great. He's going to get

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:52.420
better organized in the battleground states.
He's going to be far ahead of us strategically.

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.150
He's going to develop an incisive economic
message.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.599
He's going to separate from Bush.
And he's going to be ready to unleash holy

00:54:58.599 --> 00:55:03.690
hell on us when we come out of the primary."
And none of that happened.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:08.970
And it was a feat of enormous political malpractice.
[laughter]

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.420
Because, if they had used those three months
differently -- see, it doesn't seem like a

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.519
big deal now.
People say, "Plouffe, who cares you lost the

00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:15.799
Texas primary? You won."
But, you think about that.

00:55:15.799 --> 00:55:20.059
I mean, that night I thought, "We have really
screwed the pu chair. We might have just caused

00:55:20.059 --> 00:55:23.309
ourselves the presidency."
Because we actually thought McCain was going

00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:25.982
to end up running a very good campaign.
He was a dangerous candidate for a number

00:55:25.982 --> 00:55:30.619
of reasons to us.
And so, that was what's frustrating in March.

00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:34.650
We knew how that story was going to end, but
we couldn't turn the page.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:38.410
And we assumed McCain was going to be gallivanting
across the country, building all sorts of

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:42.160
advantages on us.
And thankfully, from our perspective, he did

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.640
not.
Well, you guys are great to listen and to

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.380
let me prattle on here.
But hopefully, you'll enjoy the book and stay

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.400
involved in politics if you got involved.
And change is hard, but you know, if we all

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.619
do the right thing over the next three or
four years.

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.191
You know, listen, you guys are going to lead
the country.

00:55:58.191 --> 00:56:02.500
Many of you are leading it now.
But, you know, I always tell folks, you know,

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:10.160
"You're going to inherit this very, very soon.
And you know, if we don't do the right things

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.450
now to strengthen and stabilize this country,
it's going to make our job much harder."

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:18.019
So, hopefully, we can do some smart things
over the next few years.

00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:21.790
So in many ways, you are already leading,
but you are going to be leading formally in

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:25.710
the not-too-distant future.
You know, things -- we can hand off a little

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.329
bit better situation so you can really make
it flourish and grow.

00:56:28.329 --> 00:56:30.469
So, thanks for being here.

00:56:30.469 --> 00:56:30.869
