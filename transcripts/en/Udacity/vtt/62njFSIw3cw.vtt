00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.490
In this lesson you learned about
the difference between Ruby Core and

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.600
the standard library API.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.010
You also learned about my personal
favorite topic, Ruby gems.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.690
Gems can be life changing.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.500
want to connect your app to a database?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.020
Well, there's a gem for that.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.470
want to get live Twitter
data from the president?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.430
Well there's a gem for that, too.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.730
Want to find a succinct, and charmingly
humourous way to end this video?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.540
There probably should be a gem for that.
