enterprise so you look at those cities

enterprise so you look at those cities

up largely in the era when automobiles

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
up largely in the era when automobiles
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.949
up largely in the era when automobiles
were already quite common and you see a

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
were already quite common and you see a
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.650
were already quite common and you see a
very different kind of pattern so it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
very different kind of pattern so it's
 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.979
very different kind of pattern so it's
going to be a long pole to see if we can

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
going to be a long pole to see if we can
 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.350
going to be a long pole to see if we can
make some of these changes but if one

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360
make some of these changes but if one
 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.140
make some of these changes but if one
thinks in a creative way technologically

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

complex system and understanding it in
 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.880
complex system and understanding it in
that way if one thinks about different

the transportation enterprise that is
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.270
the transportation enterprise that is
more sensitive to the need of the myriad

think we can continue to develop

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
think we can continue to develop
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.900
think we can continue to develop
economically I think we can create a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910
economically I think we can create a
 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.090
economically I think we can create a
system in which we are much more a

steward of the environment and perhaps

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
steward of the environment and perhaps
 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.840
steward of the environment and perhaps
we've been and I think we can do

we've been and I think we can do
 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.660
we've been and I think we can do
something from a social equity point of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670
something from a social equity point of
 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.849
something from a social equity point of
view to make sure that the environmental

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859
view to make sure that the environmental
 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.430
view to make sure that the environmental
impacts our shared equitably and the

impacts our shared equitably and the
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.470
impacts our shared equitably and the
economic development benefits are shared

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
economic development benefits are shared
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.100
economic development benefits are shared
equitably as well
