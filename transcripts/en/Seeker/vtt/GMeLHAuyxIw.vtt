00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.360
The bodies of the Kuiper Belt out beyond Pluto
are small and far away, but they have a lot

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.360
to tell us.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.240
Namely, their orbits speak volumes, and a
new study is hinting that there might be a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.550
gravitational mass lurking out in this distant
region of our solar system.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.080
And some people are saying it’s possibly
a tenth planet.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.880
But, that might be a bit premature.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.789
On the whole, our solar system is pretty neatly
organized.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.409
All the planets orbit more or less in line
with each other.

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.210
They average out to be right along what’s
called the “invariable plane”.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.429
Things get chaotic even further from the Sun.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.550
Like in the Oort Cloud, which is 5,000-100,000
AU away.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.570
The Oort Cloud isn't a disk.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.340
It's actually a cloud that envelopes our solar
system.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.890
Relatively closer to the Sun in the Kuiper
Belt, which is only about 30 to 55 AU from

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.240
the Sun, bodies orbit pretty regularly.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.890
They should look sort of like a flat sheet.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.260
Which bring us to the alleged Planet Ten…

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.400
Researchers from the University of Arizona
noticed that over 600 of the more distant

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.440
Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, have orbits
inclined from the invariable plane by, on

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080
average, about 8 degrees.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.240
It’s a subtle deviation, but also significant
enough to suggest that something big must

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.440
be warping those orbits.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.920
They’re far enough from the Sun that another
gravitational mass could be responsible.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.580
If you look at a spinning top… it sort of
models things in the solar system.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.360
Imagine the invariable plane cutting through
the middle.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.130
The inner solar system is steady, like the
top.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.340
If the top wobbles, something is causing it
to do so.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.479
The over 600 objects they looked at are wobbling
pell-mell like a handful of spinning tops

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.260
all nudged differently, and the observational
evidence says it’s not a fluke or bad data.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.670
Something has affected them.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.620
According to the researchers’ calculations,
the irregular orbits could be explained by

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.229
a gravitational mass around the size of Mars
orbiting about 60 AU from the Sun.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.400
It’s definitely not the theorized Planet
Nine, by the way, that’s way larger and

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.580
about ten times farther away.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.700
We did a video about it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.270
But like Planet Nine, Planet Ten is still
a theoretical body that may or may not exist,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.590
and we might not have seen it yet because
we haven’t looked in the right place.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.900
Or it might not exist at all — it’s possible
a star whizzed by our solar system in recent

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.229
history (astronomically speaking) and kicked
those orbits around, then went on its merry

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.260
way.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.850
As with all big, predicted things in space,
astronomers will need to do some follow-up

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.450
observations to confirm Planet Ten’s existence…
or non-existence.
