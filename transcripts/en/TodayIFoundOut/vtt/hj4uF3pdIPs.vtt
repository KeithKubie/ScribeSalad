00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.960
On humans and other primates, nails are a
flattened version of a claw which likely developed

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.840
to aid in gripping and climbing.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.590
However, they can also act as a visible “health
report.”

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
Someone in poor health, or infected by a fungus,
might have yellow, brittle nails, while someone

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250
in good health might have strong, long nails.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.920
The fact that healthy nails are the sign of
a healthy person may have led to people beginning

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.900
to grow them out, or it could have been simply
that long nails are cumbersome when working

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.410
with your hands, so they were something of
a status symbol.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.800
Whatever the case, it might surprise you to
learn that manicuring nails has actually been

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.380
around for many thousands of years—dating
back at least to 3200 B.C.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.810
At the time, Chinese royalty would grow their
nails and tint them with things like eggwhites

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.810
or flower petals.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.350
Around the same time, Ancient Egyptians were
also painting their nails, this time in accordance

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.840
with their social classes; richer Egyptians
painted their nails a darker colour, while

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.570
poorer Egyptians painted them a lighter colour.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.020
The modern practice of growing out and painting
nails is a result of a more recent occurrence,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.900
happening in the 1920s and 1930s where women
began growing long, luxurious nails.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.139
Before this, women commonly tinted their nails
with oil or glosses.

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:16.119
However, in the 1920s, shortly after the introduction
and popularity of automobile paint, proper

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.029
nail paint also became available and a nail
painting boom resulted.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:23.670
Of course, many “proper” women didn’t
dare paint their nails for several decades

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.020
after that, but Hollywood stepped in.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.469
In 1940, it became the style to have long,
red nails, likely spurred on by actress Rita

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.509
Hayworth.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.369
Many women started copying her style, striving
to look like the knockout celebrity.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.039
Much like painting one’s nails, artificial
nails, which mimic real nails and add length

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.899
and a healthy appearance to nails, have an
astoundingly long history.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.779
Artificial nails were once worn by Chinese
women during the Ming Dynasty (14th -17th

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:45.779
century).

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:49.899
In this case, these nail extensions were worn
by noblewomen to further show that they did

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.369
not have to use their hands for manual labour,
unlike commoners.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.849
There are also records of women in 19th century
Greece using pistachio shells as artificial

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:58.849
nails.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.969
It wasn’t until 1954 that an early version
of the modern artificial nail was invented.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.439
It was first patented by Fred Slack, a dentist,
who had chipped his nail at work and needed

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.439
a replacement.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.899
He and his brother worked with various materials
before coming up with something that would

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.250
work, starting with dental acrylic, resulting
in a realistic-looking fake nail that soon

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.200
became incredibly popular among women across
the world.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.460
Since then Slack’s company, Nail Systems
International, has continued to innovate creating

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.220
fake nails out of a variety of substances.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.260
Of course, as with everything beauty and style
related, growing nails out and painting them

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.970
are trends that come and go.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.310
During the 1960s, women preferred a more natural
look and rarely painted their nails.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.750
Nail painting saw a huge come-back in the
1980s, though, and since then the practice

00:02:38.750 --> 00:03:24.040
has been relatively popular in certain countries

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:56.380
in

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:04.010
the world.
