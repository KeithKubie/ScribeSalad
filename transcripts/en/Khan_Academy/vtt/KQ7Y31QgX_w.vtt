00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:01.732
- [Instructor] So when
you first learn calculus,

00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:04.354
you learn that the derivative
of some function f,

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:07.058
could be written as f prime of x is equal

00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:09.530
to the limit as, then
there's multiple ways

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.347
of doing this, the change
in x approaches zero

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:16.347
of f of x plus our change
in x, minus f of x,

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:20.319
over our change in x.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.175
And you learn multiple notations for this.

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:28.397
For example, if you
that y is equal f of x,

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:31.502
you might write this as y prime.

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:34.252
You might write this as d-y, d-x,

00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:37.886
which you'll often hear me
say is the derivative of y,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:40.149
with respect to x, and that you can do

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.955
the derivative of f with respect to x

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.906
because y is equal to our function.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.512
But then later on when
you, especially when you

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.051
start getting into differential equations,

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.987
you see people start
to treat this notation

00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:54.911
as an actual algebraic expression.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:59.357
For example, you will learn or
you might have already seen.

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:02.285
If you're trying to solve
the differential equation,

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:06.691
the derivative of y with
respect to x, is equal to y.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.551
So the rate of change
of y with respect to x

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.533
is equal to the value of y itself.

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.733
This is one of, the most
basic differential equations

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.903
you might see.

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:17.771
You'll see this technique,
where people just say,

00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:20.351
"Well, let's just multiply
both sides by d-x."

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:24.228
Just treating d-x like as if
it's some algebraic expression.

00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:28.318
So you multiply both sides
by d-x and then you have,

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:30.517
so that would cancel out algebraically,

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:32.232
and so you see people treat it like that.

00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:35.538
So you have d-y is equal to y times d-x,

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:38.240
and then they'll say, "Okay
let's divide both sides by y."

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.530
Which is a reasonable thing to do.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.148
Y is an algebraic expression.

00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:46.085
So if you divide both sides
by y, you get one over y,

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:47.752
d-y is equal to d-x.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:51.529
And then folks will integrate both sides

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.416
to find a general solution to
this differential equation.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:56.477
But my point on this video isn't to think

00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:59.237
about how do you solve a
differential equation here,

00:01:59.237 --> 00:02:01.671
but to think about this notion of using,

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:03.780
what we call differentials.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.123
So a d-x, or a d-y,

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:08.333
and treating them algebraically like this.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.026
Treating them as algebraic expressions,

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.114
where I can just multiply
both sides by just d-x or d-y,

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:16.327
or divide both sides by d-x or d-y.

00:02:16.327 --> 00:02:21.204
And I don't normally say
this, but the rigor you need

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:24.153
to show that this is
okay in this situation,

00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:27.282
is not an easy thing to say.

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:31.069
And so to just feel reasonably
okay about doing this,

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.846
this is a little bit hand wavy,

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:35.008
it's not super mathematically rigorous.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.822
But it has proven to be
a useful tool for us,

00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:40.126
to find these solutions.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:43.944
And conceptually the way
that I think about a d-y, or

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:47.745
a d-x, is this is the
super small change in y,

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.590
in response to a super small change in x.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.983
And that's essentially
what this definition

00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:54.216
of the limit is telling us.

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.978
Especially as Delta x approaches zero,

00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:59.679
we're going to have a
super small change in x,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.603
as Delta x approaches zero.

00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:02.984
And then we're going to have a resulting

00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:05.327
super small change in y.

00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:07.169
So that's one way that you can feel

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.157
a little bit better, of...

00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:11.136
And this is actually one
of the justifications

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:12.941
for this type of notation.

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.533
As you can view this, what's
the resulting super small,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.349
or what's the super small change in y,

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.718
for a given super small change in x?

00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:22.886
Which is giving us the sense
of what's the limiting value

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.507
of the slope?

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:25.695
As we go from the slope

00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:27.561
of the secant line to a tangent line?

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:29.188
And if you view it that way you might feel

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:33.104
a little bit better about
using the differentials,

00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:34.559
or creating them algebraically.

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.292
Let me just multiply both sides by

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:39.372
that super small change in x.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.800
So the big picture is, this is a technique

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.469
that you'll often see,

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:47.087
in introductory differential
equations classes.

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.303
Introductory multi-variable classes and

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:51.127
introductory calculus classes.

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:53.573
But it's not very mathematically rigorous,

00:03:53.573 --> 00:03:57.206
to just treat differentials
like algebraic expressions.

00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:59.076
But even thought it's
not very mathematically

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:01.778
rigorous to do it willy nilly like that.

00:04:01.778 --> 00:04:04.266
It has proven to be very useful.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:06.370
Now as you get more sophisticated

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.686
in your mathematics there
are rigorous definitions

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:10.267
of a differential.

00:04:10.267 --> 00:04:11.889
Where you can get a better sense of where

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.778
it is mathematically rigorous to use it

00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:14.801
and where it isn't.

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.357
But the whole point here is, if you felt

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:18.609
a little weird feeling about multiplying

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.384
both sides by d-x or dividing
both sides by d-x or d-y.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:25.426
Your feeling was mathematically justified,

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:27.833
because it's not a very
rigorous thing to do.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:31.908
At least until you have
more rigor behind it,

00:04:31.908 --> 00:04:33.755
but I will tell you that if you're

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:36.509
an introductory student
it is a reasonable thing

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.470
to do as you explore and manipulate

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.862
some of these basic
differential equations.
