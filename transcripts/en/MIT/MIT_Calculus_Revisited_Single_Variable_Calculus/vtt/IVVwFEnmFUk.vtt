00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.110
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.070
I thought that today what I'd
like to do is to in a sense

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.020
clean up a few little things
that were implied by our last

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.630
lecture, things that bothered
me a little bit and which I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.380
thought were worthy
of discussing

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.810
in more detail today.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.240
You may recall that last time
we discussed the inverse of

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.710
differentiation.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.720
And towards the end of the
lecture, we pointed out that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.920
traditionally this operation
was called

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.670
the 'indefinite integral'.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.250
Now, you see, two points
bothered me here.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.709
One is why the word integral?

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.770
In other words, why not just
'inverse derivative'?

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.940
And we're going to talk about
that in more detail later in

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.070
the course.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.860
The other part that bothered me
was the inference of what

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
do you mean by the 'indefinite'
integral, say, as

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.310
opposed to the 'definite'
integral?

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760
In essence then, I think that
when you say indefinite

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.690
integral, one probably assumes
that there was something

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.260
called the definite integral
that exists.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.930
And in order not to prejudice
anything and not to use the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.660
word definite integral in a
context that I don't really

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.940
want it in, I have entitled
today's lecture The "Definite"

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.480
Indefinite Integral.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.840
And let's see what this
really means now.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.650
Recall that last time we used
the notation that 'D inverse'

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.720
'f of x' meant--

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.660
and that was what?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.440
This is notation we used, and
we said in the book but this

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.490
was denoted by integral ''f of
x' dx', and that this was

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.320
called the indefinite
integral.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.840
And what it meant was it was
a name for all function 'G'

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.640
whose derivative with respect
to 'x' was 'f'.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.590
And by the mean value theorem,
we also showed what?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.250
That another name for that
set was simply what?

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.080
If we knew one function whose
derivative was 'f', call that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.050
capital 'F'.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.750
Then the family capital 'F of
x' plus 'c' was another name

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.600
for this set of functions.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.270
And by way of a review, let's
do a typical problem that we

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.950
could tackle last time.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.010
Let's see where the word
'indefinite' comes from.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.500
You see, in a sense, the
indefiniteness comes from the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.380
arbitrary constant 'c'.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.920
You see, let's suppose that we
know that 'f prime of x' is 'x

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.440
squared', and we now want
to find out what

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.670
'f of x' looks like.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.770
You see the inverse of
differentiation again.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.260
We have the derivative.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.580
Well, we know that one function
whose derivative is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.440
'x squared' is '1/3 x cubed'.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.180
Therefore, any other function
whose derivative is 'x

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.260
squared' must differ from '1/3
x cubed' by a constant.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.890
Hence, we know that
'f of x' is '1/3 x

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.300
cubed' plus a constant.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.610
And it's this 'c' that makes
this thing called the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.450
'indefinite' integral.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.850
You see, at this particular
stage, 'c' could be any

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.810
constant whatsoever, and
this would still

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.230
be a correct answer.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.930
We have only got a correct
answer up to a family of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.970
functions which differ
only by a constant.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.680
Now, if I specify one piece of
information, which is called

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.100
an 'initial condition',
shall we say.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.130
In other words, let's suppose
I specify that when 'x' is

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.680
equal to 'x0', 'f of x' is
equal to 'y sub 0', the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.670
subscript 0 here just being
the abbreviation for a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.360
beginning point.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.540
In other words, I now specify
one additional piece of

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.640
information.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.910
Well, if I plug this back into
the equation before, I get

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.570
that 'f of x0', which is 'y0',
equals '1/3 'x sub 0' cubed

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.670
plus c', from which I can
determine that 'c' is equal to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.240
''y0' minus '1/3 x0 cubed''.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.270
Now, notice that 'x0' and
'y0' are given numbers.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.400
Consequently, 'c' here is
a particular number.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.980
And 'c' being a constant, it
means that whatever 'c' is for

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220
one given value of 'x', it
must be that for all.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.240
So now what I can do is replace
the indefinite 'c' by

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.460
the definite specific value
''y0' minus '1/3 x0 cubed''

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.380
and arrive at the fact that 'f
of x' is that unique function,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.570
the only function that there
is: '1/3 x cubed' plus 'y0'

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.590
minus '1/3 x0 cubed'.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.140
In other words, no more
arbitrary constant in here.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.890
What is this function
'f of x'?

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.720
Well, it's the function whose
derivative is 'x squared' and

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.370
satisfies the condition that
when 'x' is equal to 'x0', 'y'

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.540
is equal to 'y0'.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.260
And if you want to see that in
terms of our usual analogy of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.720
resorting to curve plotting,
observe that what we can say

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.790
here is what?

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.790
The slope is 'x squared'.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.960
Therefore, the curve has the
form 'y' equals '1/3

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.610
x cubed plus c'.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.300
We now specify that the
curve passes through

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.400
the point (x0, y0).

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.410
That helps us determine
that 'c' is 'y0'

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.680
minus '1/3 x0 cubed'.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.710
We put that value 'c' back into
our original equation,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.470
and we wind up with 'y' equals
'1/3 x cubed' plus 'y0' minus

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.660
'1/3 x0 cubed'.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.260
And what is that particular
curve?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.550
It's the curve that's
characterized by the fact that

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.150
its slope at any point (x , y)
is given by 'x squared' and it

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.270
passes through the
point (x0, y0).

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.080
In other words, notice then that
if we know the slope of a

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.180
curve and we know a point on the
curve, in other words, we

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.870
know the slope everywhere and we
know a point that the curve

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.180
passes through, it shouldn't
seem too surprising that we

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.230
can uniquely locate where the
curve is at any time.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.050
And that's exactly
what this says.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.830
We have a unique expression
for this particular curve.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.620
Let's see if we can't generalize
this result.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.580
And instead of talking about 'f
of x' equals 'x squared',

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.120
let's consider the following.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.500
Suppose we just generalize it.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.010
We have that we're given that
'dy dx' is 'f of x' and the

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.280
domain of 'f' is the closed
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.010
And now what we'd like to do is
to find out what function

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.840
'y' is specifically.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.590
Well, assume that 'g prime'
is any function whose

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.960
derivative is 'f'.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.630
And by the way, this is a
pretty big assumption.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.320
In other words, it's one thing
to say let's assume that we

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.240
have a function whose
derivative is 'f'.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.940
But for a given 'f', it may not
be quite that simple to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.070
find what 'G' must be.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.480
And we'll talk about
that in more detail

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.130
as our course unfolds.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.530
But it's not always that simple
to find a function

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.900
which has a given derivative.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.970
We mentioned that in the
last lecture, too.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.950
At any rate, all we're assuming
now though is that by

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.540
hook or by crook, somehow or
other, we know a function 'G'

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.440
whose derivative is 'f'.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.820
Then therefore, what we conclude
is that since 'G' has

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.540
the same derivative as 'y', that
'y' must be 'G of x' plus

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.320
a constant.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.260
Now, here's where the word
'initial condition' comes in.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.040
We're starting this problem
at 'x' equals 'a'.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.420
See, 'x' equals 'a'.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.570
What we assume is the curve has
to be someplace when 'x'

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.480
equals 'a'.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.460
Let's call that y-coordinate
'y' of 'a'.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.390
In other words, 'y' of 'a' is
equal to 'G of a' plus 'c',

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.810
from which we determine that
'c' is equal to 'y of

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.400
a' minus 'G of a'.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.950
You see, the only indefinite
thing in here is the 'y of a'.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.730
Because, you see, all we're
saying is we know the

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.520
x-coordinate when 'x' is 'a',
and the curve can then pass

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.910
through any point whose
x-coordinate is 'a'.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.300
And all we're saying is let's
call the y-coordinate of that

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.930
point 'y of a'.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.740
At any rate, knowing what 'c'
is, we now have that 'y of x'

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.580
is 'G of x' plus 'y of
a' minus 'G of a'.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.510
Now, in particular, from this,
you see, notice from this, we

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.860
can now find out what
'y of b' is.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.420
Namely, we just replace 'x' by
'b', and we get that 'y of b'

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.290
is 'G of b' plus 'y of
a' minus 'G of a'.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.850
And again, the only thing
that's indefinite over

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.930
here is 'y of a'.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.800
Now, to get rid of the only
indefinite part, it seems

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.190
rather clever that maybe all we
should do is subtract 'y of

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.860
a' from 'y to b'.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.230
If we do that, we get that 'y of
b' minus 'y of a' is 'G of

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.270
b' minus 'G of a'.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.400
Notice that name for 'y of b'
minus 'y of a' is just the

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.280
change in 'y' as 'x' moved
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.370
In other words, if we know the
derivative of 'y' with respect

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.380
to 'x' and we want to find out
how much 'y' changed by as we

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.120
moved from 'x' equals 'a' to 'x'
equals 'b', all we have to

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.280
do is to compute 'G of b' minus
'G of a' where 'G' is

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.090
'a' function whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.930
And by the way, that's all this
notation means over here.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.260
This is read this evaluated at
the upper value minus the

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.290
value of this evaluated
at the lower value.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.470
In fact, now I suppose the only
problem that's dangling,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.910
as we said, you know, let 'G'
be the function whose

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.090
derivative is 'f'.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.890
There are many functions whose
derivative is 'f' once we know

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.110
one function whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.420
Which function should
we use over here?

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.170
And what I intend to show next
is that it really doesn't make

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.800
any difference.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.240
That's how definite
this really is.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.080
Namely, let's suppose that 'H'
is any other function whose

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.980
derivative is 'f'.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.920
Well, if we use this particular
expression, my

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.330
claim is that the change in 'y'
would be a 'H of b' minus

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.510
'H of a', the same way
as we did with 'G'.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.760
And the reason for this is that
if 'H' and 'G' have the

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.920
same derivative, then they
differ by a constant.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.570
That means that 'H of x' is 'G
of x' plus some constant,

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.090
which I denote by 'c1' to
indicate that this is no

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.870
longer an arbitrary constant.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.810
What I'm saying is I've picked
a particular 'H'.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.170
I have the 'G' of the
previous problem.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.100
The difference is some
specific constant

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.470
which I call 'c1'.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.240
Well, at any rate, I can now
compute 'H to b', which is

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.430
just 'G of b' plus 'c1',
'H of a', which is

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.670
'G of a' plus 'c1'.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.320
And if I now subtract, I get
'H of b' minus 'H of a' is

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.660
equal to 'G of b' minus 'G of
a' because the constant 'c1'

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.040
drops out when I form
the subtraction.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.730
In other words, notice that 'G
of b' minus 'G of a' is a

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.510
well-determined number
independent of what function

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.170
we choose whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.970
And to see what this thing
means pictorially, just

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.260
observe the following.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.440
Our geometric interpretation
is this.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.300
Let's suppose that we have the
curve 'y' equals 'G of x' on

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.240
the closed interval
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.930
And what's the property
of 'G'?

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.320
It's derivative is 'f'.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.570
And now we look at 'H of x'.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.230
Now, what is 'H of x'?

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.020
'H of x' is 'G of x'
plus a constant.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.570
Graphically, what happens
to a curve when

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.340
you add on a constant?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.670
You see, adding on a constant
just raises the curve.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.300
In other words, it displaces the
curve parallel to itself

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.380
vertically, in other words, with
respect to the y-axis,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.160
that the constant just
lifts the curve.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.450
In other words then, what we're
saying is that when

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.160
you're measuring the change in
'y', observe that it really

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.830
makes no difference whether
you're talking about this or

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.630
whether you're talking
about this.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.030
Because since these two curves
are parallel, you see, the

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.560
displacements over these
intervals are the same.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.740
In other words, all we're really
saying, I guess, is

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.160
that these two regions
here are congruent.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.130
In fact, it might be wise in
a sense to pick a new axis

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:20.590
either way here, shift this
thing over, and label this the

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.220
'delta y' axis.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.820
And what you're really saying
is the arbitrary constant

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.480
doesn't really make
any difference.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.980
Because what you've raised the
curve by at this end, you

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.900
raised it at this end, and
consequently, the arbitrary

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.520
constant drops out in
determining the change in 'y'.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.790
Well, again, this may
still seem abstract.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.370
Let's give a physical
interpretation to what we're

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.990
talking about right now.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.000
Let's suppose now that
we have a particle

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.785
moving along the x-axis.

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:53.080
A particle is moving
along the x-axis.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.920
We know that its speed at any
time 't' is given by 't

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.120
squared', and we know
that the particles

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.540
moves for one second.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.990
In other words, the domain
of 't' here is the closed

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.580
interval from 0 to 1.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.720
Now, we know that
'v' is 'dx dt'.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.070
Therefore, since '1/3 t cubed'
has its derivative equal to 't

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.840
squared', 'x' must be '1/3
t cubed' plus a constant.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.990
And here's where the
word 'initial

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.270
condition' comes in again.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.710
We're starting this problem
when 't' equals 0.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.180
When 't' equals 0, the particle
has to be someplace.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.140
Let's say it's at 'x'
equals 'x sub 0'.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.850
That's 'x of 0', you see.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.920
And if we do this, notice
that when 't' is 0,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.060
'x' is 'x sub 0'.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.860
That says that 'c'
is 'x sub 0'.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.180
Replacing 'c' by 'x sub 0', we
find that the particle moves

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.720
according to the rule
'x' equals '1/3 t

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.440
cubed' plus 'x sub 0'.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.890
Now, we can find out where the
particle is when 't' equals 1.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.180
When 't' equals 1, 'x'
is '1/3 plus 'x0''.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.960
We know that when the particle
started at 't' equals 0, 'x'

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.590
of 0 was 'x sub 0'.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.490
And therefore, the change in
'x', in other words, 'x'

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.680
evaluated when 't' equals '1
minus x' evaluated when 't'

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:25.160
equals 0 is simply what? '1/3
plus 'x0' minus 'x0'', or 1/3.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.810
In other words, in this
particular problem, if we

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.540
choose as our unit, say, feet
and seconds, if a particle

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.670
moves for 1 second according to
the rule that speed in feet

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.920
per second is the square of the
time, in 1 second it has

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.940
been displaced by a distance
of 1/3 of a foot.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.200
And if I want to draw that for
you, let me show you what's

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.350
happening over here.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.860
What we're saying is
here is a particle

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.160
moving along the x-axis.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.020
when we start this problem
at time 't' equals 0, the

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.510
particle is at some point
'x' equals 'x0'.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.360
We observe that the particle
is moving because of the

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.690
velocity 't squared', and that
means it's always moving from

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.080
left to right.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.610
And what we find is that when
the time is 1, the particle is

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.430
now at 'x0 + 1/3'.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.200
In other words, in this 1
second, the particle has moved

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.140
1/3 of a foot.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.670
By the way, to make a little
interesting aside while we're

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.080
here, and we'll come back to
this in more detail also into

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.610
future lectures, notice that
since 'v' equals 't squared',

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.760
when 't' is 0, the
velocity is 0.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.890
And when 't' is 1, since 't
squared' is then 1, the

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.140
velocity is 1.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.210
Notice that the particle starts
with 0 velocity, ends

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.870
up with a velocity of 1, but the
average velocity is not a

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.000
half a foot per second.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.190
In other words, notice that the
particle traveled a total

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.460
distance of 1/3 of a
foot in 1 second.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.610
In other words, the average
speed was just 1/3 of a foot

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.780
per second.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.880
And you see, notice that in this
particular problem, since

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.200
'v' is equal to 't
squared', the

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.260
acceleration is not a constant.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.040
The acceleration is '2t'.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.060
It's a variable.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.080
Notice, for example, that the
time is approximately 7/10 of

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.500
a second before the particle
would move a half a foot.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:25.160
See, in other words, notice that
the time has to be 7/10

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.250
of a second before the
velocity is 1/2.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.630
Namely, when you square
0.7, you get 0.49.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.870
And notice again the
nonlinearity of this, which,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.080
as I say, we'll come back to
later, but I thought it was

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.500
worth mentioning in
passing over here.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.900
At any rate, let's generalize
this velocity problem because

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.650
I think it's much easier to
think in terms of distance,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.790
rate, and time than in terms
of slopes of curves.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.360
But let's just take
a look here.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.790
The generalization is this.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.490
Let's oppose that we
have a particle

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.870
moving along the x-axis.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.780
Its speed at any time is given
by 'v' equals 'f of t', and

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.580
the time interval is from 't'
equals 'a' to 't' equals 'b'.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.640
We assume that capital 'G' is
any function whose derivative

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.780
is 'f', and we then can conclude
that therefore 'x'

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.440
must be 'G of t' plus
a constant.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.750
We also say OK, initially
that's what?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.960
Not necessarily 0.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.960
Initially is when we
start the problem.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.109
When 't' equals 'a', 'x of
a' is 'G of a' plus 'c'.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.340
'x of t', therefore,
is 'G of t'.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.420
Notice that 'c' is 'x of a'
minus 'G of a', so 'x of t' is

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.710
'G of t' plus 'x of
a' minus 'G of a'.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.170
From this, just replacing 't'
by 'b', I find that 'x of b'

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.050
is 'G of b' plus 'x of
a' minus 'G of a'.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.140
Again, this is the only
indefinite part here.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.990
Notice, by the way, that this
is mimicking what I did

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.310
earlier for 'dy dx', but I
wanted to go through this one

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.660
more time in terms of a more
tangible physical example.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.630
At any rate, if I now subtract
'x of a' from this result, I

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.140
wind up with that 'x of b' minus
'x of a' is 'G of b'

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.480
minus 'G of a'.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.310
In other words, the change in
'x' on this time interval from

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:19.020
'a' to 'b' is determined just
by evaluating 'G of b' minus

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.630
'G of a' where 'G'
is any function

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.550
whose derivative changes.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.860
See, a rather easy
way of evaluating

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.780
this particular thing.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.530
Now, again I should point out
as an interesting physical

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.590
aside that this 'delta x' is
a displacement, not a total

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.370
distance, and I'll explain
what that means

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.850
in terms of an example.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.230
You see, let's observe that in
the problem that I did over

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.480
here, in this particular problem
over here, notice that

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.200
the velocity was always
positive.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.100
In given problems, the velocity
can oscillate between

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.440
positive and negative, meaning
in terms of moving along the

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.940
x-axis, the particle
can sometimes move

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.080
from left to right.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.740
Other times, it can from
right to left.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:08.400
But at any rate, what I want
to point out is that the

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.350
change in 'x' is a displacement,
a net change.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.430
Let me give you an example.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.500
Let's suppose again
that a particle is

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.330
moving along the x-axis.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.710
Now its speed 'v' is given
by 't - 1' where 't' is

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.320
between 0 and 2.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.070
Now, the function I'm looking
for, 'x', must differ from a

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.260
constant by a constant from any
function whose derivative

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.470
is 't - 1'.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.370
In particular, one function
whose derivative is 't - 1' is

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.120
'1/2 t squared' minus 't'.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.590
So whatever 'x' is, it
must have what form?

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.210
It's '1/2 t squared' minus
't' plus a constant.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:59.410
Now, I want to compute 'x'
evaluated when 't' is 2, 'x'

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.900
evaluated when 't' is 0, and
take this difference because

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.910
that will be the change in
'x', you see, as 't'

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.880
goes from 0 to 2.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.480
Well, at any rate, you see 'x of
2', just putting 2 in here,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.200
gives me 1/2 of 4, which
is 2, minus 2 plus

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.810
'c', which is 'c'.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.440
'x of 0' is 'c', and therefore,
'x of 2' minus 'x

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.390
of 0' is 0.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.120
Or written more symbolically,
'delta x' as 't' goes

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.150
from 0 to 2 is 0.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.540
In other words, there
is no change in 'x'.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.680
Now, obviously, we don't mean
the particle didn't

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.760
move in this case.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.900
For no motion, the velocity
should be 0, but the velocity

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.470
is 't - 1'.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.240
Let's see what really happened
in this particular problem.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.140
To do this, I have drawn some
separate graphs over here.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.280
The first one shows 'v'
in terms of 't'.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.870
And what this shows is what?

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.230
That when 't' is between 0
and 1, 'v' is negative.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.120
Now, there's nothing imaginary,
again recall, about

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.990
a negative velocity.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.090
Remember, that since the
particle is moving along the

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.810
x-axis and the positive sense of
the x-axis is from left to

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.440
right, a negative velocity means
that the particle is

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.540
just moving from
right to left.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.220
So what this says is the
particle was moving from right

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.050
to left for the first second
and then from left to right

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.010
for the second second.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:33.590
Also, if we now want to plot the
distance versus the time,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.240
you see, what we see is that
'x' is equal to '1/2 t

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.990
squared' minus 't'.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.160
That's this particular shape.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.160
And the plus 'x sub 0' is
our initial condition.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.520
In other words, this tells us
lookit, when we started this

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.860
problem at 't' equals 0, the
particle was positioned at 'x'

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.350
equals 'x sub 0'.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.820
And notice what this
thing seems to say.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.320
This seems to say that what?

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.650
You started here.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.790
Then for the first second, the
displacement was decreasing.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.060
That means you were moving in
the negative direction.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.270
And then you reached a certain
peak here, and when you got

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.940
down to this particular point,
you started to come back.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.240
And at the end of the second
second, your displacement was

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.090
exactly what it was when
you first started here.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.600
And by the way, let me again
mention, this is not the graph

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.740
of how the particle moved.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.210
The particle is moving
horizontally along the x-axis.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.000
This graph is just how the
displacement looks as a

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.730
function of time.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.280
In fact, by the way, to see how
we can eliminate the 'x

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.000
sub 0' here, I have
drawn one more.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.040
You'll notice that in our
recipe, we said let's compute

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.650
'1/2 t squared' minus 't'
as 't' goes from 0 to 2.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.920
That was the special case where
I replaced the x-axis by

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.030
the 'delta x' axis.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.230
In other words, the curve 'x'
equals '1/2 t squared' minus

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.180
't' would be this curve here.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.610
In other words, when
't' is 0, 'x' is 0.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.550
This says what?

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.510
The change in 'x' when you start
the problem is 0 because

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.210
the particle hasn't moved yet.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.950
And this says what?

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.890
The particle moves, reaches
a minimum value

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.400
when 't' equals 1.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.200
And when 't' equals 1, 'x'
equals minus 1/2, and then

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.650
comes back to 0 when
't' equals 2.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:29.990
In other words, physically what

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.930
happened here is the following.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.770
We started this problem
at 't' equals 0.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.760
At 't' equals 0, the particle
had a certain displacement, a

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.490
certain initial position which
we'll call 'x sub 0'.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.260
And what happened in this
problem is that for the first

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.030
second, the particle moved
from right to left.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.130
And when 't' was equal to 1,
the particle was at the

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.250
position 'x sub 0' minus 1/2,
which is just another way of

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:01.460
saying it was 1/2 of a unit, or
in this case, 1/2 a foot to

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.300
the left of its starting
point.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.910
Then during the next second,
the velocity is positive.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.420
The particle doubles back,
returns to the point 'x0' when

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.440
't' equals 2, so that the
displacement, meaning the net

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.450
change in position during the
time interval of this problem,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.300
the net distance
traveled is 0.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.880
It started and finished
at the same point.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.460
On the other hand, the total
distance traveled is 1/2 a

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.190
foot in this direction, 1/2 a
foot in this direction, so

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.140
therefore, a total of 1 foot.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.760
Well, you see, I thought this
was a worthwhile discussion to

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.970
have on distance,
rate, and time.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.070
But I also thought another thing
was rather important.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:51.160
Did you notice that except for
my mentioning at the beginning

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.010
of our lesson that the inverse
derivative is called the

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.830
indefinite integral, that the
so-called integral sign has

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.600
never appeared in anything
that I've done.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.550
In other words, to emphasize
what I was talking about in

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.960
the last lecture, observe that
I could get by wonderfully

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.720
without ever having heard of
an integral sign, without

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.280
having heard of the phrase
indefinite integral.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.980
At any rate, though, let me ask
the following query, so to

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.040
speak, to sort of lead into
a summation point of view.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.070
Once we invent the notation
integral ''f of x' dx' to

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.050
denote the set of all functions
'G' whose derivative

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:37.650
is 'f', why not invent a new
symbol, namely, what?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.260
We'll still use this integral
sign, but now put that lower

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.420
and upper bound on this thing.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.530
We'll call this the definite
integral ''f of x' dx', or the

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.590
definite indefinite integral--

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.910
I put these limits
on, 'a' to 'b'--

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.800
to denote 'G of b' minus 'G of
a' where 'G prime' is any

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.710
function whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.630
In other words, to put this in
still another perspective,

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:06.310
remember the 'G' was a member
of the family described by

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.250
interval ''f of x' dx'.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.110
To indicate that I'm going to
compute 'G of b', why not put

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.690
a 'b' on top of this
integral sign?

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.800
And then to indicate that I'm
going to subtract from that 'G

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.020
of a', why not denote 'G of a'
by the same integral sign with

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.770
an a underneath it?

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.400
And then symbolically, I can
think of 'G of b' minus 'G of

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.200
a' as being this expression
here, which I will then

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.040
abbreviate as--

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.090
you see, in other words, I'll
take this thing and say OK,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:41.030
this is now an abbreviation
for what we have here.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.020
In other words, that when you
see this thing, which we'll

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.690
call the definite indefinite
integral, ''f of x' dx' from

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.200
'a' to 'b', this is just an
abbreviation for what?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.370
'G of x', 'G of b' minus 'G of
a' where 'G' is a function

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.520
whose derivative is 'f'.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.980
And with this in mind
now, I can summarize

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.710
our lecture as follows.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:07.330
Suppose I know that 'dy dx' is
'f of x', where 'x' is defined

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.200
on the closed interval
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.750
Then the change in 'y' on this
interval, in other words, the

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.080
change in 'y' as 'x' goes from
'a' to 'b' is given by the

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:25.430
symbol integral 'a' to 'b' ''f
of x' dx' where this symbol is

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.720
defined to be 'G of x' evaluated
between 'x' equals

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.580
'a' and 'x' equals 'b', meaning
'G of b' minus 'G of

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.700
a', where 'G' is any function
whose derivative is 'f'.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.810
Notice again then, in closing,
that this particular symbol

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.530
here, as far as I'm concerned,
is artificial.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.430
I don't really need it.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.380
And whereas it might have been
unfortunate to invent the

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.400
phrase indefinite integral, it
might be even more unfortunate

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.720
to have two words sounding
so much alike that

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.120
are completely different.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.600
In other words, notice that when
I write the integral sign

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.040
from 'a' to 'b' ''f of x'
dx', what this thing

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.480
denotes is a number.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.120
It's a change in 'y'.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.190
Without the two numbers here,
'a' and 'b', this denotes a

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:18.660
set of functions, namely, all
functions whose derivative

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.490
with respect to 'x'
is 'f of x'.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.700
Well, anyway, I hope that this
straightens out, if nothing

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.850
more, the difference between
the words definite and

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.910
indefinite.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.000
And we shall return to
the subject called--

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.590
or turn to the subject called
integral calculus and bring

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.260
this up in more detail
from a different

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.640
context in a little while.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.860
In the meantime, we'll have
a little sojourn into the

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.560
circular functions and revisit
trigonometry for a few days

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.710
while we allow this idea
here to set more

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.690
firmly in your mind.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.380
