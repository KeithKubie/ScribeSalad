00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.399
What's up, guys?

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.290
My name is Venus X, and we're here at MoMA
PS1 in Long Island City, and we're standing

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.440
on the dance floor of Warm Up festival, which
happens here every summer, every Saturday,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.110
during July, August, and a little bit of September.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.490
And it's a really special festival that I
was able to play seven years ago, and I'm

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.410
now curator of.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.050
What's cool about the festival is that you
buy a ticket, and you get to see a full day

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.390
of music, but you can also visit the museum,
which has some really incredible shows.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.610
Today, I'm gonna walk you through a few of
them, so come on in.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.980
This is our lobby, and this is a work from an exhibition upstairs called "Past Skin,"

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.820
and this work was created by Jillian Mayer.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.220
She lives in Miami, she's from there.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.190
and “Past Skin" thinks about the relationship
that we have to landscape, and to our bodies,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.190
and technology.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.160
And this one specifically speaks to the way
that we use our cellphones

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.940
So, Jillian Mayer looks at people, takes photos,
and she relies on the negative spaces on their

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.440
bodies to determine what her sculptures are
gonna look like.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:14.160
Waiting for a friend, texting away, lounging,
texting away, take a walk, still texting away,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.800
sounds familiar, doesn't it?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.740
"Why should our body end at our skin?"

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.000
Abigail Lucien is from Haiti, very cool.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.300
My family is from Dominican Republic, which
is the country next door.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.040
We share an island, which isn't connected
for many reasons.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.180
But these canopies remind me of my family's
homes in Dominican Republic.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.740
It's pretty amazing to see some artwork like
that here.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.950
It's like a movie version of what people think
the Caribbean sounds like.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.260
The next part of "Past Skin" that we're gonna
look at is this film by Madelon Vriesendorp.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.619
It was made originally for French TV.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.250
And so, in this story, she's talking about
the Chrysler Building and the Empire State

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.140
Building having a love affair, two penises.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.360
I think they're gay.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.660
Don't edit that out.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.600
Oh, my God.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.260
So, we're on the third floor of MoMA PS1 and
I'm gonna walk you through Ian Cheng's "Emissaries."

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:25.340
It is a three-part saga programmed by a computer
system that is based on a video game that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.769
plays itself.

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:34.279
So, these first screens here are depicting
a world where humans have just arrived, and

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:40.249
they're trying to figure out what they're
doing, why they're there, what's their reason,

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:46.900
their ecosystem, their purpose, And so, each
character is playing out its own original

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.620
narrative that keeps on changing.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.659
So, in the second one, a volcano that exists
here has exploded.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.450
Humanity is over, and there's artificial intelligence
that's been sent to study what happened, what

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.459
did we do wrong?

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.430
Apparently, their leader, or the thing that
they follow, is called “Celebrity.”

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.310
It's kind of ironic.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.180
Anyway, he's a skeleton.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.919
He kind of looks like an entertainer, he's
got his glasses and his bling on, but he has

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.200
no skin.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.969
And so, a little bit of background on Ian
Cheng, he studied cognitive psychology and

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.360
also worked in George Lucas' factory [Industrial Light &amp; Magic]

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.599
and that's where he picked up all these animation techniques.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.669
So, this is the third and final room in the
Ian Cheng "Emissaries" three-part saga.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.659
Artificial intelligence has become something
of itself.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.379
It's its own organism now.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.879
Like the idea that we've just fused with all
of the crazy shit we were doing, crazy things

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.449
that we were doing.

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:56.930
Technology and destroying the planet, and
look at what's left of us.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.629
Anyway, this is what you would call art.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:00.629
Enjoy it.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.620
It doesn't always make sense, but that doesn't
mean it's not a really, really, really well-thought-out.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.480
So, we're in the James Turrell piece called
"Meeting" now on the third floor at MoMA PS1.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.360
It was created in 1980.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.440
It’s a really special room because apparently,
there were four feet of concrete above our

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.700
heads that he jackhammered through himself,
in order to make this beautiful hole in the building.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.319
The myth is that he pitched a tent and stayed
here some nights, which is really cool.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.970
This is one of my favorite pieces in the museum.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.560
It's really simple.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.270
It's a forever piece.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.430
It's like the clouds, or the sun, or a waterfall,
it’s one of those simple things that makes

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.039
you think about the sublime.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.310
But also, why would you put a hole in the
ceiling of a museum, and why would anyone

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.090
let you leave that hole there then for 30
some odd years?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.320
It's pretty ridiculous, maybe 40 years now.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.860
What you guys are looking at now, and what
we're gonna walk through is the "Lumen" installation

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.259
by Jenny Sabin Studios.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.780
And what you have here is a million yards
of fiber that have been digitally woven.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.200
Sort of looks like coral reef.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.140
It's crazy how you can make the digital algorithms
resemble nature so closely.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.539
And so, that concludes my tour of MoMA PS1.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.630
This is what it looks like, summer 2017.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.139
That's the stage where it all goes down every
Saturday.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.800
We open our doors at 12pm, we close at 9pm.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.979
There's music from 3pm to 9pm.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.870
So far, it's been really amazing, and I hope
to see you guys here this summer.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.509
You can come all the way through September
2nd, and if you like what you saw today, make

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.509
sure you hit the MoMA subscribe button because
there's a lot of other cool videos that have

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.520
been made, and are gonna be made, about the
exhibitions here at this museum and at our

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.249
Midtown location.
