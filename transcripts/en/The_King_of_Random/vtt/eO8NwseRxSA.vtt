00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.480
In this video I’m going to show you how
to build a fire breathing “Gas Blaster”

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.639
torch from simple, and common materials. This
homemade jet torch shoots a steady, and adjustable

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.110
flame, that gets hot enough to melt metal.
Which means, now you can dodge the challenges

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.470
of charcoal, by powering your foundry, on
propane.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.880
To start this project, simply stop in to see
any local propane supplier, and pick up an 8’ length of propane hose.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.250
You’ll need 1/4” hose with two 3/8”
flare fittings crimped to the ends, which

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.210
they’ll probably make for you right there
at the shop.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.429
And while you’re at it, see if they have
a 1/4” brass plug, and a 3/8” flare x 1/4” 45º fitting they can sell you as well.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.870
The other parts are a 1/4” ball valve. A
1/4” pipe nipple, and a 1/4” galvanized

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.609
coupling. All available, at your local hardware
store.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.469
Alright let’s get started wrapping each
of the threaded ends with teflon tape, so

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.370
they’ll make a better seal when we screw
them together in just a minute.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.760
This is pretty much the order the pieces are
going together, so let’s kick off the assembly

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.229
by attaching the flared end of the brass 45º,
to the end of the 8’ hose.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.929
Screw the fittings together finger tight,
then use a pair of pliers to sinch them together,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.920
so they make an air-tight seal.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.799
Add the ball valve next, screwing it tightly together the same way, then screw the pipe nipple onto the end.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.390
It’s important that the valve handle opens
toward you, and shuts off in the down position.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.320
So double-check you put it on the right way,
then move on to making the intake nozzle next.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.390
Now rather than screwing the 1/4” coupling
to the pipe nipple right now, it’s going

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.409
to be really helpful to use a sanding belt,
or a metal file, to flatten down each of the four sides first.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.520
The flattened sides will make it easier for
4 set screws to bite into place later on,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.860
and hold the coupling securely in place.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.219
Alright, let’s move on to assembling the
propane nozzle, and for that we’ll need

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.789
the brass plug from earlier, a 6mm tap, and
a “wire feed” welding tip.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.079
Now you could save money, simply by drilling
a 0.6mm hole directly into the brass plug

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.049
itself, but I’m using “wire feed” contact
tips because they’re replaceable, they look

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.579
cool, and the hole's exactly the right size
for this torch.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.299
Go ahead and drill a 3/16” hole directly
through the center of the brass plug.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.909
It’s important to get the hole as straight
as you can, so I’m using a drill press I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.109
found at a garage sale for $20.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.449
But if you’ve got steady hands, you can
make it work just fine with a cordless-drill as well.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.360
The next step is to cut inner threads in the
hole, so the welding tip will screw into place.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.950
And an M6 x 1.0 tool, works great for tapping
that.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.709
I added thread tape to the welding tip just
for good measure, and with a few flicks of

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.159
the fingers, you can see we’ve got a good
looking propane nozzle, ready to join the system.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.400
Go ahead and screw the nozzle securely to
the steel coupling, then just set it to the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.880
side for a second, because we’re actually
going to move over, to working on the jet tube for a bit.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.220
The components we’ll need to finish the
torch, are four socket cap screws (M5 - 0.8 x 25mm),

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.140
a 1” steel reducer coupling (1”
x 3/4”), a 1-1/2” steel reducer coupling (1-1/2” x 3/4”),  and a 6” steel pipe
(3/4” x 6”).

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.540
Now to secure the jet assembly, to the nozzle
we first have to drill holes for the set screws.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.870
So file down the four sides of the larger
coupling to make them nice and flat, then

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.920
clamp it in a vice to hold it securely. Because
it’s important these holes are drilled as straight as possible.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.750
Another cool trick is to screw the pipe on
and adjust it horizontally, to help ensure

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.810
the coupling is about as perpendicular as
you can get it.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.659
Now the position of the holes you drill, is
really important.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.519
You need two 1/8” holes drilled through
the rim of the large end, opposite from each other.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.150
Then two more 1/8” holes perpendicular to
the first two, and right on the edge, where

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.299
the adaptor begins sloping down.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.200
We need to tap these holes as well, but they’re
a slightly different size, so let’s use

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.939
an M5 x 0.8 tap this time, because that’s
the one that matches the threads on our cap screws.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.000
Ok, now that we’ve got the intake port machined
and completed, the hardest part is over, and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.900
we can bring back the nozzle we made earlier,
and secure the two pieces together with set screws.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.120
Twist the cap screws into the holes, and you
should find they easily go all the way in, by hand.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.159
And if you drilled and tapped your holes correctly,
the four tips of the screws will meet together, and form a cross at the center.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.750
Let’s combine these two parts together,
simply by setting the adaptor overtop of the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.640
nozzle, and checking to make sure the tip
is centered inside the hole at the top.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.480
Let’s secure it in position by hand-tightening
the screws until we feel them touch the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.700
coupling inside, then simply fine-tune the
adjustments, keeping the nozzle as centered as possible.

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.989
Now when the screws are in "finger tight", we
can make the assembly a little stronger, by

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.400
adding a some tension, with a screw driver.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.200
The screws should only need about 1/4 twist
each, to lock the nozzle on tight. But feel

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.549
free to go around a second time, if you want
to be extra sure.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.819
At this point our modified intake adaptor
has two set-screws at the bottom, two perpendicular

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.839
screws an inch above those, and a propane
nozzle, sitting perfectly centered, in the middle.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.340
Now it’s a really good idea to have an adjustable
regulator, to control the air flowing through

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.030
the torch. So let’s make one of those next.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.630
All you’ll need is an empty can of tuna,
and this air-regulator template I made, which

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.680
you can have for free. Just look in the description
for a link on where to get it.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.800
Print, and cut out one of the paper templates,
then glue it directly to the center of the steel lid.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.639
The steel should be thin enough to slice with
a pair of scissors, so carefully cut around

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.580
the edges of the template, then gently mold
it from the back, into a bowl-shape.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.700
With the center pressed in and the edges raised
up a bit, it should look a bit like a small steel shield.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.289
This slit on the side let’s you slip the
regulator completely over the intake port,

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.419
essentially blocking off any air-flow. And
you’ll see why that’s important in a minute.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.459
From this point, the rest of the torch is
really easy to assemble.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.380
Simply drop two, 1/2” cut washers over the
end of the pipe nipple, then grab the intake

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.580
adaptor and screw the inside coupling on as
tightly as you can get it by hand.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.690
Now screw the small steel adaptor onto the
6” pipe until it’s hand tight as well,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.080
then loosely screw those pieces, onto the
air-intake adaptor.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.360
Just like that, this “Gas Blaster” torch is completely finished, and ready to breathe fire.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.120
Now, you could hook this up to your propane
tank and use it right away, but for safety

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.120
and protection, you really should add a pressure
gauge, and some kind of regulator valve.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.050
You’ll also need a 1/4” Prest-O-Lite (POL)
valve, for connecting the regulator to the

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.830
propane tank, and a 1/4” x 3/8” flare
fitting, for connecting the regulator, to the hose.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.990
Now open the valve on the tank, and spin the
regulator up to about 30 PSI, so you can check

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.360
for any leaks in the hose, and the connections.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.000
If you hear any hissing, then double-check
the connections have thread-tape on them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.710
and tighten everything up, until the hissing stops.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.460
At this point, our propane torch is 100% finished,
so why not take it for a test drive, and see what it can do?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.300
Now firing up the torch, really couldn’t
be easier. Simply hold a flame near the nozzle

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.729
with one hand, and slowly open the valve on
the torch, with the other.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.069
It should light off no problem, and watch
this. If we slowly adjust the air-regulator

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:12.919
at the back, we can convert it from a fire
belching blow torch, to a metal melting jet-torch in just an instant.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.959
The sound, and the color of the flame, will
tell you a lot, about how the fuel, and the air are balanced.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.150
So if you’re planning to melt metal, just
play with the flame until you get a nice blue color, and a jet-loud roar.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.690
Blue flames like this are slightly oxidizing,
and are the color I use, for my backyard casting.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.440
By regulating the air-intake, you have the
option of using any length of pipe you want,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.340
and can slide between an oxidizing flame,
(Oxygen &gt; Gas) and a reducing flame, (Gas &gt; Oxygen) as quick as you need.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.520
When you’re ready to shut it off, simply
close the valve on the handle, and the flame disappears in an instant.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.479
Perhaps the best part about this jet-torch
design, is that it works with the "flower pot

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.550
foundry", I showed you how to make in a previous
project, without any other modifications required.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.599
The end flare doesn’t actually fit through
blower port though, but you can just take it off.

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.490
Amazingly, the inside of the foundry acts
as an improvised nozzle all by itself, so

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.000
just point the tube into the hole, and it’ll
work just fine.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.050
That’s really all it takes to convert your
backyard foundry, to propane.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.919
Add a little gas and light it off with a bbq
igniter, then adjust the air-flow until you

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.460
see the flame tighten into a fiery vortex,
of metal melting power.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.740
Now this set-up can get really hot in a hurry,
so quickly put on the lid, and stand back.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.460
In as little as 5 minutes, the inside of your
foundry will be glowing red-hot, and you’ll

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.690
be melting all your favorite metals, without
any of the challenges you had, with charcoal.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.449
There’s no babysitting, no mess to clean
up afterward, and what’s really cool, is

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.699
you’ll probably be saving money as well.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.340
The “Gas Blaster” is designed to self
regulate, and sustain a healthy flame from

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.340
1 PSI, all the way through 55 PSI, without
even flinching.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.150
That means you can run your foundry as hot,
or as cool as you want, just by regulating

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.430
the pressure from the propane tank.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.110
The inside of the foundry gets hot enough
to boil brass, and liquefy bullet casings

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.580
on contact, but amazingly, the intake end
of the torch stays relatively cool the entire time.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.680
By the way, if one jet-torch can do all that,
why not exponentialize the power, by adding another?

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.210
I added a “T” fitting to my hose so I
could split it, and run separate lines to each torch.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.099
Then drilled a second hole through the side
of my foundry, so now the flames hit the crucible, from either side.

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:14.659
Try it for yourself, and you’ll be amazed
at how fast this flaming duo, can really heat things up.

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:19.020
Well now you know how to use easily accessible,
and easy to replace parts, to make a “Gas

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.760
Blaster” jet torch, and convert your backyard
foundry, to propane.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.080
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
