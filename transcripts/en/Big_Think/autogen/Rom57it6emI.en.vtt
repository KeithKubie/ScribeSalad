salt and there's so much evidence that

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550
salt and there's so much evidence that
 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.730
salt and there's so much evidence that
salt is related to high blood pressure

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740
salt is related to high blood pressure

heart disease stroke and so forth it
 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.620
heart disease stroke and so forth it
would be really terrific if we could cut

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630
would be really terrific if we could cut
 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.720
would be really terrific if we could cut
down on our salt intake we don't need

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730
down on our salt intake we don't need
 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.180
down on our salt intake we don't need
nearly as much as we're eating and the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
nearly as much as we're eating and the
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.310
nearly as much as we're eating and the
real problem with it is that nearly

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320
real problem with it is that nearly
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.620
real problem with it is that nearly
eighty percent of the salt and American

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630
eighty percent of the salt and American
 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.139
eighty percent of the salt and American
diets is there before anybody has any

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149
diets is there before anybody has any
 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.200
diets is there before anybody has any
choice about it it's either in the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
choice about it it's either in the
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.330
choice about it it's either in the
processed food that we buy in the store

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340
processed food that we buy in the store
 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.819
processed food that we buy in the store
or it's in the restaurant food or the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829
or it's in the restaurant food or the
 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.650
or it's in the restaurant food or the
food the pre-prepared meals that are

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660
food the pre-prepared meals that are
 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.350
food the pre-prepared meals that are
outside the amount that's added at the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360
outside the amount that's added at the
 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.569
outside the amount that's added at the
table is minimal compared to what's

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579
table is minimal compared to what's
 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.119
table is minimal compared to what's
already there so what that means is that

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129
already there so what that means is that
 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.770
already there so what that means is that
for somebody who wants to cut down on

for somebody who wants to cut down on

for somebody who wants to cut down on
soul you can't eat processed foods and

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119
soul you can't eat processed foods and
 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.209
soul you can't eat processed foods and

you can't eat restaurant foods we need
to do something about that at the policy

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229
to do something about that at the policy
 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.919
to do something about that at the policy
level so that restaurants and processed

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929
level so that restaurants and processed
 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.929
level so that restaurants and processed
foods will cut down on the soul and make

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939
foods will cut down on the soul and make
 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.460
foods will cut down on the soul and make
it easier for people to eat less

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470
 
 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.440
 
there's a lot going on in government

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
there's a lot going on in government
 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.270
there's a lot going on in government
right now trying to work with food

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280
right now trying to work with food
 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.070
right now trying to work with food
manufacturers and restaurants to cut

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080
manufacturers and restaurants to cut
 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.100
manufacturers and restaurants to cut
down New York City for example has a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110
down New York City for example has a
 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.430
down New York City for example has a
very quiet under the table initiative to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440
very quiet under the table initiative to
 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.110
very quiet under the table initiative to
try to get the salt and you see the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120
try to get the salt and you see the
 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.940
try to get the salt and you see the
problem with salt is that if you're

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
problem with salt is that if you're
 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.490
problem with salt is that if you're
eating a lot of it you don't notice the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500
eating a lot of it you don't notice the
 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.980
eating a lot of it you don't notice the
taste of it you only notice the taste of

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990
taste of it you only notice the taste of
 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.840
taste of it you only notice the taste of
it if you're not eating a lot of it and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850
it if you're not eating a lot of it and
 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.240
it if you're not eating a lot of it and
so if everybody in the population was

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250
so if everybody in the population was
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.450
so if everybody in the population was
eating less then the foods that are out

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
eating less then the foods that are out
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.150
eating less then the foods that are out
there would taste terribly salty but

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160
there would taste terribly salty but
 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.820
there would taste terribly salty but
unless all of the food manufacturers and

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
unless all of the food manufacturers and
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.650
unless all of the food manufacturers and
all of the restaurants cut down at the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660
all of the restaurants cut down at the
 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.070
all of the restaurants cut down at the
same time then nobody wants to go first

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080
same time then nobody wants to go first
 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.750
same time then nobody wants to go first
so that's really what the problem is

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760
so that's really what the problem is
 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.219
so that's really what the problem is
that's why you need government

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229
that's why you need government
 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.410
that's why you need government
intervention in this to try to make it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420
intervention in this to try to make it
 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.210
intervention in this to try to make it
easier for people to cut down on their

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220
easier for people to cut down on their
 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.249
easier for people to cut down on their
salt intake because even if you want to

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259
salt intake because even if you want to
 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.830
salt intake because even if you want to
it's really hard
