00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.410
- So Adam, welcome to my office.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.243
- Thank you sir.

00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:04.220
- On the internet, this is
called The Cosmic Office.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.640
So, I have a sample of aerogel

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.870
in this office.
(gasps sharply)

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.703
- Really?

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:08.536
- Yes.

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:09.700
- I have never touched
a sample of aerogel--

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.698
- You've never touched aerogel?

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:11.580
- In my whole life.
- Really?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.470
- Always wanted to.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.550
- This will be a first for Adam Savage.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.383
- Dude.

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:15.216
- It'll be a first for everybody.

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:16.049
(laughs hysterically)

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.945
- What the hell is aerogel?

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.811
(chuckling)

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.080
- Okay, aerogel is the most ghost-like

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.190
solid substance ever spun.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.050
- Oh really?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.883
- Yes.

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:29.090
And it's used for NASA

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.963
and the aerogel is a,
has many applications.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.720
But one of the ones that
we care most about is,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.600
you put that on a
spacecraft, on a space probe,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.180
and as it flies through a comet's tail,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.410
particles of the comet enter the gel

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.770
and it slowly stops
it, so that it's intact

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.090
by the time you bring it
back and then analyze it.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.760
So you, among the many
things you can do with it--

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.090
- Is catch a comet's tail?

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.358
- Ya catch a comet's tail.
(laughs)

00:00:56.358 --> 00:00:57.191
(mumbles)

00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:00.010
- It's also, it's highly
insulating properties.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.740
It's like one of the most
insulating things ever known.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.470
And the way they make it,
they have some polymer chain

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.330
that they spin up and
it's this solid thing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.060
but then they evaporate all the liquid

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.030
and what's left are the molecules

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.710
that are, that flesh out the volume

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.265
that the liquid wants to occupy.

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:20.098
- Ooh.

00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:20.931
- And so...

00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.320
- And it's like 99.9% air right?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160
- Yes.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.993
(gasps sharply)

00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:25.826
- Higher than that.

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:26.659
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.840
- Okay, so here it is.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.315
- Oh my goodness, look at that.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:30.148
(laughs)

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:31.300
- I said, it's like a ghost.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.220
- It does look like a ghost--

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.053
- Okay.

00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:33.930
- You brought a tesseract out.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.430
- Oh my--
- Hang on, hang on.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.300
- No way.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.133
- Hang on...

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.370
Way.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.300
Okay

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.133
(gasp sharply)

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:41.966
- Look at that.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:42.799
- Oh my...

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.807
Okay that is one of the
coolest things I've ever seen.

00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:45.640
- And it's like a ghost.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.560
- It is.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.660
- It's actually solid.

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.070
It's not flexible.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.070
- Right.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.940
- And it's very brittle.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.777
- It is science cotton candy.

00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:54.890
(laughs loudly)

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.250
- Don't eat it Chuck.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.370
Okay, here we go.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.203
Ready?
- Ready.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.902
- Whoah.

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:02.350
- That is aerogel.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.610
- Look at that!

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.120
That's (gasps sharply)

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.953
Oh my God.

00:02:05.953 --> 00:02:07.130
I can feel that it's--

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.963
- You can pick it up.

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:09.790
(gasps sharply)
- I trust you.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.650
- It's like a ghost.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.690
- That is so like a ghost.
- If Casper were made

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.700
of anything, Casper
would be made of aerogel.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.530
- If Casper were made of something,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.604
oh that is too cool.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:18.800
(laughs)

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.720
That really is too cool man.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.553
Look at that.

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.660
- It might be the lowest density

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.760
solid stuff ever because
it's not, I mean it's,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.640
it's volume filling strands of molecules.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.106
- Is this how neutrinos talk about Earth?

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.400
(laughs loudly)

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.233
- Very good.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.066
- Thank you.

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:36.899
- That was very good.

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.190
Neutrino earth is like
transparent to Earth.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.023
- Right.

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:39.856
- So...

00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:40.689
- That is great.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.190
- So this is aerogel

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.440
and I have a whole cube of it here--

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.220
- That is an incredible
collection of aerogel.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.160
- So I am honored that I could show Adam

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.810
something he'd never
seen or touched before.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.925
- Nice.

00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:50.943
- And I show you something
you didn't even know existed.

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:52.213
(laughs)
- It's so true.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.163
- Just to remind people

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:56.210
we got Adam here 'cause
he's got a new book.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.043
- Yes.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:57.876
- We would have him anyway

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:58.766
even without the book.
That's right.

00:02:58.766 --> 00:02:59.599
- Let me just make that clear.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.265
- Absolutely.
- I appreciate that.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:03.630
- Okay Every Tool's A Hammer:
Life Is What You Make It.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.463
I see what he did there
with the subtitle--

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:05.500
- Yeah, it's very cool.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.333
- That's right, right.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:08.220
All right we're signing off on StarTalk.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.470
Adam thanks for coming through town.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.420
- That was awesome.
