00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:05.181
(electronic beeping)

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:08.348
(upbeat lively music)

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.130
- Welcome to A Conversation With History,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.440
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.120
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.310
Our guest is Jennifer Granholm

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.440
who is a former governor of Michigan,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
and a former Attorney General.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.440
She is now at Berkeley
as an adjunct professor

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
in the School of Public
Policy and in the Law School.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.230
Jennifer, welcome to our program.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.240
- So glad to be with you, thank you.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.040
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.010
- Well, I was born in Vancouver,
British Columbia, Canada,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.181
but came to the US with my
parents when I was four.

00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:13.290
And we moved to Southern California

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.290
and then to Northern California

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.460
and I'm proud to say I'm a Cal alum.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.790
And so that's where my parents
actually are still alive

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.420
and they are living in San Carlos.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.990
- And looking back, how did they affect

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.270
your thinking about the world?

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.100
- Well, it's kind of
interesting you say that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.960
'cause they never got a
chance to go to college.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.840
They come from very humble roots

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.700
and they're Republicans, I'm a Democrat,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.340
an active Democrat, so I often think

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.790
that perhaps it was higher
education that gave me

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
a wiser view of the political spectrum.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.160
But they're also very meat and potatoes,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.940
and while I wasn't raised in Michigan

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.970
and I ended up becoming
the governor of Michigan

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.960
because I married Michigan,
the sort of infused notion

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.550
of being very understanding
where people come from

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.690
when they haven't had
all the opportunities

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.020
is a gift that my parents gave to me.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.393
- And you have a very value-oriented way

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.700
of looking at the political world.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880
Does that come from them?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.600
- Well, it's an interesting thing.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.794
I mean, when you say value-oriented,

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:29.794
they are very faithful people
in terms of religious faith.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:35.537
And my dad, who is just a stoic Swede,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.980
I never heard him utter a swear word,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.400
I never heard him raise a voice

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.400
and I never heard him tell a
lie in any way, shape, or form.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.900
I mean, for him, integrity was everything.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.840
And so I feel like that
became so important to me

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.130
because I would never
want to do something,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.340
a, that disappointed him
but that ran counter to that

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.320
sort of infused sense of values.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.410
Now when I met my
husband, who is Catholic,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.910
I converted to Catholicism
and the reason why

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.190
is because the Catholic
tradition that he came from

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.860
and that I really admired
was a tradition that involved

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.490
service to the poor.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.451
And so that became a very
much a part and parcel

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.670
of how I governed and my
values and priorities,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.840
budgetarily, in how I governed

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.350
and the people that I was able to serve.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.000
- And your relationship with your husband

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is a very important
partnership in your life,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.527
not only did you write a book together,

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:45.790
"A Governor's Story," which
I will show our audience

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.060
in which we will talk
about in a few minutes,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.060
but also he was an important partner

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.600
when you went into public service.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.810
- Super important partner.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.707
I mean, first of all, when we--

00:03:58.707 --> 00:03:59.540
- [Harry] You should say his name.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.730
- His name is Daniel Mulhern

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.250
and he's also a professor
here at Berkeley.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.180
He teaches in the Haas Business School.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210
He teaches leadership as a matter of fact

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.790
which is what he ended up doing

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.210
before I became governor.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.920
He had a business et cetera that was doing

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.020
consulting in leadership and all of that.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.570
But he's from Michigan
and we met at law school

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.527
and I initially, I had to be
wooed, I'll just say that,

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:26.510
and he was really great at that,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.250
but we're totally different people.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.520
He's very much, he's very heart-centered,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.923
I'm head-centered.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.590
If you look at, I don't
know if your viewers know

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.690
what Myers-Briggs is, but it's a test

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.670
that determines your
personality types, et cetera.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.440
We are completely opposite,
which is really great

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.570
because together we make a whole.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.570
And he has skills and
tendencies that I don't have

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.570
and similarly I have skills and tendencies

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.050
that he doesn't have and so
it's a really great thing.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.120
It could create tension, but once we,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.010
once you come to love
and understand somebody,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.660
we've been married for 33 years,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.980
you end up recognizing that the things

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.980
that you might differ about are things

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.330
that actually can end up benefiting you.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.230
So he has been an incredible partner

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.940
in our life and in our
marriage and in raising kids.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.130
When he grew up he
wanted to be either pope

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.330
or president or governor of Michigan.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.520
And when we went through
marriage prep with a priest,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.690
the priest said to us, well, hey,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.170
what if the party comes to Jennifer

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.010
and asks her to run for
office, what will you do?

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.020
And he was like, he grew up he was,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.800
he went to Yale as an undergrad,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.180
he went to Harvard Law School,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.313
he's a jock, he wanted to be a big man,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.090
he said, well, I'd probably be jealous,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.720
but if she wanted to do
it I'd be behind her 100%.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.870
And the priest was very prescient

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.160
and the party did come to me.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.060
And Dan from the get-go was saying,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.390
hey, the door only opens every so often;

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.950
when it does, you gotta go through,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.570
I'm with you, I'm behind
you, I've got the kids.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.030
'Cause when I ran for attorney general,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.560
which was my first public office,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.100
my youngest child, we have three children,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.000
my youngest was only seven months old.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.470
And so Dan was like, I got the kids,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.493
don't worry, let's do it.

00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:20.550
I don't think he really knew
what he was getting into

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.190
when he said that, but nonetheless

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.330
he has been an incredible partner.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.770
- And he really assumed
the burden of raising--

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.603
- [Jennifer] Yeah, yeah.

00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:29.436
- The children actually.

00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:31.570
- Yeah, I mean his lane was to take care

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.020
of these little souls.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.020
And, honestly, if you did
look at our personality types

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.540
and you compared them and you were trying

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.040
to pick someone to raise your
children, you would pick him.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.170
Because he can stare at a baby for hours.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.270
- So the Lord intervened (laughs).

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.550
- The Lord intervened, I guess.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.870
I mean, it's funny because they ended up

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.280
benefiting enormously
'cause he's creative,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.730
he's soul-centered.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.820
So, for them, it was really important.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.750
And it's hard to be a child of a governor

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.640
or an attorney general and
so having somebody there

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.090
who is solid, who is
there for you is really,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.260
really important and I'm just so grateful

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.520
that he was willing to do that.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.740
- Before you went to
Cal and to Harvard Law

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.750
you tried a number of different careers.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.960
We don't have to go into it.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.752
- Thank you (laughs).

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:27.300
- But is there a general
lesson that you acquired

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.640
from trying a number
of things before you--

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.250
- Which is go and do it.
- Yeah.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.750
- I mean, a lot of times I think kids

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.150
at Cal 'cause I've got these young people

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.670
who want to achieve, achieve,
achieve, which is great,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.030
but sometimes you wanna
experiment a little bit

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.970
and closing doors is a
way of making a choice.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.850
And so to be able to try some stuff out,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.580
even if it's wild stuff.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.920
And if it doesn't work, what
better time to try it at least

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.300
when you are young and don't have a family

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.930
and don't have those
kind of responsibilities.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.240
So I strongly encourage these
young people to experiment

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.550
and then figure that out, try it

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.850
and maybe it'll work, who knows.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.450
But if it doesn't,
don't feel bad about it,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.800
just know that it's a
stepping stone in life.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.710
- What led you to politics and the law?

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.100
- Pardon me, what led me?
- Yeah.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.660
- Well, I, it's funny, one
of the things that I tried

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.920
as I went to Los Angeles,
and I wanted to become

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.920
a serious actress and I was in that role,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.630
not in that role but in that step,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.630
I worked for Universal
Studios as a tour guide

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.790
and in between tours, I kid you not,

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.560
I would sit in the back waiting
for my tour to be called

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.587
and I was reading Will and Ariel Durant's

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:49.110
"The History of Civilization."

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.380
And that got me to reading philosophy

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.840
and that got me to thinking,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.730
what the hell am I doing here (chuckles),

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.540
and really got me super
interested in politics.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.960
My parents were not political.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.250
I mean, they're Republicans
but they're sort of

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.100
one step removed; they're not active.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.120
I volunteered for a political campaign,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.970
which at that time was John B. Anderson

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.120
who was an independent.

00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:18.740
I went door-to-door for
him, I became a US citizen,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.570
I had started that process when I was 16,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.600
I was the first from my family

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.860
to become US citizen from Canada.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.430
And then that swearing-in ceremony

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.910
was so powerful for me--

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.743
- Swearing-in?

00:09:32.743 --> 00:09:33.850
- To become a citizen.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.683
- Oh, oh, right.

00:09:34.683 --> 00:09:39.683
- I felt like I, this is my country now

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.940
and I have an obligation to do something.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.213
And so the combination of
reading sort of the history,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.830
both history and philosophy
and then becoming a citizen,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.230
I said, I'm leaving LA and I'm gonna go

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.820
to the best college I possibly can

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.310
and take a different path.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.180
And so that's when I was fortunate

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.410
to be able to get into Berkeley

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.970
and all is history from there.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.400
- And then to Harvard Law School.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.540
I like to ask, my guests, what they see

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.847
as the skills and
temperament prerequisites

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.830
for the work that they have done.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.510
So in your case as a political leader,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.830
what advice do you have for students

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.960
about the skills that they should acquire

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.193
and the temperament they have to find?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.860
- Well, I think the most important

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.580
piece of advice I give to students

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.290
is if you want to run for office,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.980
if you wanna be a leader, which is great,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.890
glad that you wanna serve.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.110
But most important, if you don't have,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.900
as a personal experience,
some kind of crisis

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.900
or tragedy or a difficulty
that you have surmounted,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.090
then put yourself in a position
to see other people's pain,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.500
put yourself in a place to understand

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.180
what the thing is you
should be fixing out there.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.940
Remember, if somebody, if
a young person comes to me

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.250
and says, I wanna run for office,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.880
and I say why and they say,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.580
because I think I'd be really good at it,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.920
I'm good at speaking,
I know a lot of people,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.220
people tell me I'd be good.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.330
Like, dude, that is the
worst reason to run.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.510
It's not about you; it's
about an authentic desire

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.280
to change the world in some way,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.720
in some meaningful way.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.940
And if you don't have that as your driver,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.990
then you will never be successful or good

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.530
or have people follow you.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.730
Nobody wants to follow you
because you speak well,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.660
people wanna follow you because you are

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.170
determined authentically
to change something.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.990
And so to me, that's the most important

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.740
qualification to have.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.220
- I hear you saying that two elements

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.500
are empathy, which you just described,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.580
but also empathy and responsibility.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.970
So once you do it, what's involved here,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.630
then let's get to doing it.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.463
- Yeah.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:14.010
In fact, I was just speaking
at, I was speaking to a class,

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.020
my husband's class on leadership
at the Haas Business School

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.060
and Haas has a value on the wall,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.880
one of their values is beyond self.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.910
And if you're gonna serve
the public in some way

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.040
you have to recognize
that it must be because

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.180
you are put here on the planet

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.150
to do something more than serve yourself.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.410
You have to be about others.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.600
It's not about money,
it's not about anything

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.160
other than you're putting every ounce,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.160
every fiber of your being into
making it better for others.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.580
- When you become governor
you come in with an agenda,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.218
you have a set of plans,
but that's not the--

00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:01.636
- Not always the thing
that works out (laughs).

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:02.469
- Right.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:04.950
And so, what, you opened the
door to the governor's office

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.410
and there's crisis--
- Yeah.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.940
- After crisis.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.170
So what did it take

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.170
to be able to embrace that situation?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.343
And you say in your book,
if I can find it here,

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:26.910
a quote that you had gotten from a friend

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.910
about endure, move forward,
I can't find it right now.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.120
- [Jennifer] Yeah,
accept, adjust, advance.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.953
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:39.640
- And that's sort of
the key to what you did.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.770
- I mean, in my case, so
I was elected as governor

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.360
during a time of massive economic shift.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.790
I mean, it was really an
existential crisis for Michigan,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.950
for Michigan's economy,
for Michigan citizens,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.360
for Michigan's businesses.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.680
We were known as the automotive capital,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.590
we were known as a manufacturing state,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.430
we had seven times more manufacturing,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.470
old line manufacturing jobs

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.630
as any other state in the country.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.670
And people came, the whole migration north

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.870
was to Henry Ford's factories, right?

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.470
And so everybody came to Michigan,

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.050
everybody's families from Michigan,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.050
Dan, my husband's father
is 37 years at Ford,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.000
I mean everybody worked
in the auto industry

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.130
or in one of the suppliers, I mean,

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.000
it was just part and parcel of who we are.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.960
And so when the crisis in
manufacturing happened,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.850
obviously there had been automation

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.180
that had been displacing jobs like

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.240
in the latter part of the last century

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.580
but it accelerated so much
and when combined with trade

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.580
and automation together it
just completely decimated

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.960
so much of who we were.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.900
So that crisis was not
just a one-off crisis,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.800
that was a deep structural
change in our economy.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.630
- And we're talking about what year?

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.660
- So I was elected as governor in 2002.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.990
So there was a national recession
happening at that point,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.350
George Bush was president.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:10.350
2003, I came into office and
it only continued to get worse.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.500
In Michigan, the motto is when
the nation catches a cold,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.000
Michigan catches pneumonia,
that's because we manufacture

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.190
big consumer products like
cars; when we're in a recession,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.960
people don't buy those kind of products.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.280
However, there's pent up demand,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.330
and when you come out
of a national recession

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.770
then we used to do really well.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.070
So that cycle was something
we were used to in Michigan.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.010
But in the early 2000s, it became clear

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.020
that this was not a cyclical recession

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.000
that this was a structural change

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.760
in the real underpinnings of our economy

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.940
and that required a
different kind of leadership

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.440
which gets back to your point,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.330
the door opens, crisis hits us in a way

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.140
that we had not anticipated,
no one had anticipated,

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.100
and boom, we had to deal with it.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.600
- And you had to assume
all sorts of roles.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.083
You had to be a strategist, a negotiator,

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:08.460
a explainer to the public,
who had elected you,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.300
expecting one agenda and getting another?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.133
- Right, yeah.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:13.880
I mean, I think that's
true with any governor,

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.050
with any CEO that you have
to assume all of those roles.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.560
But it is on steroids when
you are in crisis, right,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.010
especially the part about
helping people transition

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.370
from an old economy to a new one

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.890
when their identity is tied up

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.180
in manufacturing these products

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.057
or in their father who
had worked at this factory

00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:37.090
and their grandfather had
worked at this factory

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.330
that whole identity crisis.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.440
When you tell them, you know what,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.410
those jobs are not gonna come back

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.810
and you have to be retrained,

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.780
that means you're putting the work on them

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.400
when they want you to fix it for them.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.400
And so that is a leadership moment

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.090
where you're trying to bring,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.970
to give the work back to the people

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.360
and the people don't want to
have to do that kind of work.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.850
So it's easier to explain it to them often

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:07.850
when you talk about it in
terms of their children.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.610
So you can say to somebody
who is a factory worker

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.200
who's in their late 40s, look,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.550
what was good enough for you,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.120
and you made rational choices

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.580
at the time you made those choices

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.290
to go from high school to factory,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.580
but that's not gonna be
enough for your kids.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.670
They all get it then.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.230
They see what's happening.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.400
It's just the idea of
a 40-something-year-old

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.620
going back to get retrained
and having to sit next,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.610
in a community college, to an 18-year-old

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.390
or a 19-year-old doing trigonometry

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.008
when you didn't have to take
that even in high school,

00:17:38.008 --> 00:17:41.110
it's a diminishing thing,
it's a dignity question.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.840
And so there has to be a response to that

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.310
that is more robust and more nuanced

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.600
and more dignified than we have
used in the past in the US.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.880
- And this empathy thing
becomes very important

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.890
because you have factory
after factory closing

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.100
and you have to confront the workers

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.040
and go to the factory
that's about to close

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.280
and explain to them that you care

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.973
and this is what we have to do.

00:18:09.973 --> 00:18:10.806
- Yeah.

00:18:10.806 --> 00:18:12.010
I mean, can I, I'll just tell this story

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.460
about Greenville because this,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.793
there's a little city
in Michigan, Greenville,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.330
and it happened in my first year in office

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.710
and it really became
the wake-up call for me

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.760
that things were gonna
be totally different

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.120
than what I had anticipated.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.490
So the, we had in
Michigan something called

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.670
the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.730
which is the entity that saves businesses

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.860
that works with them to come.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.730
And I got a call from the
president of that entity

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.400
at the end of my first
year in office and he said,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.900
Gov, we got a big problem.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.830
There is this little tiny community

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.230
in the middle of Michigan
called Greenville

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.870
and they are known as
the refrigerator capital

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.630
of North America because they have

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.790
the largest refrigerator
factory in North America

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.790
operated by Electrolux.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.200
This town had 8,000 people.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.170
3,000 worked at the factory.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.380
So as you can imagine,

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.440
with senior citizens
and children et cetera,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.510
it's a one company town essentially.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.950
There are suppliers and
there's the factory.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.130
And the guy from the Economic
Development Corporation

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.920
said to me, the problem
is, is that that factory

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.260
is going to move to Juarez, Mexico.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.840
And I said, are you kidding
me, I'm the new governor,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.673
there's no way.

00:19:17.673 --> 00:19:20.160
So we went, I brought my
whole cabinet to Greenville

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.310
and we put all sorts
of incentives together

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.760
to offer to the head of Electrolux,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.280
the management of Electrolux,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.930
and it was $780 million
worth of incentives

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.121
which was massive.

00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:34.840
Zero taxes for 20 years, we're gonna help

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.311
to build them a new factory all of that.

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:39.560
And they looked at our list of incentives,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.640
they went outside the room for 17 minutes,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.120
they came back in and said,
wow, this is the most generous

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.940
that any community has ever
been in trying to create jobs,

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.510
keep their jobs, but there's
nothing you can do, governor,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.820
because we can pay a $1.57
an hour in Juarez, Mexico.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.110
Now when he told us this,
this was like a nuclear bomb--

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.160
- This is the CEO.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.280
- Yeah, this was the head
of the management team

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.010
at Electrolux who had come
in for this negotiation.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.010
And, because Michigan had so
many of these kind of factories

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.390
when he said there's nothing you can do,

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.590
I thought, oh my God, what does this mean

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.930
for the rest of these
communities, these little towns

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.600
that are built up around these factories?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.830
And the month that the last refrigerator

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.665
came off the assembly
line, let me just say this,

00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:31.665
the workers at Electrolux
were so incredible

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.640
that when this was announced
that they were leaving,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640
and it was the newscasters,
there are tears everywhere.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.640
But the next day, these workers showed up

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.400
with American flags on their lapels,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.410
showed up for work on time
and they worked through

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.550
to the last refrigerator
was off the assembly line.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.110
And that month they had this big gathering

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.160
in a pavilion in Greenville
called Klacke's Orchard Pavilion

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.410
and they called this
gathering The Last Supper.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.380
And I went to it and I
went up to the first table

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.134
and it was just like this
massive community wake.

00:21:13.134 --> 00:21:16.300
Everybody was grieving and
everybody's like nudging,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.230
what are you gonna do,
what are you gonna do now,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.430
what are you gonna do now?

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.650
And I go up to the first table
and there's this guy in his,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.290
he's got a baseball cap
on and he's got tattoos

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.070
and he stands up and he says, gov,

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.570
he's got his daughters next to him,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.270
he says, I want you to meet my girls.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:35.270
He said, I have worked in
this factory for 30 years.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.470
My father worked in this factory,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.520
my grandfather worked in this factory,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.280
I went from high school to factory.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.480
I'm 48 years old.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.530
All I know is how to make refrigerators.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.330
And then he does this, he puts his hand

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.660
on his chest like this and he said,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.660
so, gov, tell me, who
is ever gonna hire me?

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.350
- So in a year you're governing

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.640
in a context where the Republicans

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.990
have set the stage.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.990
And they've been running
and winning on a platform

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.127
of cut taxes, less government and,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.750
if not eliminate, then lower the expenses

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.530
of the social net.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.793
- The social safety net.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.320
- That increases your problem.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.780
And, I guess, as I'm listening to you,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.650
you, on the one hand, have empathy,

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.800
but in the back of your
head you must have a theory

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.630
of what's causing all of this.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.463
- Well, yeah.

00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:42.000
I mean, I will say this.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.020
I mean, I know that it has to
do with globalization, right?

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.780
Obviously they're going to Mexico

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.053
because they can and it's cheaper.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.100
I used to campaign on NAFTA and CAFTA

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.310
have given us the SHAFTA.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.100
So I know why Donald Trump
won in states like Michigan

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.650
because there are the residue,
this hulking residues,

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.750
or vacant land from people from factories

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.620
that have been cleared out, right?

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.610
So I know that.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.290
So a lot of this had to do
less with the state budget

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.390
than with external
factors that were global.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.920
However, because these
factories were leaving

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.890
and people were finding
themselves without work,

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.280
that had a huge impact on the state budget

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.270
'cause state budgets are countercyclical.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.640
And obviously when unemployment is high,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.960
the needs are high but
the income to the state,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.910
the tax receipts are lower.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.910
So what do you do in that situation?

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.350
And when I was elected,
I say I'm a Democrat

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.650
and I was elected with a Republican House

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.650
and a Republican Senate, a
Republican Supreme Court,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.070
a Republican Attorney General

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.610
and a Republican Secretary of State

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.640
so I was the only Democrat.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.210
It required compromise.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.440
I get the idea of cutting taxes

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.960
to try to make yourself irresistible,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.470
but our corporate tax
rate was not that high.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.360
It wasn't corporate taxes
that caused Electrolux

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.490
or any of the other factories to go;

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.280
it was because of wages, honestly.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.440
And automation, obviously, eventually

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.870
played a big role too,
not in the early part

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.870
of the 21st century, but
certainly in the past decade

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.540
or so it's really played
a much bigger role.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.690
I say all of that to say
that the state responses

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.690
to something like this are
really, it's very difficult

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.711
'cause what you wanna do is invest great,

00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:38.340
more robustly in training
for those workers

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.040
but you don't have the
money to be able to do that

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.960
when all you're trying to do,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.280
you got your finger in the dike

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.040
to at least not cut K through 12 education

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.210
or not cut healthcare
for vulnerable citizens.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.900
It is a very difficult time.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.010
So as governor, even
though I'm a Democrat,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.430
I ended up cutting more
out of state government

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.550
than any governor in
the history of Michigan,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.370
but as a proportion, than
any governor in the country

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.790
during that recession.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.880
We ended up by 25% cutting
all the state departments,

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.070
closing down prisons, defunding the arts,

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.450
defunding all of these things.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.570
In fact, I went around to the state,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.400
in every media market of the state,

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.750
and I did these town halls where

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.330
I had the local station select people

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.720
who were representative of areas

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.410
where state government was facing cuts,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:37.410
students, teachers, prison
workers, sheriffs, et cetera,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.320
and I gave them all
clickers and I said to them,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.180
okay, if I'm gonna, if you
have to make your first cut

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.940
or place your first
dollar, where would it be,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.390
and I'd give them a series of choices.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.380
Would you defund the arts or
would you defund libraries?

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.830
Would you defund libraries,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.120
would you defund higher education?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.540
Would you defund higher education,

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.150
would you defund prisons?

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.280
Would you do higher education
versus K through 12?

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.470
You have to have people realize

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.220
what the series of trade-offs are.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.940
And so I took all of the results

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.650
of those essential focus
groups back to the legislature

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.200
'cause I also invited the state reps

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.870
that represent those areas and I gave them

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.010
what the citizens wanted.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.990
And the citizens basically said,

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.990
if you have to cut, cut,
but don't cut K through 12

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.270
and don't cut healthcare
for vulnerable citizens,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.447
those two things.

00:26:29.447 --> 00:26:32.470
And I'm pleased that
despite all the massive cuts

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.590
those two things I was able to preserve,

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.530
but the only way to do it in
the face of all of the crisis

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.860
was to be able to go to the people.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.860
- But you came in knowing
that retraining and education

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.700
were an important plan in your platform.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.810
- Yes, absolutely.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.520
Those were things that

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.140
I came in knowing.
- Yeah.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.620
- But we hadn't faced the crisis yet.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.150
Unfortunately, so I was governor also

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.140
when the auto industry
went bankrupt, right,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.580
so our major, and before that,

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.230
the suppliers to the auto
industry went bankrupt.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.560
And during the Great Recession in 2008,

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:17.110
between December of 2008 and June of 2009,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.080
I got 1,018 WARN Act notices

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.590
and WARN Act notices, for your viewers,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.290
are the notices that a
governor gets and a mayor gets

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.310
when a company is about
to do a mass layoff.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.560
So 1,018 companies doing mass layoffs

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.610
during that six-month period.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.030
So we were completely in the soup.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.900
So, fortunately, Obama was elected

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.140
and I was able to go to the
Department of Labor and said,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.240
can you give us a waiver
on all of the monies

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.590
that we would normally get,
'cause we have to craft

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.740
an emergency training
program for our workers

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.890
and we also have to work with
the Department of Commerce

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.360
to get international
investment in Michigan

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.640
'cause you have to have jobs
to train people for, right?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.680
So it was a simultaneous
diversify the economy,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.790
bring in new kinds of jobs,
train people for those jobs

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.250
while not cutting these essential services

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.093
that keep people afloat.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.070
- You were governing now
which was very different

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.460
from campaigning.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.340
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.340
- So (laughs) talk a little
about that dichotomy.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.660
And, importantly, when you're
running for reelection,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.060
you're running against Mr. DeVos--

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.893
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

00:28:31.893 --> 00:28:33.043
- Who is, I guess, the husband--

00:28:33.043 --> 00:28:34.279
- The husband of Betsy DeVos, yeah.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:36.180
- Of Betsy DeVos.
- Yeah.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.900
- And the founder or the president of--

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.240
- Amway.
- Amway.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.170
So basically you wear a very different hat

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.520
when you, you have to.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.390
- Oh, for sure.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.380
I mean, you campaign in
poetry, you govern in pros,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.300
the old saying goes.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.450
And honestly, you really
don't know what it's like,

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.560
when you're campaigning
you're motivating people,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.840
you're enthusiastic,
you have these visions

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.840
of what you'll be able to achieve
and sometimes the reality,

00:29:02.864 --> 00:29:05.190
the rubber meets the road
when you walk in the door.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.180
So two years after I was elected governor

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.980
and all of this stuff
had started to happen,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.140
all this crazy started to kick in,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.320
I wasn't even into my third year,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.570
governor terms at four years,

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.610
but Dick DeVos declared that
he was gonna run against me

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.320
because all of this stuff
was happening, right?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.670
Now anybody with a brain understands

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.033
that a governor doesn't
control the national economy,

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.850
the auto industry and the suppliers

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.740
are going to into bankruptcy,
that's not a governor's,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.420
the governor doesn't do much about it

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.690
unless the governor actively
did something to promote that

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.070
but that wasn't obviously the case.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.700
But nonetheless you're
up against somebody,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.420
I was up against somebody who
had millions and millions,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.710
I mean, they're billionaires,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.740
millions and millions of dollars to spend

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.250
to persuade the citizens that somehow

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:59.250
Michigan's structural changes
were the new governor's fault

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.010
and so that was a really
challenging moment.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.320
But the good news is, from my perspective,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.750
is that I won the reelection and I won

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:10.880
with the largest number of votes

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.290
ever cast in Michigan's history,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.991
and partly because Mr. DeVos himself

00:30:14.991 --> 00:30:18.860
had a factory in Michigan
that he shut down

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.510
and opened up one in China

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.880
and people saw that as outsourcing,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.960
Amway stands for American Way,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.330
American Way jobs to China

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.020
and that was not readily forgiven.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.960
- Social media wasn't a
factor yet, I assume--

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.870
- Not quite so much now.
- Yeah.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.080
And how does that change all this?

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.856
- Oh, it's so, yeah.

00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:43.630
- Doesn't it lower the standards even more

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.263
than they are already--
- When you say standards,

00:30:45.263 --> 00:30:46.203
what do you mean standards?

00:30:46.203 --> 00:30:50.060
- I mean the standards of
civility in campaigning.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.210
- Yeah, I think that,
certainly what we're seeing

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.060
it's a much more crass
world because perhaps

00:30:57.504 --> 00:30:59.550
anybody can play, right?

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.930
I think that there's some real
beauty in the democratization

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.930
of political discourse because
everybody can have a voice.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.393
You just wanna make sure
that people, that some,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.860
I don't know, some sense of
standards are, some civility,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.240
is upheld and I worry, I mean, personally,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.810
I worry that the example that's
being set in the White House

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.810
just degrades our desire
for the truth, for example,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.510
I mean this relative
truth, alternative facts,

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.190
it's just so disturbing to me.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.340
I wonder after we're done
with this period, this term,

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.620
will we get back as a nation to realizing

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.790
that some facts really are facts.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.460
You know what, this really is a glass.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.833
It is not a sponge.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.310
And it's not relative.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.500
So I hope that we will get
back to the notion of honor

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.687
and of truth and of all that,

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:05.990
but maybe that's just a
quaint thing on my part.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.270
- Looking back in
dealing with these crises

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.540
and dealing with this campaign

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.430
where people are coming at you

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:18.430
with the strangest charges,
what are you most proud of

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.300
both as a governor and as a campaigner?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.600
- Well, two different, that's
two different questions.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.230
- Yeah.
- As a campaigner,

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.940
I was really proud of
the campaign that we ran

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.320
because it was really was about values.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.810
When I campaigned it
was, I sat down before

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.530
and I try to figure out, all right, what,

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.220
really what do I stand
for, what are the values

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.100
that I stand for in order
to be able to explain

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.500
what citizens will get through governance?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.880
So it was integrity, it was creativity,

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.570
it was excellence and it was inclusion

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.390
those were the four values I ran on.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.100
When I did fundraisers I would
go through the four values

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.790
and I would say, here's what I'm gonna do

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.320
that will be an example of those.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.020
And what's your return on investment

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.440
for investing in this
campaign is that you will

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.560
make sure that you have someone

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.380
who is relying on values,
that's a good return

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.390
on your investment.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.990
So that's campaigning.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.170
It's a different scenario.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.470
I mean, you bring those
values into government

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.460
but it's a different scenario.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.560
You can't just govern up in the air.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.390
The reality on the ground
is much different now.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.330
What I'm really proud of is that we did,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.490
we were focused on three things:

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.150
diversifying the economy,
educating our citizens

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.210
and protecting people as we transition

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.430
from this old economy to a new one.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.200
So I'm really proud of the fact
that we were able to start,

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.380
you can't finish everything
in two short terms,

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.900
but start the ball rolling
to bring in new sectors

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.630
in Michigan and other, we wanted to

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.530
support the manufacturing sector

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.850
but also recognize that you cannot balance

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.090
a state's economy on one leg,

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.790
you have to bring in other legs.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.000
And so we did that.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.480
The effort to try to get more
young people to go to college,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.660
our goal was eventually
to double the number

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.050
of college graduates in Michigan,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.230
that would not be able to have happened

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.530
in my term as governor,
but we wanted to get people

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.710
knowing that college was super important

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.160
or getting a certification
or getting something

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.650
that will enable you and seeing education

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:18.900
as a lifelong thing and not just something

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.910
that you do before you're 22.

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:24.270
So those kinds of things, I'm really proud

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.860
that we set the ball rolling.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.720
And by the time my last term came around

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.550
and the last couple of years
after the Great Recession,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.790
we actually had the fastest growth

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.100
of any state in the
country according to Gallup

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.500
in terms of our economy 'cause
we really took advantage

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.660
of the crisis to bring
in a lot of investment,

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.180
a lot of international investment.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.120
I did 11 trips overseas to bring in

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.953
international investments.

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:49.786
- And we should mention that

00:34:49.786 --> 00:34:53.400
because part of your
campaign hat was useful

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.320
as you went abroad to attract foreign--

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.250
- Totally.
- Investment

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.083
in foreign business.

00:34:58.083 --> 00:35:00.160
- Right, selling Michigan overseas.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.460
I mean, Michigan is an amazing state.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.640
it's a beautiful state.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.070
It has more miles of shoreline
than any state in the country

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.400
even more than California.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.810
People might not realize that.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.070
I mean, it's a beautiful state.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.040
So being able to sell the
state to people and saying,

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.210
hey, let Michigan be your gateway,

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.640
if you wanna open your doors in the US

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.640
let Michigan be your gateway to that;

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.730
we're in the middle of the country,

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.350
we make things, we have
more engineers per capita

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.130
than any state in the
country, that kind of thing.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.000
So it allowed me to be able to do that.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.890
I mean, one of the areas
that we wanted to move into

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.277
was in the clean energy economy

00:35:34.277 --> 00:35:35.820
and one of the components of that

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.090
was making auto 2.0 which
is the electric vehicle,

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.500
so we were a little ahead of our time.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.910
But I went to Korea, I went to Japan

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.980
to get the components for the battery,

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.420
for the lithium ion battery.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.640
So we needed anode,
cathode, separator material,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.130
electrolyte, we had to
have those suppliers

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.250
inside of the state and we
created a whole supply chain

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.580
to be able to do that.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.400
So those kind of things
I'm really proud of

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.929
and they've lasted so that's
really important (chuckles).

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:09.929
- In your Weinstock
lecture, you talked about AI

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.060
and employment and workers and so on.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.310
And I'm curious, because
this tenure as governor

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.600
and now you're at Berkeley
has really prepared you

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.860
to think about how we
integrate technology,

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.037
not run away from it.
- Right.

00:36:29.037 --> 00:36:31.330
- And I want you to
break that down a little

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.440
at wearing your political hat,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.740
what are the sorts of things
that you have to think about

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.460
if we're gonna bring AI to the table?

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.530
Retraining, education, what?

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:47.530
- Right, so there's
been, there's been this,

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.160
in the industrial Midwest,
there has been really,

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.210
the villain has been China.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.460
It's not necessarily been robotics.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.320
Although people are
starting to see this now.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.090
It's easier to campaign against China,

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.010
I mean you saw the president
do that during his campaign,

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.070
than it is against robots.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.020
People see the benefit of robots.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.430
They don't wanna have to lift heavy stuff.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:17.430
They don't want, they wanna
learn how to program the robots.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.270
They wanna know how to
maintain a robotic line.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.170
And so the idea that you
can have a better job,

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.320
a more well-paying job
without breaking your back

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.120
is a really, and you can
still work in a factory.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.560
Now there may be fewer of those jobs,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.650
those specific jobs inside of a factory,

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.690
however, those jobs will be better paying.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.240
That's attractive to people

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.410
because they could see themselves in that.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.610
So the only question to me at that point,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.890
not just to me but to everybody,

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.230
is how do you train people who
haven't had a college degree,

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.890
and it made sense for
them not to at the time,

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.520
how do you train them to be
able to work with the technology

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.530
and the technology
enhances their capabilities

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.480
rather than having them
see it as a threat.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.830
That to me, we can actually use AI

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.190
to help retrain people in a way

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.210
that allows them to have that dignity.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.340
There are number of examples of this

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.240
that are currently in use.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.672
For example, the Department of Defense

00:38:18.672 --> 00:38:22.240
has deployed this AI technology

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.260
where they're training
these naval officers

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.440
using something called digital tutor

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.880
where you, the tutor assess where you are

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.340
and assesses how you
learn and then takes them

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.440
to the next level and allows them to do it

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.350
at their own speed and their own way

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.890
in a way while they're learning,

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.690
while the machine is
learning how they learn best.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.720
The results of those have been astonishing

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.900
and astonishingly successful.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.870
So for people in the industrial Midwest,

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.130
who have been displaced like this,

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:57.747
this to me requires
creative federal response

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.870
or it could be a state by state response.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.101
I would love to see a
competition be issued

00:39:04.101 --> 00:39:07.780
for apps that develop
or for training modules

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.800
that are developed using AI to get someone

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.313
to be able to work with AI.

00:39:12.313 --> 00:39:14.320
I mean, that is a great response.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.390
I also think that our
workforce development

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.580
or workforce training
dollars which are so terribly

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.830
ineffectively spent right now.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.310
We have something called the
Workforce Investment Act,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.190
the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.030
they're terrible, the
results are terrible.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.706
Studies have shown that
they're not effective.

00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:34.200
We spend billions on that.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.130
We could redirect that money
to help subsidize wages

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:41.360
during a training period so
that somebody is training

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.900
for a job that they know
is gonna be happening.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.620
On-the-job training rather
than in the classroom training

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.760
for those kind of workers is
by far the most effective.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.100
Right now, we pay unemployment to people

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.870
to go and look for a job.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.300
What if we paid unemployment to people

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.790
partly subsidizing those wages as well?

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.870
Flip it, help to
subsidize their employment

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.470
during that training process,

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.250
give the employer a
chance to look at them,

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.170
give them a chance to
look at the employer,

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.140
have them gain a skill and at the end

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.950
of the unemployment period

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.790
the employer can decide up or down,

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.470
the employee can decide up or down

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.880
but they'll have gained
a skill and have wages.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.370
So there's a, I just think we gotta turn

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.150
the way we've been doing
things on its head.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:30.150
- And you need a vigorous
social network in,

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:35.140
a social net in this context,
right, for this transition

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.710
whether it's tuition
support, whether, whatever.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.160
- Yeah, I think that
tuition support can happen

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.610
by repurposing this workforce,

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.610
the training dollars we currently spend

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.400
that are ineffective.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.890
The safety net can happen
by repurposing unemployment

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.570
and what we are paying for

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.800
when we pay people's unemployment, right?

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.340
I mean you have to have some unemployment

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.010
that is there not paying for training

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.170
but a large portion of it could
be used to upskill people.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.980
There are experiments
that have been undertaken

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.890
in other countries.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.530
For example, in Singapore,
they have decided

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.000
that they're gonna put $500 in an account,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.850
in a lifelong learning account,

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.410
for every citizen of
Singapore over 25 years old

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.760
and they're gonna do this on annual basis.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.810
They just started it so
they haven't evaluated it,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.796
but the purpose is, and
Singapore as a state,

00:41:28.796 --> 00:41:32.420
as a geopolitical entity has been viewed

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.360
as the most effectively
run entity in the country,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.530
in the whole city state,
in the whole world,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.260
they decided that it's
important for their citizens

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.610
to continually learn
and to have the freedom

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.040
to have a portable account
that will enable them

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.320
to upskill themselves.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.660
We should be thinking of stuff like that

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.150
in this country as well.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.150
Education should not be seen
as K through 12 or K through,

00:41:59.927 --> 00:42:01.900
whether it's undergraduate or graduate,

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.240
it's gotta be a lifelong thing.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.290
And it can't just be in
the setting of a university

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.730
or a community college, it has to be,

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.710
there has to be broader
ways of looking at it.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.100
- I would like now to talk a little

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:18.097
about the two-party structure
and get your assessment

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.140
of the Republican and Democratic

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.890
ability to deal with
these kinds of problems.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:36.320
And to the extent that
the Republicans fail,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.400
why have they dominated the discourse

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.263
on what government should be doing?

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.710
- I think the president has
been extremely effective

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.330
at communicating to people
who have felt left behind.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.440
When he talks about the forgotten American

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.440
even though he's never
experienced any of that himself,

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.020
during the campaign he went to a farm,

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.290
an off the track, I can't remember,

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:09.680
it was a Southern state, I can't remember

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.480
where exactly it was,
but he went to this farm

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.540
and all of the pundit class,

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.920
the chattering class were saying,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.103
why would he go way over
there, that's crazy.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.950
People came for hundreds of miles

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.840
in this rural place to see him

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.210
because he specifically
chose to go to a place

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:34.210
that was off the beaten path
and it was a huge signal

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.550
that I'm gonna see you.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.620
To me, this is where Democrats

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.860
'cause traditionally
Democrats have been about

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.760
the forgotten American, the little guy,

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.410
the person who doesn't have money,

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.500
the person whose not got cloud.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.130
The fact that we've allowed Donald Trump

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.170
to be the champion for that when he

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.680
still does not personally
embody it is amazing.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.363
Now, so he has had a specific skill,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.710
the Republican party I think
doesn't have that same skill.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.370
I think he's sui generis.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.870
And so the question
is, who's gonna be able

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.703
to take that mantle?

00:44:07.703 --> 00:44:09.920
Mike Pence would never be
able to do that, right?

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.930
That's just not.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.747
So to me, as you set up a 2020 battle,

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.360
the Democrats need to put someone up

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.500
who is authentically speaking
to people, all people,

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.959
it's gotta be about the great word all,

00:44:26.959 --> 00:44:29.480
and you gotta have somebody who,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.940
young people who are here, it was in,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.130
I was having dinner last night
with a student at Berkeley

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:37.810
and she was saying, she
was so passionate about it,

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:41.550
we are craving authenticity, don't BS us,

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.900
don't give us this political speak.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.200
This is why social media is
so empowering for so many

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.380
'cause it allows people
to speak their mind

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.203
without having to censor all of the,

00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:57.760
to put your words in
the most political box.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.760
The political, the people who are doing

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.270
the strategy for politics
over the past 30 years

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:12.470
are freaking out because
nothing that is true in the past

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.650
is gonna be true in 2020.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.570
That usual strategy just does not work.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.560
So people are encouraged to be,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.450
you can make a mistake
now, you can admit it,

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:23.990
you can fess up, you can say,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.690
hey, in the past, I smoked
pot or whatever it was.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.790
You can admit to having
gone through something.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.210
You can admit, I mean,
Stacey Abrams in Georgia

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.480
admitted to having had some
difficulty with her finances.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.100
There are just, there's
so much you can admit to

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.710
and just be honest about.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.170
And that next generation, the Millennials,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.900
the Gen Z-ers, are craving people

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.720
who are just gonna be honest

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.960
and not run away from being human.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.990
And so I think whoever
it is that is president

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.620
has to be courageous enough,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.010
on the Democractic side at least,

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.480
or in running against Donald Trump

00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.780
you have to be courageous enough

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.720
to be authentic and to speak to all people

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.070
including those that are
off the beaten track,

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.720
including those that the
political advisers would suggest,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.790
oh, you should ignore
them because they're not

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.370
gonna vote for you anyway
or they never vote,

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.460
so don't waste your time.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.890
That's not gonna work anymore.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:20.890
- If you compare the
policies of the Democrats

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.660
in terms of, with the Republicans,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.550
in terms of having a
rational worked out policy

00:46:29.582 --> 00:46:32.880
of what should be done
about the integration of AI,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.870
hypothetically, let's
say, then how do you make

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.210
that understandable to people?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.980
In other words, how does that interface

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.930
with authenticity and the personality

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.760
of the bearer of that plan?

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.310
'Cause clearly in the last election

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:57.490
there was no impact in terms of

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.360
what was the laid out
program by the Clintons.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.010
- Yeah, no, and I was on Hillary
Clinton's transition team

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:07.180
and on her policy group and
she had a book this thick

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.360
of very specific policies
including how to retrain for AI

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.860
and how it's integrated
in a way that creates jobs

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.430
rather than takes them
away and all of that.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.603
And I think Democrats have got,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.010
we always end up electing,
or at least nominating,

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.990
somebody who's super smart

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.010
and whose got the best policy books.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.850
And so Hillary Clinton or
John Kerry or Michael Dukakis

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:36.340
or Al Gore all super
brilliant people, right,

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.530
but if you can't translate
what's in those books

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.540
to people's hearts and speak to their guts

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.660
then your policy book means nothing.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.270
So you have to be able to tell stories

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.740
that resonate with
people using real people.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.476
And so if you don't, I mean
this is true as governor,

00:47:57.476 --> 00:48:00.700
I mean it's why everybody
always bring somebody

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.510
to the State of the Union
to the State of the State

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.670
'cause you, the way you can say,

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.210
this is why my policy is gonna work

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.210
'cause it worked for this
real person who's like you

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:13.910
and to give people hope that
something like that will work.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.140
So to me, you have to have somebody

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.870
that speaks to people's heads and hearts

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:22.830
and that's a challenge,
that's the magical challenge.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:26.310
Especially when you're
talking about AI, people,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.480
if I went to Michigan now
and even use the words AI,

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.080
people would know what I'm talking about.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.860
If I say robots, people
know what I'm talking about.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.150
So we have to be able to have
language that is accessible

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:38.170
and take down the fear level and say,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.190
you know what, this is
gonna create more jobs

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.080
than it's gonna take away.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.920
Yeah, the taxi drivers
and the truck drivers

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.080
may eventually have their jobs impacted,

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.880
but can you imagine this
whole spade of businesses

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.060
that could be growing up around this?

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.380
I mean, giving people some imagination,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.010
giving them seeds of hope I
think is really important.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:02.640
- And what will make for
that possible candidate?

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.120
Background, personality, obviously smarts,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.100
the Democrats--
- Yeah.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.250
- Don't have a problem with smarts.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.403
- Yeah, I think definitely
smarts but more so.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.890
It's not personality.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.200
It's really this quality of authenticity

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.200
causing people's hearts
to soar in some way,

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.360
the ability to speak to aspiration.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.210
I mean, Obama did this so well,

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.510
Bill Clinton did this so well.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:37.450
So whoever it is, it cannot
be somebody who's robotic,

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:40.000
it's gotta be somebody who gets it

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.220
and gets the deep, the
deep personal crisis

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.190
that people feel when they see

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:51.550
that vacant factory on their corner or,

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.780
I mean pick any other
crisis out there, right,

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.980
the healthcare situation,
a mom whose child

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.930
has sickle cell anemia and
she can't afford the copay,

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.650
somebody who has seen and has been there,

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.930
somebody who's gone
through those experiences,

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.710
to me, will be the best candidate.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.870
- One last question
requiring a brief answer.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.400
Looking back at your career, do you have

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.750
a single piece of advice
for students or people,

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.210
or young people planning
to go into politics?

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.910
- Well, one, if they're planning
to go into politics, great.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.570
My best advice really is for them

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:31.140
to serve before you go in a role

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:35.190
that enables you to see people

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.660
who have gone through
crisis or who are in crisis

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.720
so that you can take
their stories with you.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.360
- Well, on that note,
Jennifer, thank you very much

00:50:46.268 --> 00:50:47.250
for taking the time to be here.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.420
- You're such a great questioner.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.405
It's great to be here,

00:50:49.405 --> 00:50:50.350
thank you.
- Thank you.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.450
And thank you very much for joining us

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.623
for this Conversation with History.
