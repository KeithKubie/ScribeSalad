00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
The first question, the best-case running time for a given input size is no longer

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.970
than the best measured time for each algorithm.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.830
This is true and to think about this, all you really need to do is realize that our definition--

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.240
the best-case running time is better than all other possible running time.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.480
If there's one smaller than it, well, it's not really the best is it, and you can think

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.730
of the same thing for the worst-case running time to the second one, which is also true.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.910
The worst-case running time for given input size is at least the worst measured time for each algorithm

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.110
because if there is a worst or longer measured time, then the worst-case running time--

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.260
well then it's not worst is it.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.930
Now, for the third question, algorithm beta is the fastest for all inputs.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.570
This is actually false, and even though it's actually true for all of the inputs that we tested,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.540
it might not be true for much smaller inputs--for example, n=1 or 2.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.129
We can't say that it's the fastest for all inputs because well we haven't tested it on all inputs.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.580
It might very well be the case but in order to say that we'll actually

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.860
need to test it and that's not really feasible.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.400
And for the final question, what else can for smaller inputs the algorithm with exponential behavior

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.640
is faster than the algorithm with polynomial behavior, and this is actually true.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.700
If you got alpha and gamma, alpha being the exponential algorithm and gamma being

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.170
the polynomial one, actually is faster--25 minutes is quite a bit faster than 500.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.450
So this is actually true and it's interesting to see that sometimes for small inputs

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.740
and exponential algorithm isn't really that big of a deal.
