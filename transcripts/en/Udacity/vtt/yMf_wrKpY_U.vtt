00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.270
Welcome to the DevOps Nanodegree.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.790
I'm Julia,
a Project Manager here at Udacity.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.520
I will be guiding you through your first
steps in learning more about DevOps.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.500
DevOps developed organically from people
who are at the forefront of developing

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.310
software for the Internet.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.410
These people came from all
different types of backgrounds.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.500
Some might have a similar
background to you and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.790
some might be completely different.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.730
But they all have a single goal
to improve collaboration and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.770
efficiency throughout
their organizations.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.080
DevOps is a practice that emerged from
agile development and lean management.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.020
One thing all of these systems have
in common is continuous improvement.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.900
DevOps is not just about buying
software or holding a one day training.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.600
It's a journey that will take time,
effort and commitment.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.700
You'll need to balance the needs of
many different groups within your

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.190
organization as you implement
wide scale cultural changes.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.090
Well, it's up to you to take the first
steps, we will be here to support and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.369
guide you along the way.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.320
In the process we'll look at tools
that can help you manage some of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.600
the technical challenges.

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:12.962
Although DevOps won't magically
solve all of your problems,

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:17.830
following DevOps practices will help
your team to improve collaboration and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.500
work flow throughout the whole
software development life cycle.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.790
DevOps did not become popular because
somebody forced its adoption.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.820
It's popular because it works and
it makes teams and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.230
companies more successful.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.840
Excited to learn more?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.540
Let's jump in.
