00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Well I was sitting down watching TV and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.500
the neighbor had knocked on the door and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.690
told me I moved your car for you and you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
need to get out of here and so I ran to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.720
the door and I saw how high the waters

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.750
were and reminded me like the Red Sea of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.210
the water just coming down with full

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.040
force and so I turned to Michael my son

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.420
and told him you better get out of here

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.320
and told his sister we got to go. We didn't

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.420
have time to get a coat, a hat, whatever we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.840
had on we had to run honestly and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
quickly for our lives. In the midst of that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.230
water, nothing mattered to me: the house didn't

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.360
matter, the car didn't matter, it was just life.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
I wanted them to be safe. By the goodness of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160
God, we made it.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.500
Being in high school when all of Sandy was going on

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.380
when I had to still be a student, still go to my extra

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.460
curricular activities, still had to go to work

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.060
and I was considering whether or not I'd still

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.210
pursue Harvard, I didn't think of it as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.150
an extra burden. Hurricane Sandy allowed

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
me to electrify my interest and make it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.360
so that everything that I did meant all

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.020
the more. It taught me resilience, it taught me that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.280
you have to press on because people are

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.790
counting on you and you should be

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.300
counting on yourself.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.700
Michael knew he

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.620
wanted to come to harvard at the age of 10

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.500
I remember him coming into my room

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.869
and he'd say, mommy I figured it out. Harvard's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.329
not too far from here. Annual tuition of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.680
this school is just about as much income

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.409
my family has. I learned about the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.030
whole need-based financial aid that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.120
Harvard has, and that basically charged

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.700
the rest of my time in high school

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.820
the minute I figured out that this

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.320
was a thing actually can happen.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.800
I had conceptions of it, this idea that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.000
Harvard people are like sort of snooty

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.069
and preppy and stuck up. None of that was

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.760
true. The best thing about being here was

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.049
the people and the interactions, the

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.209
conversations, understanding the world

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.700
through others. It is not even

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.470
necessarily facilitated that I grow but

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.150
it is actually the catalyst of my growth

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.800
being here.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020
I had a leak in my house on

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.879
the roof you know when it was an

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.790
older house and I said, I need this to get

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.940
fixed, so Sandy took out the old and I

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.060
believe that if you lose something you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.019
will recover greater things. Every moment

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.530
in life counts. Flat out I want to sing I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.440
want to sing, that's plan A. Plan B is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.790
going to law school. It's something I've

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.170
always wanted to do. I find law so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.090
intriguing that I feel like that would

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.340
be the best medium for me to to give

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.950
back to the rest of the world. When I'm

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.870
talking to Michael, Michael talks about

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.680
his dreams. He thinks ahead, he's a planner.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.049
If there's anything that I learned from

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.930
being homeless for 14 months it was that,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.359
you know, you got to find joy and you

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.620
gotta find joy in everything. In

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.620
everything. I am taking for granted any

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.840
moment that I've been given because

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.630
nothing short of a blessing that a lot

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.880
of people want that not everyone can

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.280
have and yeah, I feel like all those

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.319
things sort of informed how I existed

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.470
Harvard and how I will persist through

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.000
time post-Harvard.
