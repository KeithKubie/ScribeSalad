00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let me introduce you to the mystery test function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is a function which returns either pass or fail.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We would like to use fuzzer input in order to make it fail.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here's some fuzzer input, which we can pass to mystery test.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's see where they passes or fails on that. Well, for this input, it passes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We now, however, is again a fuzzer generated input for which mystery test now fails.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The first input passes, but the second input fails.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So you wonder what it is in this input that makes a function fail.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
How can you find this out straightforward--by using delta debugging in order to simplify the first input

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
such that you know which part of the first input actually causes mystery test to fail.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And here is programming exercise, find the minimal input that causes mystery test to fail,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and for this, use a fuzzer such that you'll find input that causes mystery test to fail.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And once through fuzzing you found such an input, use delta debugging in order to minimize the input.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Over to you.
