hello everyone so today at the keynote
you probably heard that we are unifying

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
you probably heard that we are unifying
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.330
you probably heard that we are unifying
the developer experience for instant

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
the developer experience for instant
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.730
the developer experience for instant
apps and Android app bundles and so my

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
apps and Android app bundles and so my
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.170
apps and Android app bundles and so my
colleague Ben and I are going to talk to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
colleague Ben and I are going to talk to
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090
colleague Ben and I are going to talk to
you a little bit about how that works

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
you a little bit about how that works
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090
you a little bit about how that works
from the developer perspective so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
from the developer perspective so
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.160
from the developer perspective so
instant apps it's a technology that we

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
instant apps it's a technology that we
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470
instant apps it's a technology that we
introduced a little over two years ago

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
introduced a little over two years ago
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.560
introduced a little over two years ago
at Google i/o and it lets you give you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
at Google i/o and it lets you give you
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.830
at Google i/o and it lets you give you
users and native Android app experience

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
users and native Android app experience
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.709
users and native Android app experience
without them having to explicitly go and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
without them having to explicitly go and
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.319
without them having to explicitly go and
install your app from the Play Store now

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
install your app from the Play Store now
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299
install your app from the Play Store now
how that works is you split up your app

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
how that works is you split up your app
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.750
how that works is you split up your app
into smaller pieces called features and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760
into smaller pieces called features and
 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.090
into smaller pieces called features and
the user can reach those via a link a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
the user can reach those via a link a
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490
the user can reach those via a link a
URL and also via other means as we'll

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
URL and also via other means as we'll
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580
URL and also via other means as we'll
see later in this presentation now to

see later in this presentation now to
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220
see later in this presentation now to
get your app small enough and to be able

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
get your app small enough and to be able
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.490
get your app small enough and to be able
to launch it instantly instant apps for

to launch it instantly instant apps for
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049
to launch it instantly instant apps for
the first time used a technology that we

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
the first time used a technology that we
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880
the first time used a technology that we
introduced in Android 5 lollipop

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
introduced in Android 5 lollipop
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280
introduced in Android 5 lollipop
that's called split apks now with

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
that's called split apks now with
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.429
that's called split apks now with
configuration split apks Play Store was

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
configuration split apks Play Store was
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740
configuration split apks Play Store was
able to deliver the smallest most

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
able to deliver the smallest most

apks locally bundled them in a zip file
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240
apks locally bundled them in a zip file
called an instant bundle and then you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
called an instant bundle and then you
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740
called an instant bundle and then you
upload that to the Play Store so the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
upload that to the Play Store so the
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.569
upload that to the Play Store so the
Play Store can choose from the set of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
Play Store can choose from the set of
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.840
Play Store can choose from the set of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
apks and delivered them to devices now
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.260
apks and delivered them to devices now
to do that the developer had to do some

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
to do that the developer had to do some
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719
to do that the developer had to do some
significant refactoring in your apps so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
significant refactoring in your apps so
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520
significant refactoring in your apps so
the project structure of an instant app

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
the project structure of an instant app
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.670
the project structure of an instant app
as it looked - one year ago look

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
as it looked - one year ago look
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530
as it looked - one year ago look
probably something like this first of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
probably something like this first of
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200
probably something like this first of
all you had to take all of your base

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
all you had to take all of your base
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120
all you had to take all of your base
application code and move it from the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
application code and move it from the
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.880
application code and move it from the
application module to a base feature

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890
application module to a base feature
 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
application module to a base feature
then you had to split your app into

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
then you had to split your app into
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.760
then you had to split your app into
future modules containing the various

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
future modules containing the various
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709
future modules containing the various
features in your app or normally we

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
features in your app or normally we
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.300
features in your app or normally we
would call them screens or activities

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
would call them screens or activities
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.169
would call them screens or activities
and then you had these two almost empty

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
and then you had these two almost empty
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600
and then you had these two almost empty
dummy modules application and instant

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
dummy modules application and instant
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.890
dummy modules application and instant
app for building the artifact

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
app for building the artifact
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.869
app for building the artifact
that we need so the apk for application

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879
that we need so the apk for application
 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.819
that we need so the apk for application
that would be the installed application

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829
that would be the installed application
 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.429
that would be the installed application
and he used to have and then the instant

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439
and he used to have and then the instant
 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.679
and he used to have and then the instant
app is a bundle that would contain all

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689
app is a bundle that would contain all
 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.119
app is a bundle that would contain all
the split apks that you upload to a

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129
the split apks that you upload to a
 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.160
the split apks that you upload to a
separate track in the Play Store now

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
separate track in the Play Store now
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.009
separate track in the Play Store now
this was not ideal as I said it required

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
this was not ideal as I said it required
 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.809
this was not ideal as I said it required
significant work from you your project

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819
significant work from you your project
 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.740
significant work from you your project
no longer look simple same time this

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
no longer look simple same time this
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.349
no longer look simple same time this
year we introduced a new publishing

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359
year we introduced a new publishing
 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.789
year we introduced a new publishing
format for Android apps called the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799
format for Android apps called the
 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.940
format for Android apps called the
Android app bundle or AAA B now this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950
Android app bundle or AAA B now this
 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.559
Android app bundle or AAA B now this
format preserves some more information

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
format preserves some more information
 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.479
format preserves some more information
about what's happening in your project

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489
about what's happening in your project
 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.250
about what's happening in your project
it contains some metadata about

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
it contains some metadata about
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.259
it contains some metadata about
targeting of the resources native

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269
targeting of the resources native
 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.490

libraries and so on there are in your

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
libraries and so on there are in your
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.399
libraries and so on there are in your
project but it also actually retains

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409
project but it also actually retains
 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.770
project but it also actually retains
some of the module information about a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
some of the module information about a
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.449
some of the module information about a
new type of module called dynamic

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
new type of module called dynamic
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.300

feature that's in your project now I
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.069
feature that's in your project now I
called it a publishing format because

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
called it a publishing format because
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.190
called it a publishing format because
you use it to upload this whole big

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
you use it to upload this whole big
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.899
you use it to upload this whole big

with Google Play dynamic delivery we are

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
with Google Play dynamic delivery we are
 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.089
with Google Play dynamic delivery we are
able to serve an optimized set of split

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099
able to serve an optimized set of split

that there's one big difference because

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680
that there's one big difference because
 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.199
that there's one big difference because
it happens on a cert on the server side

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209
it happens on a cert on the server side
 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.319
it happens on a cert on the server side
on the Play Store we need to be able to

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329
on the Play Store we need to be able to
 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.539
on the Play Store we need to be able to
resize your app that's why if you use an

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549
resize your app that's why if you use an
 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.490
resize your app that's why if you use an
Android app bundle you have to enable

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500
Android app bundle you have to enable
 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.979
Android app bundle you have to enable
app signing by Google Play now that's a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989
app signing by Google Play now that's a
 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.409
app signing by Google Play now that's a
good thing actually if you let us store

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419
good thing actually if you let us store
 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.689

your key for you it is safer it's more

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699
your key for you it is safer it's more
 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.319
your key for you it is safer it's more
secure but there's also another benefit

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329
secure but there's also another benefit

your apks and make them more optimized

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510
your apks and make them more optimized
 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.960
your apks and make them more optimized
as we develop more optimizations on the

as we develop more optimizations on the
 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.360
as we develop more optimizations on the
Play Store side over time what we

Play Store side over time what we
 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.219
Play Store side over time what we
deliver to users devices can be even

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229
deliver to users devices can be even
 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.140
deliver to users devices can be even
more optimized as we just announced with

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
more optimized as we just announced with
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.780
more optimized as we just announced with
uncompressed libraries and so it will

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790
uncompressed libraries and so it will
 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.539
uncompressed libraries and so it will
make sense to move instant apps to this

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549
make sense to move instant apps to this
 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.599
make sense to move instant apps to this
new model why build all the apks locally

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609
new model why build all the apks locally
 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.869
new model why build all the apks locally
and then not be able to optimize them

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879
and then not be able to optimize them
 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.789
and then not be able to optimize them
further on the Play Store what if we

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799
further on the Play Store what if we
 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.649
further on the Play Store what if we
could use the new app bundle format to

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659
could use the new app bundle format to
 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.330
could use the new app bundle format to
deliver an instant app experience to our

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340
deliver an instant app experience to our
 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.930
deliver an instant app experience to our
users so let me tell you how to go back

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940
users so let me tell you how to go back
 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.780
users so let me tell you how to go back
to that simpler better project structure

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790
to that simpler better project structure
 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.300
to that simpler better project structure
for your instant apps so if you if

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
for your instant apps so if you if
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.399
for your instant apps so if you if
you've ever done that whole dance to

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409
you've ever done that whole dance to
 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.830
you've ever done that whole dance to
move modules around and move your code

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840
move modules around and move your code
 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.740
move modules around and move your code
to a base feature and so on we literally

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
to a base feature and so on we literally
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.170
to a base feature and so on we literally
have to go back to that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
have to go back to that
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.330
have to go back to that
simple project to use as you would build

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340
simple project to use as you would build
 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820
simple project to use as you would build
your apk so first of all we no longer

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
your apk so first of all we no longer
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.240
your apk so first of all we no longer
need the instant app plug-in everything

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
need the instant app plug-in everything
 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.499
need the instant app plug-in everything
that we need is baked into the

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509
that we need is baked into the
 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.029
that we need is baked into the
application plugin that can now build

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039
application plugin that can now build
 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.090
application plugin that can now build
bundles and so we don't need the base

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100
bundles and so we don't need the base
 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.210
bundles and so we don't need the base
feature anymore instead we can move our

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220
feature anymore instead we can move our
 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.040
feature anymore instead we can move our
code back to the application or we will

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
code back to the application or we will
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.930
code back to the application or we will
be using that to build our unified

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940
be using that to build our unified
 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.650
be using that to build our unified
bundle artifact and so again with future

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660
bundle artifact and so again with future
 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.050
bundle artifact and so again with future
modules we now replace them with dynamic

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060
modules we now replace them with dynamic
 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.090
modules we now replace them with dynamic
features that work within the app bundle

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100
features that work within the app bundle
 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.510
features that work within the app bundle
world so ultimately we want something

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520
world so ultimately we want something
 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.170
world so ultimately we want something
simple you can have your application

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180
simple you can have your application
 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.279
simple you can have your application
application module with any additional

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289
application module with any additional
 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.650
application module with any additional
library modules that you need optionally

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
library modules that you need optionally
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.420
library modules that you need optionally
we have dynamic features that can be

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
we have dynamic features that can be
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.249
we have dynamic features that can be
downloaded on demand adding

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259
downloaded on demand adding
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.230
downloaded on demand adding
functionality to your app at runtime and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240
functionality to your app at runtime and
 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.270
functionality to your app at runtime and
we have the single piece of metadata

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
we have the single piece of metadata
 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.670
we have the single piece of metadata
that tells the Play Store that this

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680
that tells the Play Store that this
 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.219
that tells the Play Store that this
bundle is instant app enabled so that

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229
bundle is instant app enabled so that
 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.510
bundle is instant app enabled so that
would be great if you could upload that

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
would be great if you could upload that
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.490
would be great if you could upload that
one artifact to the Play Store and have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500
one artifact to the Play Store and have
 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.960
one artifact to the Play Store and have
it published both on the install an

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970
it published both on the install an
 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.879
it published both on the install an
instant track and that's exactly what we

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889
instant track and that's exactly what we
 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.249
instant track and that's exactly what we
were what we were aiming for now there's

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259
were what we were aiming for now there's
 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.320
were what we were aiming for now there's
one caveat we are currently testing that

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330
one caveat we are currently testing that
 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.360
one caveat we are currently testing that
with our partners but you might not

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
with our partners but you might not
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.310
with our partners but you might not
actually be able to upload this single

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
actually be able to upload this single
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.930
actually be able to upload this single
artifact to the Play Store just yet

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940

that's why if you want to try it right

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
that's why if you want to try it right
 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.939
that's why if you want to try it right
now

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949
now
 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.980
now
I suggest you create two product

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990
I suggest you create two product
 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.930
I suggest you create two product
variants in there in this simple project

structure still and in one of the
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.490
structure still and in one of the
variants simply enable their metadata

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
variants simply enable their metadata
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.890
variants simply enable their metadata
with enabling the instant app for your

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
with enabling the instant app for your
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.200
with enabling the instant app for your
bundle and use the other variant to

bundle and use the other variant to
 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.770

that's left is design a bundle build an
 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.990
that's left is design a bundle build an
app bundle ID or through Gradle so the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000
app bundle ID or through Gradle so the
 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.310
app bundle ID or through Gradle so the
bundle release command instead of a

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320
bundle release command instead of a
 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.070
bundle release command instead of a
symbol release or through the wizard and

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.140
have to have a URL mapping then this is
the way to go and it's not a lot of work

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.150
the way to go and it's not a lot of work
 

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.290
the way to go and it's not a lot of work
to do and it gives you the users the

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300
to do and it gives you the users the
 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.690
to do and it gives you the users the
experience that you can share any link

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:55.700
experience that you can share any link
 

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.760
experience that you can share any link
that leads to your app and any Android

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:57.770
that leads to your app and any Android
 

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.680
that leads to your app and any Android
user can then open the app straight away

00:10:59.680 --> 00:10:59.690
user can then open the app straight away
 

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.630
user can then open the app straight away
without having to install it permanently

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:01.640
without having to install it permanently
 

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.270
without having to install it permanently
and I think for a conference is a good

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.280
and I think for a conference is a good
 

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.560
and I think for a conference is a good
use case to have an app that you use

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.570
use case to have an app that you use
 

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.960
use case to have an app that you use
once and you don't have to fully install

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:07.970
once and you don't have to fully install
 

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.350
once and you don't have to fully install
it

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360
it
 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.360
it
you have the instant app and for a

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.370
you have the instant app and for a
 

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.009
you have the instant app and for a
couple of features like in our case it's

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:12.019
couple of features like in our case it's
 

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.720
couple of features like in our case it's
notifications you still have to install

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:13.730
notifications you still have to install
 

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.990
notifications you still have to install
the app but it's fair enough to have an

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000
the app but it's fair enough to have an
 

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.949
the app but it's fair enough to have an
experience that you can start

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959
experience that you can start
 

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.600
experience that you can start
straightaway without the first steps

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:19.610
straightaway without the first steps
 

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.500
straightaway without the first steps
necessary also there's another thing

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:23.510
necessary also there's another thing
 

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.130
necessary also there's another thing
that we use for app bundles in order to

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.140
that we use for app bundles in order to
 

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.240
that we use for app bundles in order to
download code dynamically so going back

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.250
download code dynamically so going back
 

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.060
download code dynamically so going back
to the the previous section is basically

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.070
to the the previous section is basically
 

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.910
to the the previous section is basically
you can do that with the zip and feature

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920
you can do that with the zip and feature
 

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.819
you can do that with the zip and feature
in synapse what we're going on forward

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:39.829
in synapse what we're going on forward
 

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:42.100
in synapse what we're going on forward
now you have to ship your app as an app

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.110
now you have to ship your app as an app
 

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.530
now you have to ship your app as an app
bundle and you have to use dynamic

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:44.540
bundle and you have to use dynamic
 

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.449
bundle and you have to use dynamic
feature modules in order to make use of

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:46.459
feature modules in order to make use of
 

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.519
feature modules in order to make use of
the play core library the play core

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:48.529
the play core library the play core
 

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.829
the play core library the play core
library allows you to download features

00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839
library allows you to download features
 

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:53.829
library allows you to download features
dynamically on demand so not during the

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839
dynamically on demand so not during the
 

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.870
dynamically on demand so not during the
initial installation and it's unified

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880
initial installation and it's unified
 

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.630
initial installation and it's unified
between instant app and installed app so

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.640
between instant app and installed app so
 

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.280
between instant app and installed app so
you don't have to do different calls on

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.290
you don't have to do different calls on
 

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.290
you don't have to do different calls on
that and it does all the heavy lifting

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:02.300
that and it does all the heavy lifting
 

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.860
that and it does all the heavy lifting
so if you say to play query a library

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:05.870
so if you say to play query a library
 

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.540
so if you say to play query a library
download this it connects to the Play

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:07.550
download this it connects to the Play
 

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.100
download this it connects to the Play
Store it downloads it it puts it in the

Store it downloads it it puts it in the
 

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.889
Store it downloads it it puts it in the
right place for instant apps it puts it

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:11.899
right place for instant apps it puts it
 

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.350
right place for instant apps it puts it
into the share cache there and for an

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360
into the share cache there and for an
 

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.819

permanently so how does it work well you

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:20.570
permanently so how does it work well you
 

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.960
permanently so how does it work well you
add it as a dependency available from

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:22.970
add it as a dependency available from
 

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.019
add it as a dependency available from
maven Google come and use it in your in

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.029
maven Google come and use it in your in
 

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:28.480
maven Google come and use it in your in
your project and then you create a split

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.490
your project and then you create a split
 

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.340
your project and then you create a split
install manager factory within your

install manager factory within your
 

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.170
install manager factory within your
activity hold on to that create a

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.180
activity hold on to that create a
 

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.970
activity hold on to that create a
request where you can install one or

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:33.980
request where you can install one or
 

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.329

multiple modules at the same time those

00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:37.339
multiple modules at the same time those
 

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.370
multiple modules at the same time those
module names have to match the module

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.380
module names have to match the module
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.350
module names have to match the module
name that you set for the dynamic

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360
name that you set for the dynamic
 

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.090

feature module directly in the manifest

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.100
feature module directly in the manifest
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.460
feature module directly in the manifest
of that module you build it and then you

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:45.470
of that module you build it and then you
 

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.050
of that module you build it and then you
just tell the manager to start the

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.060
just tell the manager to start the
 

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.569
just tell the manager to start the
installation and that's all the coding

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:49.579
installation and that's all the coding
 

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:51.220
installation and that's all the coding
you eat in order to get started with it

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.230
you eat in order to get started with it
 

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.630
you eat in order to get started with it
obviously there's a couple of things

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:52.640
obviously there's a couple of things
 

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.980
obviously there's a couple of things
that you have to do around it I'll go

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:53.990
that you have to do around it I'll go
 

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.560
that you have to do around it I'll go
into that in a second but before we do

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:56.570
into that in a second but before we do
 

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.240
into that in a second but before we do
that if you don't want to start the

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.250
that if you don't want to start the
 

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.650
that if you don't want to start the
installation straightaway there's a way

00:12:59.650 --> 00:12:59.660
installation straightaway there's a way
 

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.630
installation straightaway there's a way
to do a deferred installation so for

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:01.640
to do a deferred installation so for
 

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.660
to do a deferred installation so for
example if you have your instant app you

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:03.670
example if you have your instant app you
 

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.829
example if you have your instant app you
started you and you know that your user

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839
started you and you know that your user
 

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.139
started you and you know that your user
is in a flow where they're where they're

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:08.149
is in a flow where they're where they're
 

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:10.300
is in a flow where they're where they're
for example buying something so they've

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:10.310
for example buying something so they've
 

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.650
for example buying something so they've
logged in and then they're starting the

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:11.660
logged in and then they're starting the
 

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.329
logged in and then they're starting the
purchase process and you want to have

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:13.339
purchase process and you want to have
 

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:15.340
purchase process and you want to have
and you want to download a payment

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:15.350
and you want to download a payment
 

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.290
and you want to download a payment
payment module for example you can do

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.300
payment module for example you can do
 

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.630
payment module for example you can do
that deferred or during the flow when

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:19.640
that deferred or during the flow when
 

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.380
that deferred or during the flow when
when the users in that you can do

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:21.390
when the users in that you can do
 

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.750
when the users in that you can do
installations also uninstallation its

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760
installations also uninstallation its
 

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.300
installations also uninstallation its
deferred at some point so that means the

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:26.310
deferred at some point so that means the
 

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.250
deferred at some point so that means the
uninstallation doesn't get done straight

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260
uninstallation doesn't get done straight
 

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.750
uninstallation doesn't get done straight
away but at some point where the system

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760
away but at some point where the system
 

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.550
away but at some point where the system
says yes I'm cleaning up and this is

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560
says yes I'm cleaning up and this is
 

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.170
says yes I'm cleaning up and this is
where this is module get all right it

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180
where this is module get all right it
 

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.140
where this is module get all right it
also gets removed and you can also

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.150
also gets removed and you can also
 

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.880
also gets removed and you can also
cancel installation requests for if for

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:37.890
cancel installation requests for if for
 

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.590
cancel installation requests for if for
whatever reason you from the from the

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600
whatever reason you from the from the
 

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.730
whatever reason you from the from the
developer perspective want to cancel

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740
developer perspective want to cancel
 

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.600

that there's an option to do it and

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:43.610
that there's an option to do it and
 

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.860
that there's an option to do it and
there's a listener you can set on the

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:45.870
there's a listener you can set on the
 

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.650
there's a listener you can set on the
under manager that's my preferred way of

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660
under manager that's my preferred way of
 

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.060
under manager that's my preferred way of
listening for the state updates the

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.070
listening for the state updates the
 

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.280
listening for the state updates the
split install state update listener it's

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:52.290
split install state update listener it's
 

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.590
split install state update listener it's
quite a word and there's quite a few

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600
quite a word and there's quite a few
 

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.990
quite a word and there's quite a few
things so usually what happens the happy

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000
things so usually what happens the happy
 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.230
things so usually what happens the happy
path is you trigger and install your app

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240
path is you trigger and install your app

dynamic delivery one of the things we do

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:15.270
dynamic delivery one of the things we do
 

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.580
dynamic delivery one of the things we do
is we don't take the installed size

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:19.590
is we don't take the installed size
 

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.580
is we don't take the installed size

has a file size that it's larger than a
limit then that's alright because we

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.250
limit then that's alright because we
 

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.710

could take the download size into

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720
could take the download size into
 

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.900
could take the download size into
account so you get some compression over

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:32.910
account so you get some compression over
 

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.310
account so you get some compression over
the wire and that's what we take into

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320
the wire and that's what we take into

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.070
same technology underneath that you can
use for modularizing an instant app as

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080
use for modularizing an instant app as
 

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.530
use for modularizing an instant app as
well so firstly what we did is we know

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:45.540
well so firstly what we did is we know
 

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.540
well so firstly what we did is we know
the most apps will do is we created a

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:47.550
the most apps will do is we created a
 

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.010
the most apps will do is we created a
base module where

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020
base module where
 

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.980
base module where
hosts all the domain code and data so

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:51.990
hosts all the domain code and data so
 

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.830
hosts all the domain code and data so
shared access to share preferences

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840
shared access to share preferences
 

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.800
shared access to share preferences
login for example some repositories some

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:57.810
login for example some repositories some
 

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.390
login for example some repositories some
persistent API calls and things like

00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400
persistent API calls and things like
 

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.610
persistent API calls and things like
that and on top of that are different

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620
that and on top of that are different
 

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.620
that and on top of that are different
feature modules those future modules

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:03.630
feature modules those future modules
 

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.330
feature modules those future modules
have their own domain code their own

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340
have their own domain code their own
 

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.880
have their own domain code their own
logic and obviously the UI which is only

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:07.890
logic and obviously the UI which is only
 

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.140
logic and obviously the UI which is only
displayed in this module and that setup

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.150
displayed in this module and that setup
 

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.510
displayed in this module and that setup
can be used for many apps if you have a

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520
can be used for many apps if you have a
 

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.340
can be used for many apps if you have a
base module which shares information and

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:16.350
base module which shares information and
 

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.780
base module which shares information and
on top of that the different future

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:17.790
on top of that the different future
 

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.290
on top of that the different future
modules but let me share a little bit on

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:21.300
modules but let me share a little bit on
 

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.600
modules but let me share a little bit on
more in-depth what we did so initially

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:23.610
more in-depth what we did so initially
 

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.150
more in-depth what we did so initially
we had an app which is the module that

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160
we had an app which is the module that
 

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.800
we had an app which is the module that
most people have so we had this monolith

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:27.810
most people have so we had this monolith
 

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.130
most people have so we had this monolith
and if we ship as an apk that's fine

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140
and if we ship as an apk that's fine
 

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.190
and if we ship as an apk that's fine
because well there is no reason to go

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200
because well there is no reason to go
 

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.290
because well there is no reason to go
into the whole modernization part part

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300
into the whole modernization part part
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.050
into the whole modernization part part
if we in in the end have one single

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.060
if we in in the end have one single
 

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.970
if we in in the end have one single
monolithic app apk de we ship to our

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980
monolithic app apk de we ship to our
 

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.020
monolithic app apk de we ship to our
users but since we were considering

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.030
users but since we were considering
 

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.460
users but since we were considering
going towards dynamic feature modules

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:46.470
going towards dynamic feature modules
 

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.950
going towards dynamic feature modules
and app bundles we moved everything into

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960
and app bundles we moved everything into
 

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.390
and app bundles we moved everything into
your base which on the one hand had the

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400
your base which on the one hand had the
 

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.100
your base which on the one hand had the
shared dependencies which basically

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.110
shared dependencies which basically
 

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.890
shared dependencies which basically
means everything that we include coming

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900
means everything that we include coming
 

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.560
means everything that we include coming
from whatever repositories externally as

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:57.570
from whatever repositories externally as
 

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.870
from whatever repositories externally as
well as a couple of local first party a

00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880
well as a couple of local first party a
 

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.090
well as a couple of local first party a
third party api's and libraries that we

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100
third party api's and libraries that we
 

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.270
third party api's and libraries that we
have forked and worked with we after we

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280
have forked and worked with we after we
 

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.910
have forked and worked with we after we
had this we started working on features

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:07.920
had this we started working on features
 

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.390
had this we started working on features
that we extracted from the from the app

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400
that we extracted from the from the app
 

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.480
that we extracted from the from the app
itself the first we started with was an

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:14.490
itself the first we started with was an
 

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.460
itself the first we started with was an
about screen because well and about your

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:16.470
about screen because well and about your
 

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.990
about screen because well and about your
screen it's kind of untangled from most

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000
screen it's kind of untangled from most
 

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.550
screen it's kind of untangled from most
of the stuff that we have within the app

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:19.560
of the stuff that we have within the app
 

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.840
of the stuff that we have within the app
so it's a good starting point for

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:20.850
so it's a good starting point for
 

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.390
so it's a good starting point for
getting our hands with wet with how do

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400
getting our hands with wet with how do
 

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.330
getting our hands with wet with how do
you e yeah with what does it actually

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340
you e yeah with what does it actually
 

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.860
you e yeah with what does it actually
entail to make a dynamic feature module

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:27.870
entail to make a dynamic feature module
 

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.570
entail to make a dynamic feature module
how do we do all those things

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580
how do we do all those things
 

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.490
how do we do all those things
then we went on to do a search screen

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500
then we went on to do a search screen
 

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.130
then we went on to do a search screen
and after that we have two newest host

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140
and after that we have two newest host
 

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.780
and after that we have two newest host
two new sources that we extracted into

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:35.790
two new sources that we extracted into
 

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.880
two new sources that we extracted into
dynamic future modules as well and they

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:37.890
dynamic future modules as well and they
 

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.580
dynamic future modules as well and they
all depend on the app and that the app

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:40.590
all depend on the app and that the app
 

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.260
all depend on the app and that the app
and everything shares the information

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:42.270
and everything shares the information
 

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.300
and everything shares the information
through that as well you can read up

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.310
through that as well you can read up
 

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.130
through that as well you can read up
