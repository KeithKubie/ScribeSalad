00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.372
Nearly 100 years ago,

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:16.826
almost today,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.206
most women in the United States
finally won the right to vote.

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:26.502
Now, it would take decades more
for women of color to earn that right,

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.226
and we've come a long way since,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.421
but I would argue not nearly far enough.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:33.603
I think what women want today,

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:36.674
not just only in the United States
but around the globe,

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:39.000
is to no longer be an afterthought.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.669
We don't want to continue to try to,
like, look at the next 100 years

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:47.856
and be granted, grudgingly,
small legal rights and accommodations.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.477
We simply want true and full equality.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.172
I think that women are tired
of retrofitting ourselves

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:59.816
into institutions and governments
that were built by men, for men,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.386
and we'd rather reshape the future
on our own terms.

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:06.288
I believe --

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:09.616
(Applause)

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.132
I believe what we need is a women's
political revolution for full equality

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:18.562
across race, across class,
across gender identity,

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.130
across sexual orientation,

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:22.499
and yes, across political labels,

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:25.799
because I believe what binds us
together as women

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:29.304
is so much more profound
than what keeps up apart.

00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:31.177
And so I've given some thought

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.697
about how to build
this women's political revolution

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.287
and that's what I want
to talk to you about today.

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.474
(Cheers)

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.569
(Applause)

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:44.607
The good news is that one thing
that hasn't changed in the last century

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.195
is women's resilience

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.465
and our commitment to build
a better life not only for ourselves,

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.526
but for generations to come,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.694
because I can't think of a single woman

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:55.116
who wants her daughter

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.640
to have fewer rights
or opportunities than she's had.

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:04.432
So we know we all stand on the shoulders
of the women who came before us,

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.607
and as for myself,

00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:08.542
I come from a long line
of tough Texas women.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.337
(Cheers)

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:13.536
My grandparents
lived outside of Waco, Texas,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.038
in the country.

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.393
And when my grandmother got pregnant,

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:20.380
of course she was not going
to go to the hospital to deliver,

00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:22.565
she was going to have that baby at home.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.017
But when she went into labor,

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:27.883
she called the neighbor woman over
to cook dinner for my grandfather,

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:29.310
because ...

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:32.729
I mean, it was unthinkable that he
was going to make supper for himself.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.507
(Laughter)

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.142
Been there.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.280
(Laughter)

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.876
The neighbor had no experience
with killing a chicken,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.799
and that was what was planned
for dinner that night.

00:02:45.823 --> 00:02:48.116
And so as the story goes,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.559
my grandmother,
in the birthing bed, in labor,

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:55.931
hoists herself up on one elbow
and wrings that chicken's neck, right?

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.212
And that is how my mother
came into this world.

00:02:58.236 --> 00:02:59.710
(Laughter)

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:03.584
(Applause)

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:05.490
But the amazing thing is,

00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:08.764
even though my mother's own grandmother
could not vote in Texas,

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.842
because under Texas law,

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:15.616
"idiots, imbeciles, the insane and women"

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.845
were prevented the franchise --

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.700
just two generations later,

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:24.108
my mother, Ann Richards, was elected
the first woman governor in her own right

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:25.337
in the state of Texas.

00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:32.317
(Applause and cheers)

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:35.817
But you see, when Mom
was coming up in Texas,

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.213
there weren't a lot
of opportunities for women,

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:41.722
and frankly, she spent her entire life
trying to change that.

00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:43.801
She used to like to say,

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:47.681
"As women, if you just give
us a chance, we can perform.

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:51.601
After all, Ginger Rogers
did everything Fred Astaire did,

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.965
but she did it backwards
and in high heels."

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.332
Right?

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:59.262
And honestly, that's kind of what women
have been doing for this last century:

00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:02.464
despite having very, very little
political power,

00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:04.924
we have made enormous progress.

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.384
So today in the United States,

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:08.436
100 years after getting the right to vote,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.280
women are almost half the workforce.

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:13.554
And in 40 percent
of families with children,

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.543
women are the major breadwinners.

00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:17.514
Economists even estimate

00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:22.162
that if every single paid working woman
took just one day off of work,

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:25.576
it would cost the United States
21 billion dollars

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.104
in gross domestic product.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.825
Now, largely because of Title IX,
which required educational equity,

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.222
women are actually now half
the college students in the United States.

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.223
We're half the medical students,
we're half the law students --

00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:40.398
Exactly.

00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:41.573
(Applause)

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:43.947
And a fact I absolutely love:

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:48.204
One of the most recent classes of
graduating NASA astronauts was ...

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:49.379
What?

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:51.202
For the first time, 50 percent women.

00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:54.579
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:57.603
The point is that women
are really changing industries,

00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:00.552
they're changing business
from the inside out.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.491
But when it comes to government,
it's another story,

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:07.390
and I actually think a picture
is worth 1000 words.

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:11.267
This is a photograph from 2017
at the White House

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:15.164
when congressional leaders
were called over to put the final details

00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:18.259
into the health-care reform bill
that was to go to Congress.

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:20.745
Now, one of the results of this meeting

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.694
was that they got rid
of maternity benefits,

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:25.341
which may not be that surprising,

00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:28.705
since no one at that table
actually would need maternity benefits.

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.940
And unfortunately,
that's what we've learned the hard way

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.221
in the US for women.

00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:36.805
If we're not at the table,
we're on the menu, right?

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:42.551
And we're simply not at enough tables,

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.292
because even though women
are the vast majority of voters

00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:46.467
in the United States,

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.845
we fall far behind the rest of the world
in political representation.

00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:54.583
Recent research is that when
they ranked all the countries,

00:05:54.607 --> 00:05:59.153
the United States is 104th
in women's representation in office.

00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:02.002
104th ...

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:03.849
Right behind Indonesia.

00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:07.088
So is it any big surprise, then,

00:06:07.112 --> 00:06:08.941
considering who's making decisions,

00:06:08.965 --> 00:06:11.878
we're the only developed country
with no paid family leave?

00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.506
And despite all the research
and improvements we've made

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.967
in medical care --

00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:19.110
and this is really horrifying to me --

00:06:19.134 --> 00:06:23.722
the United States now leads the developed
world in maternal mortality rates.

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:27.941
Now, when it comes to equal pay,
we're not doing a whole lot better.

00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:30.077
Women now, on average,
in the United States,

00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.132
still only make 80 cents
to the dollar that a man makes.

00:06:33.156 --> 00:06:35.199
Though if you're
an African American woman,

00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:37.525
it's 63 cents to the dollar.

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:41.326
And if you're Latina,
it's 54 cents to the dollar.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.573
It's an outrage.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.281
Now, women in the UK, the United Kingdom,

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:48.112
just came up with something
I thought was rather ingenious,

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:50.628
in order to illustrate
the impact of the pay gap.

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:54.917
So, starting November 10
and going through the end of the year,

00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:57.702
they simply put an out-of-office
memo on their email

00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:01.092
to indicate all the weeks
they were working without pay.

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:02.267
Right?

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:05.122
I think it's an idea
that actually could catch on.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:09.149
But imagine if women
actually had political power.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.614
Imagine if we were at the table,
making decisions.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:17.279
Imagine if we had our own
women's political party

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:20.428
that instead of putting our issues
to the side as distractions,

00:07:20.452 --> 00:07:22.680
made them the top priority.

00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:25.245
Well, we know --

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:27.378
research shows
that when women are in office,

00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:30.109
they actually act differently than men.

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:32.807
They collaborate more
with their colleagues,

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:35.096
they work across party lines,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.807
and women are much more likely
to support legislation

00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:42.060
that improves access to health care,
education, civil rights.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:45.916
And what we've seen in our research
in the United States Congress

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.108
is that women sponsor more legislation

00:07:48.132 --> 00:07:49.927
and they cosponsor more legislation.

00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:53.705
So all the evidence is that when women
actually have the chance to serve,

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.752
they make a huge difference
and they get the job done.

00:07:57.155 --> 00:08:01.243
So how would it look in the United States
if different people were making decisions?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.768
Well, I firmly believe
if half of Congress could get pregnant,

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:08.220
we would finally quit fighting
about birth control

00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:09.429
and Planned Parenthood.

00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:10.599
(Applause and cheers)

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:11.774
That would be over.

00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:16.870
(Applause)

00:08:16.894 --> 00:08:19.292
I also really believe that finally,

00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:24.213
businesses might quit
treating pregnancy as a nuisance,

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:27.351
and rather understand it
as a primary medical issue

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:29.518
for millions of American workers.

00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:33.129
And I think if more women were in office,

00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:37.455
our government would actually prioritize
keeping families together

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:39.265
rather than pulling them apart.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.072
(Applause)

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:46.320
But perhaps most importantly,

00:08:46.344 --> 00:08:49.954
I think all of these issues would
no longer be seen as "women's issues."

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.898
They would just be seen as basic issues
of fairness and equality

00:08:53.922 --> 00:08:56.446
that everybody can get behind.

00:08:58.153 --> 00:08:59.524
So I think the question is,

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:03.831
what would it take, actually, to build
this women's political revolution?

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.666
The good news is, actually,
it's already started.

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.452
Because women around the globe
are demanding workplaces,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:14.877
they're demanding
educational institutions,

00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:16.401
they're demanding governments

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:21.342
where sexism and sexual harassment
and sexual assault are neither accepted

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:22.825
nor tolerated.

00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:24.597
Women around the world, as we know,

00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:27.748
are raising their hands
and saying, "Me Too,"

00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:30.419
and it's a movement
that's made so much more powerful

00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:33.751
by the fact that women
are standing together across industries,

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:37.743
from domestic workers
to celebrities in Hollywood.

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:41.530
Women are marching, we're sitting in,

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:42.844
we're speaking up.

00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:45.311
Women are challenging the status quo,

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.242
we're busting old taboos

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:49.919
and yes, we are proudly making trouble.

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:54.735
So, women in Saudi Arabia
are driving for the very first time.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.204
(Applause and cheers)

00:09:57.228 --> 00:10:01.901
Women in Iraq are standing in solidarity
with survivors of human trafficking.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.033
And women from El Salvador to Ireland
are fighting for reproductive rights.

00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:11.114
And women in Myanmar
are standing up for human rights.

00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:15.468
In short, I think the most profound
leadership in the world

00:10:15.492 --> 00:10:17.314
isn't coming from halls of government.

00:10:17.338 --> 00:10:20.848
It's coming from women
at the grassroots all across the globe.

00:10:20.872 --> 00:10:24.465
(Applause)

00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:29.151
And here in the United States,
women are on fire.

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:32.517
So a recent Kaiser poll reported

00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.637
that since our last presidential
election in 2016,

00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.682
one in five Americans have either marched
or taken part in a protest,

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.434
and the number one issue
has been women's rights.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.076
Women are starting new organizations,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.815
they are volunteering on campaigns,

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:50.859
and they're taking on every issue

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:54.598
from gun-safety reform
to public education.

00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:58.370
And women are running for office
in record numbers,

00:10:58.394 --> 00:10:59.883
and they are winning.

00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:01.095
So -- (Laughs)

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.450
(Applause)

00:11:02.474 --> 00:11:06.475
Women like Lucy McBath from Georgia.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.907
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:14.740
Lucy lost her son to gun violence,

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:18.709
and it was because of her experience
with the criminal justice system

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:20.974
that she realized just how broken it is,

00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:23.771
and she decided to do
something about that.

00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:25.443
So she ran for office,

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:28.014
and this January, she's going to Congress.

00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:30.019
OK? Or --

00:11:30.043 --> 00:11:31.429
(Applause)

00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:33.866
Angie Craig from Minnesota.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:34.991
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:40.968
So her congressman had made
such hateful comments about LGBTQ people

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.184
that she decided to challenge him.

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.987
And you know what? She did, and she won,

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.964
and when she goes to Congress in January,

00:11:47.988 --> 00:11:51.513
she'll be the first lesbian mother
serving in the House of Representatives.

00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:53.322
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.517
Or --

00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:56.077
(Applause)

00:11:56.101 --> 00:11:58.870
Or Lauren Underwood from Illinois.

00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:01.108
She's a registered nurse,

00:12:01.132 --> 00:12:05.633
and she sees every day the impact
that lack of health care access has

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:07.834
on the community where she lives,

00:12:07.858 --> 00:12:09.753
and so she decided to run.

00:12:09.777 --> 00:12:12.850
She took on six men in her primary,
she beat them all,

00:12:12.874 --> 00:12:14.257
she won the general election,

00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:16.234
and when she goes to Congress in January,

00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:18.836
she's going to be the first
African-American woman ever

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.855
to serve her district in Washington, D.C.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:24.009
(Applause and cheers)

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:27.255
So women are recognizing --

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.699
this is our moment.

00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:29.962
Don't wait for permission,

00:12:29.986 --> 00:12:31.829
don't wait for your turn.

00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:36.388
As the late, great
Shirley Chisholm said --

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:38.984
Shirley Chisholm, the first
African-American woman ever

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.276
to go to Congress

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.023
and the first woman to run for president
in the Democratic party --

00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:46.490
but Shirley Chisholm said,

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:50.015
"If there's no room for you at the table,
just pull up a folding chair."

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:54.499
And that's what women are doing,
all across the country.

00:12:55.664 --> 00:12:59.753
I believe women are now the most
important and powerful political force

00:12:59.777 --> 00:13:01.326
in the world,

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.431
but how do we make sure
that this is not just a moment?

00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:10.359
What we need is actually a global movement
for women's full equality

00:13:10.383 --> 00:13:13.044
that is intersectional
and it's intergenerational,

00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:14.801
where no one gets left behind.

00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:17.983
And so I have a few ideas
about how we could do that.

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:21.054
Number one: it's not enough to resist.

00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:23.170
It's not enough to say what we're against.

00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:26.467
It's time to be loud and proud
about what we are for,

00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:29.665
because being for full equality
is a mainstream value

00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:31.692
and something that we can get behind.

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:34.845
Because actually, men support
equal pay for women.

00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:37.598
Millennials, they support gender equality.

00:13:37.622 --> 00:13:42.022
And businesses are increasingly adopting
family-friendly policies,

00:13:42.046 --> 00:13:44.153
not just because
it's the right thing to do,

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:46.082
but because it's good for their workers.

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:47.604
It's good for their business.

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:50.254
Number two:

00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:53.741
We have to remember,
in the words of Fannie Lou Hamer,

00:13:53.765 --> 00:13:57.285
that "nobody's free
'til everybody's free."

00:13:57.665 --> 00:13:59.288
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:02.818
women of color in this country
didn't even get the right to vote

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.765
until much further along
than the rest of us.

00:14:06.257 --> 00:14:09.212
But since they did,
they are the most reliable voters,

00:14:09.236 --> 00:14:12.158
and women of color are the most
reliable voters for candidates

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:13.505
who support women's rights,

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:15.271
and we need to follow their lead --

00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:20.542
(Applause and cheers)

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:23.045
Because their issues are our issues.

00:14:23.414 --> 00:14:26.202
And as white women, we have to do more,

00:14:26.226 --> 00:14:29.345
because racism and sexism and homophobia,

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.752
these are issues that affect all of us.

00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:35.858
Number three: we've got to vote
in every single election.

00:14:35.882 --> 00:14:37.033
Every election.

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:39.862
And we've got to make it easier
for folks to vote,

00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:43.294
and we've got to make sure
that every single vote is counted, OK?

00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:46.166
(Applause and cheers)

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:51.770
Because the barriers that exist
to voting in the United States,

00:14:51.794 --> 00:14:54.375
they fall disproportionately on women --

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.722
women of color, women with low incomes,

00:14:56.746 --> 00:14:59.630
women who are working
and trying to raise a family.

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:03.229
So we need to make it easier
for everyone to vote,

00:15:03.253 --> 00:15:06.698
and we can start by making
Election Day a federal holiday

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:08.267
in the United States of America.

00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:13.461
(Applause and cheers)

00:15:13.485 --> 00:15:16.186
Number four: don't wait for instructions.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.593
If you see a problem that needs fixing,

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:21.600
I think you're the one to do it, OK?

00:15:21.624 --> 00:15:25.695
So start a new organization,
run for office.

00:15:25.719 --> 00:15:30.329
Or maybe it's as simple as standing up
on the job in support of yourself

00:15:30.353 --> 00:15:31.507
or your coworkers.

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.332
This is up to all of us.

00:15:33.654 --> 00:15:38.131
And number five:
invest in women, all right?

00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:39.303
(Applause)

00:15:39.327 --> 00:15:42.975
Invest in women as candidates,
as changemakers, as leaders.

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:44.179
Just as an example,

00:15:44.203 --> 00:15:47.097
in this last election cycle
in the United States,

00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:51.578
women donated 100 million dollars more
to candidates and campaigns

00:15:51.602 --> 00:15:53.470
than they had just two years ago,

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:55.866
and a record number of women won.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.133
So just think about that.

00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.837
(Applause and cheers)

00:15:58.861 --> 00:16:03.942
So look, sometimes I think
that the challenges we face,

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:05.315
they seem overwhelming

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.985
and they seem like they almost
can never be solved,

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:12.142
but I think the problems
that seem the most intractable

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:14.436
are the ones that are most
important to work on.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.238
And just because it hasn't been
figured out yet doesn't mean you won't.

00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:21.832
After all, if women's work were easy,

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.342
someone else would have
already been doing it, right?

00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:25.444
(Laughter)

00:16:25.468 --> 00:16:29.207
But women around the globe,
they're on the move,

00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:32.781
and they are taking strengths
and inspiration from each other.

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:35.780
They are doing things
they never could have imagined.

00:16:35.804 --> 00:16:38.302
So if we could just take
the progress we have made

00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:39.932
in joining the workforce,

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.431
in joining business,

00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:43.504
in joining the educational system,

00:16:43.528 --> 00:16:47.254
and actually channel that
into building true political power,

00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:49.537
we will reshape this century,

00:16:49.561 --> 00:16:51.693
because one of us can be ignored,

00:16:51.717 --> 00:16:53.503
two of us can be dismissed,

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:55.637
but together, we're a movement,

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:56.905
and we're unstoppable.

00:16:57.355 --> 00:16:58.563
Thank you.

00:16:58.587 --> 00:17:00.373
(Applause and cheers)

00:17:00.397 --> 00:17:01.555
Thank you.

00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:02.880
(Applause)
