00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Hi everyone.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.020
Welcome back.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.110
So we're going to move
on to the second panel,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.990
which is on ownership
and contractual issues.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.650
The goal of this panel
is to explore the state

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.130
of contract law vis-Ã -vis
software-enabled everyday products

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.580 position:56%
and how contracts such as end user
license agreements impact investment

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.090
in and the dissemination and
use of everyday products,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.800
including whether any
legislative action is necessary.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.910
So before we start, we should
first introduce the new member

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.190
to our section.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.490
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Good morning.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.790
I'm Erik Bertin.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.090
I'm the Deputy Director

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.390
for Registration here
at the Copyright Office.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.520
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: And we should
also have the new members

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.460
on the panel introduce
themselves and their affiliations.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.670
So, if we could start
with you, Mr. Perzanowski.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.260
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: My
name is Aaron Perzanowski.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.560
I'm a Professor of Law

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.890
at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.690 position:56%
I've been thinking and writing about
issues concerning consumer ownership

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.420
of digital goods for a long time.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.870
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: And Mr. Harbeson.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.800
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: I'm Eric Harbeson
from the Music Library Association.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.100
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: OK, great.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.400
Thank you.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.740
So, after reading the comments
we've received in this area,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.610
we've identified two areas
of particular interest.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.980
First, what are the legal
or practical rationales

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.340
for employing end user license
agreements or other types

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.070
of agreements in the context of
software-enabled consumer products?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.770
And second, are such agreements
having any practical effect

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.670
in the marketplace in terms
of limiting the availability

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.890
of exceptions and limitations
in the copyright act?

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.830
So, if anyone would like to
start addressing one or both

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.640
of those issues, that'd be great.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940
So, Mr. Bergmayer.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.940
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.720
So, I think one of the issues
with software, in particular,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.840
is that where it goes beyond
contract law is that if the seller

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.200
of a software product or a
software-enabled product is

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.210
in some way saying that you never--

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.140
the buyer never actually
owns the copy.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.110
That doesn't just affect the
relationship between the seller

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.060
and the buyer, it has
downstream effects

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.880
because the first-sale doctrine
then never kicks in and people

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560
who are not privity to the sales
contract between the seller

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.650
and the buyer would also
be infringing copyright

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.950
for later distributions.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.120
So I think that is one of the
particularly dangerous areas

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240
with the notion that a seller

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.890
of a software product
can reserve ownership.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.010
And also, I think you'll see
in a lot of the comments,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.820
there was agreement that the
law doesn't need to change

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.720
but different people have different
idea of what the law means.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.770
When I say the law it
doesn't need to change,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.460
I think that these parallel
doctrines that have come

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.130 position:56%
up where software vendors uniquely
among all copyright holders have the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.180
ability to sell you
something and say

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.630 position:56%
that they didn't really sell it you,
that has no basis in the statute.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.320
It defies common sense and legal
logic and yet we've allowed it

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.510
to grow up in the software
industry to sort

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.020
of arrange its business models
around this legal concept

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.290
where in other areas
plenty of other sellers

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.120
of copyrighted products have
tried to do the exact same thing

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.580 position:56%
and they've been smacked down by the
courts, you know, the foundational

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.490
for sale cases about the
attempt to withhold rights--

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.010 position:56%
resale rights from customers, the
people who have given people sample.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.390
Music have tried to say,
well, you can't resell this

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.690
because you don't really own it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.060
and courts have taken the
very common sense view

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.470
that if you're transferring a
physical item to someone for keeps,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.850
that means they own it and just
sort of boilerplate language

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.970
in a sales agreement
between a seller

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.860
and a buyer can't really change
that basic economic reality.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.630
And it is this-- you know,
this is the issue that sort

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.570
of got me involved in this area.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.260 position:56%
You know, I first started looking
about this stuff and the Vernor case

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.200
which I think came
out the wrong way.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.560 position:56%
And I think if we just revisit
these doctrines which are judge-made

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.360
and have no basis in the statute,
we can undo a lot of the real

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.860
and potential consumer harm.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, can I-- I mean, so,
you know, when I re-read Vernor--

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.630
I mean, Vernor is based on an
older case from 1977 called Wise

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.300
which didn't involve up a software.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.670 position:56%
It involved a motion picture prints.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.280
And with the court basically said
there was-- I mean it reached--

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.010
it sort of reversed the
convictions I think in that case

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.370
on other grounds but it
did say that, you know,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.490
the court discussed a sort of
VIP prints of motion pictures

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.950
like staying [inaudible]
and said that,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.800
you know, those could be licensed.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.300
And so I'm just wondering
what you say about--

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.960
I mean, just to your point that
this is something that's unique

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.480
to software, I'm just wondering
whether you could address sort

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.600
of why and it's a reasoning.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.640
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: There absolutely
can be situations where I sort

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.980
of transfer physical custody
of a physical item to a buyer

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.990 position:56%
or another person where they don't
really own it but I think there have

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.290
to be facts to support that,
it can't just be routine

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.780
like I just sort of add it to
every single thing that I sell,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.190 position:56%
there has to be some sort verifiable
requirement that they destroyed

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.250
after use or that they return it,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.790
or there has to be some
sort of reality to that.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.090
It can't just be something

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.850
that anytime anyone buys a consumer
product, the example that I pulled

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.790
out was-- in our comments
but I could have found it

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.520
in probably any product is
the Nest thermostat license

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.850
which simultaneously says that you,
the buyer, don't really own this,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.480
you don't own the copy of
the software which, you know,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.140
is a physical thing because
copies are always material objects

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.970
but it also describes
you as the buyer.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.440 position:56%
And it's just contradictory and it's
just put there as a matter of course

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.790
in all software that
is sold to consumers.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.240
And I think that's the problem,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.760 position:56%
not that there might be exceptional
circumstances where, yeah, you know,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.520
if you're giving it back or if
you're really just renting it

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.300
or it's in a unique market that
has particular characteristics

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.780
like film prints.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.310
But I think it is the
universalization of this,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.970
what should be an exceptional
circumstance, that's the problem.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.040
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, just a couple
of points I'm just curious about.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.760 position:56%
So-- I mean in Vernor there was--
as a recall, there was a requirement

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.300
that purchaser destroy
the copies when they--

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.190
the original copies when
they purchased the upgrades.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.300 position:56%
So there was-- the court did mention
that sort of restriction which seems

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.600
to me similar to what was--

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.900
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.380
But at the same time you can't
just say that you're required

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.770
but there's no actual enforcement.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.990
I mean, as far as I
know, if you just say

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.880
that just adding a requirement of
distraction to a contract is enough

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.750
to get you into that special
circumstance, then people just

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.220
that every time and it
won't really be enforced.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.750
I think the point is that there
has to be an economic reality

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.700
that controls whether or not a sale
has taken place, not merely words.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.060
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So, just
a follow-up question.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.380 position:56%
So I wonder if you could-- So what
the software folk say is that, well,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.250
if we can't license it, then
things like academic versions

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:39.220
of software become unviable
where, you know, you sell someone,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.690
you know, $149 copy of Microsoft
Word with the understanding

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.490
that they're not going to use
it for commercial purposes

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.390
if you don't have some sort of
license that enforces that, right.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.690
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: So two things.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.720
You can still have a contract,
just the contract only applies

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.020
to the person who ended--
who entered into the contract

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.170
and it doesn't apply to all
potential downstream users.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.630
So if you do sell something to
someone at a discount and then just

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.430 position:56%
up and reselling it into the general
market, you can use contract law

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.650
to go after them but I think
it would be inappropriate

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.930 position:56%
to go five owners down the line and
start using copyright against people

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.290
who have no idea, never
entered into that contract.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.550
And second, you know, yes, there
are certain business models

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.000
that might be easier for sellers
if they have certain legal rights

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.960
but that doesn't-- that's
not a slam dunk argument

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.110
that those rights should exist and
in fact in other areas like books

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.380
and textbooks we do have special
academic editions or pricing

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.560
and it seems to work just fine.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.550
There is no concept that
when you buy a textbook,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.850
you don't really own it.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.630
And in fact, you know,
I think anyone who used

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.840
to be a student thinks it's great
that you can buy a used textbook

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.850
or sell your textbook
when you're done with it.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.170
And I just don't see why we need
special software-specific doctrines

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.670
except when they are
specifically codified by statute,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.120
where there's notion that you
don't own a thing that you bought,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.470
does not come from the statute.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.980
That is entirely a
judge-made doctrine.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:08.160
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Why don't
we move on to Mr. Band?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Thank you.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.240
So for ORI where this--

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.730
the relationship of contract

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.450
to those issues most obvious
is the first-sale doctrine

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.850
which applies to owners of copies.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.110
And so if you have software
embedded in a device

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.970
and the software is just
licensed but not sold,

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.320
then the first-sale doctrine
arguably does not apply

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.260
to that piece of software and so
you can't transfer the software

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.980
when you're transferring
the rest of the good.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.830
And so that makes it
difficult to sell--

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.550
to sell the product in
the secondary market.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.520
And so that's, you know,
really where we see that issue.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.920
And as John said, really
the economic realities

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:02.060
of the transaction are that
when you buy the device,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.200
you're buying the copy
of the software,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.500
you're not expected to return it.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:12.910
And it seems that obviously
that, you know, if you're able

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:19.570
to keep the device for its useful
life, let's say if it's 10 years

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.370 position:56%
but let's say-- you know, then if
you want to after five years sell it

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.590
to someone else who could
benefit from the other five years,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.110
you should be able to do so.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.180
And so-- But when you
have a contract--

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.760
when you have this
contractual restriction,

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.590
not only do you have
problem that it--

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.280
that could be breaching a contract
but on top of that you're not able

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.210
to take advantage of
the first-sale doctrine.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.880
So, figuring out the
license piece is--

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.320
or this contractual
piece is critical

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.890
to allowing the alienability of
this piece of personal property.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.920
And then just-- secondarily,
you know,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.720
we had talked in the last
session and a lot of people talked

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.090
about reverse engineering
and interoperability and how

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.570
that isn't-- have the
copyright law so clear on that

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.850
and we'll talk a little bit more
about that in the next session.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.380
But I just wanted to point
out that almost every piece

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.490
of software that's
distributed whether just

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.700
as on the standalone basis
or if it's in a device,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.650
the license agreement almost
always contains a prohibition

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.360
on reverse engineering
for any purpose.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.490
So, you know, it's all well and
good that the jurisprudence says

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.210
that it might not be a
copyright infringement

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:46.320 position:56%
but if you have these pervasive
license agreements that prohibit you

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.190
from engaging in that activity,
obviously there's a tension.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.760
Now, the question is, getting
to second question, you know,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.400
what has been the real
impact on that?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.300 position:56%
Now with respect to these
restrictions on reverse engineering,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.960
the license restrictions, you
know, there has been litigations,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.820
the Bowers v. state case.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.460
And one of the issue there was--

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.670
is the license prohibition

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.390
on reverse engineering is preempted
and, you know, the truth is that--

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.190
you know, in that case, two
judges say not preempted,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.400
one judge said yes it is preempted.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.690
I think that that's one of
those really complicated areas

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.310
that I would hope the
study would start delving

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.510
into about this relationship of
when our contract term is preempted

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.370
by the copyright act
and starting to think

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.440
about that and look at that more.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.710
But I think that that is
an issue that, you know,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.190
when you counsel clients, you
have talk about and you say, well,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.820
there's this argument,
there's that argument and,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.300
you know, do what you need to do.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.340
And I have a feeling a lot of--

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.070
you know, there are some people who
do go ahead and reverse engineer

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.260
and sort of hope that it's in the
event that there's a litigation

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.710
that will be found to be preempted.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.250
And I imagined there are other
people who are more risk averse

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.470
and are not reverse engineering

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.750
because they don't
want to take that risk.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.050
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Sorry.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.970
Is it your understanding that a
violation of such a contract term

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:27.470 position:56%
against reverse engineering would be
just a breach of contract or would

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.110
that be-- is that somehow tied
to copyright infringement?

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.800
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, I think
there's case law that would suggest

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.080
that it could be both,
meaning if it seemed to be--

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.210
if it's a valid restriction
in your--

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.220
you know, I think there is a
case law that would suggest

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.920
that it would be not only
both breach of contract

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.420
and a copyright violation--
copyright infringement.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.720
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Sorry.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.020
Even if it were otherwise fair use?

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.970
I mean, if the reverse engineering
were deemed to be fair use,

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.350
it would still be infringement?

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.650
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Right.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.040
I could-- Again, the argument would
be because you're going against--

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.380
you don't have-- you
might have the copyright--

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.770
you would have the copyright
but because you have--

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:16.580 position:56%
you know, you agreed not to do it
right, you know, I'm not-- I would--

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.240
I think it would be-- you know, it
would be an issue to be determined

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.580
but I think that certainly there
would be some who would argue

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.350
that that would be an
infringement as well.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.180
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Sort of a
step back from legal issues

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.860
and getting into the specifics.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.250
In terms of these licenses,
how prevalent are they,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.290
how often do they have sort
of restrictive language

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.830
about reverse engineering or
restrictive language that sort

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.570
of specific to copyright?

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.260
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: I wouldn't say

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.200
that I obviously haven't
done a complete survey

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.620
but I would be shocked if
the vast majority of programs

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.090
that are distributed,
you know, whether by--

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:07.610
you know, I will be surprised
if it didn't have a--

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.810
every license that I have
seen, every software license

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.890
that I have seen includes a
prohibition on reverse engineering.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.160
It is-- You know, as John would
say, you know, this is boilerplate.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.550
You just automatically include it.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.920
I'm sure all of Mr.
Zuck's members when they--

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.850
of the vast majority when they
distribute their apps, I mean,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.900
it's just-- you know, it's part of
the template, you prohibit people

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.340
from reverse engineering.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.960
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Well, just as
sort of a data point, you know,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.830 position:56%
not to bring up the four-letter word
but in the rulemaking proceeding.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.580
We have had a finding that
for ECU and automobiles

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.460
that there were no licenses
associated with those at the time,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.500
so we're-- it would be very
helpful to us to have sort

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:00.070
of specific examples of industries
or specific contracts themselves

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.360
that are attached to
these products and sort

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.770
of the restrictive covenants
that are in those agreements.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.700
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Also I know--
because I can't speak from the--

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.640
for automotive industry because
I'm not as familiar with that

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:26.000 position:56%
but I certainly know on the computer
area almost whenever you're buying

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.450
certainly-- whenever you're--
when you're acquiring the computer

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.920 position:56%
and then certainly whenever you're--

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.870
you know, all those licenses
that you're always clicking

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.300
out whenever you're-- you know,
any update you get, you're clicking

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.960
on a license-- of course I never
bother reading that just like none

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.550
of us ever read any of those
licenses that we're clicking

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.130
on our agreement to but
I would be surprised

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.030
if all those software license
did not include a prohibition

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.330
on reverse engineering.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.080
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: I'd like to open
that question to everyone just

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.040
to get a sense of because, you
know, we understand that this--

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.800
these exists in general
software context but to sort

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.900
of narrow the inquiry into sort of
software-enabled consumer products

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:15.800 position:56%
and how prevalent this is in that
context would be incredibly helpful.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.640
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.380
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Yeah, I mean
I debated with a response simply

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.900
because I don't have any data, I
don't have any information in terms

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.380
of how prevalent reverse
engineering prohibitions are

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.520
in embedded software licenses
as opposed to other types

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.790
of software licenses and not
to mention the difficulty

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.640
that we talked about in the
first session about making

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.790
that distinction between
software and embedded software.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:50.020
But I actually will not disagree
with Mr. Band in terms of the fact

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.140
that the reverse engineering
prohibitions, you do find them

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.030
in many, many if not virtually
all software licenses.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.770
And there's a reason for that,

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.570
which is most people don't
care about reverse engineer.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.010
When you get a mass market
software included and embedded

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.770
over how many people
want to go ahead

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.640 position:56%
and reverse engineer the software
in their toaster or their thermostat

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.760
as example was used before
or something like that.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.520
It allows software companies to
go ahead and with a certain level

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.280
of comfort be able to include
their software in those products.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.120
So there are significant benefits
not only to the software companies,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.890
not only to the hardware
manufacturers

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.320
but most importantly their
benefits to most consumers.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.940
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: So, along those
lines, what are the benefits

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.060
and the drawbacks of having
these license agreements attached

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.250
to the products then, beyond sort
of-- both in the copyright context

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.920
and outside of the
copyright context?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.220
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
So you're taking

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.200
about beyond just reverse
engineering now in terms

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.700
of the value of these licenses.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.950
I mean, I think it's important
to note that, you know,

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.230
the software license will
be-- is one component in--

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.760
if we're talking embedded software
in the larger scheme of things

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.230
in terms of the hardware itself.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:16.120
And if you look at a lot of these
software licenses, for instance,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.770
we talked about transfer
and prohibition on transfer,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.830
most of them actually
do allow transfer,

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.810
they may have certain conditions
attached to those transfers

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.030
and a lot of those have to do
with, you know, with consumer--

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.980
you know, consumer protections
perhaps more than anything.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.210
I think it was interesting that
the gentlemen from public knowledge

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.470
and I think maybe Jonathan
as well, maybe,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.560
talked about the fact there's value
in having to return the product

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.530
or having to destroy the product.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.100
And if I was really, really
interested in the fact that the--

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.850 position:56%
from gentleman from public knowledge
talked about, his big issue was

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.930
that there was no actual
enforcement of that.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.790
And, oh my gosh, I mean,
you know, public knowledge,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.670
I understand represents consumers

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.990
but now it's encouraging
software companies to go knocking

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.200
on consumer's doors and
saying, "Did you destroy that?"

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.030
And I don't think that's
anything anybody wants to do.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.540
It is certainly not consumers
and not the software industries.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.880
So, in terms of having to
return the software to prove

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.750
that it's a license makes
very little practical sense

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.940
and it's just a burden on
consumers and frankly a burden

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:35.410 position:56%
on the software owners, also, having
to destroy it, also, you know,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.590
comes with its difficulties as
well in terms of, OK, you know,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.260
you then have prove that it was
destroyed or something like that.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.240
And when you're talking about a
lot of these software products

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.260
at the pace that technology
is moving, do you really need

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.170
to destroy that software to
prove that this is a license

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.380
at some point, very, very
soon that software is going

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.980
to be obsolete anyway
and have to be updated?

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.170 position:56%
I mean, we talked about a little bit
of how quickly software is updated

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.640
and how quickly technology moves.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.920
So, why do we need these
sort of artificial--

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.910
to include these artificial
requirements

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.640
to show that something license.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.880
I do think the Vernor test is the
good test, is an accurate test

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.940
of when something-- when the
software license should be enforced

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.880
under the copyright
law when it shouldn't.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.910
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: So can I
ask you the question I ask,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.600
I think it was Mr. Band, which
was if someone violates a ban

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.580
on reverse engineering,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.030
if that reverse engineering
would otherwise be fair use?

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.800
Is that just a violation
of the contract

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.860 position:56%
or is that a copyright infringement?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.160
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Yeah.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.460
So I would have a hard
time believing

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.760 position:56%
that would be copyright infringement

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.960
when you have a court saying
that this is fair use.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.190
I mean, I don't see
how that's possible.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.650
I don't know that we've had any
litigation in that area, but--

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.790 position:56%
so I take a slightly or maybe
totally different view than Mr. Band

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.000
on that particular issue.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.300
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: I assume
that's an answer

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.010
that would make Mr. Band happy.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.310
[ Laughter ]

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.080
Keith Kupferschmid: So
advocating for each other.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.010
That was a joke for the record.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.970
[ Laughter ]

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.100
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Why don't
we move around the room

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.180
since we have a lot of cards up?

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.630
So we'll move on with Mr. Harbeson.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.930
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: I
do want to speak.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.520
I just want to make sure that
I'm going to be going back

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.970
to the top level question,
so make sure that were.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:35.430
I want to thank the office for
letting me come here to speak

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:41.510
because I am representing
the Music Library Association

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.550
which you might not expect to see

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.720
at a hearing called
Software-Enabled Consumer Products.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.240
And we're here because
we believe that the--

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.870
not withstanding its
name the study is bigger

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.500
than software-related
consumer products.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.700
And this is-- So I'd like
to invite the room to take--

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.680
to go to one upper level of
abstraction and think of this

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:19.260 position:56%
in terms of the broader way in which
we're allowing contracts to affect--

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:26.240
allowing nonnegotiable end
user license agreement,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.110
especially to create a
parallel system of copyright

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.410
without the limitations and
exceptions that are built in.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.310
And we've-- you've already been
discussing this to a fair amount.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:46.920
I want to raise our issue which
is that in many cases, there are--

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:53.330
there is music and especially sound
recordings, which have for years

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.230
and years and years libraries have
been collecting this music on disc

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.790
and then tape and then
tape and then disc again.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.760
And we've lent it and we've
done-- we've taken care--

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.610 position:56%
we've preserve that we've done of
all of the things that libraries do.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:18.580 position:56%
Along comes the digital distribution
services such as iTunes and Amazon,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:26.870
then you have Spotify of the world,
and in some cases we have found

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:32.670 position:56%
that music distributors are deciding
only to distribute their music,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.790
their sound recordings
especially, through these services.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.980
I'm actually just talking about
sound recordings not musical works,

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.080
only looking to distribute
their sound recordings

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.670
through these services.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.450 position:56%
Now, in the case where they are also
distributed on a physical medium

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.740
that we can purchase,
that's not a problem.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.040
We can buy them.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.250
We can distribute them
the way we always have.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.890
But, when they're only distributed

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.520
through this digital
distribution services

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.450
and that's the only way
the public can have access

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:07.040 position:56%
to these sound recordings, that
creates a big problem for libraries,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.370
and this has been on
the verge of a trend.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.670
It's not quite there yet.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.240
It is not, however,
parade of horribles.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.570
It's actually in the
record we have--

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:21.620
you know, on the record a link
in our comments, we have a link

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.570
to a list of works
that we've collected

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.320 position:56%
that are being distributed this way.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.900
In particular, I'd like to put on--
to discuss one that we discussed

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.130
in our comments which is the case

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:41.710
of a Grammy Award winning sound
recording of Gustavo Dudamel

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.130
in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:50.850
We've raised this in copyright
office proceedings before.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.850
This is a Grammy Award winning
sound recording produced

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:59.350
by Deutsche Grammophon in which a
couple of our members spent a lot

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.190
of grant money trying to track
down the license for this.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.290
It was only being distributed in--

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.960
by iTunes and the iTunes software
license makes it impossible

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.150
for libraries to enter into
the agreement because it's

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.770
for end users only when
libraries are not end users.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.120
Furthermore, even if we could
enter into the agreement,

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.130
it doesn't let us do
anything with it.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.410 position:56%
So, our-- my colleagues at the
University of Washington spent a lot

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.120
of time tracking down the--

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.760
someone who could give
us-- give them a license.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.660
They went to iTunes and
iTunes said you have

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.260
to talk to Deutsche Grammophon.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.260
Deutsche Grammophon, you have
to talk to, I think, Universal.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.290 position:56%
And finally after a large train of--

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.070
a lot of work, they finally
tracked down, I think it was--

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.020
yes, it was Universal
Music Group which--

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.080
and I quote, the article
that my colleagues published,

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.020 position:56%
"They agreed to license the material
under the following conditions

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.520
that no more 25% of the album's
content could be licensed

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.520
and the license would be valid
for no more than two years.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.210
Furthermore, a $250 processing
fee would be charged in addition

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.640
to the unspecified licensing
fee that would have been more

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.940
than the processing fee."

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.300
So now we're over $500
for a two-year license

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:32.080 position:56%
for not even the entire work for a
Grammy Award winning sound recording

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.870
and for work that the public
could purchase for $10 on Amazon--

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.050
well, purchase for $10 on Amazon.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.300
Libraries do important work.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.940
We cannot allow these
kinds of licenses

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.400
to circumvent the good
work that libraries do.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.590
Right now the problem is only in
music libraries that we know of,

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:02.240 position:56%
with sound recordings, but there are
numerous companies that are putting

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.440 position:56%
out digital works and who knows when
they'll stop making CDs or DVDs.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.390
I keep hearing about the
forthcoming death of the CD.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:18.560
So, I-- we are advocating for a
very narrow exception to the law

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:25.350 position:56%
that would allow those-- the
provisions of nonnegotiable licenses

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:32.200
to be-- to not be enforceable
only in the event that they are--

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.420
that there is no other means
for a library to acquire it.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.720
And I can talk about that later.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.020
Thank you.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.320
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Thank
you, Mr. Harbeson.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.020 position:56%
I'd like to ask a broader question--

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.570
and maybe this speaks
to the issues you raised

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.890
or others may want to jump in.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.370
And that's the question
of privity of contract.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.360
I mean, if you're taking a license
for the software that's embedded

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.670
in the product that you purchased,
what impact if any does that have

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.390
on the downstream users that
Mr. Band raised earlier.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.450
Are they bound by these
licensing agreements,

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.130
do they run with the product itself
or is this an issue of contract

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.880
as Mr. Bergmayer suggested
that there's a distinction

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.190
between licensing and contracts,

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.200
which I'm not quite sure I
see the difference there?

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.980
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: To
answer that question,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.280
I think it's pretty simple.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.580
License is just permission

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.940
to do something you otherwise
don't have the legal right to do.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.020
And conditions can be put on
that, but it simply unilateral.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.870
There's no need for there
to be a meeting of the minds

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.690
or consideration on both
sides, or anything like that.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.340
A contract is a contract
that you like--

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.640
you learned about in law school.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.830
I think in software typically you
have one agreement which is both.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:48.070
You know, just to answer sort of
your questions, I think the failure

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.530
to distinguish between a license
and a contract and the allowance

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:57.760
in the software context uniquely of
sellers to reserve ownership rights

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.740
of physical goods that they sell
leads to issues like the core

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.540
in MDY ended up saying, "OK,
well, we don't want to say

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.540 position:56%
that any single tiny minor violation

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.750
of a contractual term
automatically leads

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.060
to copyright infringement
in the case of software.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.020
Because in the case of software if
you don't own it you did a license

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.370
to operate it and you need--

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.380 position:56%
and you simply need a license to use
the product in its ordinary course

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.150
and the court really
saw the coincidence

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.670
of that would be pretty bad so they
said, OK, well, you actually have

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.670
to look at it and you have to
determine, is this a covenant

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.780
on a license or is it a contractual
condition and you have to sort

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.700
of piece together and
like dissect the document

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.000
to figure out the difference.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.610
And I think that is a sort
of very difficult task,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:46.090
which you could avoid if you simply
get rid of the underlying problem

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.880
of the reservation of ownership
because in the normal course

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.640
of action, like for example
if I'm a movie theater

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.560
and I violate the contracts
that allows me

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.300
to publicly perform the movie and
then I publicly perform it anyway,

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.600
the idea that that kind

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.170
of contractual violation
could give rise

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.430
to a copyright infringement
is not a problem.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.020
It only becomes a problem
when you need a license simply

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.800
to use something in its
ordinary course of operation,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.730
which by all sort of common
sense you thought that you owned.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.690
So, I'm not sure if I'm sort
of getting at the distinction

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.580
that I see between a license,
but I think that the failure

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.380
to properly distinguish and
understand what a license is

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.200
versus what a contract is

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.310
by including deferral
appellate court says has led us

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.970 position:56%
to this very difficult legal
situation where it is very difficult

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.190
to tell where what consumer
rights are and whether or not

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.110
and which particular
provisions might run

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.320
with the chattel as it were.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.960
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: So what would
be your solution to that issue?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.880
Would it be sort of, you know,
clarifying that regardless

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.140 position:56%
of these licenses that, for example,
in the conducts of Section 109

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.800
or Section 117, you
know, that, you know,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.100
the consumer would be considered an
owner in those context, at least?

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.400
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yes.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.700
I think that is the solution.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.030
For the most part consumers who buy
physical items whether it's media

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.100
or consumer products, I think
they typically own those products.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:17.130
Routinely, judges and the common
law has historically always said,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.700
you know, things like, "Oh, you
know, this isn't really a sale,

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.310
it's a thousand year lease,"
like that doesn't work.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.260
Like it doesn't matter that the two
parties agree amongst themselves

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.740
and their sophisticated party is
that negotiate and sort of write it

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.040
down in a piece of paper.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.340
It's not true.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.760
You can't make something that is
false true just by writing it down.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.270
And you can't take something that
is a sale and label it not-sale

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:40.280
and then have all sorts
of legal consequences

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.040
that affect people including
people who are never even privity

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.380
to that original agreement.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.230
&gt;&gt; John Riley: Is there a
distinction now between the types

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.960
of contracts that, you know,
attempt to expand what we think

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.570
of as copyright rights and
those that are short of that?

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.050
You know, when we talk
about type of contract

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.360
that says you can't sell a book
for less than a dollar forever

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.820
that would be expanding your
traditional rights, right?

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.900
But some of these other, you
know, licenses that we talk

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.590
about are short of the full-term
of copyright, for example.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.970 position:56%
You know, you could use a work
let's say it's a downloaded textbook

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.600
on your Kindle for the
term of your semester.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.900
Is there a distinction there?

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.200
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Well, I mean,
I think the reason we keep talking

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.810 position:56%
about this in the copyright context
is because of the RAM copy doctrine,

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.330
which says that if
you're not the owner,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.050 position:56%
you need a license to use a product.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.240
And that's not true in any
other context, you know?

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.450
Even if I don't own a
book, even if I stole it,

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.470
simply reading it does not
constitute an infringement.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.640
But in the case of software,
if you're not the owner

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.150
of the physical item, the
material object of the copy,

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.570 position:56%
you need a license and therefore all
sorts of crazy conditions can be put

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.840 position:56%
on that license and simply
infringing anyone of them could lead

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.430
to an instance of copyright
infringement.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.040
And it's a very software-specific
notion that comes

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.890 position:56%
out of this concept that simply to
use a product in its ordinary course

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.070
of operation, somehow
triggers copyright.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.590 position:56%
And that's true uniquely in software

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.140
and I think that's why this is
a software-specific problem.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.450
I'm not going to say that
there can't be other problems

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:13.400
with over broad contracts
or licenses, but, you know,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.850
I'm just really focused on
this concept of ownership

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:20.390 position:56%
and RAM copies leading to, you know,
minor infractions, perhaps leading

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:23.850
to copyright infringement in the
case that's unique to software.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.970
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Well, we
should get some more thoughts

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.270
on these issues.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.220
So, let's move on to Mr. Mohr.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.580
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Yeah, there's--

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.440
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
Turn on your--

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.730
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Several
points that look nothing

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.520
like what I was originally
going to say.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.130
A couple of things, I mean, first

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.630
of all I think there has been
a fair amount of healthy candor

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.870
that the complaints
going on here far broader

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.380
than what this examination
is supposed to be about,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.280
which is embedded software.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.970
And these are complaints
about licensing generally.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:05.390
I've seen reflected a greater
degree of certainty than I have

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.500
about whether a particular
restriction will trigger

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.590
infringement liability, because
there are covenants and conditions.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.850
And covenants trigger
contractual liability

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.500
and conditions will trigger
infringement liability.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.100
And so-- And then in that
context even if the infringement--

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.440
even if there's an
allege of infringement,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.870
I honestly don't know the answers
to whether an affirmative defense

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:36.000
in that particular situation
might excuse that infringement

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.900
and then lead only to
a contract liability.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.270
I don't know the answer
off the top of my head.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.400
But I think that's the way that--

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:51.410
that's one way that the
courts could resolve this.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:57.460
The second thing that I confess
some confusion to is knowing

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.650
when a sale and a license occurs.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:05.540
The problem is that there
seems to be some belief

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.850
that there's a unified field
theory of software licensing

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.580
and that every-- most-- It's true.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.840
Most pieces of software
are licensed,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.600
but there are situations
when they're not.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.250
And the courts have done a
good job at sorting that out,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.430
different facts, different
results, different types of media

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.290 position:56%
with particular different commercial
customs, different results.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:32.350
That seems to here have
worked reasonably well.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:38.650
And so, now, they-- our friends
have problems with the existence

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:43.900
of licensing generally, and
that's fine, but there's no--

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:49.880
it's a big jump to say from
there that, OK, well, you know,

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.880
embedded software is
a special problem

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.510
that needs special
rules, it doesn't.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.050
And I think that's-- I'm not sure
that Congress necessarily agrees

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:03.480
with that premise and
certainly the courts haven't.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.660 position:56%
And then there's-- finally there was
two little things about ownership

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.700
that I wanted to mention.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.600
The first has to do with
unforeseen consequences.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.090
I mean, I think one of the reasons
that open source software works is

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.000
that because the license
restrictions run with the copy.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.100
And so, if someone becomes an
owner of a particular copy,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.820
they're no longer bound by
the license restrictions.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.530
So at that point, how does
the community survive?

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.140
What's the incentive
for the community--

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.760
for the open source
community to survive?

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.340
And the second thing that distract
me, again, in sort of making it

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.270
out that there's this, oh, there's
this software boogieman that--

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.750
I'm not sure that's
right either because--

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.100
and an example of that is 512.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.360
There are all kinds of works
now that are reproduced in RAM.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.010
That's not unique to software.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.810
And that may be a problem
that our friends have

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.190
with the copyright generally.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.280
But again, that protection
of content

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.010
on computer networks is
frankly essential to many of my

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.080
and other folks-- member's
well-being.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.350
And that's not-- that is not
a particular provision the law

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.370
that were inclined to reexamine
our application, rather.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.050
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: I had
a follow up question for you.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.350
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Yup.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: I guess anyone
who comes out for you about the--

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.170
So we're-- here, we're really
trying to limit this to this kind

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.000
of consumer products and embedded
software, which has we heard

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.460
from the first panel is
apparently very difficult

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.690
if possible at all to draw.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.450
But a lot of this discussion
is really way beyond that kind

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.930
of situation and Vernor and Krauss
[assumed spelling], they both dealt

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.230
with the software itself.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.200
So you're selling-- you
know, there was a license

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.990
for the actual software
versus a sale.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.030
And I wonder what the
opinions would be or the kind

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.420
of legal analysis could be
based on something else,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.500
like you buy the refrigerator,
it has some sort of software

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.720
to make the ice cubes
come out or whatnot.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.100 position:56%
When you buy the refrigerator you're
not signing a license or anything,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.020
it just kind of coming
through and kind

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.790
of what the different
analysis might be.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.460
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: I think
in that context, I mean,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:09.210
the analysis would be-- I would
expect it to be context-specific.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.600
So in other words, all of
those decisions would be made

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:19.300 position:56%
against a backdrop of sales of goods
that have occurred for decades.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.760
And so, I agree, I
think slapping a label

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.240
on a refrigerator saying this
refrigerator is licensed,

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.940
I'm not sure that would--
I'm not sure that would work.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.010
But that's not what's
really happening.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.080
I mean, when that refrigerator
contains, essentially,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.180
a functioning computer and
that computer starts develop--

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.140 position:56%
results in a continuing relationship
with the software provider,

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.580
for example, over, I don't
know, what you had in--

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:53.010
what the UPC codes are and you're--
that you put in your refrigerator

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.100
and now it knows what you've been
eating, how often you're eating,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.310
whether or not you're off your
diet plan, all of these other kinds

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.860
of personal information,
that's an appropriate--

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.290
very appropriate situation
for a license agreement.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.740 position:56%
That is also a way that the
manufacturer maintains the integrity

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.040
of its product by kind of
setting the terms under which

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.220
that relationship occurs
or entitled to do that.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.500
And if consumers don't like
that relationship, there is no--

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.560
they can go and buy
different refrigerator.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.950
That's why we don't see this
as a-- you know, we don't--

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.900
as a group, we generally
don't see a problem here,

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.360
it seems to be working OK.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.590
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr. Zuck.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.280
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thanks.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:41.600
You do come around past what
we thought you're going to say

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.650
by the time the discussion evolves.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.110
But I think that, again,
taking a kind of step back,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.030
there's the entire history of
the software industry that comes

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.590
into play when looking
at one of the--

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.610
some of the standard practices
that we see like, you know,

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.430 position:56%
prohibitions on reverse engineering.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.800 position:56%
And you have to remember that that's
a legacy of tremendous amounts

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.940
of software piracy and people
just trying to empower themselves

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.740
in any way possible to try
and stem the flow of that.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.960
I also think that it's a little
bit specious to say that a copy--

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.680
a digital copy of something
is really to same thing

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.860
as a physical object, and where
this really bares itself out is

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.960 position:56%
that the enterprises, for example,
have one copy of a piece of software

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.710
and can buy multiple
licenses for its use.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.170 position:56%
These are different keys, et cetera,

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.200
that I put in to make
use of the software.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.750
So it's a little bit like you're
allowed to make as a many copies

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.450
of this encrypted book as you
want to, but what I'm going

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:42.120
to sell you is the key that allows
you to decrypt, you know, the--

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.820
which letters to read to read the
book or something like that, right?

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.900
And so, I think there is a
distinction that it has allowed

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.030
for very dynamic business
in terms of business models,

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.740
whether the example you brought
in terms of educational pricing,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.030
enterprise pricing, et cetera,
there's different support plans,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.890
there's also a history of support
for software that's very different

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.570
than it is for physical products.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.380
And there's reputational
things to consider as well.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.780
I mean, we have a member drink mate
that actually made an overt attempt

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.930
to have an open license for people
to create different versions

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.330
of the implementation software

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.320
on what is essentially a personal
breathalyzer device, right?

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.220
And what they found over time
is that they weren't able

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.510
to maintain a standard of
quality among these sort

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.420
of publicly provided
versions of software devices

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.140
and they suffered a reputational
harm as a result, and had to

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.950
and were only enable to because
of it being a license to bring

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.470
that back in house and make sure

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.160
that only their software was
associated with those devices,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.480
we saw that they could recuperate

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.300
from that reputational
harm that they suffered.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.990
So I think there's a lot
that's unique about software.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.550
I think as we move forward
into the internet of things

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.580
and embedded software and devices,

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.600
you're going to see more
experimentation in business models,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.310 position:56%
and some of the legacy practices
will start to fall away because some

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.100
of the legacy dangers will
fall away at the same time.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.710
But I think all of that is going
to happen much more quickly

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.770
into much more dynamic
fashion than any kind

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.540
of legislative effort would happen.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.040
So again, as we said
in the last panel,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.750 position:56%
I think that the existing mechanisms
that are in place both in terms

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:19.130
of contract law and copyright
exceptions, provide a more fluid

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.440
and a better place to
deal with these issues

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.990
than some kind of legislative
solution.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.920
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr.
Perzanowski, I think you're in

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.360
and we'll go to Mr. Bockert.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.570
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: So there
are a couple of distinctions

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.590
that I think are useful to draw
that I think at some points

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.410
in our discussion have
been confused.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.450
So first I think we
need to distinguish

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:43.420
between licensing software and
licensing copies of software.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.250
And these are two very
different things.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:51.300
I also think we have to distinguish
between questions of interpreting

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.900
and enforcing contracts
on the one hand,

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.190 position:56%
and what I think should be the
crucial question for this discussion

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.460
which is how we determine whether a
transfer of ownership has occurred,

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:07.180
when it comes to particular
copies of software, right.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.780
And one place I think it make sense
to look is the statute itself.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.230
You know, unfortunately, for
better or maybe for worse,

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:19.260
the copyright act does
not define ownership

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.420
in the context of consumers.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:26.260
It doesn't define transfers
of ownership.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.240
But there is language that's useful
in this interpretive question,

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.320
and that language is
in 1063 itself, right?

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.270
1063 defines the kinds
of distributions,

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.680
the copyright law recognizes when
it comes to particular copies,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.330
and it divides the universe
into two kinds of distributions.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.730
There are sales and other transfers
of ownership on the one hand,

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:56.330
and there is rental, lease,
and lending on the other.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:00.350
So, every transfer of a copy,
every distribution of a copy,

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.940
is either a transfer of ownership

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.960
or it's a rental, a
lease, or a lending.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.160
That's really clear
from the statute.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.800
So the question is if someone wants
to license a copy, which one is it?

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.110
And I think if you look at it

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.790
from that perspective it's actually
a much easier question to answer,

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:27.020
into the idea of a licensed
copy, is really a myth, right?

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.320
That's not a real thing.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.190
It's not a transactional form
that the copyright act recognizes.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.410
You might say that there are
certain kinds of leases or rentals

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:42.950
or lendings that you want to use
the label license to characterize,

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.480
but there's no such
thing as a licensed copy.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.310
The software industry has
been pretty successful

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.760
in convincing some courts
that that's a real thing.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.690
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: But how
would you-- Sorry.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.790
How would you explain why is then,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:46:01.120
where they essentially had
perpetual possession of the movie,

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.250
the film prints, but
under restrictions.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:05.550
And the courts are--

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.850
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
You're talking about Wise?

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.150
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, Wise.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.450
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: So
we could characterize--

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.180
we could look at the facts of
Wise and say that that is a lease,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.080
that that is a lending, that there
are certain restrictions, right?

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.150
So, what is it that separates a
transfer of ownership from one

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:26.960 position:56%
of these other kinds of more
temporary time limited transactions?

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.490
And it might be an
ongoing obligation to pay.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.100
It might be that there is some
sort of durational limit, right,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.670
at some point you've got
to give the thing back.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:41.190
That fits, I think, reasonably
well into the common understanding

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.730
of leasing or rental, right?

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:48.890
It's not a transfer of ownership,
if when the thing is given

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.100
to you it is made explicitly clear
that at a certain point you have

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.940
to return the item, you
have to destroy the item,

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.830
that's not a transfer
of ownership, right?

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.740
Ownership entails perpetual
possession,

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.790
no ongoing obligation to pay.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.510
When those two factors are present,

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.060
what you have is a transfer
of ownership, right?

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.740
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So is it your
position that both Vernor

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.040
and Krauss are incorrect?

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.630 position:56%
Not the decision but the reasoning
of both of those cases is incorrect?

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.620
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
I'm happy to say

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.820
that the reasoning in
Vernor is incorrect.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.840
I think the reasoning
in Krauss is less clear

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.190
than it should be, although I'm--

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.010
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: But Krauss
acknowledged that there could be--

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:30.890
I mean it didn't find the license
in that case but it acknowledged

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.540
that there could be licenses.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.840
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
Yeah that's right.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.690
Yeah, I think the conceptual
framework that courts used

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:38.430 position:56%
to answer this question is confused.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:42.490
A couple of other points here.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.680
You know, one of the questions
that came up is, you know,

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:53.050
what's the value of a license
that purports to deny a transfer

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.650
of ownership to a consumer?

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.610
And there's a lot of value there.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.600
It's value that I think
we should question

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.220
from an overall social
utility standpoint, right?

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.640
It's about restricting resale,

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.740
it's about controlling
aftermarket products,

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.010
it is about controlling
the market for services.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.600
It might be about price
discrimination

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.130
and we can have a debate about the
merits of price discrimination.

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:27.610
There are other means other
than denying consumers the right

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.360
to own the things that
they purchased

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.160
to achieve price discrimination.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.520 position:56%
I think it's worth pointing out that
the Supreme Court was really clear

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.910
in Kirtsaeng that price
discrimination is not among the

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:45.120 position:56%
rights that copyright holders get to
enjoy by virtue of their copyright.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.420
So if--

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.720
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: If you would
acknowledge that there are--

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.360
I mean this is sort of like
basic economics, right?

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.860
I mean there are consumer
benefits to allowing

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.160
for price discrimination.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.330
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
There certainly can be,

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:58.190
but I would not say that price
discrimination is necessarily

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.890 position:56%
overall to the benefit of consumers.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.480
There are certain circumstances
where price discrimination it is

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.860
in fact very useful for consumers.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.910
But denying consumers' ownership

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:15.940
and imposing ongoing copyright
obligations is not the only way

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.240
to price discriminate.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.590
There are lots of industries
that price discriminate

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.150
that don't use copyright
law whatsoever.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:25.930
And, you know, I think we've
seen in the wake of Kirtsaeng

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.080
that price discrimination
in the market

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.040
for academic textbooks continues.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.950
There are other ways
of achieving that goal.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:40.370 position:56%
One way of achieving that goal is to
not sell products to people, right?

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.910
Don't engage in transactions
that look like sales.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.610
Engage in transactions that look

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.480
like subscriptions
that look like rentals.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.660
You know, my students have the
option to get their case books

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.650
in law school on a
rental model, right,

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:56.990 position:56%
or on an ongoing subscription model.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.110
That at least is an honest way
of engaging with consumers.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:04.110
You're not characterizing
in a transaction as a sale

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:06.760
when in fact you don't
believe that it's a sale.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.980
You know, those kinds
of transactions carry

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.900
with them expectations

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.030
that consumers think they're
getting a certain set of rights

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.070
when they buy a product, right?

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:22.310
When you go and you buy that new
refrigerator, you think you own it.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:25.520
You don't think you're entering
into an ongoing relationship

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.600
with the service provider, right?

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.840
That's what you do with
your cable company.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.570
I won't say more about what people
think of their cable companies.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:39.300
You know, but when you buy a
refrigerator, you think you own it.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.450
You think you have a
certain set of rights.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:47.290
I just-- I have a study that
was just published last Friday

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.040
that looks at this question in the
context of digital media that looks

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.450
at the Buy Now button used
prominently by Amazon and Apple,

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:59.190
and finds that consumers believe
they have the right to engage

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:05.120
in a resale with digital media
that they buy now to lend

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.160
that digital media to
others to give it away,

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.260
to leave it in their will, right?

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.140
So when you set up a transaction,
when you present it to consumers

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:20.040
in the context of a sale,
they have expectations

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.470
about what they're getting.

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.810
And the fact that some
license agreement that no one

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.470
in their right mind would invest
the time to read, you know,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.890
includes terms to the contrary
does not change those consumer

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.200
expectations, right?

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:40.330
So, this isn't to say that we can't
allow for flexible business models

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:46.340
that give software companies
the kinds of protections

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.640
that they think they need.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.940
You can look at what Adobe has done

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.700
with its Creative Suite
over the last few years.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.000
You can't buy it anymore.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.960
You can pay Adobe $50 a month
for the rest of your life

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.630
if you're creative professional
to use their software.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:00.970
And in a lot of ways, I think

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:04.590
that was really smart
decision on their part, right?

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:09.420
It avoids the problems
that they saw with resale.

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.820
It allows them a, you know,
more predictable revenue stream.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.100
It allows them to deliver
product updates

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.730
to consumers in a more
effective way.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.530
And it's a really honest
transaction.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.500
You know what you're
getting from the outset.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:28.150
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So is this the
problem that's going to diminish

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:30.880
as we go forward, because
as we move, you know,

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.030
more and more into kind of
cloud-based services the sort

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:40.800
of problems that you've identified
are kind of problems of the moment.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.260 position:56%
But, you know, we have Office 365,
there's like all sorts of other ways

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.510
in which where now
software is moving

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.490
into like cloud-based
subscription models.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.790
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski:
So in some ways--

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:52.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And then the reason I'm
asking that is because, you know,

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:56.810
if we're looking ahead, if we're
solving yesterday's problem,

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:58.800
it doesn't make very much sense.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.100
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: I'm sorry.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.830
Can I just add one
point on top of that?

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:06.420
I mean the Adobe example you
cite is a good one but sort

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.380
of the logic behind your
argument is that the physicality

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.720
of the Adobe product is gone.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.620
There is no longer a CD
that you're purchasing.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.470
It's-- You're just simply
downloading the product,

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.110
as opposed to your
refrigerator which is physical

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:19.410
in every sense the, the
word, it's going to be

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:20.710
with you for a long time.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:22.010
So is there a distinction there?

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:23.310
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: Yeah.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.610
Well, I think in the Adobe example,
you're not buying anything, right?

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.480
That transaction is absolutely on
the rental, lease, or lending side

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.980
of this divide in Section 1063.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.540
So I don't think there's
any good argument

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.150
that the consumer owns anything.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.250
You know, they're paying
for a service.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:42.210
In terms of whether this
is yesterday's problem

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.410
or tomorrow's problem, in
some ways I think for markets

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:50.470
for pure software products,
we are going to see a move

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:55.400
in this direction towards
cloud-based services.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.690
The area where I think
we need to be focusing

00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:02.600
as I think we are here
today, is what happens

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.170
when we see software
embedded in everyday products

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:08.740
that consumers use everyday, right?

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:14.430
There, there is necessarily a
kind of a physical embodiment

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.080
of the work and of the product.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.750
And so, in those circumstances,

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:25.720 position:56%
I don't think you can escape these
questions, right, because the nature

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.230
of the product embeds
that kind of physicality.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:37.010
And unless we start to see-- which
I'm doubtful about, unless we start

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:41.340
to see really explicit shift to now
you don't buy your home appliances,

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.140
you lease your home
appliances, we're going to have

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.270
to face this question of who
owns the software that makes

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.570
that product work, right?

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:52.980
The software is just as important
to the functioning of your car

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.450
or your new smart refrigerator
or your smart TV as any

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.900
of the physical component.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:06.060
So to tell consumers, sure, you own
the plastic and you own the chips

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.780
and you own the display,

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.690
but the thing that actually
makes the thing work,

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.940
the thing that actually
makes the thing valuable,

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.060
someone else controls that.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.090
That puts consumers in a really
precarious situation, right?

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:20.230
Think about-- I missed the
beginning of the first panel,

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.360
so I'm sure someone has
already mentioned revolve.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.390
But look at what happened
with that device.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:28.530
Consumers went out, they
bought this device for $300,

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.440
this home automation hub.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.740
They thought they owned it.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.070
They thought they got to use it as
long as they wanted until one day,

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.370
they got a message that said, "Oh,

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.990
that thing you bought,
it's a brick," right?

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.010
It's useless now.

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.570
Because they don't own and
they don't control the software

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.960
that makes it operate.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.560
That puts consumers in a
really precarious position.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.840
So, you know, I'm worried
about a future

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.760
where consumers have this illusion
of ongoing personal property rights

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.310
that they have enjoyed,
you know, for centuries.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:59.850
But what's really going on
and what they will learn only

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:03.180
when it is too late is that
they really have no control

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.450
over the objects that surround
them and that they rely on.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:08.750
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: So first
I'm going to announce

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:10.900
that we're extending the panel

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.090
since there're some really
good thoughts being discussed

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:20.310
but going sort of towards what
you've been talking about,

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.010
how has an-- and this is for
you and everyone else sort

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.700
of how has this played
out in the market.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.390
I think you mentioned-- I don't
know if this is sort of actual data

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:33.700
but the possibility of
the refrigerator and that

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.390
if consumers are unhappy with
the restrictions that come

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:40.350
with that refrigerator that
they can just buy a refrigerator

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:43.450
from a different seller.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:47.630 position:56%
And, you know, in the comments there
is the example of the Keurig device

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:51.810
where people were upset with their
restrictions sort of set forth

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:56.350
by Keurig and they decided
for PR reasons to move forward

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.650
in a different direction.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:01.300
So I'm really curious sort
of how the market, you know,

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.820
plays out in this sphere.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.880
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: I think the
short answer is it's too early

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.180
to tell.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.880
You know, this is all
developing as we speak.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.760
There have been instances where
consumers were up in arms enough

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:21.090
about a particular restriction that
they could effectively, you know,

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:24.090
move the needle in terms
of how a company responds.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.780
There have been other examples
where that hasn't been the case.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.990
Frankly, the big problem is these
restrictions do not become clear

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:36.510
to consumers until they are faced
with a device that doesn't behave

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.330
as they expected to, right?

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.250
So, you know, the revolve
I, I think, the clearest

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.440
and most recent example of that.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.760 position:56%
It's not the only one of the comment

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.150
that I submitted includes a
long list of consumer devices

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:55.330
where these kinds of problems
have presented themselves.

00:57:55.330 --> 00:58:00.800
So, I'm not willing today to
say that the market is going

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.540
to be capable of solving
these problems.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.610
I think in some instances it
will and in many it won't.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:11.010
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: So why don't
we move on to Mr. Bockert?

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:13.130
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
So, I think the--

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.430
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: If you just
turn on your microphone.

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:15.730
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Sorry.

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.030
So the refrigerator
example is a good one.

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.900
And you confront a variation
of the problem or this issue

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.960
in almost every merger
and acquisition

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.710
where you have a buyer going in

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:27.770
and saying I want all
your refrigerators,

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.520
you know, in this facility.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.700
And you know, in the back of
your mind, you're like, well,

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.780
each of these refrigerators
has the software in it

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.590
that when you press the button
that shoots out the ice, right?

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:39.810
And you go to the seller and you
say I'd love to see the license

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:43.370 position:56%
that covers the software that shoots
out the ice in your refrigerators.

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:48.890
And the seller, of course, says
I either had it and I lost it

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.010
or it doesn't exist at
all, they just don't know.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:53.920
And then as a buyer, you have
to ask the question, you know,

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.670
"Am I allowed to acquire this?

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:58.330
Is now the owner of that
software going to hold me up--

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.830
hold up the transaction
perhaps have a, you know,

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:05.660
a special transaction fee just
to allow it to go through?"

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.640
And, you know, in refrigerators it
may be an easy example because it's

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.700
like small amounts of money but the
larger the product gets, you know,

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.750
we can start adding
up a lot more money.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:20.060
And I think the idea is
we already have, you know,

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.580
the concepts especially, you
know, imported from patent law

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.350
like the doctrine of
exhaustion, where we can say maybe

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:29.670 position:56%
in certain cases with software, when
it's embedded in a consumer product

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.250
and it acts in a certain way
in that consumer product,

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.720
maybe the doctrine of
exhaustion can apply.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.850
So we can say, look, you
know, this is what it's doing

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:39.190
in that refrigerator,
therefore, you know,

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:42.660
the sale can go on,
it runs with the good.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.350
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: And why
don't we move back this way.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.650
Mr. Zuck.

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.950
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Sure.

00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:52.330
I know we're running
a little bit long.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:55.770
I guess, again, I get back to
the notion that there's a lot

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.070
of dynamism sort of
in the marketplace.

00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:01.330
And so if you look TiVo
as another example,

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:06.010
they were practically giving away
hardware that was in conjunction

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.200
with software as a
service that allowed

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.970
for programming and
storage of content.

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:14.620
And so, I mean, embedded in
that business model was sort

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.120
of like basically subsidizing
the hardware

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.190
with what was a software license.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:24.330 position:56%
And again, I think that you're going
to potentially see things like that

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:28.060
with refrigerators that
there's a service or, you know,

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:32.270
you connected the way or
something like that associated

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.360
with your refrigerator and
its monitoring capabilities.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.220
And I can't foresee what all
of those models are going

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.890
to be but I can imagine them.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.910
And I think to some extent,
we're going to have to rely

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:45.880
on requirements for notice and
things like that to take the place

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.560
of trying to jigger the law around.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.990 position:56%
And again, I come back to that being
the fundamental question you're

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.600
asking is whether or not there's
some fundamental change to be made

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.250 position:56%
to copyright law to accommodate
what is an incredibly dynamic market

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.990
but incredibly dynamic
business models.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:03.310
And as I said, as the risks
associated with piracy change

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:07.130
as the needs for consumers change,
I think the market will evolve

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.150
in such a way that it
will address these things.

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:13.380
I mean, the number of people
that are really affected

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.870
by the license agreement in the
refrigerator in their inability

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:21.120
to sell it, at least to
date, is not existent, right?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.420
I mean people have been selling
devices and cars to each other

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.280
that have software embedded
than for the most part.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.960
And so, again, until we really
have an identifiable problem,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.380
I think we shouldn't be
looking ahead to the solution

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.930
because we'll get it wrong.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.230
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: And Mr. Mohr.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:39.530
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Two responses,

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.080
I guess two hopefully
pretty quick points.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.610 position:56%
All right, well, so the first has to
do with the idea of licensing copies

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:54.700
on which the entire open source
and software industry is based.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.490
A wise man once said-- and
I think it was John Bond--

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:04.550
that, you know, if all the courts
come out against you've got

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:09.370
to entertain the possibility
that you're wrong.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.750
And in this particular instance,
I mean, that's the way all

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:16.040
of the cases have come out.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.170
You know, that is the-- that's
a legal reality we live in.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.260
That's a reality that
works quite well.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.470
Again, it's the model that open
source depends on and a lot

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:30.010
of our other members
depend on to make money.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:33.260
The second thing I would
suggest is to be careful--

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:38.670
very careful when you analyze
these issues about getting confused

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:43.180
between issues of consumer
protection

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.420
and issues of copyright law.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.060
So it is true that if you
in certain circumstance,

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.200
in a specific transactional
context, that the presence

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.670
of a Buy Now button could
convey an impression

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.880
that is misleading or deceptive.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.450
And it is also true the same
can be said of many things,

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.220
for example, campaign commercials.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.470
It does not follow from that
that there is any problem

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:09.730
with the copyright
system whatsoever.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.590
And I think it's important
to draw that line

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:18.290
between a particular practice in a
particular context, and this is one

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:21.150
of the things that the PTO is
going to look at because this came

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:25.760
up in the context of
their study and some kind

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.110
of inherent problem
with licensing itself.

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.440
I think those are two
very different inquiries.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.820
That's it.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.630
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr. Harbeson.

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:41.860
&gt;&gt; Eric Harbeson: I want to go back
to the refrigerator and point that,

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.170
yes, the consumer can go
find a different refrigerator

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:48.880
if she has a problem
with the licensing,

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.530
but she still needs
the refrigerator,

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:54.390
and if all of the refrigerators
can carry that--

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:58.070
some kind of unacceptable
license, she's out of luck.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:03.730
Now, to use that to once again
beg the room's indulgence,

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.110
in the case of sound recording

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:09.380
of a musical work it's
the only sound recording.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.680
It's a monopoly.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.560
This is why this is
related to copyright.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.280
If you're the only-- If you
have the exclusive right

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.650
to that particular sound
recording and my library needs

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:27.170
that particular sound recording,
there is no other way I can get it.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:31.640
That's where the consumer
protections fail.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:39.600
There is no way for the
library to serve this material.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.100
And another thing that I've heard
brought up but may have been

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.780
in an earlier panel, and
I'm sorry, if it was.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.900
But the idea that software
licenses are--

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.590
well, the software
products are updated so fast

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:01.020
and their lifespan was so
short that they really aren't--

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.480
they aren't a long-term problem.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.690
But with sound recordings which
last hopefully hundreds of years--

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.530
in some cases they lasted
more than a hundred, anyway--

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:18.200
a license that doesn't have an
expiration will become a problem

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.690
for a very long time.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:26.810
And so, again, I really would like
to encourage everyone to think

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.640
about this as a problem
that's much bigger

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.710
than simply software-enabled
consumer products.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.590 position:56%
The folks that I represent are not--

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.690
do not have a problem
with licensing per se.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:47.080
The idea of iTunes model providing
licensed copies begging your pardon

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.940
to consumers directly for 99 cents
and having all of those terms

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.470
and conditions is not
actually our problem.

01:05:55.470 --> 01:06:01.680
The problem is when libraries
specifically are excluded

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.860
from that process and are unable

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:09.870 position:56%
to include culturally extremely
significant works in our collections

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:14.740
and those works die out as
soon as the service dies out.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.040
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: OK.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.340
Thank you.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.640
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Oh.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.940
And--

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.660
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So I want to
address the issue of, you know,

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.510
whether you go out and
buy another product.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.550
When you purchase a vehicle,

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:30.500
you're spending $30,000,
$40,000 for that car.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:35.070
The information that's available to
you about the repair of that car,

01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:39.690 position:56%
the licensing is not entirely
apparent to you, too, until you have

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:40.990
to actually go through it.

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:44.070
And then you find your, you
know, now subject to the fact

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:46.380
that you don't own that vehicle.

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:49.020
The licensing hasn't
really occurred but--

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.700
and it's part of the
1201 discussions

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.220
that the car companies raised
the fact that they felt

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.050
that when you purchased
a car you are--

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.590
the owner who was licensing

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.710
that software didn't
necessarily own the software

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.980
that was on that vehicle.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.080
That created a huge
firestorm in itself and--

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.440
within our industry
and with consumers.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.280
And I think that, you know, cars
are around for multiple years.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.040
What happens to these
cars, they change hands,

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.180
parts are taken off these
cars with software on them

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.610
and then they're remanufactured
by individual companies,

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.770
that then what happens
to that software company,

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:28.430
they reuse that software
on that remanufactured part

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:32.910
because the part itself needs to
have that software to operate.

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.080
Those are all questions
that I think are--

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.380
that needed to be answered as well.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:40.860 position:56%
But I don't believe that, you know,
you can simple say that you're going

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:44.210
to just buy-- if you buy a Ford
you don't like the whole deal,

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:46.830
you could go out and buy
a Chrysler next time,

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:50.250
because simply you're pretty much
stuck with that car for a while

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.550
and the servicing on that vehicle.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:54.850
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Do
you feel like the market

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.210
in that area hasn't
addressed those issues?

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:02.510
I'd recall sort of there
being some press on some

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:05.860
of the car companies
considering those issues

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.060
and those concerns and coming to.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.130
I believe those are
memorandum of understanding

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.430
when it comes to, you know--

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:14.320
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: Yeah, we came to
a memorandum of understanding

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.730
on the right to repair, which meant
that all the information tools

01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:22.470
and software supposed to be
available to a repair shop

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.770
to be able to repair that car

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:28.060
but that doesn't necessarily
cover the part itself.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.570
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr. Kupferschmid.

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:31.870
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Thank you.

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:33.720
And I guess maybe we can talk

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.690
about the different product
other than refrigerators.

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:36.990
We're so close to lunch time.

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:40.510
I don't know about you, I'm
getting a little hungry.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.800
To address a few points
that Professor Perzanowski--

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.100
if I'm pronouncing
that right-- discussed.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.970
He had some-- took some
issue with the Vernor case

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:52.310
but at the same point talked about
how you distinguished lending

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:55.430
from a sale and the fact that
lending-- and I'm pretty sure--

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.250
this is a quote-- there
are certain limitations.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.960
If you look at the Vernor case it's
part-- there's a three-pronged test

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.510
and that includes that the license
include limitations on the transfer

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:11.000
but also limitations on use,
and that would sort of seem

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.530
to satisfy that requirement.

01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:16.020
It was also raised about, you know,

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.960
the question are we trying the
solve yesterday's problems?

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.600
And I could not agree
more with that.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.590
For some reason we
have this fascination,

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:28.560
love affair with destruction
and return of the product,

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.890
and hitting the Buy Now
or buy button and people--

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:37.750
or consumers are confused
about that.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:40.060 position:56%
I think it depends on the consumers.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.040 position:56%
I think if you were to have my
17-year-old son sitting here instead

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.080
of me, I think he'd say
there's no confusion whatsoever

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.200
because he's grown up in an
environment that's very different.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:56.150
If you look at-- I mean, and
this issue is not specific

01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.670 position:56%
to copyright either if you hit the
buy button when you're buying a seat

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:03.180
on an airplane, but I
don't think anybody thinks

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.100
that they're actually
buying that seat.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:12.890 position:56%
And so, I think that terminology has
just been used because it's easier

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:14.190
for consumers to understand.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:17.790
We talked about these sort of long
use and long licenses and it's

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.960
so difficult for consumers
to understand.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.080
The idea is everyone is trying
to make it easier for consumers.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.540
And if you have these
long descriptions of the--

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:32.250 position:56%
within the button I think that would
certainly make it more difficult.

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:37.410
And then just the last thing I just
reiterate, which is already said.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:41.160
To the extent that the software
license is embedded in software--

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.800
because remember, that's what
we're talking about here--

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:50.030
are being misused or
abused, the market is

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:51.800
and will be self-correcting.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.520
In our comments we mention
the Keurig example, OK?

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.980
And that applies here.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.180
If you're engaging-- If a software

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.420
or a hardware manufacturer
is engaging in sort

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.030
of anti-consumer behavior, they're
not going to be around very long.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:12.810
And if the manufacturer is
dealing with a software company

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.720
and that software company is just
trying to enforce their license

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.350
in way that the manufacturer--

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:20.820
device manufacturer isn't
particularly pleased with, well,

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:23.020
that relationship is not going
to last very long either.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.990
So there are-- in terms of
the market and relationships,

01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:29.570
there are self-correcting
mechanisms in there

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:32.800
if in fact these problems
were to continue to occur

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:38.750
or can occur going into the future.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.640
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr. Band.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So, a lot of
people have raised the issue of sort

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:47.500
that there's this continuing
relationship

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:52.850
that you're really not
getting a software as a product

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.680
but a software as a device.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.560 position:56%
And that certainly might be true
with respect to some of the software

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.340
and the devices that
we're talking about.

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.830
I mean, it could very well
be that in your computer

01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:07.470
that there is one piece of
software that is compute--

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:10.860
you know, communicating to the
central server somewhere in the sky

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.630
and telling them that you are,
you know, eating too much.

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:20.300
But I think there's going to
be a lot of other software

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:23.610
in the refrigerator and certainly
a lot of other software in the car,

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:24.910
and all of these replaced--

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:28.840 position:56%
all of these parts that Mr. Lowe has
been talking about that communicate

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.790
with one another where they're
not interacting with, you know,

01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:38.300
with the cloud that they're just
interacting with other parts

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:44.560
of the car and you'll have the
software that's interacting

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.780
with other parts of
the refrigerator.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:55.720
And I think it's important to
sort of try to keep this issue--

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.020
you know, keep those separate.

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.820
Because I agree that if there
is an ongoing relationship

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.840
that poses different issues.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.900
Now part of it, you know, there's
related issues like are you paying

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.250
for the ongoing relationships?

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.310
Certainly if you're
paying, you know,

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:11.120
the subscription fee every
month, that's one thing.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.930
If there's a sort of a
paid-up license that--

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:18.170
you know, paid-up license at the
beginning where it's understood

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:21.540
that you're-- you know, for
the life of a refrigerator,

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.470
it will always be communicating
with the cloud, you know,

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:29.560
that might be different situation
and maybe in that case, you know,

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.610
you have-- you know, the person

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:35.680
about the refrigerator has a
different bundle of rights.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.940 position:56%
But it certainly seems to me that if
we're talking about sort of software

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.940
that is-- you know, where there is
no ongoing relationship, I mean,

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.180
that seems to be much easier case
to say, OK, let's figure out how

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.680
to deal with that situation.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.650
In other words, you know,
there's a bit of a spectrum here,

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:53.950
a spectrum of relationship.

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:56.040
There could be situations
where there's absolutely none,

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.320
there could be a situation where
there's a very tight relationship

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.070
with the ongoing subscription,
and then you have situations

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.810
in the middle where
there might be some sort

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.100
of ongoing relationship
but it's all paid up.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.300
And those are three very different
situations that I think can be--

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.600
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So do you think that--

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.570
I mean, to me that suggest that we
should really careful about trying

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:19.680
to be establish rules in this
area and that may be something

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.300
that we should let courts sort
out on a case by case basis.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.560
I mean, do you disagree with that?

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.860
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Yes.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:31.180
Because I think it is
possible to come up with rules.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.100
Certainly where there is no
ongoing relationship, whatsoever,

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.530
I think that's a very
easy case, you know,

01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:40.660
and we could come up
with rules today.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.960
And if fact, you know,

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.540
to some extent that's what
[inaudible] tries to do that.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.740
It tried to be very careful.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.490
And one of the things that,
you know, in the conversations

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.790
with Congressman Farenthold's
office that, you know,

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:57.160
came up with exactly this but
what about the updates, right?

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.530
And so there were some folks who
said, well, you know, if you--

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:04.340
you know, and again we're only
dealing with the contemplations

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.060
when you have a paid-up
license, when it's all--

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:11.310
you know, you pay once
upfront, no ongoing payments.

01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:13.510
And so, should you be
when you sell it to the--

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:19.610 position:56%
you know, when the device is sold to
the second person, what do they get

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:24.930
in terms of software going forward?

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:29.560
And there were some folks who were
very interested in saying, well,

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.080
you should be able to get
whatever the first person

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.240
or whatever the first purchaser
would have gotten if it had stayed

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.780
in that person's possession.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.820
So, to the extent that there would
have been ongoing updates, then,

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.360
you know, the second purchaser
should be able to get everything

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.310
that the first purchaser had
bought-- would have gotten.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:53.040
But actually, you know,
the ultimate conclusion--

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.630
again, not necessarily that
our numbers would have wanted--

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:05.540
was that now you only got bug
fixes and security patches.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:11.020
You don't get the new releases,
so that-- you know, that there's--

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:14.350 position:56%
that you are-- even though you would
have paid upfront and if it stayed

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.330
with the first person that would
have gotten any new release,

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:21.150
the idea is that, you
know, because the sense was

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:23.250
that there is this ongoing
relationship and it's sort

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:28.620
of different that you don't get
the full bundle you get less.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.100 position:56%
But the point is that these are ones

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.900
that Congress is perfectly
capable of drawing.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.370
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: That line
seems particular--

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:40.260
That seems like a very difficult
line to apply and practice

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.830 position:56%
if I'm a software company, you know,

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:47.900
oftentimes on bundling bug fixes
with, you know, new releases,

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.070
so I'm adding new features
and I'm adding bug fixes

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:51.790
and sometimes they're
sort of integrated--

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:54.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, so if the
copyright office wants to recommend

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.100
that it should just be-- you should
get everything the first purchaser

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.450
wanted and, you know, that you
should get all the new releases,

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:01.750
that would be great.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: I mean, you know, but
that again goes back to the question

01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:06.360
of whether there's like
a practical concern here.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.510
I mean, you know, just
looking on eBay to see

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:10.630 position:56%
if I can buy a used Nest thermostat.

01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:11.930
And you can.

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:15.940
And I'm not-- So going again
to the fact that this is

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:19.850
about consumer products
if there is not problem--

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:22.390
a demonstrated problem
in the marketplace,

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:25.720
I'm not sure just looking it
from Congress' perspective

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.200
that they're particularly would
be interested in trying to jump

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.420
into this kind of thorny issue.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.370
So again, just to reiterate to the
extent we have specific examples

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:38.640
of this occurring in the context of
consumer devices not in the context

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.750
of sort of business-to-business
type transactions,

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.610
I think that would be something
we'd be very interested

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:46.770
in finding out about.

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.350
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Mr. Bergmayer.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:49.650
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: OK.

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:50.950
You know, just for the record,

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:53.330
open source software is not
dependent of licensing copies.

01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:55.960
It's dependent on licensing
intellectual property rights,

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.240
that the licensee otherwise would
not have in placing conditions

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.770
on those rights, which
is totally legit.

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:04.540
So, for example, the GPL grants
to the licensee the right

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:07.340
to make reproductions or the
right to make derivative works.

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.270
Licensees don't otherwise
have those rights.

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:11.260
So putting conditions
on those is fine.

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.980
And I don't have an
objection to that.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.940
Those licenses do not
depend on saying

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:19.060
that the ultimate user does not own
a copy of the software in question.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.830
I think that is very
important distinction.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:24.090
Second, I think, you know,
let's say for the sake

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:25.990
of argument that I own this iPhone.

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:29.300
When I install an app on it, I
think I own a copy of that app.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.620
A copy is defined is the
statute as a material thing,

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.070
the only material thing
I see is the iPhone,

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:37.310
therefore I necessarily own a copy.

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.860
I don't think there are
negative consequences of that

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.460
for the software developer.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.760
What does it mean?

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.270
It means I can operate the software
without needing a specific license

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:49.200
by virtue of the essential step
test, the essential step doctrine

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.620
which says that I'm entitled to
make RAM copies that are necessary

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.720
to use physical items that I own.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.700
I don't think that's bad
for software developers.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.790
And it might mean that
first-sale applies.

01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:02.080
But as a practical matter in
today's technological environment,

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.380
what I'm going to do?

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.190
Sell my entire phone
including my iTunes account?

01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:08.540
That's really not going to happen.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.100
I think it could happen if I were

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.780
to sell my iPhone including
my iTunes Store account

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.080
that is tied to.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.930
I think I should be allowed
to do that and I think that's

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.580
where first-sale kicks in.

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:21.370
But as a practical matter, you
know, first-sale doesn't entitle me

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.330
to make arbitrary numbers of
new copies and resell them.

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:27.310
It doesn't entitle me to engage
in piracy in any respect.

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:31.600
In fact, the main thing that saying
that I own a copy of software

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.100
that I bought even in the case

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:37.600 position:56%
of an Adobe Creative Cloud situation
is simple to say that simply

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.500
by virtue of owning it, I don't
need a license just to use it.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.860
It doesn't grant any new rights.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.460
It doesn't necessarily
even entitle me

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.410
to software updates in the future.

01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:50.310
And I don't think that is
bad for a software developer,

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:52.810
and I have a hard time seeing
why there is such resistance

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:56.870
to this concept which is grounded
in a claim text of the statute

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.550
that one, copies are
material items, and two,

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.130
if I own the material
item I own the copy.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.130
I don't-- I have very difficulty--

01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:08.410
a very much difficulty in seeing
the resistance to that except

01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:12.260
for the fact that by saying
that you don't own the copy,

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:15.420
that brings up the RAM copy's
doctrine and it allows you

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.250 position:56%
to put all kinds of restrictions and
sort of gin up copyright violations

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:22.530
for what otherwise be a
routine contract violation.

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.740
So, those are my two final points.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.380
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: So
again, is it your --

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.470
I'm going to ask you
the same question asked,

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:30.790
Mr. Perzanowski before.

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:32.550
Is it your view that both--

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:36.100
in the sense both Krauss and Vernor
had it wrong when they suggested

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.850
that there could be
licenses for software?

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:41.170
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: In the
case that I don't own software,

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.510
it's because I don't
own the material item.

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:45.580
So when you're saying
that I don't own the film,

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:48.660
that means I don't own the film
stock, there's no third way.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.630
There's IP rights and
there's material copies,

01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:54.480
there is no like ethereal
copy that is somehow a part

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.430
from the material object
and has nothing to do

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.760
with traditional 106 rights.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.060
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: Yeah, I know.

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.360
I understand that point.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.560
But both Krauss and Vernor
proceeded from the assumption

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.190
that there could be
licenses and copies.

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:08.390
And they reached different
results at the end

01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:09.690
of the day looking at the facts.

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.290
But I think they both
have that same basic--

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:14.430
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: So I think to
use the helpful terminology in any

01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:16.970
of those cases if you're saying
that I have license to copy,

01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:19.580
what you're saying is that the
material object is something

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:23.280
that I don't really own because
I'm just borrowing something

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.890
and that's fine and that's
not unique to software.

01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:29.190
&gt;&gt; Erik Bertin: All right.

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.490
Thank you.

01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:32.680
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: We'll
conclude with Mr. Perzanowski.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.300
&gt;&gt; Aaron Perzanowski: I'll
try to be really brief.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.940
So, I want to come back to
the point that Chris made

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.710
which I think is really important.

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.910
And I agree that for the most part,

01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:42.810
these kinds false advertising
concerns

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:46.810
that I raised are legally distinct
from the kinds of questions

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:48.110
that we're trying to answer here.

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:51.270
There is one way that I do think
they're relevant and it comes back

01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:53.830
to a point I think you made
earlier which is that, you know,

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:56.980 position:56%
one of the reasons that the software
cases seem to come out differently

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:02.320
from the other kinds of, you know,
license versus sale questions

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.280
with other types of media is

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.360
that maybe we think there
is something different

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.920
about business practices,
about the history,

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.290
and about consumer
expectations in software markets.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.520
I'm not entirely convinced
of that argument.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.600
If that's true, though,
it cuts both waves, right?

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.940
If consumers are used to
licenses when it comes

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.680
to standalone software,
they're not used to licenses

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.780
when it come to refrigerators,
right?

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:29.920
So we should about that line
of reasoning not only in terms

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.200
of how it applies looking
backward but in terms

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.010
of how it applies looking
forward into the areas

01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:39.010 position:56%
where consumers have no expectation,
whatsoever, of licensing

01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:42.310
and whether there is no history
of a practice of licensing.

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:45.470
To come back to Keith's
point, the great thing

01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:48.110
about doing empirical research
is you don't have to suppose

01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:50.650
or imagine you get like
answers to questions.

01:22:50.650 --> 01:22:55.000
And it turns out that young white
men are in fact more confused

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.970
than anyone about what
the Buy Now button means,

01:22:57.970 --> 01:23:01.500
and it turns out that providing
a bullet-pointed short notice

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.450
significantly reduces the degree

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.670
to which consumers
misunderstand the rights.

01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:11.600
The papers up on SSRN, if anybody's
interested, I recommend you read it

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.210
because I do think there is
value from having real evidence

01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:18.110
and not just imagining
the way the role might be.

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.110
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: Great.

01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:24.110
So we're going to take
15-minute break.

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:27.810
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
