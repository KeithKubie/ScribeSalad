00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:17.270
Colfax Avenue, here in Denver, Colorado,

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:21.160
was once called the longest,
wickedest street in America.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.450
My office is there in the same place --
it's a medical desert.

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:28.370
There are government clinics
and hospitals nearby,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.362
but they're not enough to handle
the poor who live in the area.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:33.998
By poor, I mean those who are on Medicaid.

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:37.483
Not just for the homeless;
20 percent of this country is on Medicaid.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.555
If your neighbors have a family of four
and make less than $33,000 a year,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.378
then they can get Medicaid.

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.944
But they can't find a doctor to see them.

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:48.847
A study by Merritt Hawkins

00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:51.633
found that only 20 percent
of the family doctors in Denver

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:53.457
take any Medicaid patients.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.085
And of those 20 percent, some have caps,
like five Medicaid patients a month.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.708
Others make Medicaid patients
wait months to be seen,

00:01:02.732 --> 00:01:05.707
but will see you today,
if you have Blue Cross.

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:09.605
This form of classist
discrimination is legal

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.469
and is not just a problem in Denver.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.315
Almost half the family
doctors in the country

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:16.473
refuse to see Medicaid patients.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:18.506
Why?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.224
Well, because Medicaid pays less
than private insurance

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:25.248
and because Medicaid patients
are seen as more challenging.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.878
Some show up late for appointments,
some don't speak English

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.871
and some have trouble
following instructions.

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:35.588
I thought about this
while in medical school.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:40.736
If I could design a practice
that caters to low-income folks

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760
instead of avoiding them,

00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:47.576
then I would have guaranteed customers
and very little competition.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.934
(Laughter)

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:53.720
So after residency, I opened up shop,
doing underserved medicine.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:56.401
Not as a nonprofit,
but as a private practice.

00:01:56.823 --> 00:02:00.833
A small business
seeing only resettled refugees.

00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:03.243
That was six years ago,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.720
and since then, we've served
50,000 refugee medical visits.

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:13.723
(Applause)

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:17.144
Ninety percent of our patients
have Medicaid,

00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:19.429
and most of the rest, we see for free.

00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:22.294
Most doctors say you can't
make money on Medicaid,

00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:24.149
but we're doing it just fine.

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:25.323
How?

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:28.673
Well, if this were real capitalism,
then I wouldn't tell you,

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:30.421
because you'd become my competition.

00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:31.941
(Laughter)

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:34.381
But I call this
"bleeding-heart" capitalism.

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:35.758
(Laughter)

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:39.179
And we need more people doing this,
not less, so here's how.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.196
We break down the walls
of our medical maze

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.602
by taking the challenges
of Medicaid patients,

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:48.942
turning them into opportunities,
and pocketing the difference.

00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:53.244
The nuts and bolts
may seem simple, but they add up.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.648
For example, we have no appointments.

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:57.632
We're walk-in only.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.006
Of course, that's how it works
at the emergency room,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.040
at urgent cares and at Taco Bell.

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:05.529
(Laughter)

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:08.153
But not usually
at family doctor's offices.

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:10.007
Why do we do it?

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.903
Because Nasra can't call
for an appointment.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:17.238
She has a phone, but she
doesn't have phone minutes.

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:20.394
She can't speak English,
and she can't navigate a phone tree.

00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:23.820
And she can't show up on time
for an appointment

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:26.180
because she doesn't have a car,
she takes the bus,

00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:29.530
and she takes care of three kids
plus her disabled father.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.664
So we have no appointments;

00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:33.450
she shows up when she wants,

00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:36.292
but usually waits less
than 15 minutes to be seen.

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.565
She then spends as much time
with us as she needs.

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:44.386
Sometimes that's 40 minutes,
usually it's less than five.

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:47.172
She loves this flexibility.

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.596
It's how she saw doctors in Somalia.

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.323
And I love it, because I don't pay
staff to do scheduling,

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:56.644
and we have a zero no-show rate
and a zero late-show rate.

00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:59.713
(Laughter)

00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:04.303
(Applause)

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.009
It makes business sense.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.319
Another difference is our office layout.

00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:11.899
Our exam rooms open
right to the waiting room,

00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:14.391
our medical providers
room their own patients,

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:18.247
and our providers stay in one room
instead of alternating between rooms.

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:22.875
Cutting steps cuts costs
and increases customer satisfaction.

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:28.260
We also hand out free medicines,
right from our exam room:

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:31.093
over-the-counter ones
and some prescription ones, too.

00:04:31.117 --> 00:04:33.164
If Nasra's baby is sick,

00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:37.466
we put a bottle of children's Tylenol
or amoxicillin right in her hand.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.440
She can take that baby straight back home
instead of stopping at the pharmacy.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.662
I don't know about you, but I get sick
just looking at all those choices.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.587
Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.156
We also text patients.

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.387
We're open evenings and weekends.

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:56.593
We do home visits.

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:58.838
We've jumped dead car batteries.

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.085
(Laughter)

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:04.426
With customer satisfaction so high,
we've never had to advertise,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.925
yet are growing at 25 percent a year.

00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:11.150
And we've become real good
at working with Medicaid,

00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:14.276
since it's pretty much the only
insurance company we deal with.

00:05:14.942 --> 00:05:17.332
Other doctor's offices
chase 10 insurance companies

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:19.029
just to make ends meet.

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.453
That's just draining.

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:25.370
A single-payer system is like monogamy:
it just works better.

00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:27.937
(Laughter)

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.473
(Applause)

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:35.069
Of course, Medicaid is funded
by tax payers like you,

00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:38.482
so you might be wondering,
"How much does this cost the system?"

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.736
Well, we're cheaper than the alternatives.

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:43.546
Some of our patients
might go to the emergency room,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.966
which can cost thousands,
just for a simple cold.

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:49.386
Some may stay home
and let their problems get worse.

00:05:50.272 --> 00:05:56.117
But most would try to make an appointment
at a clinic that's part of the system

00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:59.274
called the Federally
Qualified Health Centers.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:04.347
This is a nationwide network
of safety-net clinics

00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:08.514
that receive twice as much
government funding per visit

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:10.471
than private doctors like me.

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:13.085
Not only they get more money,

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:15.482
but by law, there can only be
one in each area.

00:06:16.568 --> 00:06:19.756
That means they have a monopoly
on special funding for the poor.

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:22.320
And like any monopoly,

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:26.248
there's a tendency for cost to go up
and quality to go down.

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:30.762
I'm not a government entity;
I'm not a nonprofit.

00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:32.858
I'm a private practice.

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:35.416
I have a capitalist drive to innovate.

00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:38.541
I have to be fast and friendly.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.224
I have to be cost-effective
and culturally sensitive.

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:46.129
I have to be tall, dark and handsome.

00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:47.677
(Laughter)

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.264
(Applause)

00:06:49.288 --> 00:06:52.363
And if I'm not, I'm going out of business.

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:54.410
I can innovate faster than a nonprofit,

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:56.886
because I don't need a meeting
to move a stapler.

00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:03.312
(Applause)

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:06.485
Really, none of our innovations
are new or unique --

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.477
we just put them together in a unique way

00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:11.263
to help low-income folks
while making money.

00:07:11.287 --> 00:07:13.335
And then, instead of taking
that money home,

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:16.752
I put it back into the refugee community
as a business expense.

00:07:17.794 --> 00:07:19.318
This is Mango House.

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:21.275
My version of a medical home.

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:24.794
In it, we have programs
to feed and clothe the poor,

00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:27.893
an after-school program, English classes,

00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:32.752
churches, dentist, legal help,
mental health and the scout groups.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.274
These programs are run
by tenant organizations

00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:38.172
and amazing staff,

00:07:38.196 --> 00:07:43.201
but all receive some amount of funding
form profits from my clinic.

00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:48.356
Some call this social entrepreneurship.

00:07:49.253 --> 00:07:51.824
I call it social-service arbitrage.

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.743
Exploiting inefficiencies in our
health care system to serve the poor.

00:07:57.974 --> 00:08:00.278
We're serving 15,000 refugees a year

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:03.116
at less cost than where else
they would be going.

00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:08.149
Of course, there's downsides
to doing this as a private business,

00:08:08.173 --> 00:08:10.585
rather than as a nonprofit
or a government entity.

00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:14.013
There's taxes and legal exposures.

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:18.712
There's changing Medicaid rates
and specialists who don't take Medicaid.

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.233
And there's bomb threats.

00:08:22.686 --> 00:08:25.384
Notice there's no apostrophes, it's like,

00:08:25.408 --> 00:08:27.599
"We were going to blow up
all you refugees!"

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:33.268
(Laughter)

00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:35.339
"We were going to blow up
all you refugees,

00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:37.697
but then we went
to your English class, instead."

00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:41.302
(Laughter)

00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:47.405
(Applause)

00:08:47.429 --> 00:08:50.096
Now, you might be thinking,
"This guy's a bit different."

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.190
(Laughter)

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:52.408
Uncommon.

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:53.433
(Laughter)

00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:55.275
A communal narcissist?

00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:56.331
(Laughter)

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:57.506
A unicorn, maybe,

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.923
because if this was so easy,
then other doctors would be doing it.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:04.950
Well, based on Medicaid rates,
you can do this in most of the country.

00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:06.571
You can be your own boss,

00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:09.357
help the poor and make
good money doing it.

00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:10.595
Medical folks,

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:12.635
you wrote on your school
application essays

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:15.316
that you wanted to help
those less fortunate.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.607
But then you had your idealism
beaten out of you in training.

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:21.056
Your creativity bred out of you.

00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:23.795
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:09:24.383 --> 00:09:28.249
You can choose underserved medicine
as a lifestyle specialty.

00:09:29.022 --> 00:09:30.578
Or you can be a specialist

00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:33.469
who cuts cost in order to see
low-income folks.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.171
And for the rest of you,
who don't work in health care,

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.218
what did you write on your applications?

00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:42.734
Most of us wanted to save the world,
to make a difference.

00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:45.956
Maybe you've been
successful in your career

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.204
but are now looking for that meaning?

00:09:48.752 --> 00:09:50.219
How can you get there?

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.069
I don't just mean giving
a few dollars or a few hours;

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:59.674
I mean how can you use your expertise
to innovate new ways of serving others.

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:02.135
It might be easier than you think.

00:10:03.617 --> 00:10:06.617
The only way we're going to bridge
the underserved medicine gap

00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:08.664
is by seeing it as a business opportunity.

00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:11.172
The only way we're going to bridge
the inequality gap
