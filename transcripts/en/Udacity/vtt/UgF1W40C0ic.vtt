Many message mutations causing osteogenesis imperfecta, are good examples

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.990
of loss of function alleles that are actually dominant. Now,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.740
living with OI isn't easy, even for the people that

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.670
love and support them. For example, some individuals have been

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.309
falsely accused of physical abuse. Because they aren't aware

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.920
that the individual suffers from OI. And that they're at

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.950
a much higher risk for bone fractures. Now currently there's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.540
no cure for OI. So most therapies and treatments essentially

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.800
try to improve mobility and reduce the risk

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.570
of fracture. And like the Achondroplasia example, the function

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.260
of collagen is so important that mutant alleles

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.060
are not found in homozygous condition, because it's lethal
