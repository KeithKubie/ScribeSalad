India becomes an incredibly important
player when we start thinking about how

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909
player when we start thinking about how
 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.820
player when we start thinking about how
do we protect human health and how do we

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830
do we protect human health and how do we
 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.350
do we protect human health and how do we
deal with climate change the

transportation sector faces really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610
transportation sector faces really
 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.670
transportation sector faces really
substantial challenges in terms of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680
substantial challenges in terms of
 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.250
substantial challenges in terms of
transitioning to a low GHG future and we

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260
transitioning to a low GHG future and we
 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.570
transitioning to a low GHG future and we
don't know what that future is going to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580
don't know what that future is going to
 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.640
don't know what that future is going to
look like but I think that the biofuels

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650
look like but I think that the biofuels
 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.800
look like but I think that the biofuels
could play a potentially of an important

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
could play a potentially of an important
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.630
could play a potentially of an important
role especially an important role in the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640
role especially an important role in the
 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.910
role especially an important role in the
transition so the challenge that we're

transition so the challenge that we're
 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710
transition so the challenge that we're
looking at in our project is how to

looking at in our project is how to
 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.010
looking at in our project is how to
facilitate low GHG biofuels and their

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
facilitate low GHG biofuels and their
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.680
facilitate low GHG biofuels and their

you just drop it in water and sunlight

hits it but not one side comes hydrogen
enough the other side comes out to them

so it really is like a leaf it doesn't

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
so it really is like a leaf it doesn't
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.430
so it really is like a leaf it doesn't
have years and it's not a heavily

station one of the main problems that we

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
station one of the main problems that we
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350
station one of the main problems that we
see is that these extreme heat events

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
see is that these extreme heat events
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.390
see is that these extreme heat events
really pose a threat to some of the
