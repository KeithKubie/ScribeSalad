00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.140
It might be odd to get your head around, but
galaxies can and do collide.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.710
But far from an wild party of death, galaxies
collisions yield hotbeds for new star formation,

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.099
leading astronomers to suspect that this not-so-violent
event is actually a driving factor behind

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.580
galactic evolution.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.930
The big question here is how can galaxies
collide and not just destroy everything?

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.860
It helps to think about what a galaxy really
is.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.230
Every galaxy is made up of some 100 billion
stars with planets orbiting their host stars,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.690
but those stars are really far apart.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.890
Take the Milky Way for example.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.850
We’re about here on the edge of a spiral
arm called Orion Spur.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.359
It looks crowded in our little neighborhood,
but our nearest neighbor Alpha Centuri A,

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.109
is actually 4.3 light years away.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.360
So galaxies might full of stars, but those
stars are really far apart, meaning the likelihood

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.020
of two hitting is pretty low.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.399
But that doesn’t mean nothing happens, because
there is stuff in those vast distances.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.670
The “space” between stars is actually
full of gas and dust.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
Within these regions are dense pockets of
interstellar material, called molecular clouds,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.800
that collapse under their own mass and gravity,
forming protostars and eventually new stars.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.160
When galaxies collide, it’s this material
— the interstellar gas and dust — that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.620
interacts gravitationally with some neat results.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.940
In a collision, one galaxy can rip material
from another, disrupting star formation and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.710
adding more material to its own molecular
clouds.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.290
A direct collision between these gases can
also result in shockwaves reverberating through

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.070
both galaxies, triggering new regions of star
formation where there wasn’t any before.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.130
Aside from generating new pockets of star
formation, both close passes and full-on collisions

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.590
cause gravitational interactions begetting
interesting changes, causing spiral arms,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920
tidal tails, and even rings.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.730
Two spiral galaxies could merge and form an
elliptical galaxy with more active star formation

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.500
than either had before.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.890
But it’s not like this happens overnight…
not that there’s a “night” where galaxies

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.960
are concerned.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.070
This process can take millions of years.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.030
Which is a good thing because our own Milky
Way is on a crash course with the Andromeda

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.960
galaxy, but we’ve got a good 4 billion years…

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.460
That should be enough time to live my best
life.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.720

You know what’d be awesome?

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:26.709
If after the Andromeda collision our sky lit
up with tons of newly forming stars!
