00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:07.947
- [Whitney] My name is Whitney,

00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:10.842
and I live in Eminence, Kentucky.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:14.341
I live with my mom and
my two younger siblings.

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:17.207
I go to school at Eminence Independent

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:20.063
and Bellarmine University.

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:23.933
I've always had a thing for anatomy.

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.735
- [Buddy Berry] Whitney's
a special young lady,

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.820
and our early college
program has been her vehicle

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.737
to see the potential of her future.

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.505
The Eminence spirit is
to keep looking forward.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.799
What drives us is giving kids the freedom

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.311
and the empowerment to do
whatever they put their minds to.

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:49.161
We want to give them
opportunities and experiences

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.881
that would far exceed anything

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.678
that any generation of Eminence
student had ever had before.

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:57.240
We felt like we were
having students graduate

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.958
academically prepared to go
to post-secondary education,

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.429
but kids would go, they would spend

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.922
maybe a semester, maybe two, and then

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:07.323
all of a sudden they're back
in town, they didn't complete.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:09.767
- We were having huge drop-out rates,

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:11.949
and so we needed to do something.

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:14.874
- [Thom Coffee] Dr. Barry and
I called Bellarmine University

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.755
and said, we have a crazy idea
we'd like to pitch to you.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.240
- [Buddy Berry] And with one yes,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.087
the Bellarmine-Eminence
partnership was born.

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:23.615
250 kids have gone through it,

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:26.032
and 249 are still in college.

00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:29.334
- So this was an opportunity

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.323
in a relatively safe environment

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.039
to get them thinking about college,

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.754
what college is like, what
college-level work is like,

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:39.790
and let those students
explore a little bit

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.703
rather than just throwing
them in the deep end.

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.510
College, especially if
you come from a family

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.958
that has no college
experience, it's very daunting.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.320
- I didn't go to college,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.902
so I think it's done good for Whitney.

00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:54.758
She's always been a go-getter,

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:57.531
and she wants to be a neurosurgeon.

00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.324
- My mom's been supportive,
but it's a little difficult

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:03.199
because she doesn't
know how to help me out,

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.604
so I've had to turn to my
teachers and my counselor.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:07.769
- And so I want to make sure that you know

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.428
what courses to look for next year.

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:12.028
Sometimes it's as simple as, I just need

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:14.189
somebody to tell me not to give up.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.595
They can do the work,
they're capable students,

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.428
but they need the support network.

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:22.657
- One barrier that we found was,

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:25.480
a lot of these homes didn't
have internet service.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.563
And so, we created a WiFi school bus.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.588
- [Whitney] And honestly, it's amazing.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.662
Say I wrote a paper the night before,

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:35.282
I forgot to make corrections on it,

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.716
I can use that WiFi
while I'm going to school

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:40.049
and then send it on its way.

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.174
- [Graham Ellis] In their
first year, they take

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:45.200
Bellarmine courses from
our Bellarmine faculty,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.050
but just for the Eminence students.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.883
- We took English 100,
a Human Geography class,

00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:50.466
and a Speech class.

00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:54.277
It was kinda rocky at first,

00:02:54.277 --> 00:02:56.671
I didn't raise my hand or anything.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.646
If I didn't understand
anything I just went home

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:01.410
and tried to figure it out myself.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.015
But in college, you have to
ask your professor questions

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:05.574
or they're just going to move on

00:03:05.574 --> 00:03:08.010
and you're going to be so lost.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.299
This year is my second year in.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.435
Honestly, it was more comfortable.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:15.004
I felt like I knew what I was supposed to.

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:16.428
I have a question.

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.578
- So, epiphyses are the ends of the bone,

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:20.884
and diaphysis is the shaft, the...

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:22.916
- My second year, I actually
got to choose my classes

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:25.717
after finishing my GenEd
courses my first year.

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.882
I chose Anatomy and Physiology,

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:30.384
and then I also chose
Western World History.

00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:32.133
- [Thom Coffee] So sometimes
those exploratory classes,

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.720
of I may be interested in this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.194
and I just want to put my toe in the pool

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.629
and see if I like the
water, is a valuable thing.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.322
We want to give them flexibility.

00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:40.867
- You can basically do whatever you want.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.059
I'm taking a Psychology class and

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.352
I'm taking a Theology class this semester.

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:47.547
- These classes are
straight college credit.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.513
They would transfer just like anybody

00:03:49.513 --> 00:03:51.690
who went to a university
their freshman year

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.441
and decided to switch universities.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.400
Some of the courses,
for example English 101,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.682
we would also credit them with
a senior English credit here.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:05.336
So, you have nine hours of
elective transfer credit,

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:09.478
and then you've already
got 27 of the 39 hours.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:10.929
So you're really close.

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.482
- [Jared] It actually shocked me, because

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:14.312
I'm going to have a lot of
the credits out of the way.

00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:16.392
- Where I'd be going to
school for neuroscience,

00:04:16.392 --> 00:04:17.750
it would be for five years.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.128
Instead, now it's going
to be for four years.

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:21.113
So that's even better, because

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:22.574
it gets me into med school quicker

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:26.491
and I can go ahead and
start what I want to do.

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:30.209
- For a lot of these kids,
they're leaving high school

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:33.508
with more hours than somebody
in the family has ever earned.

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:34.903
And so, it's really that proof

00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:37.377
before they move away and are on their own

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.125
that they can do it and they can succeed.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:44.495
- The Bellarmine program has
taught me that I can do this,

00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:47.889
like I can finish college,
I will finish college.

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.515
And it just makes me really
excited for the future.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:51.374
- I'm very proud of you.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.983
- Thank you, thank you.

00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:54.733
- You've done very...
