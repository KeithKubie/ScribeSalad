00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.929
Your immune system might not be sentient,
but it can get amnesia.

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.929
Sort of.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.219
It’s pretty neat, and also scary.

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:16.059
Hello everyone, a happily measles-free Amy
with you on DNews today.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.380
Since 1968, we’ve been immunizing kids for
measles, with the same vaccine we use today.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.589
But, as more and more kids got vaccinated,
scientists noticed something weird.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.730
There was a significant drop in deaths from
measles, which was expected, but also a drop

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.960
in deaths from other infectious diseases.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.530
And no one knew why… until now!

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.500
A paper in the journal Science looked at monkeys
that had measles and found their immune systems

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.210
had a sort of amnesia after being infected.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.600
This “immune amnesia” caused a years-long
disabling of the immune system against other

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
diseases.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.380
See, our immune system is made up of organs,
cells, and proteins that together protect

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.289
the body from harmful organisms.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.640
When a foreign cell with an antigen -- a protein
on the surface of bacteria, fungi and viruses

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.200
-- enters the body, the immune system reacts
to fight it, protecting the body from illness.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.970
We get sick when your immune system meets
a pathogen it hasn’t encountered before.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.439
But when it meets a familiar pathogen, it
binds with the antigens on it’s surface

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.120
and the body can fight off the disease.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.900
Your immune system gets weak when you’re
sick, but it bounces back imbued with a memory

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.010
of the disease it fought.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.600
Now, if the same pathogen enters the body
a second time, you can fight it off.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.110
This is why your mom might have encouraged
you to play with your friend who had the chicken

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.110
pox.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.630
Once you get it, your body has the defence
for it and you won’t get it again!

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.790
But the measles changes this whole behaviour!

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.600
For some reason, immune systems in people
with the measles lose any memory of how to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.280
fight other diseases.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.190
Once the immune system bounces back, the new,
regenerated white blood cells only remember

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.210
the measles; they have no memory of other
diseases the body previously fought!

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.329
And that’s why the measles vaccine helps
protect against other diseases!

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.500
We’ve seen this play out before.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.790
That same paper in the journal Science compared
child mortality rates in the US, UK, and Denmark.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.330
Using a complex statistical model, they found
that in all three countries the rise in infectious

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.500
diseases -- specifically pneumonia, diarrhoeal
diseases, and meningitis — matched rates

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.719
of immune amnesia following measles; that
“immune amnesia” lasted on average for

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.869
27 months.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.800
So, for more than two years after contracting
measles, kids were more susceptible to potentially

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.410
deadly diseases.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.110
Rates of infectious disease were linked to
measles cases so strongly the team was able

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.610
to correlate childhood mortality rates with
measles outbreaks.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.610
What does this mean?

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.400
Well without the vaccine, if you get chickenpox
when you’re 4, then measles when you’re

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.020
5, you’re susceptible to chickenpox again
for another two years!

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.220
For young kids, this can mean exposure to
measles in a 2 year old can reset the immune

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.670
system to that of a newborn, leaving the toddler
at risk to other potentially life-threatening

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.670
diseases.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.270
Today, the measles has been almost eradicated
in the United States in the last half century,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.010
taking other diseases with it.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.100
So... do you need another reason to vaccinate
against measles?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610
But does this mean you should expose your
kids to measles?

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.440
We talked about measles parties in this video
right here.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.870
So anyone out there get measles and other
nasty complications?
