When you are reading Piazza,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.100
there are a couple of different
ways you can navigate.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.060
First, there's the topic list that
we've been using on the left.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060
Second, you can filter
by folders at the top.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, here are all of
the topics in the project folder.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.540
The numbers indicate the number
of updated posts in each folder.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.530
Clicking a folder shows only
those topics in that folder.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.100
Third, you can use the search bar.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.890
The search bar allows you to search
by key words or by certain flags.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.270
After you start typing a search query,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.950
click the search tips to
bring up a list of flags.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.980
For example,
you can search within titles, or for

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.310
specific contributors by name.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.120
Note that sometimes the folder listing
across the top won't list every folder.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.380
In those cases,
you can search by folder here.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.780
&gt;&gt; My favorite navigation features,
though,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.970
are found under this gear right here.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.870
This menu lets you view only
certain types of messages.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.200
For example, you can view only newly
created topics by clicking on Unread,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.500
or you can view only updated
topics by clicking on Updated.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.380
You can choose to view only instructor
posts by clicking on Instructor Posts

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.220
near the bottom,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.530
which is a great way to focus on getting
the crucial content pretty fast.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.310
You'll also notice that we've
been using Compact Mode,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.420
which shows only the topic titles.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.350
You can change that at the bottom.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100
If you're overwhelmed by the amount
of new content on Piazza and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.330
you just want to start fresh, you can
just click Mark All Read at the bottom.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.900
Lastly, you can also
shortcut these filters.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.610
Ebony has Unread, Updated, Unresolved
and Following shortcutted right here.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.390
You can remove a shortcut
by clicking Remove shortcut

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.890
while viewing that filter, and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.550
you can add a shortcut by clicking Add
shortcut while viewing that filter.
