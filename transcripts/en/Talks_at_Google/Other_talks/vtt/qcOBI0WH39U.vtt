00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.350
JAMES: So I'm super excited
to have Vicki Abeles-- did

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.070
I get it right?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.240
VICKI ABELES: Yes.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.650
JAMES: Close?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.774
VICKI ABELES: Close enough.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.140
JAMES: Excellent, yes--
uh-oh, close enough--

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.240
to have Vicki here.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.150
She's an inspiration.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.340
She began her career as
a Wall Street attorney

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.140
and turned filmmaker
in 2007 when

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.490
she co-directed the
award winning documentary

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.240
"Race to Nowhere."

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.114
Which is more than a
film, it's more a phrase

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.730
now used by parents--
a rallying cry.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.720
It's a vivid portrayal of
the pressure cooker culture

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.020
dominating American schools,
which you got a taste

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.409
of in the videos we showed.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.150
So Vicki showcased
"Race to Nowhere"

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.579
in more than 7,000 community
sponsored screenings--

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.370
including multiple
showings at Google years

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.830
ago-- to millions of
viewers around the globe.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.830
She is also the
author of a book.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.584
There it is.

00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:48.000
After you read this book it
will be full of post-it notes,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090
I guarantee you.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.800
She's an-- amazing book,
"Beyond Measure," which is also

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.420
a documentary of the same name.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.080
Which builds on
"Race to Nowhere,"

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.669
by looking at
practical solutions

00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:00.960
that you can take in your
homes, classrooms, and school

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.600
districts.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.650
Starting tomorrow or even today.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.520
So Vicki's films and books were
a wake up call in our family

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.414
and in our district where the
film was shown-- both films.

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:12.580
And it served as a rallying
cry to make a difference

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.625
in the lives of our children and
the students of our community.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.440
So Vicki, welcome to Google.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.020
VICKI ABELES: Thank you.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.417
JAMES: So I'm going to let
you do most of the talking.

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:25.000
And in a little bit we're going
to introduce a special Googler

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.660
to join us.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.930
But I want to start with
the thought of producing

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.370
not one film but two.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.260
And authoring a book
is absolutely daunting.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.030
Doing any one of those
three is daunting.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.590
So talk about the
moment when you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.350
were inspired to devote so
much energy to this task.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.530
VICKI ABELES: Sure.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.950
So about 10 years
ago my daughters

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.220
were in middle school,
fifth and seventh grade.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.950
And as a parent I started to
see the pressures and the toll

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.410
that school was taking
on them and our family.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.430
I saw two young girls
who went from being

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.410
happy, confident girls
who loved school.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.400
To losing sleep.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.650
To becoming anxious.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.280
To waking up in panic attacks
during the middle of the night

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.510
about a test the next day.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.949
And I started to wonder if
this was just my family.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.130
So I started speaking to
families in my community.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570
And then eventually to families,
educators, health professionals

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.030
across the country.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.050
And what I discovered
was an epidemic

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.270
of unhealthy, unprepared,
disengaged young people.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.850
And then about six
months into my research

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.195
a young girl, 13
years old-- same age

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:36.180
as my oldest daughter-- took her
life after failing a math test.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.950
And it was in that moment that
I knew I had to do something.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.970
And so I thought to myself,
what if we could do something

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.510
to really listen to our
kids, give our kids a voice?

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.890
And those questions
are what ultimately

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.214
lead to "Race to Nowhere."

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:53.130
JAMES: That's amazing.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.990
I can't think of
anything more motivating,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.334
and I wish that's not what
it took to motivate change.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:00.750
That kind of leads into the
second question, which is fear

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.980
is a powerful
motivator-- although we

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.530
spoke at lunch how
this really should

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.220
be about inspiring people.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.160
So should parents be
scared about the health

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.740
of their children or see
a tremendous opportunity

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.940
to do something much better?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.390
And if so, why is
either the case?

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.750
VICKI ABELES: So I don't
want to be an alarmist.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.180
But here is what the data shows.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060
One in three students reported
to the American Psychological

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.785
Association that
they are stressed

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:28.600
and that that stress is
leading them to depression.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.570
The number one source of the
stress cited by 83% of students

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.450
was school.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.420
The CDC reports that the
majority of teenagers

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.480
in this country get two hours
less of sleep each night

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.950
than what's recommended.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.520
And then in a recent survey that
we conducted in collaboration

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.400
with a pediatrician from St.
Louis at a local Bay Area

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.550
high school.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.910
What we discovered
was really concerning.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.590
We did a survey about the
wellness of that community.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280
Community surveying middle
class families, about

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
2000 high school students.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220
More than 50% of
those students we're

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.160
showing signs of moderate
to severe depression.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.750
More than 50%.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.310
I think what we have, James,
is a public health crisis.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.870
On a scale that we have
yet to fully recognize.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.779
And at the same time I think
that we need to use that data

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.570
and what we know-- even
annecdotatelly-- in our homes,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.130
in our classrooms, in our
communities, to inspire action.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.360
And just a quick
example-- you may

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.670
be familiar with this-- but
the Burbank school district

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.650
has taken these
issues seriously.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.930
They've created a
wellness task force.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.690
They now have a wellness center
at one of their high schools.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.225
They adopted a suicide
prevention policy

00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:39.600
in their district,
which involved

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.030
professional development for
all professionals ranging

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.805
from teachers to
administer to janitors.

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:48.430
And they are also addressing the
source of the unhealthy stress

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.280
in our kids lives.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.640
Ranging from homework to AP
courses to too much testing.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.280
So I'm really inspired by that
story and there are stories

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.781
like that.

00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:57.571
Which you knew, we
write about in our book.

00:04:57.571 --> 00:04:59.900
JAMES: Yes, well I want to
switch around a little bit

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.441
and talk about
wellness for a second.

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:05.000
So mindfulness is something
that has been taught

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.140
to thousands of Googlers.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.120
As one of the
training programs we

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.980
get to take, addressing
stress is one of the things

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.800
we think about-- it's
part of our culture.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.550
How have some of the
districts that you've

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.910
spoken to taken practical
steps on addressing stress?

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.330
VICKI ABELES: So we see a
number of districts and schools

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.370
and even teachers who are
adopting mindfulness programs.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.679
Adding Yoga to the school day.

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.220
And I think that's
terrific and there

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.870
is great research to support
the benefits of that.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.570
At the same time,
I am an advocate

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.920
for getting to the source
of the unhealthy stress.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.380
And I think, unfortunately,
too many of our kids

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.860
are suffering from a
system and a culture that

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.280
values business-- and oftentimes
that means too much homework.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.790
That values constant measurement
and the arms race to college.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.800
And I think that it's really
incumbent upon all of us

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.150
as people who care for
students, for children,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.380
to address those
unhealthy stressors.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.460
And at the same time to add
programs like mindfulness.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.580
JAMES: So that leads to the next
thought I have-- is all right,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.250
so part of this is students
get caught up in the arms race

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.560
with their peers.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.750
Feeling like it's a badge
of honor to lose sleep

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.940
and to take 10 AP classes.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.640
Parents get terrified
about their kids

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.000
getting into the right school.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.440
And everyone seems to be
trapped in this cycle.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.840
So how do you
respond to this fear

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.110
of being disadvantaged
if you're the first one

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.100
to try to address this problem.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.885
VICKI ABELES: Right, so I think
that's an excellent point,

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:35.660
is that no one really wants to
step off the treadmill first.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.650
But we're at Goggle
here today and so

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.810
let's think about the
things that make people

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.350
at Google successful, right?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.990
I imagine many people
at this company

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.189
are successful because
they're creative,

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:46.980
because they're
self-starters, because they

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.600
know how to get things done.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.240
And unfortunately
our schools today

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.060
are set up in ways that our
kids spend most of their days

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.730
sitting in rows, consuming
information and regurgitating

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.230
it.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.470
That's what we value in
many of our schools today.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.800
And unfortunately we crowd
out the opportunity for them

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.290
to develop the very skill
that are going to serve them,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.220
not just in college and their
future employment, but in life.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.700
And so, you know, what
I find really inspiring

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.660
are those schools that we
have followed these last three

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.050
years in the film "Beyond
Measure" and in the book,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.900
that are taking
steps to re-imagine

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.475
what's possible in our school.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.850
And I think that's the question
we need to ask ourselves.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.090
What if we design schools in a
way that prioritized wellness

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.020
and learning?

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.350
JAMES: So that in the movie
you have some amazing examples

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.810
of innovation around schools
changing-- charter schools,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.489
public schools,
that didn't really

00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:40.030
seem to be the
factors-- just schools

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.250
that took that first step,
not just the individual

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.350
but-- what are some of the most
inspiring examples of schools

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.000
that have taken that leap of
faith and seen it at least

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.060
head the right direction.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.420
VICKI ABELES: Right, so
we've visited schools that

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.380
are taking steps big and small.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.920
What I want to
highlight is the process

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.279
of change, the process that
creates change is really

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.570
what we want to be focusing on.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.230
And it's critical
that that process

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.260
include all of the stake
holders in a community.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.500
Ranging from students--
students need

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.850
to be an important voice
in these conversations,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.180
they need to inform the design
or the redesign of the school.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.360
In fact, in all of the schools
that we feature in our new film

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.670
students were an integral
part of the design process.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.020
You need to engage the
superintendents, the community

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.880
members.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.090
I think everybody needs to be
a part of this conversation.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.540
There is no greater resource
and important issue,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.830
I think, than addressing
the well-being of our kids

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.780
and their preparation
for their future.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.899
JAMES: So what have you
learned to help students break

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:38.940
this cycle even if their
parents are pushing them

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.731
and even if the districts
are pushing them.

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.320
And I think when we get to Ken
that there's a great example

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.000
of that locally.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.230
But where they get into the
idea that this studying late

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.032
at night and even
pretending to go

00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:51.990
to sleep-- as you wrote
about-- and having wake

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.310
up in the middle of the
night doing homework

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.976
when their parents
think they're asleep.

00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:57.554
What are some of the ways
to have students believe

00:08:57.554 --> 00:08:58.720
it's in their best interest?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.940
VICKI ABELES: Well,
so one of the ways

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.280
to have them believe it's
in their best interest is

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.850
to tell them stories
of people who

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.179
have taken alternative paths.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.720
To really convince
them that it's not

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.267
the name of the college
that one attends that

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:11.600
determines your success in life.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.760
And in fact, what colleges,
what employers are looking for

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.290
are people who are passionate.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.373
People who are interested.

00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:20.630
People who want to
contribute something

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.080
positive to the world.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.539
That being said, you know, I
think there's a lot of things

00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:27.705
that individuals can do in
their home-- both parents

00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:28.540
and students.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.460
You know, from modeling balance
as parents for our children.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.520
To encouraging our children
to not over schedule

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.900
both academically and in
terms of extracurriculars.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.809
But I also think that puts a
lot of burden on individuals.

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:43.350
And what I want to
say to you, James,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.040
is that I think the individuals
are responding right now

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.130
to the culture
that exists, right?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.000
And if you are a parent
with a child in school,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.570
school is the culture.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.310
And that culture really impacts
your family and your student.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.810
And so that's why I'm a big
advocate for a school change

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.490
as well.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.440
I think that we need
to move away from what

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.740
has become a blame game.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.980
Of blaming college admissions,
of blaming helicopter parents

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.625
and say, the individuals
are responding

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.440
to the system and the culture.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.010
And we all make up that culture.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.980
And what we're trying to
do is to empower people

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.150
to change that culture.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.050
And that takes a
different mindset

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.259
about the things that matter.

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:21.050
JAMES: So that kind of
leads to-- if you're

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.722
trying to implement
any kind of change,

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.180
if you're trying
to sell something,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.680
you're going to run
into objections.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.370
People are going to come up
with all kinds of reasons

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.360
not to do things.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.890
It's human nature to
be static in some ways.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.540
So what are some of the
most common objections

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.420
you hear, that you
expect to hear,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.000
and how do you counter
those objections.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.920
VICKI ABELES: So I think the
most common objection to things

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.230
like reducing the
number of AP courses

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.150
or reducing the
amount of homework

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.710
is our kids won't be prepared
for what's coming next.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.870
And the reality is
research is very clear

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.640
that the best way to prepare
people for bad situations--

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.770
let's just say high
school homework-- is

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.170
to have lots of good
experience along the way.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.060
But the other argument
that I'll make,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.660
James, is that we know that our
kids are incredibly unhealthy.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.860
They're sleep deprived, they're
anxious, they're depressed.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.820
They're contemplating
suicide at increasing rates.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.160
And at the same time we
hear from college professors

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.220
and from employers
that they're showing up

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.260
unprepared for the kind
of thinking and problem

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.330
solving that's needed.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.140
So I don't really think
there is a reason for us not

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.980
to make the change.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.820
Oftentimes, I think what
keeps us stuck in the status

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.690
quo is the mindset
that school is best

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.150
done as it's always done.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.780
And it's incredibly--
you know, there

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.440
are a lot of stake holders
that need to come to the table

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.920
in order to make the changes.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.950
JAMES: So before we bring
our next member of the panel

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.030
up here.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.370
I want to finish the
questions directly to you

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.636
about the recommend-- you in the
book in a very practical way.

00:11:53.636 --> 00:11:54.260
Which is great.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.400
I think it's part of
the reason I think

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.880
you went from "Race to
Nowhere" to "Beyond Measure"

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.500
to give people a
sense of what to do.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.400
So of the many
suggestions you make

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.020
at the end of the book, what
are a couple that you would--

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.090
for the people in
the Live stream,

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.260
here in the audience, who
watch this later on YouTube--

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.790
what are some steps
that they can take

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.456
starting tomorrow that you think
are the most practical, to just

00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:11.120
get started.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.000
VICKI ABELES: OK, so I've got
a long winded answer to that.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.380
So big picture in our
schools, I think that we

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.100
need to consider three things.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.430
We need to prioritize wellness.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.050
And that means addressing
unhealthy stressors.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.900
We need to recalibrate the way
time is spent in our schools

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.870
around a whole new
set of priorities.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.550
And we need to transform
learning in our schools.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.660
And each of us, parents,
educators, concerned citizens,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.010
need to play a role in the
advocacy to make that happen.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.700
As far as at the
individual level,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.470
I just want to share a quote
from the film "Beyond Measure."

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.140
Sir Ken Robinson-- I
assume you know who he is--

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.870
says at the very end of the
film, if you're a teacher

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.800
and you change what you
do in your classroom

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.650
you have to changed
the education system

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.320
for the students in your class.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.644
Now, I think that's a
really empowering thought.

00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:58.060
As you know from
reading the book,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.670
we share the story
of Mike Miller,

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.550
who is a teacher in Virginia.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.270
And on his own once he
had his own children

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.400
decided to reduce
homework substantially

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.950
to make homework the exception
rather than the rule.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.290
And to eliminate most
quizzes and tests.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.610
And what he found is that
students in his class

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.580
did not become lazy
all of the sudden.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.360
But, in fact, they
read more deeply.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.090
They thought more deeply.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.780
They wrote more creatively.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.780
And so I think that thought
that Sir Ken Robinson

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.110
shares at the end of the
film applies to all of us.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.800
Whether you're a parent,
a teacher, or a student,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.510
we all need to be
advocates for change.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.590
And so for anyone
here today, as well as

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.470
the people that are
listening, I would also

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.310
encourage you to get
this conversation started

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.460
in your community.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.650
We are looking to want
a national conversation

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.820
about what's possible and about
the schools of the future.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.090
And we've created a
lot of good resources

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.470
to engage a community
to share the research

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.640
behind these models that I think
are forward facing schools.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.725
And better serve our
students and our teachers.

00:14:00.725 --> 00:14:03.990
So I would just say get
involved, start a conversation.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.170
Form alliances with
like minded people.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.224
And create the change
that our kids need.

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:10.390
JAMES: And if you haven't
watched Ken Robinson's TED

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.690
talk on creativity it's
a must watch Google

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.690
and it's out on YouTube.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.630
So I want to invite
up Ken Dower.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.070
Ken is a Palo Alto Unified
School District board member.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.967
And he's a Google
staff engineer.

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:25.050
I learned about Ken's
passion for education reform

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.960
from Vicki's book,
he was quoted.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.475
He-- as I suspect
many of you know--

00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:32.675
Palo Alto school district
is known for many things.

00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:34.050
For it's education
excellence, it

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.850
is also known for its
tragic suicide clusters.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.160
And Ken has a PhD in sociology
from the University of Arizona

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.920
and has on the ground experience
making a difference in Bay Area

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.420
schools.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.030
And he's a board member at the
Paolo Alto school district.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.955
He's also a consultant for the
U.S. Department of Education

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.800
and the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.250
to name just a couple of the
many things that he has done.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.708
So I brought Ken
up here because he

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.790
can bring a local perspective
and he's also part

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.600
of "Beyond Measure" the book.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.367
So I'm going to have the two of
you respond to these questions.

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:04.450
And you can chip in where
you think it make sense.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.491
But we'll start with Ken.

00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:07.392
So the Palo Alto
Unified School District

00:15:07.392 --> 00:15:09.600
is known for its academic
achievements-- as I noted--

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.930
and suicide clusters.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.660
How unique is this
story, in your research?

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.270
And I'm very interested in
your thoughts too, Vicki.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.420
KEN DOWER: Well, I
think that-- I mean,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:26.510
unfortunately, our experience
with suicide is unusual.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:32.430
I think that it's our-- the
level of academic achievement

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.010
is pretty typical of
affluent suburban communities

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.040
across the United States.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.420
I think that-- as
Vicki has talked

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.810
about-- the issues of
stress and sleep deprivation

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.550
and so forth are really
common across the country.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.990
And the issues
that she is talking

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.790
about here and in the
book are really typical,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.412
not just in Palo
Alto, but everywhere.

00:15:58.412 --> 00:15:59.870
VICKI ABELES: And
I would just say,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.890
fortunately, we don't see
lots of suicide clusters

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.590
but there are other across
the country happening

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.030
on some college campuses,
and high schools as well.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.640
It's just Palo Alto seems to
have gotten a lot of media

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.730
attention of late.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.650
But you, Ken, I believe that
the underlying conditions

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.780
that create the risk, they're
there in many communities.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.466
We need to do
something about that.

00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:26.590
Importantly-- I just want
to say-- those underlying

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.750
conditions that I mentioned
earlier, as far as

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.810
sleep deprivation,
anxiety, and stress,

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.950
not only are kids
unhealthy today,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.390
but we are potentially setting
them up for life long disease.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.160
And that is the reason, I think,
for people to pay attention.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.986
And create action.

00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:43.402
JAMES: Well, I
think another point

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:47.827
there is that depression can
be linked to sleep deprivation

00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:49.410
but in fact it's the
other way around.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.080
That sleep deprivation
can lead to depression.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.639
So Ken, tie in--
talk a little bit

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.180
about how that
connection between all

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.770
the negative effects
of sleep deprivation.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.060
KEN DOWER: Well, I think
that's absolutely right.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.430
I mean, one of the
questions that people

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.031
had in the relation
between sleep deprivation

00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:10.030
and depression, for
example, is which is causal.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.030
And there have been studies
now that have really

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.530
teased that out and shown that
sleep has a-- lack of sleep--

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.119
has an independent effect.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.359
It's not just that
being depressed

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:23.280
reduces sleep it's that--
or has an effect on sleep--

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.250
it's that loss of
sleep can really

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.460
have all kinds of
negative health effects.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.980
On depression, on
things like propensity

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.680
to have a car accident,
on and suicidally,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.000
on depressing
academic achievement.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.890
What I really found in looking
at the research on sleep

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.250
over the last few years is
that if there is, to my mind,

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.990
if there's a sort
of silver bullet

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.910
that we could fasten on to
improve the lives of children

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.510
at school and academic
achievement it would be sleep.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.810
And if you think about it from
a kind of policy perspective,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.730
if we had policies that actually
worked to encourage sleep

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.130
we would be doing so
many positive things

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.060
in order to get there.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.080
In terms of reducing
homework and, you know,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.800
encouraging students-- and
having later start times--

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.970
encouraging students
to spend time

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.740
in the evening
with their families

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.090
and on the other pursuits
rather than homework.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.341
All those positive things.

00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:25.840
If we could really
move that needle,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.310
they'd have the
direct effect on sleep

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.726
but they would
also have all kinds

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:30.150
of other positive effects.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.525
VICKI ABELES: I
completely agree.

00:18:31.525 --> 00:18:33.560
And indeed the American
Academy of Pediatrics

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.440
has recommended a later
start time of 8:30

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.060
for middle and high schools.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.490
There are pockets of
schools that are adopting

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.150
that but not nearly enough.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.090
And in their policy
recommendation

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.240
they also cite homework and
extra curricular activities

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.240
as things that get
in the way of sleep.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.470
So from my perspective,
just going back

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.730
to the question
about one action,

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.480
I would say homework is
the low hanging fruit here.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.140
Our kids, if you just take
a look at a day in the life

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.960
of a typical high
school student--

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.350
not an over scheduled student.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.770
We can pick my son, for example.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.730
Five or six academic classes,
they spend seven hours--

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.710
7 and 1/2 hours--
a day in school.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.010
Right there, that's nearly
a 40 hour work week.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.320
And then if you factor in school
sponsored extracurriculars,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.100
just one extra curricular.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.270
Whether that's a sports
team, a debate club, theater,

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.710
that's 15 to 20 hours
pretty typically these days.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.650
Right there, you've
got a 60 hour week.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.940
And then you add on
top of that homework.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.970
And homework studies are
tricky because we're relying

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.950
a lot on self reporting.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.460
But there is a study that
shows that students today

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.190
on average, high
school students are

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.840
getting 18 hours of
homework assigned to them.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.120
And that assumes that
your child can do the work

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.210
in that amount of time.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.900
That's become a third
shift for our kids

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.524
and I think it is
the single thing that

00:19:48.524 --> 00:19:50.400
is getting in the way of sleep.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.920
And it's also
preventing our kids

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.980
from developing in all
kinds of other ways

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.794
that are really important.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.460
JAMES: You talk about
getting more sleep

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.180
and, Ken, you specifically
targeted zero period,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.470
infamous zero period.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.980
And went through
quite a struggle

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.124
to at least partially eliminate
zero period from Paul Alto

00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:07.790
School District.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.010
Including large
resistance from students.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:16.076
Talk about how you approached
that challenge of making

00:20:16.076 --> 00:20:17.950
the point you were trying
to make and have it

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.866
actually have some
tangible action at the end.

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:22.160
And how you worked
through those objections.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.540
KEN DOWER: So this
was an issue that we

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.850
worked through a year ago.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:32.660
And zero period is the period
before the start of the school

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.880
day.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.300
So our high schools
changed their start times

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.500
several years ago to around
8:30 to encourage sleep.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.480
But shortly after created
so-called zero periods

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.130
that start at 7:20
or so in the morning.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.330
And one of our
high schools, Guns,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.810
started to schedule a
number of academic classes

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.160
into zero period.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.080
And we had about 300 students
in zero period at Gun.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.330
And as Vicki said a year
and a half ago or so

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.180
the American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.150
came out with their
recommendation on school start

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.150
times of 8:30 or later.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.800
Along with a whole really
overwhelming amount of research

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.310
that shows the serious negative
effects of earlier start times.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.760
And so to me and
others in the community

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.860
this seem like an obvious,
to use Vicki's word,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.760
low hanging fruit.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.510
You know, why do
we have students

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.860
taking academic
classes in zero period.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.390
So I raised this issue
at the school board.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.060
Many local doctors eventually
weighed in on this.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.220
I met with the pediatricians
at Palo Alto Medical Foundation

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.080
who saw this as an issue that
was of real concern for them.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.840
And we advocated for a change
in our school district practice

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.040
to not have academic
classes in zero period.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.900
We can get to the
other things that

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.185
are going on in zero
period as well, which--

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:18.590
and you'll be hearing about
the art of the possible at some

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.410
point in here.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.740
But we did run into some
significant resistance

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.400
among students.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.360
Hardly any among
parents, actually.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.230
But among students.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.750
And they organized,
very helpfully really,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:38.540
a survey of students to say what
it was-- and one of the things

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.880
that they were asking
about, is what are students

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.070
getting out of zero period?

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.020
Why do they want zero period?

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.640
And when I looked at those
surveys and coded them up

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.200
for the reasons.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.600
What I found is that
there were two reasons.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.586
One is students were-- wanted
early morning classes so

00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:58.210
that they could get
their homework done

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.210
earlier, because they
could leave school earlier.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.752
And they also wanted
early morning classes

00:23:03.752 --> 00:23:05.460
so that they could
finish school in order

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.640
to get to their
sports activities.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.420
And to me what that
really meant is

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.100
that they were getting up
early as a coping strategy

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.190
for solving problems
that we really should

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.040
be solving for them, right?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.660
We should not be creating
a situation where

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.630
kids feel like they have to get
up early so that they can get

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.570
to bed at a reasonable
hour because they have

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.921
so much homework after school.

00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:32.920
And we should be arranging
their sports schedule

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.780
so that they can go to
school at a reasonable hour

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.900
finish at a reasonable
hour and then go on

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.380
to their competitions.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.590
So to me what was clear is
that the student support

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.570
for zero period was largely
around solving problems

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.420
that we should be
solving more directly.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.990
It's also the case, I think,
that students experienced it

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.257
as a sort of a lack of control.

00:23:58.257 --> 00:24:00.590
And one of the things that I
think we're giving students

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.590
with the way they were
organizing life at school

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.370
is an experience
of lack of control.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.640
You know, they just
don't have a sense

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.620
that they are in
control of their lives.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.430
Because very often they're not.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.310
I mean from morning
till night they're

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.790
doing things that they're
not really choosing to do.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.630
And this felt to them
like a lack of choice,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.930
sort of paradoxically.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.524
But I think in real terms.

00:24:20.524 --> 00:24:21.940
VICKI ABELES: And
I would just add

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.829
that the lack of choice of just
one more factor, I believe,

00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:26.120
that contributes to depression.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.340
And is out of sync with the
research around motivation

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.060
and what we know
supports motivation.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.200
Giving people autonomy
and opportunity

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.642
is to have mastering
experiences.

00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:37.100
And then, importantly,
I would also

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.410
add as far as the
depressed and anxiety, is

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.650
so much of their
student day-- not only

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.150
do they not have a
choice about it--

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.460
but often there is a
disconnect and no purpose seen

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.000
in what they're doing.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.540
And so Bill Damon, a professor
at Stanford University,

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.540
writes a lot about this.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.470
That is the lack of
purpose that is also

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.784
contributing to epidemic rates
of anxiety and depression.

00:24:57.784 --> 00:24:59.450
So I think that's
also really important.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.160
Giving our students more
choice and more opportunities

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.240
for connection between the work
that they're doing and meaning

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.320
in their lives.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.240
KEN DOWER: So before I open up
to questions from the audience

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.440
and I'll check the Dory too.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.386
Just to close off
thoughts from both of you.

00:25:15.386 --> 00:25:18.540
So reading this book I
had to read it in chunks

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.140
because it got me very wound up.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.390
Had to chill out a little bit.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.060
It's a great book.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.184
I encourage you to read it.

00:25:23.184 --> 00:25:25.660
Just you may have to
read it in pieces.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.430
Because it was both
inspiring in parts,

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.110
it was very
frustrating in parts.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.950
And it's not hard for me feels
as a parent with a sophomore

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.920
that it's almost too late
for me to make change

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.970
for my younger daughter.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.969
But I'm going to try to.

00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:38.950
I'm going to do everything
I can to try to.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.900
What gives you hope that
widespread change is possible?

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.340
VICKI ABELES: So everywhere I go
I'm inspired by fearless change

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:48.970
makers.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.210
And people who are
starting to ask questions.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.580
I think the frustration of any,
which I've experienced also

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.360
being that I've also-- my
youngest is now a high school

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.170
junior-- is that we need to
accelerate the rate of change.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.000
And we need to make
it possible for people

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.250
to come forward with both their
questions and their ideas.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.210
KEN DOWER: So I think that one
of the things that gives me

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:20.850
real optimism is that I
think in the past people

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.280
had seen health for
students and well-being,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.470
and learning and achievement,
as two kind of opposed values.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.630
And that we had to trade
off one against the other.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.129
Right?

00:26:31.129 --> 00:26:33.850
So if you want healthy students
and well-rested students

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.950
you have to-- the cost of
that is less achievement.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.670
Right?

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.230
Less homework, less rigor.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.330
And what I think is
really becoming clear

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.070
and well understood across our--
and certainly our community--

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.032
is that these are not opposed.

00:26:51.032 --> 00:26:52.240
In fact, they're reinforcing.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.580
That you really cannot have
students who are learning

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.040
and getting what we want them to
get out of school and have them

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.357
be sleep deprived and
anxious and depressed.

00:27:03.357 --> 00:27:05.440
And those are really
inconsistent with each other.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.270
So I-- and many
others in Palo Alto--

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.060
have really tried to
carry that message.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.970
And I think it's a message
that people are hearing.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:19.720
And I also agree with
Vicki that working

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.520
that into actual practice--
these are big entrenched

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.850
organizations.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.950
You know, they're
not easy to change.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.290
But it's possible.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.360
You know, winning
election in school boards.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.140
Forming parent groups.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.130
Having local blogs that
focus on these issues.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.120
Those are all things that
really make a difference.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.530
Talking to your
parents teacher so

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.380
that they hear-- so that they--
so that their experience is

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.930
parents who want less rather
than parents who want more.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.180
Those are all things that make
change possible to happen.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.080
VICKI ABELES: I just--
real quickly-- and so,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.710
I completely agree with you.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.210
Health and learning
go hand-in-hand.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.550
And our new film
features these schools

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.510
that are really creating new
and transformative learning

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.220
experiences.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.550
So not just reducing
homework and assessment

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.340
but actually looking at the
research around how people

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.740
learn and making the
learning much more

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.550
hands on much more
meaningful, experiential.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.030
So I would just encourage all
of you who are listening today

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.110
to help us take this to
a cultural conversation.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:25.380
And to know there is a better
way to educate our kids

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.940
and prepare them
for their future

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.816
while not stealing their
childhood in the process.

00:28:29.816 --> 00:28:32.190
AUDIENCE: Although we talk a
lot about the middle schools

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.460
and the high schools
making all these changes.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.120
I'm just curious,
Vicki, how receptive

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.540
have the colleges been to
your research and your books

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.090
and movies.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.400
And, you know, are they
open to these changes?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.940
Because we can do
all of that here

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.286
but if you're all mindful
through middle school

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:47.910
and high school then
you get to college

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.850
and you can't even
keep up-- you know,

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.396
what's going to
happen to these kids?

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:54.020
It doesn't really matter now if
the colleges aren't open to it.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.659
So I'm just curious how much
success you've had there.

00:28:56.659 --> 00:28:58.950
VICKI ABELES: So I have a
long winded response to that.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.170
But let me just
say that colleges

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.250
are seeing the
outcomes from this very

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.630
narrow vision for schooling.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.356
And they're also
wanting the change.

00:29:07.356 --> 00:29:08.855
So if you're not
familiar with this,

00:29:08.855 --> 00:29:10.930
a couple months ago
a new report came out

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.002
from a consortium of colleges.

00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:16.300
It's called "Turning
the Tide" and it's

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.070
making caring more common.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.002
And so colleges
absolutely recognize

00:29:20.002 --> 00:29:20.960
that we have a problem.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.470
But like many of us,
I think they're also

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.690
afraid to go first.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.200
Which is why doing these
things in collaboration

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.737
and as a movement
is so important.

00:29:30.737 --> 00:29:32.320
You know, they are
seeing the outcomes

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.360
with wellness centers that
are beyond their capacity.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.880
With students who are leaving
college their first year.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.010
So as a parents, what I will say
with two daughters in college,

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.060
it's much more important
for our children

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.960
to show up at college with the
life skills that they need,

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.560
with the resiliency, and
with a passion for learning

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.360
not schooled out of them.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.790
So colleges are absolutely
receptive to that.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.070
And what I also want to
share is that we recently

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.850
screened "Beyond Measure"
at Olin College, which

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.050
is one of the colleges
featured in the film.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.640
And I sat on a panel
with Liz Coleman,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.450
who is the former president
of Bennington College.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.280
And the question
posed to her was,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.720
what is it going to take to
create an education revolution?

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.260
And Liz Coleman's response
was that we're not

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.070
going to have an education
revolution until we stop

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.730
seeing kindergarten
through 12th grade

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.770
as preparation for college.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.270
Right.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.030
What-- and then she went on
with a very provocative thought.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.300
Which is what if K through 12
was so incredible that our kids

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.400
didn't need to go to college.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.590
And so I would just
challenge all of us

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.460
to rethink what we're
doing in our schools.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.299
To allow our kids to be present
with their experiences today.

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:46.090
And to know that that's
going to serve them

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.857
in the long run, whatever
their path may be.

00:30:49.857 --> 00:30:51.940
JAMES: And I think I just
want to-- before we past

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.820
to any other questions-- I have
personal anecdote that I shared

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.020
with our school district.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.120
That I don't know if I would
be a software engineer today

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.620
if I had had the amount
of homework kids have now.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.460
What was I doing after
school when I had free time?

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.920
I was coding an
Apple II computer.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.640
And I was absolutely
obsessed with that.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.650
I was passionate about that.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.900
If I had no time left
that passion would not

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.330
have had a chance to
flourish, except in the window

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.740
of the summer, which is pretty
well scheduled too today.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.570
So that free time-- I think
there's a fear of free time.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.150
That somehow that
free time is going

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.180
to be wasted if
left up to the child

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.560
to figure out what to do with.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.170
What's missed there is that free
time may result in some boredom

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.950
and that boredom will eventually
get trounced by the desire

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.730
to do something
fun and creative.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.670
And boredom is actually a
great trigger of creativity.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.230
So in my own
personal experience I

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.627
can see a difference between
if I was a student now

00:31:48.627 --> 00:31:51.210
I don't know if I would have had
the time to become a software

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.570
engineer in high school.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.320
VICKI ABELES: And I
would also add to that

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.945
that those moments after school
when your kids are doing things

00:31:56.945 --> 00:31:59.460
that they're interested in
and they're passionate about,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.700
that's actually where the
self learning kicks in.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.330
It's where the
perseverance kicks in,

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.780
when they're doing something
because they want to do it.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.880
Where they learn those
skills that we all know

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.880
are so critical
for their success.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.000
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about homework policy

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.655
and pursuing changes with that.

00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:16.280
You know, it's likely
to be most successful

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.570
as a collaborative process.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.650
Where we involve a lot
of the stakeholders.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.470
And I'm thinking we may
find some resistance

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.470
either from parents
or from teachers.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.440
Do you have any perspectives
on who we might find resistance

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.840
from and how to
address that so that we

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.110
can continue to move forward?

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.780
VICKI ABELES:
Well, you're always

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.310
going to find people who are
opposed to change, right?

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:39.730
What we find is it tends to
be 10% to 20% of the people,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.960
whether it's teachers or
parents-- who are opposed.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.700
Right.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.180
The rest of the people
really want the change.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.610
And so what I would
say is within a school

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:50.195
make it optional, right?

00:32:50.195 --> 00:32:52.320
I think just going back to
one of James's questions

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.910
about what's the most
inspiring change.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.970
I think the opportunity to
create a school within a school

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.890
or school within a district
or a third grade class

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.050
within a Third grade
elementary, you know, program

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.350
at an elementary school.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.910
And allow the people who are
ready for that kind of change

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.850
to opt in.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.670
Allow the teachers
who are ready to teach

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.310
without assigning homework
and constant testing,

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.200
allow them to opt in.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.390
And then let the parents
and students opt in.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.480
And when other people see that
the world doesn't fall apart

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.420
and, in fact, kids come
to school much more

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.040
curious and creative rested.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.235
I think you'll see those
changes start to spread.

00:33:30.235 --> 00:33:32.360
But the reality is when
you're talking specifically

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.276
about homework I just
need to say-- going back

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:36.910
to the low hanging fruit--
there's no research to support

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.160
it an elementary school.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.540
In middle school it's
very little research

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.890
to support it--
even in high school.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.010
The OECD, which is the
organization that administers

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.560
the PISA test-- the
international test

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.146
that our kids participate in.

00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:52.520
The countries,
first of all, that

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.320
lead the way in
those tests-- Finland

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.320
as an example-- assign
far less homework than we

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.560
do in this country.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.620
And what the OECD has
concluded that in high school

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.520
after four hours
a week of homework

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.510
you see diminishing returns.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.300
And we know that
many students are

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.420
suffering under the burden
of four hours a night.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.834
So I think health is
so critically important

00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:18.800
and that we begin to address it.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.489
If you take homework
off the table

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:23.889
I've had pediatricians say you'd
see health outcomes improve

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:24.719
overnight.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.150
And I think in that way we
would also free schools up

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.562
to begin to redesign
learning experiences.

00:34:30.562 --> 00:34:32.270
KEN DOWER: Yeah, I
would agree with that.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.550
I mean, I think homework
is a really fascinating

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.219
cultural phenomenon.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.980
There is very little
evidence that it has,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.050
as Vicki says, much of
an educational effect.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.100
And certainly at the
levels that we see

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.929
are demonstrated to
have a negative effect.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.920
Yet, we are consuming
enormous amounts of it.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.300
It's kind of a mania almost.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.640
I think it be well worth
delving into why that is.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.840
And it has been a few-- I
was on the district homework

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.150
committee in Palo Alto
and one of the things

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:09.740
that we had to do was kind
of peel the sort of moral

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.320
and you know
dimensions of homework.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.350
Homework is good
for kids because it

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.449
makes them
self-disciplined and you

00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:17.990
know it teaches them
all these things

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.289
that there's no evidence that
it actually teaches them.

00:35:20.289 --> 00:35:22.080
And if we were trying
to teach them that we

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.110
would have a curriculum for it.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.901
We wouldn't just send
them home with a book

00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:27.050
and hope that they
get through it.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.560
I do think that, at least
our experience in Palo Alto,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.610
is that there is no real
opposition to limiting--

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.320
to a policy that
limits homework.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.310
I think the biggest
obstacle to change,

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.750
and what we really found, is
passing the policy was easy.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.772
Implementing it has
been very difficult.

00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:51.230
Not because of
organized resistance

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.650
but because of organizational
inertia, really.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.752
And providing the tools
to make homework visible.

00:35:57.752 --> 00:35:59.460
I mean, one of the
problems with homework

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.150
is that it happens at home
where nobody can see it.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.650
So it's kind of an
unfunded mandate.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:09.520
So making it even visible to
teachers and to administrators

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.035
is a step that we have to take.

00:36:12.035 --> 00:36:13.410
In fact, that's
one of the things

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.630
I would really-- am pressing
on us to do next year.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.120
Is to provide a feedback
mechanism that's reliable

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.640
so that teachers
can actually see

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.390
how much time is being spent.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.020
Because it's hard
to control something

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.702
that you can't see or measure.

00:36:26.702 --> 00:36:28.410
VICKI ABELES: Two
quick thoughts on that.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.851
I think it's a great question,
and it's a really important

00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:33.350
conversation that we need to
have in our school communities,

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.350
is what time belongs
to the family?

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.570
And I would argue that
weekends belong to the family.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.360
Every weekend.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.650
The idea that our kids are
working seven days a week,

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.830
that they never have a day
without something hanging

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.030
over their head-- and we
know from the research

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.167
that that is not the best way to
grow and develop all the things

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:53.250
that we care about, right.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.680
So weekends, holiday breaks,
summer breaks and, you know,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.210
I think that the next
step is our evenings.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.470
We are not giving
our kids a choice

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.630
about going home in
the evening and putting

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.350
in that second or third shift.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.920
Where we as adults
do have a choice.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.480
And more flexibility and
room to navigate the demands.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.860
And we're also adults.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.740
These are kids and teenagers
whose bodies and minds

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.670
are still growing
and developing.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.950
And you know there's something
really wrong with the idea

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.060
that we think it's OK for them
to be putting in a 70 hour

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.340
workweek.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.880
To go back to your question
though in terms of resistance

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.220
or what support I would
just say is needed in order

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.380
to make these changes.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.420
I actually think that
professional development

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.810
is needed for teachers.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.200
Because if you take
homework off the table

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.020
that's an integral part
of many teachers practice.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.780
And what we have
found in the schools

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.080
that we visited that have
eliminated homework, when

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.140
the principals
speak to us candidly

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.946
they say it's actually not
the parents who are resisting,

00:37:52.946 --> 00:37:54.680
it's many of our teachers.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.840
And so I would just
recommend anybody

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.350
who wants to have
this conversation,

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.640
Dr. Etta Kralovec at the
University of Arizona

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.240
is an expert in this space.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.420
She loves to do professional
development for teachers.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.190
She just is online today with
an interview about eliminating

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.930
all homework K through 12.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.354
And I would argue to make it the
exception rather than the rule.

00:38:16.354 --> 00:38:18.020
AUDIENCE: I really
agree with everything

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.092
you've said so far on the
well-being of students and kind

00:38:21.092 --> 00:38:22.800
of changing the culture
of your classroom

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.430
so that students are not just
regurgitating what you're

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.040
teaching but really hands on.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.120
So that was my approach going
in to my Pre-Calc class.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.950
But throughout the
semester I was kind of

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.280
torn because students were
preparing for the AP Calc test

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.950
next year.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.300
And at the end of
every year there's

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.190
these standardized testings
and I realized that

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.350
even though the students
enjoyed the culture

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.130
and they were learning, as
I can tell, in our class.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.240
They were struggling with the
actual wording-- reading--

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.710
understanding what the
standardized questions were

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.300
asking.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.940
You know, so I taught the
math in a different way

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.520
than how the
standardized testing was

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.840
asking the questions and I
saw a huge struggle in that.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.150
And while on one hand, I really
want to keep that culture

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.250
and promote their
learning like hands on.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.560
But on the other
hand, I didn't want

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.810
to be the person that
let them fail the test

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.880
and not be able to go to a
good college or something

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.780
because that's still the
way our education system is.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.860
So I'm just wondering from your
point of views, both of you,

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.112
what are your thoughts on that?

00:39:31.112 --> 00:39:35.917
KEN DOWER: Well,
so, this is an issue

00:39:35.917 --> 00:39:38.250
that I've talked about a
little bit on the school board,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.160
is that the cost of
standardized tests

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.820
and AP tests and
things like that

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.700
is that we take
teachers like you who

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.490
bring their own particular
gifts and interests and passions

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:58.980
and we divert them
towards serving goals

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.610
that are formulated elsewhere.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.190
A curriculum that's
developed in New Jersey

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:07.109
is going to be less good,
you know, for students then

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:09.150
a curriculum that's
developed by the teachers who

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.330
are standing in front of them.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.455
And that is a response to
what their interests are.

00:40:12.455 --> 00:40:14.910
So I think that's kind
of the hidden costs

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.485
of this level of standardization
that we're seeing.

00:40:18.485 --> 00:40:19.860
VICKI ABELES: I
completely agree.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.526
I would love to speak
to you afterwards.

00:40:21.526 --> 00:40:23.630
We're actually just
finishing up a film examining

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.915
math education in this country.

00:40:25.915 --> 00:40:28.300
And the experts in that
film are real advocates

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.010
to transform what we're
doing in our math classrooms

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.830
to a direct and much more
in line with what you just

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.710
described.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.840
JAMES: Thank you, again,
for taking your time today

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.689
to share this important topic.

00:40:38.689 --> 00:40:39.980
VICKI ABELES: Thank you, James.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.530
[APPLAUSE]
