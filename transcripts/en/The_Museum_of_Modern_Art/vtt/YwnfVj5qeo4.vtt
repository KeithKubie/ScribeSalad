00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.041
- [Voiceover] The historical
photo documentation is

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.678
obviously very interesting
for understanding

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:13.380
the various transitions
that the guitar took.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.182
For conservators, those photographs

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.484
can inform our treatments.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.020
When the museum acquired the guitar,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.656
it was missing the triangular head stock.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.991
And when the guitar was reassembled,

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:29.196
in about 1980, a facsimile was made.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.765
That was made of a dark coardboard,

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.502
and this is the one that was displayed

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.371
with the guitar for it's entire time

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.007
that it's been at the museum.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.744
When you actually look at
the historical photographs,

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:47.180
the tonality of that triangular headpiece

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.849
actually has much more in common

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.417
with the face of the guitar,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.352
and it's not dark.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.422
One of the main treatments done for this

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.158
exhibition was that new one was made,

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.662
much more in line with original dimensions

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.697
based on the historical photography,

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.633
the color it seems to be more accurate,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:10.370
and the placement is
more consistent as well.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.540
I think it really helps
to define this front plane

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.909
that extends from the head stock

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.878
down through the face.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.881
The table top, which arrived at the museum

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.018
with the guitar was not
displayed with it initially,

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.287
as you can see, it's a section that's cut

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.324
directly from a pre-fabricated box,

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:31.592
these are the staples that would have

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.894
held the box together.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:38.031
And if you can imagine that that is the

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.801
side of say the top of a box,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.938
this would have extended out further.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.039
This part that's lighter

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.543
was protected from the
light when the table top

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:52.212
was installed, and then these two holes

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:56.116
that are underneath are the holes that the

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.286
table top gets pinned to the wall through.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.922
When the guitar was reassembled in 1980,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.091
it was not surface cleaned.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.226
Over the course of, at that point,

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:10.697
it's 70 year life, it had accumulated dust

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:14.234
and accretions from being
in Picasso's studio,

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.204
but then also being stored in a box.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:21.007
The splotches and the accretions
were really distracting

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.210
to the visual understanding of the guitar,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.880
and so the decision was
made to give the guitar

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.782
a thorough surface cleaning.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:32.786
Surface cleaning paper involves using

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:36.490
various techniques ranging from erasers

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.793
to soft brushes, other tools.

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:40.961
When I was working on the guitar,

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.230
I had to build up supports for my hands

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.665
so that I could get down
into the very tight spaces

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:50.665
and kind of devise my own
surface cleaning tools

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.041
so that I could get to
that depth of the knack.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:03:00.041
One of the main effects is
that the overall coloration

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.049
of the guitar is much more even.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.519
It helped to unify the planar elements.
