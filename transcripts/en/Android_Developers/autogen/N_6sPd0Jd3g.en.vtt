00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.169
and we're here today to talk about the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
and we're here today to talk about the
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.000
and we're here today to talk about the
cost of a pixel specifically the colors

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
cost of a pixel specifically the colors
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.860
cost of a pixel specifically the colors
that you choose in your apps and how

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
that you choose in your apps and how
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480

they directly affects the battery uses

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
they directly affects the battery uses
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.930
they directly affects the battery uses
of your user devices so before we do

of your user devices so before we do
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.250
of your user devices so before we do
that we need to think about the actual

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
that we need to think about the actual
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.439
that we need to think about the actual
technology that goes into users devices

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
technology that goes into users devices
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259
technology that goes into users devices
and stiffly the display technologies now

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
and stiffly the display technologies now

stands for a liquid crystal display and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
stands for a liquid crystal display and
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279
stands for a liquid crystal display and
they work very differently to an OLED

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
they work very differently to an OLED
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.400
they work very differently to an OLED
they work with what they call liquid

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
they work with what they call liquid
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439
they work with what they call liquid
crystals so each pixel we made up of a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
crystals so each pixel we made up of a
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180
crystals so each pixel we made up of a
number of color channels of malikul

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
number of color channels of malikul
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279
number of color channels of malikul
crystals the important thing to know

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
crystals the important thing to know
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380
crystals the important thing to know
here is that they require a backlight so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
here is that they require a backlight so
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.209
here is that they require a backlight so
those liquid crystals don't illuminate

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
those liquid crystals don't illuminate
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100
those liquid crystals don't illuminate
themselves that requires a backlight

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
themselves that requires a backlight
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719
themselves that requires a backlight
behind it to shine through the crystals

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
behind it to shine through the crystals
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000
behind it to shine through the crystals
and that's how you see color now most of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
and that's how you see color now most of
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490
and that's how you see color now most of
the power for a LCD display goes into

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
the power for a LCD display goes into
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109
the power for a LCD display goes into
that backlight they also see the actual

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
that backlight they also see the actual
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580
that backlight they also see the actual
crystals don't require that much it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
crystals don't require that much it's
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109
crystals don't require that much it's
the UH it's the backlight so more

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
the UH it's the backlight so more
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200
the UH it's the backlight so more
brightness is more power overload are

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
brightness is more power overload are
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.929
brightness is more power overload are
different only displays are light

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
different only displays are light
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.429
different only displays are light
emitting diodes which as you can guess

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
emitting diodes which as you can guess
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.310
emitting diodes which as you can guess
actually emit light themselves so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
actually emit light themselves so
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.480
actually emit light themselves so
there's no need for a backlight and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
there's no need for a backlight and
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490
there's no need for a backlight and
those pixel each pixel illuminate itself

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
those pixel each pixel illuminate itself
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580
those pixel each pixel illuminate itself
and that's how the light shines out the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
and that's how the light shines out the
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200
and that's how the light shines out the
good thing here is that they allow a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
good thing here is that they allow a
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.770
good thing here is that they allow a
true black so with a LCD the way you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
true black so with a LCD the way you
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.149
true black so with a LCD the way you
achieve black is by turning all the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
achieve black is by turning all the
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160
achieve black is by turning all the
crystals on and then the light the back

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
crystals on and then the light the back
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.780
crystals on and then the light the back
light still shines through and so you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
light still shines through and so you
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.889
light still shines through and so you
can never really get that really dark

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
can never really get that really dark
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.960
can never really get that really dark
true black oh let's complete different

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
true black oh let's complete different
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.389
true black oh let's complete different
in the way they LEDs work is they just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
in the way they LEDs work is they just
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.830
in the way they LEDs work is they just
don't turn the pixel on and that's how

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
don't turn the pixel on and that's how
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649
don't turn the pixel on and that's how
you get black so that's where the power

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
you get black so that's where the power
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.929
you get black so that's where the power
is and the power is dominated by

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
is and the power is dominated by
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550
is and the power is dominated by
actually emitting the light so it's the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
actually emitting the light so it's the
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.730
actually emitting the light so it's the
LED shining that actually is the power

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
LED shining that actually is the power
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.170
LED shining that actually is the power
there's no backlight is the actual LED

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
there's no backlight is the actual LED
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.590
there's no backlight is the actual LED
itself now there's a number of kind of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
itself now there's a number of kind of
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450
itself now there's a number of kind of
arrangements that displays can be made

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
arrangements that displays can be made
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.570
arrangements that displays can be made
in so if you think about pixel you tend

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
in so if you think about pixel you tend
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.999
in so if you think about pixel you tend
to have three channels are G and B and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
to have three channels are G and B and
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.410
to have three channels are G and B and
that's the simplest arrangement each

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
that's the simplest arrangement each
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.090
that's the simplest arrangement each
pixel on your display will

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
pixel on your display will
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.190
pixel on your display will
three channels and that is true for both

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
three channels and that is true for both
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230
three channels and that is true for both
LCD and OLED that both can have

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
LCD and OLED that both can have
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210
LCD and OLED that both can have
different arrangements so that's my

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
different arrangements so that's my
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.670
different arrangements so that's my
straightforward and simply mentally

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
straightforward and simply mentally
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.870
straightforward and simply mentally
simple like you have one two three

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
simple like you have one two three
 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.060
simple like you have one two three
there's also more complex ones

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
there's also more complex ones
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.370
there's also more complex ones
things like RGB are where you'll have

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
things like RGB are where you'll have
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.080
things like RGB are where you'll have
the all the channels we split across two

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
the all the channels we split across two
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.180
the all the channels we split across two
pixels and each pics will only have two

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
pixels and each pics will only have two
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.310
pixels and each pics will only have two
channels it's just a way of kind of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
channels it's just a way of kind of
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560
channels it's just a way of kind of
expanding pixel size without trying to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570
expanding pixel size without trying to
 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.370
expanding pixel size without trying to
fit as many LEDs in now it's important

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
fit as many LEDs in now it's important
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.900
fit as many LEDs in now it's important
to think about because in terms of power

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
to think about because in terms of power
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.070
to think about because in terms of power
more LEDs equals more power usage so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
more LEDs equals more power usage so
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.390
more LEDs equals more power usage so
here we've done a lot of stats over the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
here we've done a lot of stats over the
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.480
here we've done a lot of stats over the
past kind of a year or two because we

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490
past kind of a year or two because we
 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.830
past kind of a year or two because we
know that users care deeply about their

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
know that users care deeply about their
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.110
know that users care deeply about their
battery life and the display tends to be

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
battery life and the display tends to be
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.490
battery life and the display tends to be
the biggest power user

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
the biggest power user
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.760
the biggest power user
power user of your device so you can see

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770
power user of your device so you can see
 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.140
power user of your device so you can see
a very straightforward chart which

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
a very straightforward chart which
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.520
a very straightforward chart which
here's the fact that the higher

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
here's the fact that the higher
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.130
here's the fact that the higher
brightness on your display the more

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
brightness on your display the more
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.290
brightness on your display the more
power it uses you know it's kind of

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
power it uses you know it's kind of
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.780
power it uses you know it's kind of
simple anyway like everyone assumes this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
simple anyway like everyone assumes this
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.540
simple anyway like everyone assumes this
is the weight the case but the thing is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
is the weight the case but the thing is
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.460
is the weight the case but the thing is
it's actually quite linear so again kind

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
it's actually quite linear so again kind
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.360
it's actually quite linear so again kind
of simple but then we started kind of

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
of simple but then we started kind of
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.490
of simple but then we started kind of
comparing our OLED devices or LED

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
comparing our OLED devices or LED
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.590
comparing our OLED devices or LED
screens versus LCD screens and in this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
screens versus LCD screens and in this
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.470
screens versus LCD screens and in this
case it's the pixel versity iPhone 7 we

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480
case it's the pixel versity iPhone 7 we
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970
case it's the pixel versity iPhone 7 we
did with display no screenshot of maps

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
did with display no screenshot of maps
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.940
did with display no screenshot of maps
in both a normal day mode and a night

in both a normal day mode and a night
 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.010
in both a normal day mode and a night
mode the reason we use a screenshot is

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020
mode the reason we use a screenshot is
 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.140
mode the reason we use a screenshot is
because we didn't want the differences

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
because we didn't want the differences
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.960
because we didn't want the differences
between say iOS or Android to conflict

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970
between say iOS or Android to conflict
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760

with the power and just displaying a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770
with the power and just displaying a
 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.080
with the power and just displaying a
screenshot it's just define an image so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
screenshot it's just define an image so
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.280
screenshot it's just define an image so
this should be pretty similar on both

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
this should be pretty similar on both
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.110
this should be pretty similar on both
platforms but you can see with the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
platforms but you can see with the
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.300

both night and day is the same it
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.810
both night and day is the same it
doesn't change and that's because it's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
doesn't change and that's because it's
 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.970
doesn't change and that's because it's
an LCD screen and it does it can't like

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980
an LCD screen and it does it can't like

because it's an OLED display the actual
power usage drops down by 63% which is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060
power usage drops down by 63% which is
 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.900
power usage drops down by 63% which is
huge like a 6-3 percent of the biggest

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910
huge like a 6-3 percent of the biggest

it when you've got actual individual
pixel colors so we did a test where we

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080
pixel colors so we did a test where we
 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.650
pixel colors so we did a test where we
just displayed one color on the on the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
just displayed one color on the on the
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.110
just displayed one color on the on the
on the display and the actual color

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
on the display and the actual color
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.780
on the display and the actual color
itself makes a big difference in power

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790
itself makes a big difference in power
 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.260
itself makes a big difference in power
so blue itself is 25 percent more text

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
so blue itself is 25 percent more text
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.100
so blue itself is 25 percent more text
25% more

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110
25% more
 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.959
25% more
then say green or red and then another

actually we should implement in dark

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250
actually we should implement in dark
 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.129
actually we should implement in dark
themes and the power savings they've

here we have an example which you at

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000
here we have an example which you at

work you can't see the video plane but
 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.879
work you can't see the video plane but
it is and you can see that for back full

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889
it is and you can see that for back full
 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.189

brightness just by switching to a dark

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199

brightness just by switching to a dark
theme you say 43% of your battery usage

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199

now when you playing a video the rest of
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.610
now when you playing a video the rest of
it underneath isn't so important anyway

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620
it underneath isn't so important anyway
 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.149
it underneath isn't so important anyway
so dark theme really works now when it's

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159
so dark theme really works now when it's
 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.719
so dark theme really works now when it's
paused we save even more it's 60% my

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729
paused we save even more it's 60% my
 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.790
paused we save even more it's 60% my
guess here is that because the kind of

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800
guess here is that because the kind of
 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.890
guess here is that because the kind of
overlay over the video actually darkens

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900
overlay over the video actually darkens
 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.800
overlay over the video actually darkens
the video and was you know we're using

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
the video and was you know we're using
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.180
the video and was you know we're using
even more dark colors so we save more

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190
even more dark colors so we save more
 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.300
even more dark colors so we save more
power now this test itself depends very

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310
power now this test itself depends very
 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.950
power now this test itself depends very
much in the video content if you have a

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960
much in the video content if you have a
 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.510
much in the video content if you have a
video which is fully white and then

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520
video which is fully white and then
 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.070
video which is fully white and then
you're not gonna say too much and Ouija

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080
you're not gonna say too much and Ouija

so tea balls actually a really good

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759
so tea balls actually a really good
 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.490

can control it would you now you can

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
can control it would you now you can
 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.149
can control it would you now you can
switch to a dark theme and you can save

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159
switch to a dark theme and you can save
 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.439
switch to a dark theme and you can save
20% of your battery

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449
20% of your battery
 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.390
20% of your battery
well not 20% over the display you set

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400
well not 20% over the display you set
 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.939
well not 20% over the display you set
the battery just by switching to a dark

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949
the battery just by switching to a dark
 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.100
the battery just by switching to a dark
theme so it's actually quite a big thing

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
theme so it's actually quite a big thing
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.399
theme so it's actually quite a big thing
and finally on maps this is commonly the

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409
and finally on maps this is commonly the
 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.800
and finally on maps this is commonly the
canonical example of dark FEMEN where it

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810
canonical example of dark FEMEN where it
 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.619
canonical example of dark FEMEN where it
really is bright because he has the

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629
really is bright because he has the
 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.600
really is bright because he has the
obvious it's of the battery which is 31%

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610
obvious it's of the battery which is 31%
 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.700
obvious it's of the battery which is 31%
when it's on full brightness but it's

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710
when it's on full brightness but it's
 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.769
when it's on full brightness but it's
also usable like you don't want maps

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779
also usable like you don't want maps
 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.140
also usable like you don't want maps
being like a really white theme when

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150
being like a really white theme when
 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.899
being like a really white theme when
you're driving at night and glaring UI

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:31.909
you're driving at night and glaring UI
 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.159
you're driving at night and glaring UI
so dark theme here really makes the app

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169
so dark theme here really makes the app
 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.079
so dark theme here really makes the app
the app more usable and the nighttime

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089
the app more usable and the nighttime
 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.990
the app more usable and the nighttime
setting and now Alan's gonna talk for

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000

implementation

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230
implementation
 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.980
implementation
all right so how can we embrace the dark

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990
all right so how can we embrace the dark
 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.170
all right so how can we embrace the dark
side and implement dark mode in our apps

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180
 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.080
I'm going to dark theme which will not

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090
I'm going to dark theme which will not
 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.850
I'm going to dark theme which will not

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.550
night or a values - night and if you
 

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.460
night or a values - night and if you
have resources that are difficult to

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:37.470
have resources that are difficult to
 

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.190
have resources that are difficult to
extract theme colors out of say you have

a welcome splash image that is very
 

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.990
a welcome splash image that is very
complicated and you couldn't put it in a

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000
complicated and you couldn't put it in a
 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.940
complicated and you couldn't put it in a
vector drawable so your designer just

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:46.950
vector drawable so your designer just
 

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.850
vector drawable so your designer just
gave you a PNG and you can get a dark

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860
gave you a PNG and you can get a dark
 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.350
gave you a PNG and you can get a dark
version of that that has significantly

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360
version of that that has significantly
 

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.000
version of that that has significantly
different colors and it's too

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.010
different colors and it's too
 

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.530
different colors and it's too
complicated to put in a vector drawable

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540
complicated to put in a vector drawable
 

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.540
complicated to put in a vector drawable

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.550
you can just drop an alternate version
of it in drawable nights when the device

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560

a bunch of avatars those we probably
 

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.829
a bunch of avatars those we probably
want to keep the exact same maybe we

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839

the dark theme color attributes so this

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180
the dark theme color attributes so this
