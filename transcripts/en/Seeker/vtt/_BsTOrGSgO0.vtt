00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.720
There's a new "menace on our streets," and
it's helping people manage their pain, it's

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.890
all over Facebook, and everyone from moms
to addicts love it…

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.890
Kratom.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.580
Film at 11.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.580
What up peeps, this is DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.720
The interesting thing about what is "legal"
or "illegal" is that in order for something

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.610
to be illegal there has to be a law made against
it.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.390
If there's no law forbidding something, then
it is not, technically, illegal!

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.159
A 'new' drug named kratom has grabbed headlines,
as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency decided

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.890
to add the plant to it's list of Schedule
I (one) drugs, effectively banning it as an

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.870
"imminent hazard to public safety," with "no
medicinal use."

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.809
But many would argue against that last part especially.
Let's look at the science.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.250
Firstly, we have to know what this stuff is.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.899
Kratom's science name is 'mitragyna speciosa'
(mit-rah-jyna).

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.449
It's a tree native to Southeast Asia, and
its leaves were traditionally brewed into

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.199
tea for social and religious ceremonies, or
chewed as a stimulant to boost productivity

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.999
and combat fatigue for farm workers.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.850
In fact, in a 2012 study of the northern states
of Malaysia, 88 percent of people reported

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.990
daily use.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
Medicinally, outside of Southeast Asia, it's
used to wean morphine-dependent patients and

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.750
as an opium substitute.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.500
Mitragyna speciosa can be a basic stimulant
in small doses (resembling cocaine or amphetamines),

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.000
but becomes a sedative or narcotic at larger
doses (resembling opiates like morphine).

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.270
At high doses is can cause "sedation, euphoria,
and a possible dreamlike state."

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.479
In addition to chewing or brewing, the leaves
are available as a pill or powder.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.600
There are over 25 substances in the plant's
leaves, but a study in Addiction Biology detailed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.630
the effects of two unique psychoactive components:
mitragynine and 7-hydroxy-mitragynine.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.040
The first, mitragynine -- is a psychoactive
alkaloid: the component that gets into the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.380
brain and works similar to other alkaloids
like morphine, ephedrine, quinine, and nicotine;

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.090
tripping some receptors in the brain known
to respond to opioids.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.369
The second, 7-hydroxy-mitragynine, is "less
abundant" and behaves more as an analgesic

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.430
(or painkiller).

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.590
It was found to have an acute ability to reduce
anxiety (when dosed correctly).

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.599
Unfortunately for some, kratom is also habit
forming; with withdrawal manifesting both

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.700
physically and mentally.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.680
In fact, part of the reason the DEA added
it to Schedule I  was because of a study

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.410
of long-term users, finding most chewed the
leaves for an average of 18-and-a-half years,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.620
causing anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, skin
darkening, dry mouth, frequent urination,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.370
and constipation -- and that's just the USE
of it.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.720
The withdrawal starts 6-12 hours after use
and causes tremors, anxiety, joint and muscle

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.190
aches and limb jerks, mood swings, hostility,
aggression, depression, insomnia, sweating,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.720
nausea, and headaches…The DEA even observed
symptoms of psychosis: delusions, hallucinations

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.209
and confusion.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.610
This is a pretty serious situation, and can
last up to 10 days.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.319
The consumption of the plant itself doesn't
appear to be deadly at "normal" doses, but

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.280
reports have shown overdosing can cause seizures,
coma, and death.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.140
In fact, the DEA cited 15 kratom-related deaths
from 2014 to 2016.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.550
But even if you're not overdosing, studies
have shown use of kratom can lead to permanent

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.180
brain changes, causing cognitive impairment,
and difficulty recalling memories.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.770
The Biomed Research Journal dug deep into
kratom and stated simply, though it's often

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.110
marketed as a "natural" alternative to opiates,
[quote] "kratom is not a safe drug."

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.580
In an interview with Scientific American,
a specialist on the topic said, "Heroin was

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.090
once marketed as a therapeutic product and
later was criminalized," but "[Kratom] is

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.930
just like any other opioid that has abuse
liability."

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.140
All that being said, it may still have medicinal
use, but with Schedule I we may never know;

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.360
because researchers might never try to study
it.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.970
When it comes to substances like this, it's
not whether they're safe or not, or medicinal

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.530
or not, it's how they fall on the spectrum
of legality that determines their availability.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.860
Whether the DEAs call to make it illegal is
"right" can be debated, but the "safe" or

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.680
"natural" claims are pretty silly.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.830
It can be damaging, and opiates come from
plants too, though they're not often called

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.890
"natural."

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.989
It would seem at low doses, mitragyna speciosa
could be okay, but it could also be highly

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.430
habit forming, dangerous and even deadly.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.920
Obviously, more research is needed to see
if this plant offers alternatives for opiates,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.150
but for now, we'll have to wait and see if
science keeps on truckin.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.220
[SPONSOR/AD READ]
When we do scripts like this I always feel

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.550
like I'm ruining people's day… but some
people revel in that.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.380
. If you're one of those people you should
check out Discovery GO and you can watch airplane

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.480
repo.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.400
Watch that and any other discovery show on
the Discovery GO app.

You can download free at your App Store

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.140
If you're worried about which drugs are dangerous
-- like weed or cocaine which is "worse" -- we've

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.070
got the answer for you here.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:05:01.890
How do you feel about kratom?

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:12.480
I assume there are a bunch of people angry
already, I see you Libertarians!
