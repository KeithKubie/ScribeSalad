probably disagree with him on that point
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.410
probably disagree with him on that point
but that's not what game theory tells

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
but that's not what game theory tells
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240

don't reach this outcome by this amount
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.240
don't reach this outcome by this amount
of time there's going to be a problem as

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250

happens if they fail and then you have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
happens if they fail and then you have
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.180
happens if they fail and then you have
sort of the failed state and can they

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
sort of the failed state and can they
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.819
sort of the failed state and can they
actually get to any outcome by 18 months

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829

or whatever time frame is provided but

what we tend to do is literally do each

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549
what we tend to do is literally do each
 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.640
what we tend to do is literally do each
step at the time what looks best and and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
step at the time what looks best and and
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.830
step at the time what looks best and and
the best example of this was really the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
the best example of this was really the
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920
the best example of this was really the
failed policy of our defense secretary

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
failed policy of our defense secretary
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.920

I'm not succeeding what would I want to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
I'm not succeeding what would I want to
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.030
I'm not succeeding what would I want to
do and play out each of those steps and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
do and play out each of those steps and
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.699
do and play out each of those steps and
counter steps and then work backwards to

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709
counter steps and then work backwards to
 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.740
counter steps and then work backwards to
the present and so we need to do the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
the present and so we need to do the
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.410
the present and so we need to do the
exact same thing now what do we do if we

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
exact same thing now what do we do if we
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.569
exact same thing now what do we do if we
leave and it does blow up does that mean

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579
leave and it does blow up does that mean
 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.509
leave and it does blow up does that mean
that we're how do we then come back what

that we're how do we then come back what

course the the basics of strategy but
 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.110

unfortunately it hasn't always been done

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.819
 
I'd like to literally see thee how they

imagine playing out both scenarios and
 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.009
imagine playing out both scenarios and
if you're the end point and if there is

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019
if you're the end point and if there is
 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.929
if you're the end point and if there is
no end point okay we know what this is

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939
no end point okay we know what this is
 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.629
no end point okay we know what this is
today but i don't think that actually is

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639
today but i don't think that actually is
 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.050
today but i don't think that actually is
sustainable and so you know i think it

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
sustainable and so you know i think it
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.599
sustainable and so you know i think it

that which is a sustainable won't keep

answer and that to me so one side has

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
answer and that to me so one side has
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.569
answer and that to me so one side has
given a perspective which may not work

given a perspective which may not work
 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.119
given a perspective which may not work
but at least it's a chain of strategy
