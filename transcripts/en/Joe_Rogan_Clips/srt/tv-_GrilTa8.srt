1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,960
Coming from a place of being a serial
entrepreneur to this presidential

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:09,370
candidate is kind of warning people about
the upcoming technological apocalypse

3
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:12,740
as it were. Um, how did you
make that transition and what,

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,130
what was your motivation
to get involved in this?

5
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,650
To the point where we're actually
running for president on this platform?

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,030
Yeah. So, uh, so sell a company in 2009,

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,770
and that was the financial crisis.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,220
Like Wall Street had crashed the economy
and I had personally taught these kids

9
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,720
who'd worked at Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley and Mckinsey. And I was like,

10
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,840
man, we need smart kids to do something
other than just head to Wall Street and

11
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:40,480
Silicon Valley. We need to have them
go to Detroit, St Louis, Baltimore,

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,430
new and start businesses. So
I quit my job. I donated, um,

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,090
low six figures to start
this new organization.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,660
And then we trained hundreds
of entrepreneurs and helped
create several thousand

15
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:54,560
jobs. So that was like my wholesome give
back. I was like, Hey, I'm like the,

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,370
you know, the guy who just believes in
entrepreneurship because just like you,

17
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:02,000
I freaking love entrepreneurs. And I was
like, so here's the joke. I used to tell,

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,670
I went to law school, I was an
unhappy lawyer for five months. Uh,

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,960
and so what I tell people is
like if you're a clueless,

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,000
ambitious 22 year old who came out of
college and you say to your parents, Hey,

21
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,270
I'm going to go to law school,
they're going to say, that's great.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,660
It's really easy to find the law school.
Cause they're just,

23
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:24,320
they're just apply to it and the
government will give you $100,000 loan,

24
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:27,350
no questions asked. And then if
you say to your parents, Hey,

25
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:30,290
I want to be an entrepreneur,
your pants will think that's stupid.

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,440
It's hard to fly in and no one's
gonna give you $100,000 loan.

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,300
So we have this huge oversupply
of indebted law school graduates.

28
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:42,200
And the huge under supply of entrepreneurs
was my thinking. And so I was like,

29
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,990
okay, how do we fix that? So
I started this organization,

30
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,380
venture for America to try and fix that.
And so imagine being this guy,

31
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:51,230
getting medals and awards for helping
create jobs around the country.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,610
And then realizing that automation's
coming like a tidal wave and that your

33
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,810
efforts that you're getting applauded
for are really not going to do the trick.

34
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,490
And then Donald Trump wins the election
in 2016 and for whatever reason,

35
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,940
in my opinion, the media is just not being
honest about all the economic drivers.

36
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,470
They're blaming racism, Russia, Facebook,

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,550
the FBI.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,330
And if you look at the voter district
data on a district by district basis,

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,800
there's a straight line up between the
adoption of industrial robots in that

40
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:25,250
voting district and the
movement towards Trump. Mm.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,720
Like it's a straight economic story
where we blasted away 4 million

42
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:34,280
manufacturing jobs in the swing states
and Donald Trump is our president.

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,770
So imagine being me and in seeing
that and being like, okay, I get it.

44
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,110
This is an economic,
technological story.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,740
And then I went to people in
Washington DC. I was like, hey guys,

46
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,400
what are we going to do?

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
We're in the third inning of the
greatest economic and technological

48
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,920
transformation in the
history of our country.

49
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,640
And the third inning has brought
us Donald Trump. The fourth, fifth,

50
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,380
sixth things are going to be horrific.
What are we going to do?

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,940
And then the answers I got were somewhere
between disciplining and horrifying,

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,550
where if you go to mainstream
politicians and you're like,

53
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,120
what are we going to do? The answers
I got were literally number one,

54
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,230
we cannot talk about that.
Number two, we should study that.

55
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,680
We cannot talk about that was,
that's verbatim really. Yeah.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,300
And why were they saying that?

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Because it seems alarmists like
anti progress or like, you know,

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,300
you're like, uh, you know,
throwing stones at like,

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,510
like big tech companies and it's like,
I'm not throwing stones at anyone.

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,770
I'm just pointing out the
fact. So number one is, uh,

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,660
so number one was can't talk about it.
Number two was need to study it.

62
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,540
And the number three was the
point you made a originally,

63
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,540
which was we must educate and retrain
Americans for the jobs of the future.

64
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,680
And then when I was like, Hey, we're
terrible at that by the numbers,

65
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,040
then they'd literally be like,
well, I guess we'll learn
to get better at it then.

66
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,640
And then I, so I came back to, to my
home in New York City and I was like,

67
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,350
oh my gosh,
like we are so backward and far gone as a,

68
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,570
as it certainly as a government.
Um,

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,540
and so then I was grappling with
it and I'm a parent like you are.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,280
And I looked at my kids and I was like,

71
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,640
am I really going to bring them up in
this shit show? Like, is this really,

72
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,910
is this really the plan? And
so then I was like, okay,

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,110
how would you actually solve this
problem if you, if you had to do so?

74
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,350
And so then I said, okay,
universal basic income,

75
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,320
rebranded the freedom dividend after we
did a bunch of tests because it tests

76
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,370
much better, um, as the freedom
dividend and universal basic income and,

77
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,060
and then, uh, try and make the,

78
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,000
the rules of the economy worked better
for more people as fast as we can before

79
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,920
this automation wave really crescendos.
What do you mean by that? Well to me,

80
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,160
like,

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,390
you know what I'm saying is like retail
and truck driving are the two major,

82
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,690
major, obvious sectors that
are going to get displaced.

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,680
Being a retail worker is the most common
job in the United States right now.

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
The average retail workers,

85
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,470
a 39 year old woman with a high school
education making between 11 and $12 an

86
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,130
hour.

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,970
So what do those workers do in 30% of
the malls and stores close in the next

88
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,660
five years? You know, and then
truckers are next in line, you know,

89
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,670
by the five to 10 year mark.
So I was like,

90
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:11,671
we have to get our acts together
before these populations end up getting

91
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,030
displaced. And we know Americans don't
have a ton of savings to fall back on.

92
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,680
It's not like they'll be
like, oh, like, you know,

93
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:20,470
let me take a month off to like
think about like, that's not,

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,940
that's not the real life
situation. Most Americans, uh,

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,100
live and experience.
So,

96
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,690
so this is all 2017 where I'm like doing
the data research and saying like, okay,

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,670
like what's the plan? And then when I
went to various politicians, I was like,

98
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,650
there is no appetite for making this case.

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,380
There's no appetite for anyone
even talking about this.

100
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,710
So the only thing I can see that would
have a realistic chance of accelerating

101
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,580
meaningful solutions to this automation
wave in a five to 10 year timeframe is

102
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:56,470
if I run for president and I either
win, which is very doable, I can win,

103
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,280
um,

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,110
or I mainstream this set of considerations
to a point where other politicians

105
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,830
are willing to tackle something like
universal basic income and make it a

106
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,480
reality in that timeframe.
