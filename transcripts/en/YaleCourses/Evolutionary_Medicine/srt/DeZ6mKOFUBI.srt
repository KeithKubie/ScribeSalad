1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,440
I would now like to expand on this idea
that a patient is a point on a reaction

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,621
norm by taking apart the
concept of reaction norms
and showing you a bit of what

3
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,480
difference they make to our analysis.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,510
To begin with.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Evolution involves a regular alternation
between genotypes that contained

6
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,180
information and phenotypes
that consists of matter.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,290
This is an important distinction
between information and matter because

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,780
different sorts of things
go on in each of them.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,770
A motto from Livan Valence is that
evolution is the control of development by

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:45,780
ecology. And I think is, I stepped through
this. You'll see what van Valan meant.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,040
This picture of which was originally
sketched by Dick Lewington shows a regular

12
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:56,010
alternation between genotype
space and phenotype space.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,720
So you should think of this as being,
uh,

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,610
the universe in which DNA sequences exist.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,440
And this is being the universe in
which organisms exist down here.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
Naturally,

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,940
they are connected to each other and
they contain each other in some ways.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,380
The first transformation here from g one
to p one from genotype to phenotype is

19
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,490
development. That's transformation
one. And it's at this point,

20
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,780
the genes interact with environments to
map the information in genotypes into

21
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,250
the material in phenotypes.
That's where reaction norms come in.

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,810
T two is ecology and behavior.

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,800
That's what determines who
survives and reproduces.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,090
T three is mating reproduction and some
of genetics that determines the array of

25
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:48,750
gametes.

26
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,750
It's going to form the next generation
and then t four is genetics and

27
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:55,494
reproduction.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,560
That determines how the array of haploid
gametes is transcribed into a set of

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,550
deployed zygotes.
This is going on in every generation.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,200
So evolution is operating both in genotype
space and in phenotype space and a

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,550
selection is acting on phenotypes.

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,380
Development is determining
the expression of phenotypes.

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,060
Development is intimately built in to
the apparatus of micro evolution at this

34
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,774
stage.

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Now the result of that kind of
developmental transformation
as a reaction norm.

36
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,830
So here is one possible reaction norm.

37
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,970
Here you see temperature and
environmental variable on the x axis.

38
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,130
The value of a trait,

39
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,870
size of maturity on the y axis
and align relating the two things.

40
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,350
So you can say that a
reaction norm expresses the
phenotype is a function of the

41
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,830
environment.
Here you see a depiction of a population.

42
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,290
It consists of a bundle of reaction norms.

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,460
Each one of these reaction norms
belongs to a particular genotype,

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,290
and the population consists of a set of
genetically heterogeneous individuals,

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
each one of which had the potential to
produce this value of the trait depending

46
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,420
on the temperature at which it was raised,

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,730
and we can calculate a mean reaction
norm for the whole population.

48
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,653
However,

49
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,250
the concept of reaction norm originally
is bound to the concept of genotype.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,050
A genotype has a reaction or

51
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,510
now traits can have markedly
different kinds of of expression.

52
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,210
And one of the earlier lectures we pointed
out that treats have very different

53
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:51,070
evolutionary ages. They also have very
different phenotypic plasticity. These,

54
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,540
some of them are very insensitive to
environmental change. So for example,

55
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,840
in organisms like us,
the number of digits,

56
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,120
number of fingers or toes
is very insensitive to the
kind of nutrition we have.

57
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,310
We all always end up with five here.

58
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,730
The genotypes of just been
separated by different colors.

59
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,420
Just to show you the different genotypes
are always producing five fingers or

60
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,480
toes no matter what nutritional
environment they're in.

61
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,800
Other traits, for example,
if he come to thee,

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,380
are sensitive to changes
in the environment,

63
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,820
so g one in this case is quite
sensitive to changes in nutrition.

64
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,290
When it's well fed, it has many
offspring. When it's poorly fed,

65
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,680
it has few g three is less sensitive,

66
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,170
it has a flat or reaction or so.

67
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,450
That also gets across another concept and
that is that the slope of the reaction

68
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:47,451
or is a measure of the sensitivity of
that trait to changes in the environment.

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,770
Okay.

70
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,890
Because of this differential sensitivity,

71
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,960
genetic correlations can actually change
sign depending on the environment and

72
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:03,961
when there's a change in the sign of
genetic correlation or covariance across

73
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,834
environments,

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,030
then a developmental mechanism is strongly
modulating the expression of genetic

75
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,470
variance and covariance.

76
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,670
That means that the response to selection
is dependent not only on the standing

77
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,600
genetic variance and covariance,

78
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:23,210
but it's also dependent upon the
way in which it is expressed in.

79
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,520
That can change with environment.

80
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,740
Yeah.

81
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,740
No genetic correlations can
produce indirect selection.

82
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:35,210
That has surprising effects
in some environment selection
for an increase in one

83
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:40,211
trait might cause a correlated increase
in another tree and other environments.

84
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,530
Selection for an increase in one trait
may cause a correlated decrease in the

85
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:50,531
other trade environment's intermediate
to those described selection on one trait

86
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,950
won't be correlated with any
response in the other at all. So

87
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,570
reaction are important modulators of
selection responses and that becomes

88
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,840
especially important when we're trying
to evaluate the effects of tradeoffs.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,710
Okay.

90
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,760
Here for example,

91
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,590
is a detailed experiment that was done
under Sophala marketure him by Martin gay

92
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:19,150
part.
He studied AGD closing and waited,

93
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:23,230
he closure and he raised basically

94
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,880
sets of families derived from two females.

95
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Now the nice thing about these females
of soflar Mercato forum is that if you

96
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:36,050
don't give them males to mate with,

97
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:39,860
they will still produce viable
offspring and they will do it asexually.

98
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,700
So each of the small envelopes down
here consists of a group of identical

99
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,120
siblings from one mother and
this is from the other mothers.

100
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:53,210
So you have six groups of identical
siblings from one mother in six groups of

101
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:57,590
identical siblings from another mother
raised out across different yeast

102
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:01,610
concentrations, which allows for a
precise measurement of reaction norms.

103
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,253
Okay.

104
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,760
Martin observed a positive
genetic correlation when
the flies were well fed and

105
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,720
growing rapidly.

106
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,640
That's this 1.5% yeast concentration here.

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,150
And you can see that the slope of
this line is steep and positive and he

108
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:25,401
observed a negative genetic correlation
when they were poorly fed and growing

109
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:29,460
slowly.
And the slope of this line is negative.

110
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:34,461
So this is a shift in genetic correlation
between two traits driven by variation

111
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,540
in the nutritional environment.

112
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,700
Yeah.

113
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,700
And that is an experimental confirmation
of the idea that reaction norms are

114
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:47,970
modulating the expression of genetic,
not only of genetic variation,

115
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,430
but if genetic covariation
in the phenotype.

116
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,420
Okay.

117
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,280
Now what are the consequences of
plasticity for genetic definitions of

118
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,690
tradeoffs?
Well,

119
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,490
genetic correlations among traits can
change from population to population

120
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,620
within populations over time as gene
frequencies change during the course of

121
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,470
development and from
environment to environment.

122
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,050
The responses to selection that are
then important for life history.

123
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,370
And can also change and all the same ways.

124
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,950
Yeah.

125
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,950
This is not just about fruit flies
living on yeast in test tubes in the

126
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:25,914
laboratory.

127
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,080
This is also about things like the
demographic transition in the industrial

128
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:31,914
revolution,

129
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,920
which has changed the whole landscape
of selection operating on contemporary

130
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:38,430
human beings.

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,080
There are important consequences of
plasticity for the human response to

132
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:46,680
selection to these recent important
changes in our environments.

133
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,630
Yeah,

134
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,350
I love this picture because it is such
a dramatic and easily understandable

135
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:56,520
depiction of what a difference human,
uh, developmental makes the human.

136
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,360
So auto and evolved spits are identical
twins. They have the same genomes.

137
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,180
At the age of 18,

138
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,540
auto began to run distance and Aviall
began to lift weights and four years later

139
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,770
at the age of 22,
this is what they look like.

140
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,250
This is how large a difference can result
in the human phenotype due to simple

141
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,440
differences in lifestyle,
culture,

142
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:24,060
and environment that have
nothing to do with genotype. Now,

143
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,270
what is the medical significance
of phenotypic plasticity?

144
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,980
One of the areas in which
that significance is
particularly striking is the

145
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,720
developmental origins
of health and disease.

146
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,630
This has been a rapidly growing area,

147
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,720
which now has its own acronym Dohad that
indicates that things that happen early

148
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:48,900
in life have important
consequences later in life.

149
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,420
Thin infants are at increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, diabetes,

150
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,340
and obesity in late life.

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,400
We have learned that exposure
to starvation conditions
either in utero or very

152
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,750
early after birth,

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,430
will increase risk of these
diseases 50 or 60 years later.

154
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,340
Infants that are born by c section or
at increased risk of [inaudible] and

155
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,174
obesity.

156
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,550
Children who have antibiotic treatments
before age two are at greater risk of

157
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:24,270
obesity and allergies.
These are effects mediated by Microbiota.

158
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,840
So these are all reaction norms.

159
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,100
These are responses of genotypes
to variation in the environment.

160
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,190
Phenotypic plasticity
can be of several types.

161
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,870
It can be reversible so of body
weight and muscle mass are reversible.

162
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,780
Auto and evolved spits probably could
have reversed the way they appear by

163
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,790
switching, uh, regimes.

164
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
It can be irreversible.

165
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,960
Body height does not change after
maturation and humans very much.

166
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,410
It can be confined to specific
developmental stages. So, for example,

167
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:09,300
the whole Dohad paradigm tells us that
things that happen early in life in

168
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,760
particular, probably in, uh,

169
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,300
in utero and in childhood are critical
and can have knock on consequences

170
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,294
throughout life.

171
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,650
Some of them can be produced at any stage.

172
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:26,400
So tanning and acclimation to altitude
can be produced at any stage of

173
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,920
development.
Some of them are continuous,

174
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:33,150
like agent maturation and others
are discontinuous. So for example,

175
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,010
you can have morphs in water fleas,

176
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:39,360
cast in insects where
they're morphologically quite
distinct things that are

177
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,920
being produced by the same genotype.
And in summary,

178
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,560
the expression and development of many
traits are sensitive to the environment.

179
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,880
The concept of a reaction norm is useful
analyzing how genes and environments

180
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,100
interact to produce phenotypes.

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,020
Reaction norms are properties
of genotypes, and then humans,

182
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,740
they are most clearly visualized as
the differences that develop between

183
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,760
identical twins,

184
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,320
reared in different environments or
undergoing different exercise regimes.

185
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,210
Many medical conditions in adults are
sensitive to environments and countered

186
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,700
early in life.
That's the doe had paradigm.
