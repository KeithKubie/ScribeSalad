00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.810
 

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.630
A helium-filled
blimp stays aloft

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.020
since helium is less
dense than regular air.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.810
So helium will rise
above regular air.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.050
That was a strangely-phrased
first sentence,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.500
but they're just saying helium
is less dense, so helium

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.350
will rise relative
to regular air.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.280
The density of helium
is about 1.1 kilograms

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.860
per meter cubed less
than regular air.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.950
Which means a cubic
meter of helium

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.640
can lift about 1.1 kilograms.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.630
Because the density of helium--
so for a cubic meter of helium,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.990
so if this is a cubic
meter of helium,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.310
and here is a cubic
meter of regular air,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.170
they're saying that the mass
of this cubic meter of helium

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.630
is going to be
1.1 kilograms less

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.830
than the mass of this
cubic meter of regular air.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.570
And that's what allows it,
because of the buoyancy, that's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320
what allows a cubic
meter of helium

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.580
to be able to lift
about 1.1 kilograms.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.350
A blimp with a mass of 2.11
times 10 to the fifth kilograms

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.780
can carry as much as 2 times
10 to the fifth cubic meters

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.250
of helium.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.870
If the average mass of
a person with luggage

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.510
is 10 to the second
kilograms, what

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.226
is the number of passengers
the blimp can carry?

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:36.850
So I encourage you
to pause this video,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.900
and I'll give you a
little structure for this.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.400
Think about how
much mass 2 times 10

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.280
to the fifth cubic meters
of helium can carry.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.160
And then just realize it
has to carry the blimp,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.910
and then, what's
left over, is what

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.540
we can use to carry people.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.656
So the first step
is to say, look,

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:04.170
we have 2 times 10 to the
fifth cubic meters of helium.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.070
And helium, a cubic meter of
helium, can lift 1.1 kilograms.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.370
So we could say that we can lift
1.1 kilograms per cubic meter.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.000
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.550
So what is this
going to give us?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.280
Well our units cancel nicely.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.740
This gives us the mass of
kilograms that we can lift.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.640
Meters cubed canceling
with meters cubed.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640
You'd have a meter cubed
in the numerator, meter

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.810
cubed in the denominator.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.430
Our dimensional analysis
allows our units

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.940
to cancel just like
numbers would in fractions.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.550
And so we're left with 2 times
10 to the fifth times 1.1.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.400
Well 2 times 1.1 is 2.2.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.400
So this is going to give us 2.2
times 10 to the fifth kilograms

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.150
is how much we can lift.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.550
So this is how much we can lift.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.990
Once again, and this is probably
the most important step,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.240
this is our mass of helium
in terms of cubic meters,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.300
and this is how many kilograms
we can lift per cubic meter.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.680
So you multiply
those two, we get

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.930
in kilograms how much
mass we can lift.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.060
So now let's subtract out the
things that we need to lift.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.500
We need to subtract out the
mass of the actual blimp,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.600
the actual structure that
is holding the helium.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.840
So let's subtract that.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.790
So let's subtract 2.11 times
10 to the fifth kilograms.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.610
And so after lifting the blimp,
what do we have left over?

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.820
Well let's see.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.542
2.2-- maybe I should, well let
me make it-- 2.2 minus 2.11.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:46.250
We might be able to
do that in our heads.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.880
That's the same thing
as 2.20 minus 2.11.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.630
20 minus 11 is 9.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.220
So we could think
of it that way.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.930
It's 0.09.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.340
Or if you want, you could
say well, 0 minus 1,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.830
well, let's do a little
bit of regrouping here.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.520
10 minus 1 is 9, 1 minus
1 is 0, 2 minus 2 is 0.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:13.380
So this gives us 0.09
kilograms of lifting capacity

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.304
after we've netted out
the mass of the blimp.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:19.470
Actually, let me be careful.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.920
0.09 times 10 to
the fifth kilograms

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.540
that we can lift after netting
out the mass of the blimp.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.490
This is what we can use to lift
the people and their luggage

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.280
with.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.670
So they tell us that
the people and luggage--

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.560
that each person plus
that person's luggage--

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.310
is 10 to the second kilograms.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.280
So let's divide this
by 10 to the second.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.810
 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.300
And I guess we could say
kilograms per person.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.150
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.290
And then what do we end up with?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.380
Well this is going
to be equal to 10

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.700
to the fifth divided
by 10 squared is

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.190
going to be 10 to the third.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.750
So this is going to
simplify to 10 to the third.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.610
So we get 0.09 times
10 to the third.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.080
And then kilograms divided
by kilograms per person.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.080
If we just think about
the dimensional analysis,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.060
this is the same
thing as kilograms

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:24.420
times the reciprocal of this, of
people, or person per kilogram.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.400
Kilogram gets canceled
out, and you're just

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.450
left with people, or persons.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.080
So this is how many people,
and when we say people,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.910
we're saying the people
plus their luggage.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.340
So what is 0.09 times
10 to the third?

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.240
Well that's 0.09 times 1,000.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.490
So let's multiply it.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.630
If we start with 0.09 and
we multiply it by 10 once,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.280
we get to 0.9.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.510
Multiply it by 10
again, we get to 9.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.770
Multiply it by 10
again, we get to 90.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.550
So this right over here is
the same thing as 90 people.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.370
So we could lift,
the maximum load

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.867
for this blimp is 90
people and their luggage.

00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:04.367
