00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.435
My opponent tonight is
the Wu-Tang Clan's

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.137
Lamont "U-God" Hawkins.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.938
His new book is called Raw,

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.242
and that's exactly how I'll
conduct this interview-- raw.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.911
I'm gonna give it to him
with no trivia,

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.913
raw like cocaine
straight from Bolivia.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.549
Lamont "U-God" Hawkins,
everybody.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.584
-Lamont, Welcome.
-Thank you, brother. Thank you.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.586
(applause and cheering)

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.258
All right, U-God, golden arms?
The four-bar killer?

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.326
-Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
-You have many nicknames?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.996
-Many nicknames. -Did you ever
want to be the five-bar killer?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.998
Why are you the four-bar killer?

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.699
I don't know.
They gave that name to me.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.134
They just branded me
with the name.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.537
'Cause you get, like... You get
four bars in a song, you know?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.639
It's a count...
it's a character count thing.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.474
25 years ago,
 Enter the 36 Chambers came out.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:42.809
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.645
When you look back on that,
what-what jumps out?

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.647
Uh, what jumps out?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.715
The travel, the amount of work
we put in, you know,

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.651
just meeting a lot
of new people

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.453
-and different people
than we come from. -Mm-hmm.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.354
You know, just...
just being universal.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.623
Going from small to being
universal-minded, that's all.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:59.759
-Yeah. -Yeah. Like,
looking back on that,

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.661
uh, is it... is it all sunny?

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.729
Do you see it in all
a positive light, or is it...?

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.898
Yes, yes, I do, 'cause I could
have dead in the streets.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.934
-You know. -Yeah. Well, you talk
a little bit about that with...

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.936
-in your new book here.
-Yes.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.737
That your journey to...
Like, what do you see?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.339
If you didn't find
the Wu-Tang Clan,

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.007
where did you see
your life headed?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.711
Uh... I probably would have been
a statistic maybe, you know.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:21.080
-Mm-hmm. -Like, you know,
like so many of my people,

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:22.715
-probably would have been
in jail. -Mm-hmm.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.617
-Just trying to figure things
out and all that. -Yeah.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.085
And then, then somehow I know
that I'd probably

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.488
get tired of jail and got me
a regular job or found...

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.089
I would have found a way.
Some way, I'd have found a way.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.325
You said that
even before finding rap,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.627
you were trying out a bunch
of different professions,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.796
and you even studied
becoming an embalmer?

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.799
-Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Really? And you're

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.335
a high schooler thinking
about becoming an embalmer.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.138
Well, it wasn't... in
high school, it was in college.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.406
-Uh-huh. -'Cause, um,
I was real good in science.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.308
That was...
that was always my thing.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.245 line:0%
I mean, so... I was doing
business management at BMCC.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.814 line:0%
That got boring, so I was like,
you know, let me transfer over

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.849 line:0%
to LaGuardia to do... try...

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.417 line:0%
you know,
try something different.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.620
That's a job that's
always gonna be around.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.122
-That's a smart thought.
-Yes. -(laughter)

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:07.093
-You're touring right now
with the Wu-Tang Clan. -Yes.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.495
What's it like getting
back together with everybody?

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.631
Well, it's...
it's like clockwork, you know.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.232
I've been with
my brothers, literally,

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.667
I've been with my brothers

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.702
-since I was, like,
five, six years old. -Mm-hmm.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.572
So, I don't know how many people
can say they're still around

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:21.174
the people they
literally grew up with.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.009
You know what I mean?
So it's just like...

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.710
you know, getting
back together with your family.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.679
You say you've gone through
a lot of different phases

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:27.947
with the Wu-Tang Clan.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.949
Uh, you've said at times
it felt like a group,

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.018
but at times it started to feel
like a dictatorship.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.286
Which is something I'm sure

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.488
Americans don't understand
whatsoever.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.822
(laughter)

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.291
How was that experience?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.293 line:0%
Well, you know, you grow

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.528 line:0%
and you learn and you live,

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.731 line:0%
and, you know, the people
that are in charge, you know,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.301 line:0%
they grow, too, also,
and, you know, hopefully,

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.536 line:0%
through trial and tribulation,
you know, it softens the heart

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.972 line:0%
a little bit, you know,
and that's basically what it is.

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.174
-You know...
-Now, you're performing...

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.710
you're bringing
 36 Chambers back out.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:00.947
-It's a different time,
25 years later. -Yes. Yes.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.716
You're playing giant festivals,
tens of thousands of people,

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.819
they're singing along to songs
you guys wrote 25 years ago

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:10.823
about life on the streets,
your own personal experiences,

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.593
and you're having young kids
chant them in stadiums.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.994
-Yes, yes.
-Is that how you...

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.896
did you ever envision it
that way?

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.198
Is that how the Wu-Tang
is meant to be experienced?

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.567
Know what, we get asked
that question all the time.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.736
Well, sorry, they're not
all original. I'm sorry.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.204
(laughter)

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.840
-Come on, Golden Arms, come on,
give me... -I'm just saying

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.543
-we get asked that question all
the time. -give me a few bars.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.978
Give me four bars leeway here.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.946
Nah, we didn't know
it was gonna be like this,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.715
but we just put
a lot of work in.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.483
You don't realize
how much work you put in...

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:40.052
into a project or into a...
you put your life's work...

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.588
you know, just travel,
you just travel and do shows

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.957
and do shows, and then...
and somewhere along the line,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.593
it just clicks, you know,
it just, that's what happened,

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.729
you know,
and America just embraced us.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.897
Do you think the youth,
do they understand the Wu-Tang?

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.133
Oh, I think they go to us
to get the foundation

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.636
of what they want to rhyme with,
you know what I mean?

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.105
I really think we're, like,
the core of hip-hop.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.240
-Yeah. The core.
-Yeah. The hard core.

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:02.808
-The hard core.
-That's right.

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.377
-Give it to you raw.
-That's right.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.379
(cheering, applause)

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.748
What I found interesting
about your book,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.751
uh, you talk about, uh,
you showed some vulnerability

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.819
-in this book.
-Not that vulnerable.

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.187
Not a ton, no, no. But a...

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.256
I'll give you a smidge,
I'll give you a smidge.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.791
But there's a little bit
of vulnerability,

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:21.560
talking about, like, performing
and finding your voice,

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.397
uh, and coming in rusty--
it's showing vulnerability.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.399
I thought that was a weakness
for a rapper.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.734 line:0%
Well... they won't say
certain things,

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:30.403 line:0%
and, um, as you grow older,
you know,

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.205 line:0%
you find out those things is
really not that big of a deal.

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:35.308 line:0%
You know. Before, I ain't
never smiled in pictures.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.909 line:0%
I'd be like this.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.378 line:0%
(laughter)

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.282
All the time. Every picture
would be like this.

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.085
That's it.
But now I'm like this.

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.353
(laughter)

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:50.990
(whooping, applause)

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.793
You know? So... you grow.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.461
So, you know, you grow.

00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:57.496
-That's the evolution.
-That's the evolution.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.398
(laughter)

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.001
U-God, tell me
something I already know.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.405
"Wu-Tang" stands
for Witty Unpredictable...

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.407
BOTH:
Talent And Natural Game.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.009
-That's right, so...
-Yeah, I already knew that.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.143
That's right, that's right.

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:12.945
Lamont U-God Hawkins, everybody.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.881
-Give me a "W," give me a "W."
-Oh, the "W." Right there.

00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:18.451
Everybody.
His book, Raw, is out now,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.453
along with his new album, Venom.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.021
Lamont U-God Hawkins.

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.356
The fight continues.
