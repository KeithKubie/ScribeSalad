1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.110
See this.
I'm pouring my coffee into a Joe Rogan experience mug.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
I got the idea.
I stole it from Greg Fitzsimmons cause I have two,

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.970
not one but two Greg Fitz show the fits dog radio show cups at my house.

4
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.230
I'd gladly,
happily gloriously pour my coffee into these.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.950
What's going on with the volume of these things?
Is it changed?
Is it,
yeah,

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.250
I think we're all definitely,
yeah,
maybe that's what it is.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
We shot a lot of guns yesterday due to due to this episode of the Joe Rogan

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
experience podcast is brought to you by ting.
What Ting is,

9
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
is a mobile service company that cuts out all the bullshit that you usually have

10
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.710
to deal with when you get cell phone service.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.860
They have excellent coverage because they use sprints.
Backbone,
it sounds,

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.960
it's a weird word.
They need a better word than backbone.
Anyway,

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.550
they use the sprint network,
let's say that and so you get sprint coverage,

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.860
but you get to do it on tings terms,

15
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.670
which is far more ethical than you're going to get from any other cell phone per

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.960
weekend leave.
Yeah.
You can leave anytime you want to contract.
No contracts,

17
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.980
no early termination fees.
There's no,
you just,
you just leave,

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.730
you know and you just leave.
You don't,
you own the phone too.
He bought,

19
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.660
when you buy a phone from another provider,
like one of the big name ones,

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200
most of the time you're not really buying the phone.
You're sort of leasing it.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.630
Like if it says the phones to 99 with a contract,

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.640
what that means is it's two 99 but it's really 600 bucks.
So the,

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.820
the other 300 bucks you still owe.
So when you go to leave,
depending on,

24
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:39.090
say if you have a contract for three years and you only stay for a year,

25
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.130
you still owe two years of paying off that phone and that's what they hit you

26
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.670
with.
It's stupid.
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's dumb.

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.620
Accessible feature phone that your grandma has been asking for.
The Samsung.

28
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.840
Is it a flip phone?
Flip phone.
That's where Dave Gray.

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.210
Wow.
They still have flip phones.
Yeah.
Tell has one of those.

30
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.000
He knows the flip phone.
Dana white uses a flip phone.
He left.
Well,

31
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.440
he's really good with his thumb.

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.820
Like he could talk to you like and he'll text message people under the table

33
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
while he's like multitasking without anybody knowing about it because of the

34
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:17.700
buttons,
the actual buttons of the cell phone is what he likes.
So like I've,

35
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.630
I've had conversations with him under the table while he's in the middle of

36
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:26.070
talking about other shit.
He'll just be able to text you.
That's great.
Yeah.

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.840
It's because the,
you understand the thumb thing?

38
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.220
I don't think that's going on with David Tell.

39
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.640
I think he's just a fucking smash out though,
man.
As a feature phone.

40
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.370
It's battery life has counted in days,
not hours.

41
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.240
It almost makes me want to really see if I can just like take an iPad around and

42
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:42.330
use the money.
These little baby phones.
Well you certainly could do that.

43
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.040
You certainly could use a little flip phone and then do all your texting and

44
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:51.060
everything else on an iPhone.
Right?
Or Samsung it as your second phone.

45
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.080
Yeah,
because there's just,
my phone is not just my phone anymore.
It's,

46
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.800
there's too much connected calendars.
And let me check my email.

47
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.100
Let me see what this is

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 1>all,
let me put this on Instagram.
Holy Shit.</v>

49
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.840
I gotta get a picture of this to have that more than one device.

50
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.140
But then again the best way to answer a phone,

51
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.820
it's star trek style really is open and the one you had done with someone,

52
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.170
you snap that bitch shut that.
Listen,
I'm not interested.
Thank you very much.

53
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.830
Shut that bitch.
Boom.
Because you can't slam an iPhone.

54
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.370
You can slam a flip phone cause slam that shit.
You feel good about yourself.

55
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.520
You can get one for 52 bucks,
the Sanyo 38,
10 red.

56
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.170
I would like to do a side by side comparison of phone sound quality and uh,

57
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
your uh,
your ability to get a signal to yeah,
that'd be interesting.

58
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.060
Anyway,
they,
they,
they offer you a bunch of different options.

59
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.200
If you don't want one of those,

60
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.640
you can bring over an iPhone from sprint and you can also get some of these

61
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.640
really intensely cool android phones,

62
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:52.480
including the Lgg flax and see this thing,
it fucking curves.
Like your face.

63
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.870
They were just,
um,
demonstrating on television.

64
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.860
These new screens that are going to be completely flexible,

65
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.240
they're going to be able to curl.

66
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.960
So you're going to be able to have a phone that's a tube,
like a scroll,

67
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.710
and you're going to be able to pull that scroll open and you know,

68
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:10.600
I mean it could be a fucking foot long,

69
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:14.890
but then it rolls down to the size of a chapstick.
It's an amazing breakthrough.

70
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.690
What's the update on the malaria vaccine?
I know you're calling with something.

71
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.300
Look,
they're working at the two.
There's just not as much money.
People,

72
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.960
malaria tend to drain their backgrounds quite quickly.

73
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.880
You never get a call from a guy,
I got malaria,
I need hell.
It's like,
well,

74
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:34.480
no wonder we're not carrying this.
Got You.
Drop us a line.
Me,
mom,

75
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.480
malaria kills more people than uh,
well they had,

76
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.370
this does graph where they showed how many people were killed by mosquitoes and

77
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:46.120
how many people have been killed by war.
Mosquitoes is more than war.
Right.

78
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.480
Which is hard to wrap your fucking head.
I think it's more than family.
Yeah.

79
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.600
Pull it up.
Brian's.
See if you could find that thing.
It's the number one killer.

80
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.880
Yeah.
Malaria.
There's a chart,
a chart that shows how many,
uh,

81
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.950
what,
what kills humans most like it goes from,
um,

82
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.230
it goes from that to sharks to a bunch of other shit that kill people,

83
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.850
which are surprisingly small.
Spiders,
insects,
any types of Asian transportation.

84
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.140
That's pretty high these days.

85
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.340
There was a video there showing on the Internet the other day of a traffic and

86
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.680
in some African country where they don't have any,
uh,
any traffic lights at all,

87
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.220
and just people just going into intersections,

88
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.420
just freaking out and hitting the brakes and speeding up and crashing into each

89
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:35.090
other.
Find,
don't pull,
pull,
just pull up the fucking charts,

90
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.990
look for it.
Just find it will be all right here.
Malaria chart will be over here.

91
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.130
Brian will do everything is such an opportunity to see how much you're able to

92
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:48.820
let go.
Yeah.
You know,
because you can,
in La,
you,

93
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.010
if you don't develop that skill,
you're going to have to move.

94
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.670
I got in business guy in this giant fucking truck today that was going super

95
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.670
fast and I got in front of him and he hit his horn and I'm like,
come on man.

96
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.980
What you want everybody to wait behind you?

97
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.700
You're going fucking 10 miles now in this stupid big diesel truck pulling a ton

98
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:07.760
of shit.
He shouldn't be freaking out if someone doesn't want to be behind you.

99
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.180
Right.

100
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.450
It wasn't like I slowed him down for anything more than a half of a second.
Yeah.

101
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.690
People are just so weird about that.
Get in front of him at all.
But

102
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.110
<v 2>yeah.
Ah Man,</v>

103
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.220
I don't like to race.
And you cheated and it's,

104
00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:25.320
it's a punishment.

105
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.950
The Horn is there so that you can prevent an accident from happening.

106
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.830
It's to warn somebody that something is happening.
They don't see,

107
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.650
it's not after the fact to punish them.

108
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Or it's a twat alarm.
Occasionally you see people using the horn,</v>

109
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:40.490
they're like,
oh look,
there's a Twat.

110
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.300
<v 2>Ah Nah,
Nah,
Nah.</v>

111
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.180
<v 1>This reasons to use a horn like,
hey dickhead,
get out of the fucking road.
Right.</v>

112
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.610
And look out man,
what are you doing?
But there was no look out today.

113
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.780
I was just getting in front of crazy slow truck that was going below the speed

114
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.280
limit.
Yeah,
that Shit's annoying.
You know you shouldn't do,

115
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.490
they shouldn't even be allowed.
Those big stupid trucks.

116
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.610
18 wheelers was a big truck.
I mean I don't know how many,

117
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.750
it was like some giant ass fucking diesel thing.
Yeah.

118
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.520
I don't know what they were.
I wasn't paying attention.
I was just like,
Oh fuck,

119
00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:10.570
I'm behind.
This guy was one of those.
Yeah.

120
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.460
They should have special roads for those fucking things like on the highway.

121
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.860
Yeah.
That freaks me out man.
And train tracks.

122
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.420
That's where they should fucking ship stuff.
Just put it in more train tracks.

123
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.560
Well you get those guys all met up to try to stay awake so they can make long

124
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:29.040
trips and stay up for hours.
Fuck man.

125
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.560
Whenever I'm on the highway and I'm next to one of those things in my cube

126
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.930
together,
keep it together past this motherfucker,
go,
go,
go.

127
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.640
It's just like a potential bomb.

128
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.270
Girlfriend of mine in high school get hit by one of those,
an 18 wheeler car.

129
00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:40.710
Didn't even,
he didn't even fucking see the car.

130
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.280
He turned into her lane and clipped her and send her flying into a ditch and he

131
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:48.030
didn't even stop but shit died.
No,
no,
she lived.
She was okay.

132
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.910
But she freaked out.
She spun out car spun out,

133
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:54.600
but it's like this guy didn't even stop.
Fuck.
It keeps going.
I didn't see shit.

134
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.790
<v 2>Yeah.
[inaudible] I mean those things are,</v>

135
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:02.370
you think about how many hours they're logging did it can't be painted in the

136
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.820
hall.

137
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.300
<v 1>Impossible.
And it's impossible.
You'd go mad,
you go mad if that was your job.</v>

138
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:08.550
Just pay attention to the road over and over again and you start,

139
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.340
I would love to see,
well now I think the record,

140
00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:14.700
all these guys inside their trucks and they do it for accidents,

141
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.150
for insurance purposes so they can find out.
But before they used to do that,

142
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.650
I bet guys would just go bananas and start singing crazy shit to them saying to

143
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:26.240
themselves,
screaming,
racist shit.
The top,
yeah.

144
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.260
<v 2>Lungs while they're driving me.
I can't do that anymore.</v>

145
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.350
There was a lot of,
show me your tits.

146
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.050
It's truck cause I think in the 70s that was like a thing.

147
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.990
There was a point where truckers were kind of seen as cool.

148
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.590
Like I remember smokey and the bandit [inaudible] there was a time where like

149
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:43.910
truckers were seen as like,
you know,

150
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.660
they had the caps and the mullet was cool back then and it was something new,

151
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:50.270
something kind of seedy,
cool.
Know this is all on camera.

152
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.570
You're doing all those we truck,
I can't find this malaria charity,

153
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.010
but there is this chart is this code that that

154
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 1>more than half of the 15 a thousand or 1500 uh,</v>

155
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.160
malaria cases in 2007 we're in six areas and it's like New York,

156
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.480
California,
Texas,
malaria in California,
in La we had a big,

157
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:10.740
we had a big warning Adventist.

158
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:13.540
There were signs all over the trees to look at from malaria.
You know what?

159
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.690
There was just some foams,

160
00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:19.170
Zo also fucking countries who come over here with the dirty fucking diseases and

161
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:24.130
they get stung by a bugs.
Bugs.
Let me tell you about bugs.
I bugs say day.

162
00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:26.060
Got a fucking horn.
Get Out.

163
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.190
I'm going to stick the Santana up your fucking ass.

164
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.370
Give you this dirty malaria that I got from some country.

165
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:36.690
You can from a pronounce.
You got you.
Come over.
You come over here.

166
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.950
I'll take your women,

167
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.970
put them in a basement in New Jersey will [inaudible] that's only showing

168
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.760
America,
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not cool yet to go.

169
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.690
Africa seem like Maryland suspect being in this list though.
Like why New York?

170
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.610
California,
Texas.
Well listen,

171
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.110
I guarantee you most of those people have gotten it from somewhere else and then

172
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:59.520
flew back to America.
That's probably what happened.
I know it dude got malaria.

173
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.540
I knew a dude.
Justin Wren,
the guy who uh,

174
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.970
I guess we're still doing a tinker Marshall thing.
Dot Com.

175
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.360
Save 25 bucks off.
Awesome.
Yeah,
they have iPhone five for two 49.
Man,

176
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.740
that's crazy cheap.
Yeah,
that's pretty good things.
Awesome.
Um,

177
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.680
the thing that I love the most about things that the cut out all the bullshit.

178
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.140
You don't,
you don't have to deal with anything.

179
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:22.680
I think that's going to be the future too.

180
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.370
Like you don't pay if you go over a certain amount,
you know pay like a penalty.

181
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.980
You just pay for what you use all across the board.

182
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.590
So if you only use your phone for a bit,
you have a little bill.

183
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.550
You hope that's the future.
And I think TV should be the same way.

184
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.310
Just if I watch a TV show charged me a dime,
if I watch how I met your mother,

185
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.740
that's a fucking dime and movie a dollar,
whatever.

186
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.280
But it should be like a running bill based on what you watch.

187
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.300
The problem I have with that is that essentially what we're dealing with now is

188
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:51.480
the entrance of the Internet into the world of television,

189
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:54.030
slowly making its way onto the TV just with,

190
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:58.590
with Netflix and also with the different apps that you have on television now

191
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.090
that allows you to watch youtube videos.

192
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:05.091
I mean telephones come with TV's rather come with apps and I think that if we

193
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:10.491
start charging more for more content than it kind of fucks up the whole benefit

194
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.620
of the Internet.
Right.

195
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:16.650
The benefit of the Internet being net neutrality being the idea that everybody

196
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.120
should have equal access to the Internet.

197
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:22.260
And that's a big point of contention right now.
So because of the new cars,

198
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:24.300
the new Internet is going to eventually,

199
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.880
like the new television is going to be the internet.
It's not,
it's,

200
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:29.580
you're not going to be able to control with NBC,
CBS,
Fox.

201
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:32.850
The only reason why they'd be able to do it so far is because it's a long

202
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:37.230
tradition,
but the way they distribute things is antiquated.
It's stupid.

203
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.520
Like the only reason why you can't rewind and pause this is because it's

204
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:46.020
happening right now.
It's absolutely 100% live with no delay.
This podcast is,

205
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.690
there's very few things on television.
They're like that.

206
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.490
And so that because of that,

207
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.110
these guys are allowed to put things up when they want to and you have to sit

208
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:56.891
through the whole thing,

209
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.980
including they changed the recipe on how many commercials,
I mean he used to be,

210
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:02.590
they played in a 30 minute Sitcom.

211
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.260
It was 26 minutes of Sitcom.

212
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.980
Now it's down to like 21 it's crazy.
Yeah.

213
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.130
And it's just because they can make x amount more per year for that extra
minute.

214
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.890
rogan.ting.com save yourself some money.
That's it.

215
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.730
That's it for you to in commercial.
It's going an awesome company commercial too.

216
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.940
I feel like it's about as good as if I'm the person at Ting and there is

217
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:25.570
somebody in the office that actually has two.
They do things called air checks,

218
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.540
which I guess Brian,
you send those in.
I've gotten complaints about those.

219
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.030
We've lost clients because of the,
well,

220
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:33.400
I would imagine because you do the commercial,

221
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:37.540
you're away and I think that that's got to sell way more than somebody reading

222
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.870
it wrote off the page.
You imagine some people don't like it though.

223
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.600
There was some business oriented companies that thought they were going to

224
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:45.310
capitalize just based on numbers and you know,

225
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:50.290
we started talking about giant dicks and fucking Werewolf's and whatever.

226
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.730
It just took a turn.

227
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.300
This tink bitch covering up her delicious tits with this charity that's not,

228
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:58.360
she's,
oh,
she's a woman dudes.
Nice woman.
She looks like Meg Ryan.

229
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.890
She's looks like Meg Ryan.
If they photo shopped her waist to waist to hip ratio,

230
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.790
Meg Ryan and a prime man when she was something special.
She was odd.

231
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.790
Have she's it.

232
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.980
She's a nice lady who had a rough life in the spotlight over here.

233
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:15.970
Hanging out with iPhones.
Yeah.
Anyway,

234
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:20.680
rogan.ting.com we're also about to you on it.com that's o n n I t on it.

235
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.470
We sell a bunch of different cool shit,
including supplements,

236
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:25.090
strength and conditioning equipment,

237
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:28.180
protein powder made from the finest Canadian hemp.

238
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.050
It's illegal to buy hemp that's made and grown in California.
Greg,

239
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.110
did you know that?
I did know that.
That's illegal.
Crazy.

240
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.630
Can't grow hemp even though it does not even psychoactive.

241
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.710
You're not allowed to grow it because it knows marijuana because the marijuana,

242
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:45.760
the THC,
it's like its neighbor.
They call each other like no,
fuck face.

243
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:47.650
You're too close.
You're too close to that criminal.

244
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.120
It's like knowing a criminal keeps you out of an office.
It's like,

245
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.250
wow.
You know,
that's really what it is.
So what we've got to buy it from Canada.

246
00:13:57.251 --> 00:13:58.540
We can't even grow it in America.

247
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.170
It's totally non cycle by some of that cause I gotta put it will help me put

248
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.570
some weight on.
I need to,
I need to bulk up a little bit.

249
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:05.920
Protein powder will certainly help.

250
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.030
The best thing for bulking up though is lifting heavy weights.

251
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.980
Standing me dating Brian will work.
If you get

252
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.940
Brian,
we'll get a diet and put it together for you.
Everything that he eats,

253
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.210
all the olive garden's specials,
but you'll get again the wrong way.

254
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.930
Lifting weights though,
um,
is you get,
if you're going to do a dump,
put stop.

255
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.200
I do sets of like eight.
I should be doing sets.
Don't laugh.

256
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.210
We're in the middle of a fucking commercial in the conversation.

257
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.900
Pay attention to what you're doing.
Or I'm doing sets of like five things.

258
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:37.840
It's help it,
right.
It should be a work with a trainer.
You find some dude,

259
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.370
some Brian's train and me and Brian Callen workout at the same gym and he's got

260
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.890
his trainer.
Got Somebody.
He's,
it's like a 20 minute workout,
but they don't stop.

261
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.540
It's hardcore for 20 minutes.
Well.
That's really a great idea to do it that way.

262
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.700
A lot of people,
that's one of the things they like kettle bells

263
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.270
<v 0>is that it's so intensive.</v>

264
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.050
You so much of your body that you could burn out a serious workout in 25
minutes.

265
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:57.370
Yeah,

266
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.710
like if I only have 15 minutes to to do something like and then I have to shower

267
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:04.160
and go.
I literally can get a workout in 15 minutes.
It's not ideal.

268
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.610
I like to work out for like a strong hour plus I like to have enough time,

269
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.000
but if I want to I could bang out a kettlebell workout in 15 minutes.

270
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.120
<v 1>When you say an hour,</v>

271
00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:14.580
does that include cardio or that's all just lifting weights?

272
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.340
<v 0>Friends?
Just depends on where I'm at.
If I'm at a gym,</v>

273
00:15:17.341 --> 00:15:20.580
like say if I'm staying at a hotel,
I'll lift weights and do cardio.

274
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.120
I lift weights first and then I'll do cardio.
Yeah,
always lift weights first.

275
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.480
Oh no shit.
I thought it was the opposite.
You'll get tired quicker.

276
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.970
You won't be able to put it in as much work with the weights.

277
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.410
I thought you wanted to get your heart going and some sweat gums.
Well,

278
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.890
I do do that,
but that they don't consider that cardio.
I do a 10 minute warmup,

279
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.940
right?
The 10 minute warmup,
usually on an elliptical machine,
it's just a,

280
00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:41.760
I just do like these little intervals on an elliptical machine just to raise my

281
00:15:41.761 --> 00:15:43.290
heart rate,
but it's not like real cardio.

282
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.710
So I do that and then I lift weights and then after lifting weights,

283
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.890
I feel like you can push the cardio when your muscles are sore,

284
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.620
but you can't really push your muscles when you cardio's dead,

285
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.180
you're just exhausted from a hard half an hour of sprinting on an elliptical

286
00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:00.570
machine.
So then you go back on the elliptical after.
Yeah.
Yeah.

287
00:16:00.571 --> 00:16:03.630
I love the elliptical.
What a great fucking work.
Fantastic for your body.

288
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.740
There's no trauma,

289
00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:08.670
there's no banging around and no soreness of the joints and you know it's just,

290
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.340
and you can get a real fucking workout.
Brian,

291
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.340
<v 1>stop focusing on people.
Just put up,
put up the pictures of us.
Yeah,</v>

292
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.710
I'm going to get some of that powder and I'm going to go with some heavier

293
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:22.210
weights.
You're just focusing on chicks zooming in on this girl.

294
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.740
Zoom in on that girl every time.
No,
I just researched this website,

295
00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:28.330
find things that I didn't know about.

296
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:32.350
Like I didn't know that@thecoveroftheon.com I didn't know that they have this

297
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:35.080
new thing which shows a bunch of videos.
That guy,
uh,

298
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.680
on it videos now that pops up like this thing scrolls left and right.

299
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.910
And that's how I accidentally hit that video of you talking like right here.

300
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.290
Like where are all cool?
It's all done in house to the,
uh,

301
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.060
<v 0>all this stuff.
Does Dallas diamond page,
the guy in the upper left hand corner,</v>

302
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.470
former pro wrestler.
He's a yoga advocate now.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
I've seen that.

303
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.050
Has his own like style of yoga that was put together,

304
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.200
brings all these former pro wrestlers and helps them out with yoga.

305
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.070
<v 1>Yeah,
they get a piece on him on a,</v>

306
00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:07.160
I think HBS sports are one of those shows and it's like very,
a lot of them,
uh,

307
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.190
had addictions to a um,
uh,

308
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.160
barbiturates and a lot of them were drunks and,

309
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:16.270
and a big part of it is recovery too.
They get sober as they did

310
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.720
<v 0>huge part of it.
The Dallas time and page,</v>

311
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.430
he brings in all those guys that used to be pro wrestlers or even current guys

312
00:17:23.431 --> 00:17:26.850
that are injured and fucked up.
And a lot of those guys,
they turn to pills.

313
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.280
Pain pills are a big problem in a lot of athletes cause you're,
you know,

314
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.940
football players have problem with them.

315
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.840
I knew this baseball guy who has his career fell apart because of pills or hurt

316
00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:37.674
himself,

317
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.160
got a little surgery on something and they got him on pain pills to recover from

318
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:45.790
the surgery and then boom,
he's off to the races.
He just often doesn't take long.

319
00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:50.070
No,
no.
There's,
and especially if you have the,
you know,
there's certain

320
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 1>people that just,
for whatever reason,
they seem to get addicted quicker.
Well,</v>

321
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:57.960
you know,
I quit drinking 24 years ago when I first met you were,
you were sober,

322
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:00.330
right?
Right.
When we first met,
I had just gotten sober

323
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.510
<v 3>and then I had shoulder surgery about five years ago and they gave me,
um,</v>

324
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.390
you know,
Vicodin and all that year,

325
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.170
year and a half later still pop in that shit.
I had

326
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.160
<v 1>prescriptions going with three different doctors and then I went off of it.</v>

327
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:19.130
It was a dark time going off that shit.
Yeah,
on a.com.
Oh.

328
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.310
And I said,
fuck the music.
It's just,
just turn the show on.
We talked,
we were to,

329
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.670
this is too free form to have a,
an actual opening.

330
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.990
I think I'm going to kill the opening.

331
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.600
I think I'm going to add it in post because the opening line,

332
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.160
if fucking weirds everything out,

333
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.710
it's like all of a sudden music plays and you have to start from scratch.

334
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.580
It's like you kill the momentum.
So how are you going to do it?
Just like this.
No,

335
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:41.060
but I mean,
uh,
how did you use to do it?

336
00:18:41.061 --> 00:18:44.940
Like you used to like stop cue the music and then Joe Rogan.
Right,
right,
right.

337
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.930
But like why would,
why are we doing that?
Because it kind of feels like a start.

338
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.990
I think.
I know it does.
You know what it also does though?

339
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:53.820
It kills the momentum of the conversation.

340
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:56.220
That's why I don't do it sometimes because I feel like we'd get this groove

341
00:18:56.221 --> 00:19:00.810
going.
All right.
Why?
Because in the future you might not like Ting.
You'd be like,

342
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:03.390
fuck,
taking the off and then you want to just be able to cut,

343
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.290
like cut it off too.
Don't even say that rude.
No,

344
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.840
no,
no,
no.

345
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.900
But someone asked me if I wanted to put together a best of the fleshlight

346
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:17.340
commercials.
I'm like,
that seems like that would be kind of advertising,
you know,

347
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.060
like that doesn't seem like a smart move because we don't use them anymore in

348
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:24.450
the Promo code probably doesn't work anymore.
Okay.
Funniest.
Fuck.

349
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.980
Maybe some of them were hilarious.
Yeah.
Some of them who are Larry,

350
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.060
maybe if a fleshlight wants to get involved,
we want a piece of the action.

351
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.790
Bring it back just for just for some videos.
Um,

352
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.653
but uh,

353
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.200
so these doctors didn't know about each other when you have three different

354
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:44.580
prescriptions,
obviously that's what's crazy states or same state,

355
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.190
<v 3>you know.
No,
all in the same state.</v>

356
00:19:46.191 --> 00:19:49.580
One was my general practitioner when was the guy who was,
um,

357
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.470
who had done the operation and then the other one was the PT guy.
And so,

358
00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:58.580
and then,
and then,
you know,
you start,
you start looking for pills

359
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.570
<v 1>where,
God damn,
dude.
Yeah.
I knew a guy who did that with oxies.</v>

360
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.580
He got a backside.
Yeah.
That's,
that's hardcore.
And he just,
he had a one in Texas.

361
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.190
He had one down here and different doctors feeding the pills.

362
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:15.090
And you still couldn't,
couldn't keep them in the system,
just shoving them in.

363
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.320
It's,
it's heroin.
Oxy,
I mean,
it's the same exact chemical makeup.

364
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.900
Yeah.
And just like you were saying,
he went dark,
you know,
it was dark time.

365
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.910
We could still,
like there's a cloud walking over him.
When did see him?
Yeah,

366
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.430
like a,
those snoopy cartoons.
Right.
The one dude was a cloud.
Right,
right.

367
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.380
It was literally like that.
Yeah.
Poor guy.
Yeah.
It's um,

368
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.580
it's tough because

369
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.980
<v 3>you feel great.
I'm not going to lie to you when you are on those pills,</v>

370
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.470
you can talk to like at some ass all you run into a comedy club that you would

371
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:50.410
normally avoid.
I can engage.
I can have a long conversation.

372
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.970
I was doing an hour and 40 minutes sets where I was just free form and I could

373
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:56.140
sit and write scripts.

374
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.340
I mean it was just for whatever my chemical makeup is that's fucked up.

375
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.860
It righted it on the heroin.
Yeah.
Bag on him.

376
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.240
All the Greg Vicodins isn't heroin though,
right?
Vikings is a

377
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.910
lighter version of it.
Everyone's not that bad.
If you just don't take a bath,

378
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.400
you're fine if you don't take a bath.
Yeah.

379
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.430
When you're on heroin because they wanted guys.
Right,
right.
Well,

380
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.180
the problem with it is that you're,
you're um,
uh,

381
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.650
perceptives your,
what's the happiness,
uh,
chemical in you?

382
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.590
A dopamine.
Serotonin.
Yeah.

383
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:34.591
Your serotonin receptors get clogged up by the chemicals in barbiturates so you

384
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:40.120
no longer are able to receive um,

385
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.120
serotonin because those are the only thing that is,

386
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.800
that is making you feel good is the drug.
And then you have to,

387
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.960
when you go off it,

388
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.320
it takes a while for those receptors to clean out and be able to accept

389
00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:55.540
serotonin again.
And that's where you get really dark.

390
00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.110
<v 0>That's,
yeah,
that's a,
a friend had the same issue coming off.</v>

391
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:02.940
Coke was that same thing,
just depleted receptors.

392
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.250
It just hyper taxes your system.
That's the big deal with coming off ecstasy,

393
00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:09.860
right?
That's where people started getting into five HTP.

394
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.040
They started getting into five HTP because people were coming off of ecstasy and

395
00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.540
the serotonin would you be depleted?

396
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.090
And then they realize if you take five HTP while you're tripping before you

397
00:22:18.091 --> 00:22:20.450
tripping,
like while you're tripping,
after you're tripping,

398
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.830
it gives your brain the building blocks to rebuild Serotonin,
coworker,
right?

399
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.340
Everything you are as a human being.
This is the,

400
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.620
this is the thing that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around when

401
00:22:30.621 --> 00:22:35.000
it comes to like their diet or when it comes to their,
uh,
you know,

402
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.210
how,
how much nutrients they take in your body.

403
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.950
Your body is literally built on food.
It's built on food.

404
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.190
That's the only way it gets built.
You have to give it fuel.

405
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.010
The fuel that you give,
it depends.

406
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.040
It depends entirely on the nutritional properties of that fuel to give your body

407
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.460
enough to build,
rebuild itself.
And in certain circumstances,

408
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.850
what you're doing to your body just depletes its reserves of anything like where

409
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:05.210
the Serotonin,
whether it's dopamine,
when you know,

410
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.270
that's the thing that happens to guys when they're on steroids,

411
00:23:08.271 --> 00:23:10.630
they get off steroids or testicles don't work anymore.
It's,

412
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.730
you get testicular atrophy.
Same thing.

413
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.420
You just deplete your body's ability to do something.
Just wreck the whole,

414
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.300
<v 3>even if you just dial,
you see some people fuck it,</v>

415
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.060
Starbucks and they got the sugar and they just turn it upside down and you

416
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:28.140
literally,
you think,
okay,
that's crazy amount.
And then they keep going and,

417
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:32.720
and you realize like I did a cleanse a couple times because basically your

418
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:37.490
system needs once in awhile to not have to deal with all this shit and just

419
00:23:37.491 --> 00:23:39.650
drain it all out so that it can relax.
You know,

420
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:42.950
it's like turning off your computer so your hard drive and go to sleep for a

421
00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:46.220
little while and if you don't do that,
you're just,
you're

422
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.820
<v 2>fighting all that</v>

423
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.070
<v 0>time.
Yeah.
When you introduce something to it,</v>

424
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:52.270
like if I get in or heroin users,

425
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.280
you're upsetting your system in such a crazy way to your,

426
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.470
your system doesn't know what the fuck's going on.
Right.

427
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.130
It's like every now and then this guy takes this stuff in and we're on this wild

428
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:05.870
ride and then our reserves are depleted and we have to scramble to get that wild

429
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.070
ride again.
Otherwise we're not going to be even right.

430
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:09.680
Like that's one of the saddest things.
Everyone,

431
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:12.710
you see those pill guys that they only take the pills to get,

432
00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:15.380
even when they're not on the pills,
they're sick.

433
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.920
They get that sickness that they just can't deal with and they take the pills to

434
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:20.030
just relax a little.

435
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:24.650
<v 2>Yeah,
I know.
Well what,
what's your feeling?
I like raw food.</v>

436
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:26.240
That seems to be what people do now.

437
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.970
<v 0>Some raw food is really good for you.
Some foods are better when they're cooked.</v>

438
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.130
Yeah.
Um,
there's,
there's,
we had,

439
00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:36.510
Steve Maxwell's is a famous strength and conditioning and nutrition health guy

440
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.430
who was worked with a lot of MMA fighters and he's just a really knowledgeable

441
00:24:41.431 --> 00:24:44.670
guy always on top of like health and wellness type stuff.

442
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.780
And he was talking about the cellulose in like Broccoli and certain vegetables.

443
00:24:48.781 --> 00:24:52.260
Like your body doesn't even process it correctly unless its cell walls.

444
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.430
You have to cook it in order to get the most out of it to make it the most

445
00:24:56.431 --> 00:24:57.180
nutritious.

446
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.630
Which I thought was really interesting because a lot of people think that most

447
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:01.261
vegetables,

448
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:04.680
like eating most vegetables raw like raw vegetables is like the way to go,

449
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.060
which I think it is.
You know what I think?
I think there's no correct answer.

450
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.180
There's like some things are better raw,
some things are better cooked.

451
00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:14.310
Some you probably should have both.

452
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.700
You probably should have animal protein as well as vegetable protein.

453
00:25:17.701 --> 00:25:21.810
Like I always make fun of Vegans,
but if you saw what I eat on the most part,

454
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:25.470
I eat a shit ton of vegetables and I eat vegetables all day long.

455
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.070
I think it's the most important thing other than like a good quality source of

456
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:30.360
protein that you're taking your body.

457
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.990
I feel different when I eat a lot of like green leafy,

458
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.690
<v 2>Oh hell yeah.
I feel different if not better.
Right.
And I also,
um,
I,</v>

459
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.680
I fart a lot if I eat vegetables,
a lot of fruit,
a lot.
I fought,

460
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.150
I fought to the point where I got a hemorrhoid and I get this hemorrhoid and I

461
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:52.620
can't get rid of it.
And I noticed that like,
I fart probably,
you know,

462
00:25:52.621 --> 00:25:56.250
when I'm really gone,
I probably far 20 times a day and they're long,
far.

463
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.730
And it's hard.
If I'm traveling,
I get off the plane,

464
00:25:59.731 --> 00:26:02.520
I'm cramped up because I won't fight in the plane.
Oh,

465
00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:06.370
you're a sweetie cross country.
So I go to the urinal and I,

466
00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:07.650
I was just my son one time,

467
00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:11.040
we were coming back from a trip from Florida and we went into the men's room and

468
00:26:11.041 --> 00:26:13.800
we're both of the urinal and that's where I let it rip.
And I mean,

469
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.660
it's like a crazy comedy farce.
And he started laughing so hard.

470
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:20.810
He's face turned red and he left.
He's like,
yeah,
man,

471
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.970
I can't believe you did that.
I go,
that's what a gentleman does.

472
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.890
That meant I didn't do that on the plate,
dude.
Good for you.
Right.

473
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.400
Do you take enzymes?
I just got some,
uh,

474
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.330
probiotics in the mail.
I'm going to start taking.

475
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.540
<v 0>That's different than maybe what that is.
Yeah.
I mean,
probiotics are very good.</v>

476
00:26:39.541 --> 00:26:43.700
It's very good for intestinal health and the uh,

477
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.820
digestive health.
But a man enzymes really important as well.
Yeah,

478
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:51.510
you can buy enzymes like so.
Lots of good one.
I'll get you some,

479
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:53.550
I'll get you some on at once.
The,
um,
there's,

480
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.770
there's a ton of good ones that are on the market.
There's a,

481
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:59.220
there are certain enzymes that are in certain vegetables and certain fruits,

482
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:02.680
especially like Papaya.
Papaya is a big one for digestion.
Yeah.

483
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.100
That's why you ever eat at one of those Brazilian places,

484
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:07.410
those Fogo de Chao places.
Yeah,
they're awesome.

485
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.370
But one of the best desserts they have is this Papaya smoothies.
Right,
right.

486
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.670
And one of the cool things about it is the Papaya actually has,

487
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:16.590
I think it's Pectin or one of those,

488
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.830
some enzyme that helps you digest all the meat.

489
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.110
So it's like a good post meal thing.

490
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.170
It's beautiful and it's tastes so fucking good.

491
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.130
<v 3>That's where the fighting comes from,</v>

492
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.670
they say is because the fruit and the meat together.
Yeah.

493
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.640
Break down at different times so that fruit digests immediately.

494
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.880
So it forms a bubble behind the big red meat.
And then as you,

495
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:38.850
as you digest the red meat,
it releases the Papaya Fart.

496
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.040
<v 0>Oh yeah.
It's intense.</v>

497
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.700
Well they say that if you're gonna eat like one of the best way they,

498
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.563
I don't know who they are,

499
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.290
but the people who I've talked to that are health and nutrition Democrats say

500
00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:51.580
that you should have,
um,

501
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.190
like your vegetables should be like one of the first things you eat,

502
00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.090
like eating a vegetable smoothie and you are eating a fruit smoothie.

503
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.090
Sometimes fruit or vegetable based is like one of the most important things

504
00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:06.040
early cause it kind of like opens the pipes up and lubes him down that way when

505
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:07.330
you're eating something else,

506
00:28:07.331 --> 00:28:10.840
if you eat something that's a meat based meal later,
like to attacking,

507
00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:12.310
you're already open and you know,

508
00:28:12.311 --> 00:28:16.330
you already sent in the troops to clear out the fucking forest and then you shit

509
00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:17.350
comes flying out of you.

510
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:22.450
<v 3>So there's a logic to like the Italian six course meal versus the Antipasto with</v>

511
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:27.140
just some raw vegetables and a,
and then that loosens it up.

512
00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:31.610
And then you get the heavy carb pasta as your second meal because then,

513
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.590
then you,
uh,
I never followed because I'm so fucking stuff.
I'm Irish.

514
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:41.390
So the first,
the first,
you know,
wave comes and we just attack it.

515
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.230
Like there's never going to be food again.
And then they keep bringing,
like I,

516
00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.400
my friend Frank Moretti's Italian,
we used to,

517
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.890
I used to have dinner at his house and they had fucking anti pasta,
then pasta,

518
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:56.030
then they'd have shrimped and they'd have like a,
uh,
another post,
then a meat.

519
00:28:56.031 --> 00:28:56.864
And I was just,

520
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.190
I felt embarrassed that I couldn't keep eating because I eat and too much.
Well,

521
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.160
<v 0>you know what,
that's an important point when it comes to eating,</v>

522
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.500
that it's not just about health.

523
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.610
Like I think you should eat for health sake most of the time because I think

524
00:29:10.611 --> 00:29:13.490
your body of work better and you'll feel better.
But that said,

525
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.090
you should also enjoy food like as a delicious art form.
Yeah.
Yeah.

526
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.350
And like if you go to a really jam and Italian restaurant and they bring out a

527
00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:25.610
five course meal and it's got anti pasta,
delicious Lasagna,

528
00:29:25.611 --> 00:29:29.690
and then there's a me causing like,
oh my God,
like you're a wash in like a,

529
00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:32.450
an an orgy of sensation.
Right,
right.

530
00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:35.000
And you should appreciate that for what it is like,
yeah,

531
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:38.540
you're going to be sleepy afterwards.
Yeah.
It's not the best thing for you.
Yeah,

532
00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:42.100
yeah,
yeah.
But every now and again,
it's a great to do.
Let's do

533
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 1>it.
Me,
you and Collin and our wives.
Let's go to a good fucking restaurant.
Okay,</v>

534
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:49.960
let's do it.
Come on.
What did I get too excited?
I'm ready.
You got me excited.

535
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.140
No serious.
I was thinking about that the other day.
They were due.

536
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
I'm down 100%.</v>

537
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.880
Let's do a count is going to be here right after you.
So we'll,
we'll work it out.

538
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:58.714
Right?

539
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.360
Here's the answer when you were asking earlier the difference between heroin and

540
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.800
Vicodin.
Um,
so heroin,
it's a,
according to this post,

541
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.940
online has a,
a greater euphoric and analgesic property than Vicodin.

542
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.800
It's a less potent and an oral to a milligram basis.

543
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.320
So heroin is indistinguishable from morphine if administered any way other than

544
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:21.154
Ivy.

545
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.460
And heroin is more sedating than hydrocodone by a very notable degree.

546
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.370
So it seems that heroin slows you down more.

547
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:32.380
It's more of a sedative not out.

548
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.830
That's probably like when you taking Viking and you felt like really creative

549
00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:36.940
and you've got a lot done.

550
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.410
<v 1>I think that the Vicodin,
uh,</v>

551
00:30:39.411 --> 00:30:44.411
it quells your fears and your anxieties seems to be an extreme antianxiety pill.

552
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.160
No shit cause creativity.
Once you feel anxious,
it tightens up.

553
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.050
You lose it sometimes it didn't hanses it with me though.
Yeah.

554
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Sometimes like when I,
uh,
especially pot,</v>

555
00:30:58.461 --> 00:31:00.590
like eating pot for me,
there's a,

556
00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:04.700
there's oftentimes a period of anxiety or a feeling of vulnerability.

557
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.440
Just a real,
just a reality of being a person,
being a,
a finite life form.

558
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.470
Good,
weird man.
You just weird out,
you know?
But then afterwards I have,

559
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.640
I sort of relax from that and then I have this wave of ideas.
It comes,

560
00:31:19.641 --> 00:31:24.250
it's just like a gift for tolerating all the freak out.
It's like the universal,

561
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:27.800
okay,
you got through that good.
Here's some ideas.
Whew.

562
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.240
These are like gifts,
like gifts from the Gods,
you know?
Right.

563
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.720
But I don't get that from Viking.

564
00:31:32.721 --> 00:31:36.190
Then I only took viking in once and it didn't work with me with my,

565
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.470
with my system.
It just made me a moron.
I was just sitting on,

566
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.320
maybe I was too much.
Maybe I overdosed or something.

567
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.570
<v 1>Second.
Right here.
If you guys want to take some and try it out.</v>

568
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.800
You have vitamins on you?
Yeah.

569
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.850
Why do you Vika then Dayaks had been in this box for like the last year when I

570
00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:54.170
had my operation.
My teeth.
Yeah.
I don't like Viking in so I just kept it here.

571
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.423
Keep Viking.

572
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.050
How am I gonna explain it to cops and I'm like,

573
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:02.910
I don't know where the bike thing came from.
I don't even have like in,

574
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:04.100
and that's not,

575
00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:07.690
did you plant Viking and then accused the Capa Planning Vika then wait,

576
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.030
so you shoots my dog
eat dog.

577
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.740
<v 0>That's what they do.</v>

578
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.430
They shoot dodge and you haven't seen the fucking videos of cops shooting dog.

579
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.190
There's so many cops that actually enjoy shooting dogs.

580
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.480
These are like collies bark when they come to arrest someone for something and

581
00:32:23.481 --> 00:32:25.190
they just unload on the dog.
Yeah.

582
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.330
It's a fear tactic and it's also to let them know that,
you know,

583
00:32:29.331 --> 00:32:33.320
I'm completely in control here.
I just shot your dog.
You're in shock now.

584
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:37.880
And it's a tactic of control and manipulation.
Control.
It happens all the time.

585
00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:42.290
Clock cop allegedly back a smile after fatally shooting friendly,

586
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.680
<v 2>dark.
They do it all the time.
Yeah.</v>

587
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.700
<v 0>Do it all the time.
Yeah,
there was,
there was a,</v>

588
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.870
I mean there's a ton of videos I hate even talking about because it makes me

589
00:32:52.871 --> 00:32:56.230
sick.
There's a ton of videos online cops,

590
00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.100
they're just fucking shooting dogs.
Huh?
You know,
I get it.

591
00:33:00.101 --> 00:33:04.510
If you were going over a bad guy's house and that bad guy has some dogs and

592
00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:06.280
those dogs would sick you,
I get it.

593
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.410
But there's a lot of times when they're doing it with,

594
00:33:08.411 --> 00:33:12.670
that's not the case at all.
There was a guy who was a fucking mayor and um,
they,

595
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.720
uh,
they shot his dog and they shot,
um,

596
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.790
another dog ran away and hid and they chased after the dog.

597
00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:22.390
And while I was hiding,
they shot that they were shit labs,
chocolate labs.

598
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.820
And then I think their chocolate,
maybe golden labs,

599
00:33:24.821 --> 00:33:28.480
but I remember them being like really like dogs you never have to worry about.

600
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.410
And then,
um,
they,
uh,

601
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:35.140
arrest the family because someone had delivered some marijuana to the wrong

602
00:33:35.141 --> 00:33:35.974
address.

603
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.720
So what it was probably was that this guy was a postman and the postman was

604
00:33:40.721 --> 00:33:43.870
working some sort of a drug deal.
And what he would do is he would,

605
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.820
he would be delivering to a certain address.

606
00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.910
So instead of him actually delivering the package,

607
00:33:48.911 --> 00:33:50.260
the package was going to that address.

608
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.750
He handles all the packages that go to that address.
Instead of that,

609
00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:56.290
he picked up the package himself and it was pot.
So the,

610
00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.340
the people that were in the house where it turned out to actually be a mayor.

611
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.560
So they,
this guy was fucking,
haven't pot delivered to this mayor's house.

612
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.920
So this guy,
uh,
you know,
the mayor had nothing to do with it.

613
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.310
So they break down his house,
they break down his door,

614
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.980
shoot his dog chases other dog and hiding shooted fucking zip tie.

615
00:34:14.981 --> 00:34:18.120
Everybody treat him like they're drug dealers.
And then it turns out black,

616
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.420
I believe.
I don't remember.
Okay,
let's find this sounds familiar.
Yes.

617
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:27.370
I think he was mayor.
I want,
I don't want to fucking,
I want to say of DC

618
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.900
<v 2>now.
I remember it was around DC.</v>

619
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:33.650
It might've been a little bit south at the dog owners.
Black.

620
00:34:33.651 --> 00:34:37.700
It's way more scary than if a white dog owner,
right?
No.
And then the,
um,

621
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:42.330
it got big.
I think Obama climate did on it.
What do you mean?
Right?
Like if,
if,

622
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.070
if it's probably like if you go to somebody's house and a bunch of dogs,

623
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:47.630
or like at the door,

624
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:50.630
you're probably more scared and a black guy's house in the white guy's house.

625
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.390
Why?
Because white guys have like shit like bitch dogs usually.

626
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.100
I think that's a fair,
that's a fair stereotype.
I mean,

627
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.000
there is a bitch if you're in,
if you're in the hood,
there is a fair,

628
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.120
there's a fair chance that those dogs have been bred to fight or at least be

629
00:35:05.121 --> 00:35:05.954
very aggressive.

630
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.560
<v 0>Okay.
It's,
it is.
It's Maryland.
And here's the,
um,
it's Berwyn heights.</v>

631
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.550
And here's the actual story from Wikipedia.
The Berwyn heights mayors,
residents.

632
00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:16.650
Drug raid was a controversial,

633
00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:19.830
controversial action taken by the Prince George County,

634
00:35:19.831 --> 00:35:24.000
Maryland Sheriff's office and Police Department at the home of Berwyn Heights,

635
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.390
mayor,
uh,
Shay,
c.

636
00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:30.210
H.
E.
Y.
E.
Calvo.
I Dunno how to say that.

637
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.220
In 2008 the raid was a culmination of investigation would that began in Arizona

638
00:35:35.221 --> 00:35:39.820
where a package containing 32 pounds of was intercepted at a warehouse address

639
00:35:39.821 --> 00:35:41.040
to the mayor's residents.

640
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.940
In spite of intercepting the package in transit,

641
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:48.540
the police allowed to package to be delivered and once the package arrived,

642
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:48.901
the house,

643
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:53.560
a swat team raided and held the mayor in his mother in law at gunpoint,

644
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.530
shot and killed his two dogs,

645
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.080
one while at attempted to run away the event gained national and international

646
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:04.770
media attention.
Why Calvos?
While the Calvin [inaudible],
I guess,

647
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:06.390
were cleared of wrongdoing,

648
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:10.530
the police were accused by the Calvos and civil rights groups of lacking a

649
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:11.520
proper search warrant,

650
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:15.240
excessive force and failure to conduct a proper background investigation of the

651
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:16.074
home being raided.

652
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.720
<v 3>Yeah,
I think,
I think Obama made a statement about it.
As a matter of fact,</v>

653
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.770
<v 0>in 2010 and August,</v>

654
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:24.890
the sheriff say stated we'd do it again tonight.

655
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.580
<v 3>Alright,
I love cops.
Sorry.
Stays do it again tonight.</v>

656
00:36:30.581 --> 00:36:35.050
He said,
Omar drawn that Sheriff Gel and,
and uh,

657
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.150
Phoenix.
He us,
it's like,

658
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.790
I don't know what the checks and balances is on sheriffs,

659
00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:42.490
but they seem to be able to say whatever the fuck they want.

660
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.080
<v 0>There's some Douche bags out there.
The sheriff's,
that's for sure.</v>

661
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.820
I mean like everything.
There's,

662
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:51.430
there's cops that are great and then this cops that are,
that suck at it,
right?

663
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.420
And it's fucking really hard job.
That's part of the problem.

664
00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:56.850
They don't get enough respect.
It's a really hard job.

665
00:36:56.851 --> 00:37:00.360
It's a super dangerous job at developed,
well paid.
It's not well paid.

666
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:02.640
And they developed this us versus them mentality,

667
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:06.050
which is super dangerous because they are us.
This idea that you're not us,

668
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.610
that you can go over a guy's house and shoot his fucking Labrador.
Yeah,

669
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.310
that's crazy man.
I mean it should be crazy,

670
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.480
but you get so used to the stress of combat a daily basis.

671
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.680
Imagine being a fucking cop.
Everybody you deal with all day is long to you.

672
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:19.991
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

673
00:37:19.991 --> 00:37:24.880
My buddy's a cop in the South Bronx and he works the graveyard shift and he said

674
00:37:24.881 --> 00:37:25.930
that they show up,

675
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:31.290
they'll show up to help somebody and people on rooftops in the tenements.

676
00:37:31.871 --> 00:37:35.800
We'll start throwing fucking paint cans down on the street and just anytime they

677
00:37:35.801 --> 00:37:38.860
see a uniform there,
it's like if we come into a place,

678
00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:41.740
we need to make the arrest and get out of there in less than five minutes.

679
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:45.580
Otherwise a crowd gathers and it's like a near riot situation.

680
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.960
If you go into certain tenements,
imagine living like that,
you know,

681
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:53.290
you got to go and you're going in there because you know you're assisting the

682
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:55.480
fire department because somebody had a heart attack.

683
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:58.360
Or are you going and because there was reported domestic violence,

684
00:37:58.361 --> 00:38:01.690
you're trying to help the community and you are under attack.

685
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:02.980
It's like fucking Iraq.

686
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.850
<v 0>Well,
do you remember what happened during the La Riots?
Um,</v>

687
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.930
after the Oj Simpson trial where they were shooting firefighters,

688
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.990
they're showing us,
wow.
They were shooting at people.

689
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:15.090
They're shooting at anybody with a union or the uniform.

690
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.710
And just white people in general.

691
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:19.620
I mean that whole Reginald Denny thing where they pulled him out of his truck

692
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:23.730
and bashed out a fucking brick off of his head on national television.

693
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:26.700
Do you remember that?
So,
yeah.
Unbelievably scary.

694
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.060
And you watch the fact that this guy for no reason other than the fact that the

695
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:30.894
guy was white,

696
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.990
pulls him out of a truck and then takes a brick and hurls it at his head.

697
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:36.821
<v 1>Full clip.</v>

698
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:41.320
Caving is facing right now that that happened just because the guy was white.

699
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.830
Right.
And the same thing with lynchings of black people in the south,

700
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.450
but what's really fucked.
Yeah,
but for sure.
But that was a different time.

701
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.740
You know,
it's really fuck that.

702
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.330
Like that kind of racism like the black against white racism.
White people go,

703
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:59.920
well yeah,
well we kind of have a common a little bit,
you know what I mean?

704
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.330
It was amazing.
He took lunch for the team.
All this fucking,

705
00:39:03.331 --> 00:39:06.630
let's think about this owner of this basketball teams.
Donald's done.

706
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.600
All he said was keep hiding away from black people.

707
00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:15.040
Don't take pictures of the black paper.
And everybody wants his head.
It's over.

708
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:17.410
He said,
come.
I mean,
look,
I'm not gonna obviously.

709
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:20.770
Do I even need to say we're not condoning it?
Of course we're not.
Of course,

710
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.280
but this dude has $1 billion team.

711
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:27.960
He has to fucking sell because he made some stupid states.

712
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.360
He didn't prohibit a black person from coming on the team.

713
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.540
He didn't mistreat a black person even he just made statements.

714
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.980
Yeah.
He apparently had a reputation for a long time of being racist,

715
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.710
and he was the guy that ran our test didn't eat,

716
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:49.510
was it Ron Artest and suit him in 2009 yeah.
Sued them for racial discrimination.

717
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.530
So it's obvious that the guy was a racist,
does no question.
We'll also,

718
00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:55.150
he owns buildings and there was a,

719
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:58.960
there were lawsuits brought against him because he was profiling people into his

720
00:39:58.961 --> 00:39:59.530
apartment.

721
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.430
He wasn't allowing black people and he lost millions of dollars in that,

722
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.730
in those lawsuits.
Right.
He's obviously a piece of shit.
There's no question.

723
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.870
No doubt.
He's a piece of shit.
However,
what did he say that was so awful,

724
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:14.860
but finding them $2 million.
He didn't use the n word.
No.

725
00:40:14.861 --> 00:40:18.040
He said don't take pictures around black people because it makes me look bad.

726
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.670
He said,
you can fuck them.
That was what's even crazier and open minded guy.

727
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.750
You know what it was?
This is what happened,
man.
The chick was getting sued.

728
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.470
I don't know if you know this as white side.

729
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.320
The the wife was suing the side piece,
which is preposterous.
The white,

730
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.470
I mean she was humiliating her husband.
That's why she did it.
Yes,

731
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.090
but the idea was ridiculous.
The idea that you,
you can't take gifts back.

732
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.050
The guy gave away some gifts and he got the pussy.
You can give the pussy back.

733
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.600
Like what kind of ridiculous statement is that?
I mean it's,

734
00:40:49.601 --> 00:40:53.860
the whole thing's ridiculous.
We were with prostitution was nice and legal.

735
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.070
That relationship could have existed in harmony for a long time.

736
00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.220
If it was just above board out in the open.

737
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.790
I mean he gave her two Bentleys,

738
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.310
a Ferrari and a range rover,

739
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.360
Osha and he bought her this fat fucking crib.

740
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.930
It's just prostitution.
It's fun.
It should be fine.

741
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.530
And that kind of prostitution prefer girls like the perfect time.

742
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.510
You get like a relationship with the guy.

743
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:21.190
You don't have to fuck anybody else for money.

744
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.420
This guy gives you a ton of cash and if that's what you want to even say it,

745
00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:27.400
he can go fuck other guys.
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

746
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:28.480
I really don't.
Just like,

747
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:31.260
I don't think there's anything wrong with someone cleaning your teeth.
Is there?

748
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.250
I think some of wants to clean your fucking,
especially a chick

749
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.200
<v 0>has been taken.
How thick ones from a basketball team.
Owners she,</v>

750
00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:40.850
she needs her teeth cleaned.
There's sticky and gummed up.

751
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:45.530
He's probably got like tar that comes out of
cigarettes.

752
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.820
<v 2>Tar Spider webs.</v>

753
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.940
Cigarettes are spiderwebs come out of his mouth when he comes up like cobwebs,

754
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.720
like fogged cobwebs,
sticking her hair.

755
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.140
He wraps his ball sack around her neck three times.

756
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.270
Go fucking TMZ has a thing that like,

757
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.960
he was out last night eating at a restaurant.

758
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.350
They were like the balls on this guy,
but,

759
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:13.080
but can you imagine how many like eating at a restaurant now people are probably

760
00:42:13.081 --> 00:42:16.200
putting their pubic hairs in this places.
Yeah,
he's fucked.

761
00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.960
<v 0>And here's my take on the whole thing with like the,
the money thing,</v>

762
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.320
like two point $5 million ain't shit to that dude.

763
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:28.000
He's 80 years old and he's got 1.9 billion for folks who don't know what a

764
00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:29.980
billion is,
it's a thousand million.

765
00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.700
So he has one point 9,000 million dollars.

766
00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:37.000
You can take 2.5 million.
He's not going to notice he has too much money.

767
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.900
That's 0.02% of his money and the interest he's making on all this money.

768
00:42:40.901 --> 00:42:44.590
Like he'll make that back in a week.
Their money comes and goes.
It's like,

769
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.440
it's like finding a guy like you 100 bucks,
right?

770
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.170
It's like you're not going to notice a hundred bucks.
It's going to be there.

771
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:52.030
It's gone.
He doesn't give a fuck.

772
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:56.680
But the public humiliation must be unbearable,
but a way to finish at your life.

773
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.970
You picture him even in his own country club that's filled with these reptilian

774
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:04.790
blue bloods.
Even those people are going to reject tagged with good.

775
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.333
But she said

776
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:15.470
she was out of line [inaudible] cut action dot on that stand out the world of

777
00:43:17.981 --> 00:43:22.060
the billionaire Ferrari buyer.
I believe they live forever.
You know it's,

778
00:43:22.061 --> 00:43:25.150
I went to the girl's Instagram too and it's like so many people are so fucking

779
00:43:25.151 --> 00:43:27.400
mean.
It's there's something,

780
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.520
it's a weird thing we've got in our culture today where people could just

781
00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:35.521
comment on videos and comment on pictures because there's folks out there that

782
00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:38.550
are just waiting for someone that they can yell at.
Yup.

783
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:42.280
They don't have any connection to this woman like me.
I am.

784
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.170
I was curious about the whole thing.

785
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.330
I feel bad for the woman that she's that woman that has to sleep with this 80

786
00:43:49.331 --> 00:43:52.690
year old man.
I feel bad for him that he's an old racist.

787
00:43:52.691 --> 00:43:56.050
I feel bad for the whole situation.
So I life,
I feel bad for everybody.

788
00:43:56.051 --> 00:43:59.380
So I'm looking at it just out of a public curiosity because here's a store that

789
00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:01.270
I can't escape.
It's all over my Twitter feed.

790
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.900
But when I go to the Instagram and I see the comments like the other people's

791
00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:08.770
reaction to this scenario,
that doesn't involve them in the slightest.

792
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.510
You fucking ugly pig whore,
you know,
get some more plastic surgery.
You can't,

793
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.890
you rat you piece of shit.
You know you did the right thing,
girl.
Fuck him.

794
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:19.950
You should have cut his dick off.
I mean,
you're just,

795
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.220
you're just reading fucked up.
Comment after fucked up coming.
Right?

796
00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.390
What kind of a world is this where people think that's okay to do,
right?

797
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.280
Like they have pictures of their dog,
they have pictures of them on a hike,

798
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.950
they have pictures of their new car that they're washing.

799
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:39.600
Then they have a fucking comment on someone else's page.
You fucking cunt,
right?

800
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.890
Big Cuts your tits off.
You fuck with the wrong guy?
He's got $1 billion,
you know,

801
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.810
just the meanest shit,

802
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.540
<v 2>right?
Right.
Well,
and like remember Monica Lewinsky?
Oh boy.</v>

803
00:44:50.541 --> 00:44:54.250
Did they fucking hate her?
But here's the thing,
this chick mark my words.

804
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:59.040
In one year she will have a reality show.
She will have an pocket book line.

805
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:00.660
She will be worth $1 billion.

806
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.850
<v 0>Well,
in that sense it's good,
but it's in,</v>

807
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.520
in another sense it's bad because they enter the world of hate.

808
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.360
It's like you remember when Kelsey Grammer's wife was on that real real

809
00:45:10.361 --> 00:45:13.420
housewives of Beverly Hills and then they broke up and you know,

810
00:45:13.421 --> 00:45:17.920
and then she became famous for being like a mean person on the show.

811
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.340
But they was so overwhelming.

812
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.350
But this wave of hate that came at her and she just,

813
00:45:24.351 --> 00:45:27.610
she up to words that at first,
I don't think she knew what she was dealing.

814
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.190
I don't think she knew what she was getting into and I thought she was going to

815
00:45:30.191 --> 00:45:33.400
try to be controversial.
You know,
apparently she's a nice person.

816
00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:35.440
I know someone who's met her,
she's a nice person.

817
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.140
So she was trying to be controversial and do that show.
She's was

818
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.150
<v 2>Dang as you think about like Andy Kaufman,</v>

819
00:45:41.151 --> 00:45:45.110
when he'd go into the ring and he'd fight fight women and he called it the

820
00:45:45.111 --> 00:45:46.640
southerners rednecks in the own.

821
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.710
Like he was courting it and it was taken the right way.
I mean,

822
00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.340
some people hate it and some people got it.
But nowadays people,

823
00:45:55.341 --> 00:45:59.030
people go into it and they say,
I'm going to be a fucking pariah.
Yeah,

824
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.670
I'm going to represent everything people hate and I'm gonna make a lot of money

825
00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:02.220
from it.

826
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.490
<v 0>And they just figured out a way to rationalize it because of the fact that</v>

827
00:46:05.491 --> 00:46:07.350
they're,
you know,
they're going to get paid for it,

828
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:12.090
but you're also going to get paid back.
You have to realize you what you put out,

829
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:17.010
the way you make people feel,
that's exactly how they shoot back at Ya.

830
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.920
Right.
And there's some people that take it for no reason.
And then you know,

831
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.380
you see a girl and she's just beautiful and you know,

832
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:24.530
you hate her because you could never be here.

833
00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:27.360
Or I hate her because you can never fucked her.
You know,
this,
this,
this.

834
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.450
There's always going to be people that are just really negative for no reason.

835
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.020
But what do you think of the Kardashians?
So same thing.
I mean,
look the,

836
00:46:34.021 --> 00:46:37.860
the haint that those,
those girls get,
look,
I mean,
do they deserve hate?

837
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.460
What do they do?
That's so horrible.
They do.
They don't do anything that's great.

838
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:45.450
They're doing don't do anything that's in traded and represent the worst thing

839
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:48.720
in America.
Not the worst thing in America.
It's not even close.

840
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:53.010
It's just shallowness.
The worst thing is violence.
The worst thing is rape.

841
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:58.080
The worst thing is people victimizing people bullying people in school,

842
00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:02.260
bullying in the workplace.
That's the worst thing is meanness is,

843
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.640
is people just being violent,
hurting people.
What they're doing,

844
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.420
it's just being idiots that are shallow,
that run around,

845
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:12.270
and they broadcast them in front of you with really clever editing,

846
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.040
so you can't take your eyes away from it.

847
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.440
You find yourself watching it for no fucking reason.

848
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.340
<v 2>Yeah,
the they're really evil is the reaction to it.
I mean,</v>

849
00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:20.990
kids are watching a shit.

850
00:47:20.991 --> 00:47:24.440
They don't know that she got her start by doing a internet porn.

851
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.280
They just think that she's,
oh,
they fucking know.
Everybody knew everybody.

852
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:33.400
My kids know that she's famous because of that.
Your kids know.
Yeah.
Crazy.

853
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.030
Hold your kids.
You should 16 right now.
10 and 1310 13 sorry.

854
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.830
13 though.
They fucking know by the time they're eight,
they're yeah.

855
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:42.880
<v 0>Blow jobs when they're like seven.</v>

856
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.070
One kid tells another kid that his brother got his dick sucked and like what?

857
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:52.350
Someone's drinking pee.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
There's no drinking pee.

858
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.220
It feels good.
Why don't you like what?

859
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.780
And then they cover their dicks and then they sit around the school year.

860
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.670
They tell each other's things.

861
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.210
<v 2>I was 11 when I heard about a blow job and,
and I remember thinking like,</v>

862
00:48:02.211 --> 00:48:05.070
I literally thought you blew on it.
Yes.
I thought so too.

863
00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.020
I thought the exact same.
That's so funny.

864
00:48:09.021 --> 00:48:12.530
I thought the exact same thing and it just,

865
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.190
it seems crazy and outlook.
People say,
well,
it's so gross girls,

866
00:48:16.191 --> 00:48:19.190
they're giving blow jobs left and right in school and I think good.

867
00:48:19.191 --> 00:48:21.350
It's better than getting pregnant.
Let him suck away.

868
00:48:21.351 --> 00:48:22.520
No one's getting hurt with that.

869
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.070
<v 0>This is not too wrong with it.
You know,</v>

870
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:28.570
I had this conversation with some parents are the day this guy was his daughter.

871
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.200
Um,
you know,
you got a picture off her phone of her cuddling with her boyfriend,

872
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.610
you know,
but she's like 16,
the boyfriend's like 16 too.
And he's like,
you know,

873
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:40.180
you know,
who knows what else is going on.
He's all upset,
shaking his head.

874
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.290
And then the wife was like,
you know,
talking about how when she was 60,

875
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:46.930
it was actually another,
another mom's was,
was talking about how it was,

876
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:50.680
I know what I was like when I was 16 and I was like,
come on,

877
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:55.360
listen boys like girls and girls like boys were being crazy.
We're like,

878
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.800
we're attaching all the same sentiments that the puritans had and our parents

879
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:03.160
had and their parents had all these that we know to be silly now.

880
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:08.290
And all this suppression of natural sexuality is what makes people so fucked up

881
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:09.310
in the first place.
Right?

882
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.140
<v 2>Any of my friends,
they have a daughter and when she was like 16,
17 years old,</v>

883
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:17.200
she had a boyfriend.
And at first I was like,
I couldn't believe it.

884
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:19.840
They were letting the boyfriend sleep over,
you know,

885
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:22.810
knowing they were having sex.
And I thought,
God,
that's fucking twisted.

886
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.380
But then I thought I was having sex at that age,
but I was in a car.

887
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:30.940
Cops could come.
The whole aura of it was negative and shameful.

888
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.480
Why not let your kid feel that sex is a normal,
healthy thing.

889
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:37.090
And if you're doing it responsibly,
then why not?
Having a

890
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:41.580
<v 0>boyfriend is no different than having a friend.
I think you make it.</v>

891
00:49:41.581 --> 00:49:44.000
Hence if you make it different,
that's certainly intense that way.

892
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:48.230
But if you make it different than it becomes different.
If you make it like,

893
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.570
oh forbidden,
you add to attach.

894
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:54.290
There's this girl that I dated in high school and me and her sister didn't get

895
00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:59.030
along.
Her sister was just fucking angry and I was probably angry too.
And uh,

896
00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:01.190
we uh,
for whatever reason we clashed.

897
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:05.870
And part of the reason was her sister was really hot.
Like,
um,
the,
the,
the,

898
00:50:05.871 --> 00:50:08.780
the one who wasn't so hot was always angry and the hot one,

899
00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:13.530
like dudes were just bombing on her left and right.
And uh,
that we in the,

900
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:17.750
the not so hot one got an argument at school.
And because of that,

901
00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.650
like the,
the sister was not supposed to date me.
There was like this thing.

902
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.630
So because we weren't supposed to date each other,
it was like this law,

903
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.730
this romance that could be,
you know,

904
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:32.670
put together.
It's like the tension,
like we were meant to be together,
you know,

905
00:50:32.671 --> 00:50:33.060
yet.

906
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:37.400
And then you're all parents finally let me date her somewhere along the line.

907
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:42.080
And I was like,
oh,
this is boring.
Stupid lasts like a month because I run,

908
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:45.140
me and Juliette killed himself.
Good.
As it gets,

909
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.080
they realize this is as good as it gets.
Yeah.
I mean,

910
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:50.660
the real problem that we have is with,
um,

911
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.440
the tension between males and females.
That's the real problem.

912
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:58.460
The anger that men have towards women and the anger that some women have towards

913
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:00.290
men.
It's so dangerous.

914
00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.790
<v 2>I think it's changing.
I really do.
I think that,
you know,</v>

915
00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:06.400
if you've been to Canada or Europe,
that they,
they,

916
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:08.920
that feeling between the genders is very different.

917
00:51:08.921 --> 00:51:12.310
They're much more like friends over there.
And I added a specialist.
Yeah.

918
00:51:12.311 --> 00:51:14.170
And I'm starting to see,
you know,
like my,

919
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.670
like talking about my friend's daughter,

920
00:51:15.671 --> 00:51:18.280
like getting to know kids of that generation.
It's very different.

921
00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:22.060
They really do hang out as a group more than the men and women are on,

922
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.390
on more of a,
even playing like my,

923
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.400
my son just had his first girlfriend and it was very chill.
It was like,

924
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.190
it wasn't,
he told us about it,
you know,
and they weren't,

925
00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:34.240
it wasn't like a big high stakes adventure.
It was just like,
yeah,
we hang out,

926
00:51:34.241 --> 00:51:37.000
we have lunch together,
you know,
as a group we go to movies,
whatever.

927
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.370
And he didn't fit.
He felt like he was getting serious.

928
00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:42.520
So we broke up with her 13 he's like,
he even said,
he goes,

929
00:51:42.521 --> 00:51:44.920
I'm 13 that's hilarious.

930
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:49.930
<v 0>Done a great job.
We put a lot of like artificial charged,</v>

931
00:51:49.931 --> 00:51:53.390
the things that don't,
that don't have to be there.
You know,
this,

932
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:56.600
this artificial and like significance

933
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.490
<v 2>I think a lot of is I'm watching TV shows and movies were,</v>

934
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:04.020
romance is always the fucking central thing.
Every song that comes up.

935
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:08.580
It used to be people wrote songs about shit.
You know,
Hendrix would write about,

936
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.820
you know,
purple fucking,
you know,

937
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.240
Hayes and weird shit and now everything is about loving a girl or breaking up

938
00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:18.894
with a girl.

939
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.670
<v 0>Well those are the songs that resonate with people.</v>

940
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.190
How many people connect relationships to a song?

941
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.730
There's a song that I listened to that all I can think of is driving to this

942
00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:28.230
girl's house in the middle of the night.

943
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.400
There's a song radar love golden earring song.
If I hear that song is this,

944
00:52:32.401 --> 00:52:37.140
my girlfriend in high school moved across the state and I'd go visit her.

945
00:52:37.141 --> 00:52:39.720
Like we'd have a phone conversation like 10 o'clock at night.

946
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.330
She lived like a couple of hours away at 10 o'clock in the night.

947
00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:45.420
I'd get in my car and drive to visit her and then listen to that song radar
love,

948
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.000
you know,
and like,
so that song to this day I hear it.

949
00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:50.650
I think about that one person.
Right.
This is always like weird.

950
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:57.210
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a great fucking tune man.
Yeah.</v>

951
00:52:57.211 --> 00:52:59.450
80 songs I fuck man.
I,
I think

952
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:04.220
<v 0>that's an 80 song radar.
Love the 90s.
I think it's earlier than that.</v>

953
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.300
I think it was like a 70 song.
Let's see.
Golden earring,
radar love.
Let's see.

954
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:13.090
<v 2>Golden earring had like three monster songs.
Yeah.
And that was it.</v>

955
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:17.770
But um,
no I had,
I bought a 76 Volkswagen rabbit and my 23,

956
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.360
he was 73.
Wow.
Play at Brian and when I was in red,
I love on you.

957
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:25.980
I can remember every fucking song.
I got this and I started driving

958
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.510
<v 3>a school my senior year because my school was about 20 minutes away and uh,</v>

959
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.680
every song burning down the house,

960
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:34.260
like I can name the 20 top songs were on the radio.

961
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:38.130
Then every one of them I still will listen to when it comes on today.

962
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.890
Just brings me back.
Yeah,
there are songs you just,

963
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:42.830
you just instantly remember where you were.

964
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:47.250
<v 0>I was in my car in Boston and it was April and I was listening to Prince Song.</v>

965
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.270
Sometimes it snows in April and I remember,
wow,
this is,

966
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.040
I've got to get out of fucking Boston.

967
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:57.730
<v 1>Ah,
snow in April.
This signal,</v>

968
00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.740
right?
Michigan or Minnesota where a prince live.
That's just as ridiculous.

969
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.490
Sometimes it snows in April.
We'll fucking move cause that's crazy.

970
00:54:06.491 --> 00:54:10.420
That's spraying bitch.
I know.
And kids go to college there.
People go like,

971
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.900
I'm going to go to Minnesota to go to college for four.
He's like,

972
00:54:13.901 --> 00:54:15.580
did you fucking visit in the spring?

973
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.450
You really should've gone around January and checked it out.

974
00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.380
You know you can go to Arizona State,
right?
It gets 50 yeah.

975
00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:27.460
A real cold spell rolls in the town.
I mean Shit,
we went to college in Boston.

976
00:54:27.461 --> 00:54:28.211
I don't know what the fuck,

977
00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:31.660
but that's about in mind that I guess I was drunk the whole time.

978
00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.470
Bother me that much.
Well,
the town is so great.
It almost makes up for the fight.

979
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.850
It's fucking cold as Dick in the winter.

980
00:54:39.851 --> 00:54:41.890
Not when you're going to university Wisconsin.
Man.

981
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:46.810
There's no reason to be there unless you're really in Wisconsin type chicks.

982
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.310
Chicks who could make their own cheese.

983
00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.360
Girls know how to farm and Fart in the farting Wisconsin girls probably that's

984
00:54:55.511 --> 00:54:58.150
why they were skirts and a winner.
I live

985
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.100
<v 0>in Boston,
so I went to school in Boston,
but I don't know if I would've stayed.</v>

986
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:07.290
I Dunno.
I mean I,
if,
if I had an option to go somewhere else to go to school,

987
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.490
I probably wouldn't have went somewhere else.

988
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:10.790
<v 3>I was attracted because of the history of it.</v>

989
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.520
I just felt like it was an important city,
so I shut the song.

990
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.770
So I sort of felt like it was a good place to learn.

991
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.780
But then I stayed because there was a quarter of a million people my age all in

992
00:55:20.781 --> 00:55:23.390
the city and that energy was crazy.

993
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.470
And then I stuck around because we were doing comedy and then all of a sudden

994
00:55:27.471 --> 00:55:31.130
one day was like you said,
I woke up one day and I went,
what am I doing?

995
00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:36.020
I can get the fuck out of this freezing cold,
kind of segregated,
weird city.

996
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:39.610
<v 0>It's a great place to be in the beginning.
And then as you get older,</v>

997
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.780
especially for a comic,
there's a,
there's a trap.

998
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.600
And it was a trap in Boston.
We all were aware of it.

999
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.020
There was a trap where you could be a local headliner and you can make good

1000
00:55:50.021 --> 00:55:54.700
money,
but you will never work the road.
So you'll be trapped in Boston forever.

1001
00:55:54.701 --> 00:55:55.990
And we all would talk about it.

1002
00:55:55.991 --> 00:55:59.020
There's certain guys that never got out and those guys,
they were,

1003
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.720
they just showed us,
they showed us that there's a flaw in the system.
Yeah,

1004
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.610
it's awesome in the beginning it's a great nest,
but you've got to leave the nest

1005
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.760
<v 3>and it's a great life lesson because New York becomes the same way.</v>

1006
00:56:09.761 --> 00:56:13.180
You go to New York and you can turn into a comic that does too much crowd work.

1007
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:17.140
That's to better,
that doesn't do extended bits because you know,

1008
00:56:17.141 --> 00:56:20.770
you can kind of scrape together a living by being in the city and doing in city

1009
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:24.910
spots.
But um,
it's really important to go like,
I got a,

1010
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.360
not that you have to come to la,
but you got to get out on the road.

1011
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.200
<v 0>Yeah.
You gotta do sets like real headlines Sense.
Yeah.
The New York guys,
um,</v>

1012
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:34.620
we would work with them on the road.

1013
00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:39.120
Sometimes they would come and do like these Bob Gonzo gigs or John Schuler gigs

1014
00:56:39.121 --> 00:56:41.300
in Connecticut and they couldn't headline.
Yeah.

1015
00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.450
They had these 10 minutes sets that they would do in the city.

1016
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.850
So they would go outside the city and they try to do 40 minutes.

1017
00:56:47.851 --> 00:56:48.870
They just couldn't put it together

1018
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.170
<v 3>and there was no clothes,
there was no bill it.</v>

1019
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.110
The overall set just felt like a guy groping

1020
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.410
<v 0>and they would talk about being on the subway.</v>

1021
00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.960
And when you talk about being on the subway in Connecticut,

1022
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.670
they alienate you down,
not even,
you're not even into this.

1023
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:05.770
<v 3>Yeah.
And,
and the,</v>

1024
00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:09.840
and you're used to playing on race and homosexuality because that's the audience

1025
00:57:09.841 --> 00:57:12.540
in New York and you go to Connecticut and they're like,
wait,
who?
What?

1026
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.190
She's in our energy.

1027
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:17.460
<v 0>Totally different sort of an environment.
Yeah.
That's a weird thing,
man.</v>

1028
00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:21.300
There's a big difference between the kind of comedy that you do when you're

1029
00:57:21.301 --> 00:57:23.130
starting to put together your first few minutes,

1030
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.070
the kind of comedy you do when you want to do a TV set,

1031
00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:29.790
like a Letterman set or a remember like the half hour comedy hour.

1032
00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:33.230
Everybody wanted to get on that damn proud of those.

1033
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:38.010
And then there's like a real road set.
Well you gotta,
you gotta put on a show,

1034
00:57:38.011 --> 00:57:39.570
it's got to start somewhere.

1035
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:43.020
You take them on a little journey and it's got a wrap up tight.

1036
00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:44.130
Goodnight everybody.

1037
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:47.430
<v 3>You gotta be confident.
You're the orchestra leader,
you're the Alpha,</v>

1038
00:57:47.431 --> 00:57:51.090
you're up there.
And in New York it's like,
look,
nothing is more.

1039
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.560
I think of all those things.

1040
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.030
Working as a club comic in New York might be the most important because it

1041
00:57:57.031 --> 00:58:01.350
forces you to follow guys like a tell and Louie,
whoever's coming on that night,

1042
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:04.340
keep your shit together,
stay cool,
learn,

1043
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.080
learn that people are going to be skipping,
seated and leave.

1044
00:58:07.081 --> 00:58:08.070
Cause they're long shows.

1045
00:58:08.071 --> 00:58:10.050
They'll start showing eight that goes to one in the morning.

1046
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.660
So there's a lot of activity in the crowd.
And you just gotta.

1047
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:16.140
You got to learn to deal with it.
So it's crucial,
but it's not the end.

1048
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.080
<v 0>Yeah.
It's a good place to fuck around though.
It's a good gym.
Right?</v>

1049
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.830
Like the comedy store's good gym for that.
You know,

1050
00:58:22.831 --> 00:58:26.250
that's the same sort of scenario where the show starts at 8:00 PM it goes to two

1051
00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:28.400
o'clock in the morning.
It's just a continuous show work.

1052
00:58:28.401 --> 00:58:30.550
And that's the one club I a work.
It's dark.

1053
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:31.241
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:34.090
That's why I didn't used to go there cause it was so dark and I thought that

1055
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:37.450
people get bumped a lot,
but now I hear it's become a really

1056
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.790
<v 0>better run.
Um,
yeah.</v>

1057
00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:45.230
I hear good things have been here in better things.
Oh you don't go there?
No,
no.

1058
00:58:45.231 --> 00:58:48.560
Let's talk on,
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1059
00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:52.760
I stopped going there in the Mitzi incident of 2007.
Yeah,
that was it for me.

1060
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.500
Yeah,
February,
I think it was seven years bad.

1061
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.990
Because you're a good fit for the road.
Yeah,
no,
I like the ice house better.

1062
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.430
It's the same sort of thing,
but it's,
everyone's cool as fuck.
When you go there,

1063
00:59:04.431 --> 00:59:08.870
it's like the whole staff is just super friendly from the bike get.

1064
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.830
I get psyched when I see the bartenders,
I get psyched when I see the manager,

1065
00:59:12.831 --> 00:59:17.120
like everybody a cool dude.
He loves comedy.
Bob's the best.

1066
00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.300
It's like if I have a choice between a place to work out,

1067
00:59:20.301 --> 00:59:23.120
I always go with the house and the audience.
I,
it's one of the weird,

1068
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.490
weirdest things.
You walk on stage,
they're smiling at you,

1069
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.740
you haven't even talked and they're just looking at you like,

1070
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.740
I'm so happy you came.
Thanks for,
thanks for coming down.
Well,

1071
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:33.650
those crowds that we put together when we do those shows there too,

1072
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:37.100
it's like they're so positive.
There's so psyched to be there.
Right?

1073
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:39.320
And then you know,
you're doing a show with,
it's like,
you know,

1074
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:43.910
you're on Collins on and Dunkin's on.
It's like they're killer lineups.

1075
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:48.410
So it's,
we've been doing them there for a while and it's just,
it's magical.

1076
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:51.560
So when I think about going somewhere else,
like I do a little laugh factor.

1077
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:54.800
Sometimes I'll do the domino rarer show or I'll do comedy juice.

1078
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:58.770
The improv or fuck around there and I need to start doing the,
um,
the,
uh,

1079
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.940
flappers in Burbank and need to start doing,
it's real good.

1080
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Also west side comedy theater.
Great.
Where's that?
So right on the promenade.
Yeah.

1081
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.320
Santa Monica.
Yeah.
It's really weird.

1082
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:13.070
You enter it from an alley behind the third street promenade and it's this

1083
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:15.020
little theater,
but I'm telling you,
man,

1084
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.420
these crowds are so fucking good when you go in there.

1085
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:22.030
And then a Sunday and I'm doing a Sunday night and just some weeks now,

1086
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.000
so few weeks,
let me know,
man.
I'm going to go with you.
Okay.
Neil Brennan runs it.

1087
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.670
Neil Brennan runs a club.
Well,
he runs a night to talk to me about that.
Yeah,

1088
01:00:30.671 --> 01:00:35.250
that's right.
No Shit.
That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll let you know.
Come down.
Oh,

1089
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.230
I'm excited to do that.

1090
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:39.530
Cause I've always said like why they used to be places on the west side.
Well,

1091
01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:43.010
the Improv had a place right on Santa Monica Boulevard on the west side of the

1092
01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.930
story is the original,
but it was,
the store had one in the west.

1093
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.530
A lot of people don't know that Kinison didn't really make his beginning in the

1094
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:55.190
store in Hollywood.
A lot of the sets he did were in,
um,
Brentwood.

1095
01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:00.710
There was a comedy show,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Close.
I don't know,

1096
01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:05.030
a long time before I came around,
I came around at 94,
it was already closed.
So,

1097
01:01:05.031 --> 01:01:08.930
um,
Kinison and the guys down there like Carla Bald,

1098
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:12.950
they like ran the show completely opposite.
No,
but there was egg beast.

1099
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.690
I couldn't work egg beats because I was dirty,

1100
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.440
but I was hanging around with a Adam Ferrara and I used to go,
uh,
with him.

1101
01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:22.010
We still play pool a lot.
Adam please.
Really good.
Yeah.
Really good.

1102
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.850
And so we went to a egg B's a couple of times and he would do a set and then

1103
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:29.150
we'd go play pool afterwards.
That went to Hollywood billiards used to be around.

1104
01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:33.950
Where was that?
Well,
it was,
it was downtown.
It was,

1105
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.600
I forget where it was,
but there was an earthquake in [inaudible] 94,
93,
whatever.

1106
01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:40.340
It was fucked up the structure.

1107
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:43.820
They had to condemn the building and it was a 24 hour place back then.

1108
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.670
So then it moved to more Hollywood Hollywood and it was there until recently is

1109
01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:52.970
that the place was on the second floor knows downstairs actually you'd go

1110
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:56.630
downstairs to get the Hollywood billiards.
Yeah,
it was a sweet spot.

1111
01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.400
And then there was the Boston,
that flooded club,

1112
01:01:58.401 --> 01:02:02.990
which is another pool hall that was a write off a sunset and it was an old

1113
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:06.140
athletic club that they turn into a pool hall and it was great.

1114
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.160
I use static Ferrara was a real pool hall.
It was a nice pool.

1115
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.820
I played there with a bunch of guys play there with chimp brewer.
I used to.

1116
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:17.830
That's where I met Max Everly.
And uh,
that was a,
that was a sweet spot too.

1117
01:02:17.831 --> 01:02:19.830
But that place went under as well.
That's great.

1118
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.640
<v 1>Yeah.
There's,
there's no pool halls left in Hollywood now.
They're all gone.</v>

1119
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.850
There's that one in Santa Monica.
That's pretty good.
It's a great spot.
House.

1120
01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:29.460
A billiards.
Yeah.
I play at the house,
a billiards in Sherman oaks.

1121
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:32.960
I play the tournament there sometimes on Monday nights.
Oh,
I think,

1122
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.310
I think you took me there once.
Great.
Yeah,
that's great.

1123
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.980
Those are the only places left,
right?

1124
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.680
I mean for a game like pool with a population like La is,

1125
01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:45.330
there's 20 million fucking people here.
I know the relay is,
I don't get la man.

1126
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:49.380
Nate.
This no late night places to eat that are any good.
There's,
there's just a,

1127
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:51.360
there's a lot of shit that's just missing.
Well,

1128
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:54.990
there's a few places that are really good.
Like cantors cancers is great.

1129
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:59.120
Answers is fucking phenomenal.
Solid New York Deli.
It's the best Pastrami in Ela.

1130
01:02:59.121 --> 01:03:02.400
It is.
And you can get that at two o'clock in the morning.
Right?
You can go there.

1131
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.020
There's um,
swingers.

1132
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:08.640
Swingers is really good and healthy to swingers have some really good choices.

1133
01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:11.880
Yeah.
But for a city as big as la,
I mean,
I could,

1134
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:16.020
if I had come up with my list,
it would have been those same two restaurants,

1135
01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.880
you know,
that's it.
There's not,
you know,
norms fucking sucks.

1136
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.660
Apparently there's a Pacific dining cart in downtown that's 24 hours a day.

1137
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.690
Oh yeah,
yeah.
The writers on Tosh were telling me how great it was.

1138
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:30.600
[inaudible] Pacific dining car.
It's like a legit steakhouse.
Oh yeah.

1139
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.870
And there's one in downtown La that's 24 hours a day.
Yeah.

1140
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:38.730
So you can get a steak,
like a real legit steak at a restaurant at 4:00 AM.
Wow.

1141
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.860
It's,
it's weird that La doesn't have the 24 hour thing in general.
Like in Ohio,

1142
01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:46.250
every store is open 24 hours every like,

1143
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.800
like we had Myers that was open 24 hours.
We had department stores,
Walmarts,

1144
01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:52.500
we're all open 24 hours once we're all opiates,

1145
01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.680
all her stuff in Ohio is open 24 hours.

1146
01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:57.960
But then you go to la and it's like everything clothes,

1147
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.380
like even even the walks out here,
like I was just in Fort Lauderdale.

1148
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:02.590
I didn't realize those clubs,

1149
01:04:02.591 --> 01:04:06.420
nightclubs around the hardrock stay up until five o'clock in the morning.
Yeah.

1150
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:06.871
And then,

1151
01:04:06.871 --> 01:04:11.871
and then there's like a clubs to stay open till noon that opened at midnight in

1152
01:04:12.571 --> 01:04:16.740
fucking Florida.
Wow.
Yeah.
And La,

1153
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:20.580
two o'clock done.
People don't even stay up that late anyway.
Yeah.

1154
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:22.440
That's a weird thing about La.
Why is that?

1155
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:25.200
Why is everything closed up so early in New York is like 4:00 AM right.

1156
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.140
I don't know if it's because it's like a healthy city and people get up early

1157
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:31.620
and hike and do yoga and they take work more seriously.
That's a good,

1158
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:34.560
another good example.
All our grocery stores are open 24 hours a day.

1159
01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.500
Like that is a good example cause people who worked the third shift,

1160
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:40.560
that's tough action for them.
You know,
you want to get off work,

1161
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:42.060
you get off work at four o'clock in the morning,

1162
01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:45.720
you want to go pick up some groceries,
you can't,
it's fucked up.
Yeah,

1163
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:48.600
that's annoying.
That would be annoying.
Well,
member in Boston,

1164
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:52.500
you couldn't buy alcohol on Sundays.
Oh yeah.
We used to go to New Hampshire.

1165
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.340
The blue laws.
Right.
So stupid.
It's all the periods.

1166
01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:01.230
Six doesn't want you drunk.
You gotta get sober.
I say you can listen to the

1167
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.150
the five let the Father Touched Your Pee pee.
Don't worry about it.

1168
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.150
In Ohio we had drive through is where you can buy alcohol.
Yeah,

1169
01:05:09.151 --> 01:05:13.270
they have those New Hampshire doesn't Phoenix to remember any size him.

1170
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.590
He hadn't Louisiana,
they'll give you a mixed drink,
but they have to,

1171
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:17.980
it has to have a top on

1172
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.240
<v 2>it with a straw.
And the paper thing has to be covering the top of the straw.</v>

1173
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.560
We call it a sealed beverage.

1174
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.810
<v 0>Louisiana.
Yeah.
We had a driver once in Louisiana,
New Orleans,</v>

1175
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.550
New Orleans,
great fucking guy.
And uh,
after we left,
um,

1176
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.310
he was,
uh,
in a movement who's driving us around,

1177
01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:44.230
whether he was telling us about he,
he was one time I was in another place in,

1178
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.810
in Louisiana and he was,

1179
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:49.820
the cop pulled him over and he had a beer in his hand and uh,

1180
01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.760
the cop starts talking to them and asking them like questions and this and that.

1181
01:05:52.761 --> 01:05:55.430
He's answering the cops questions and he finishes the beer,

1182
01:05:55.431 --> 01:05:58.700
puts it down and pops the other beer.
And the cop goes,

1183
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.440
what the fuck are you doing?
And he goes,
wait.
He goes,
where are you from?

1184
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:07.580
And he's like,
New Orleans.
He goes,
okay,
okay.
Okay,
listen,
you can do shit there.

1185
01:06:07.581 --> 01:06:10.880
You can't do anywhere else.
You can't just drink a beer in front of me,
man.

1186
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.650
That shit.
That's why I'm pulling you over in the first place.
And he goes,

1187
01:06:15.651 --> 01:06:19.340
I wasn't even drunk.
He wasn't even drunk.
It was just enjoying a beer.

1188
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:21.650
<v 2>Right?
Driving another pass.</v>

1189
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.610
<v 0>No,
no.
He wasn't driving.
He was walking.
He was walking down the street.
All right.</v>

1190
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.000
He didn't see anything wrong with it.
Right.
It's not like I'm on board.

1191
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:29.890
Just walking down the street.
Cop pulls me over.

1192
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.670
<v 2>Well,
what's the pot laws?
Are you allowed to smoke pot in the street?
No.</v>

1193
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.590
Can you spoke here in your studio?

1194
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.330
<v 0>Allegedly,
this is what's going on with pod.</v>

1195
01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:42.410
Pod Is d criminalized and with decriminalized does not mean legal.

1196
01:06:42.411 --> 01:06:46.220
So in California it's decriminalized.
In Colorado,
it's legal.

1197
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.320
In Colorado you can just smoke weed,

1198
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:52.700
but they were trying to institute a law in Colorado where they would,

1199
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.990
they would bring out these,
these sensors and they would have these things.

1200
01:06:56.991 --> 01:06:59.060
They attach their nose,
they look preposterous.

1201
01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:03.380
It looked like something from a doctor Seuss book come to life and it's this

1202
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:07.100
thing that literally goes over your nose and it looks like a bullhorn.

1203
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:12.460
And they would sniff through it and if they could detect x parts per million of

1204
01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:16.530
marijuana outside of your residence,
they could go and arrest you or finding it.

1205
01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.740
Right.
I heard about it.
Yeah.
But they,
everybody was,

1206
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.980
everybody was so negative against it that I'm pretty sure that they dropped it

1207
01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.980
because people were so angry.
Like how stupid that was.

1208
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:27.350
<v 2>Very 1984.
No,
only that.
Okay.</v>

1209
01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.870
<v 0>Gives people the ability to stand outside.
It's,
you know what it is.</v>

1210
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:34.670
It's people that were for the longest time enforcing a policy.

1211
01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:36.860
That's not,
that's not valid anymore.

1212
01:07:36.861 --> 01:07:39.320
There's the things that guys knows that Shit's real.

1213
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.840
<v 2>Looks like the type of asshole smell or the,
look,
he's already frowning lean.</v>

1214
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:50.680
Well that guy needs,
we'd more than anybody.
Right,
right.
Put a smile on his face.

1215
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.200
Silly Bitch.
But,
um,
yeah,

1216
01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:55.480
I was just in Colorado and I didn't get a chance to read.

1217
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.370
But like couple of the comics I talked to,

1218
01:07:57.371 --> 01:08:00.400
one of them isn't even doing comedy much because he's doing pot tours.

1219
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.100
So what everybody's doing now for money in Colorado,

1220
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.190
they just do comedy and pop shops.
No,
no.
That pot tour,

1221
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:10.450
if people come in to Colorado to go drive when you drive them around,

1222
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.910
I don't think that they can technically buy it.

1223
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:16.100
I think you need a Colorado license to buy it in the shops,
but

1224
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.890
<v 3>you can walk through the shop and smell it and then not buy it for you.</v>

1225
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:22.280
And then they go out and smoke it and it's like a whole tour and they make,

1226
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:23.870
they're making fucking tons of money.

1227
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:25.640
<v 0>Wow,
that's interesting.</v>

1228
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:29.240
So the probably have material that they do just for the pot tours.
Oh,

1229
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:33.050
I'm sure there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They'd probably have a bunch of other corner pod jokes,

1230
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.880
<v 3>but they said it's great for the economy pay.
Everybody's making money.</v>

1231
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.600
<v 0>Oh,
it's unbelievable.
For the economy,</v>

1232
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.210
the and that's what that fat fuck from New Jersey,

1233
01:08:40.211 --> 01:08:44.380
the dummy that governor Chris Christie,
that fucking silly cunt.
He was like,

1234
01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:46.960
it'll never be there on my watch.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1235
01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:51.961
and he cites some unbelievably unscientific study that came out of some major

1236
01:08:52.811 --> 01:08:56.620
university,
which is like a headshot foundation.
I don't know what the study was,

1237
01:08:56.621 --> 01:08:59.590
but it was about abnormalities and a marijuana.

1238
01:08:59.591 --> 01:09:03.280
The abnormalities it causes in the brain.
What does that mean?
Well,

1239
01:09:03.281 --> 01:09:06.190
here's what it means.
What's normal?
Okay.

1240
01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:11.200
It just because something has a certain content in it or your mind reacts a

1241
01:09:11.201 --> 01:09:13.870
certain way without a drug,

1242
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:18.220
with the idea that that it changing being bad,

1243
01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:21.850
you would have to demonstrate that there's something wrong with the people that

1244
01:09:21.851 --> 01:09:23.380
it's changing.
Like what are you,

1245
01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:26.800
what are you demonstrating that shows that this abnormality isn't any way

1246
01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:30.040
detrimental?
Like what are you showing?
Like where all these people,

1247
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:30.851
they're smoking pot.

1248
01:09:30.851 --> 01:09:34.270
That of becoming shaking messages where all these people that are smoking pot,

1249
01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:39.540
millions upon millions upon millions of people are smoking pot on a daily basis.

1250
01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:44.380
Why is everybody,
are they falling apart?
Is everyone losing their job,

1251
01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.960
but if you're getting a drive,
are they looking at their phone going,

1252
01:09:46.961 --> 01:09:49.390
what the fuck is this?
You know,
this is not happening.

1253
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.790
You're not demonstrating any negative effects.

1254
01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:55.750
You're saying the study shows a negative effect.
No,
it doesn't.

1255
01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:57.130
This study shows a change.

1256
01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.690
<v 3>You can commission a study to say anything you want.</v>

1257
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.610
<v 0>Well,
when you look at the word,
the language in that study,</v>

1258
01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.860
it's not scientific at all.

1259
01:10:04.861 --> 01:10:08.760
The language is creepy because the language says in one of the quotes,

1260
01:10:08.761 --> 01:10:11.880
I'm paraphrasing it.
It was something along the lines of,
you know,

1261
01:10:11.881 --> 01:10:16.020
people that think that smoking pot,
even on a casual basis is,
is fine.

1262
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.540
This studies showing that it's not good at all.

1263
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:21.210
Like you can't say not good at all because you're not,

1264
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:25.080
you're not demonstrating not good.
When you're demonstrating is a change,

1265
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:29.910
guess what else changes your fucking personality,
your creativity,

1266
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:33.990
your compassion sex,
your sensitivity to sexual intercourse,

1267
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:38.400
the way food tastes in your mouth,
your way,
you view other people,

1268
01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:41.790
your senses going down.
There's a lot of things are going on.

1269
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:46.580
<v 3>Well these and these are the same people that will disagree with 98% of the</v>

1270
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:49.530
scientists around the world who say there's climate change.
Yeah.

1271
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:53.300
Then are hard studies with real numbers that are scientific.

1272
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.330
<v 0>Well,
this Chris Christie guys,
fat as fuck,</v>

1273
01:10:55.331 --> 01:10:57.760
which is one of the worst things you could be as a person if you want to be

1274
01:10:57.761 --> 01:11:01.360
healthy,
shows a lack of character.
It does.
It shows a lack of willpower.

1275
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:04.420
It shows a lack of focus and determination.
You look what do you,

1276
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:08.200
how do you view life and you,
you're going around in a sloppy meat wagon.

1277
01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:10.750
That's what you are.
You're,
you're not an athlete.

1278
01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:14.640
You're not someone that if you had a choice between being a person who respects

1279
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:15.930
their body and treats it well,

1280
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:20.910
or being a person that treats their body like a fucking big Mac dumpster once

1281
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:23.850
your choice,
well,
you went with big Mac dumpster.
Well guess what?

1282
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:26.550
You don't get to lead because you're not a leader.

1283
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:29.880
You don't get to decide what's healthy when you're walking around like

1284
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.690
[inaudible] you're going to have a heart attack.
Yeah.

1285
01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:36.300
I think there was a study that showed that people wouldn't vote for him because

1286
01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:38.460
they'd be afraid that he would die in office of a heart attack.

1287
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:42.300
He could die of sleep apnea for sure.
He has sleep apnea.
When you're that fat,

1288
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:45.330
you have sleep apnea.
Yeah,
he'd probably snores like how?

1289
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.540
I don't know if he sleeps with a seat CPAP machine.
If he does and he should.

1290
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.930
There's a lot of shit going on,
but there's,
that guy's probably got on diapers,

1291
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:56.000
a seed pack.
We Shane,
he's got a big Mac next to his bedside table.

1292
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.300
There's a diaper that they're selling now.
Totally.

1293
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.860
I'm told me Tara Gousha for as a lot of times a menu.
You fucker,

1294
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:04.740
you get a little drippage is a Tampon that you were at the front of your diaper

1295
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:08.550
cause your Dick leaks man and they're trying to sell it as like a normal thing.

1296
01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:11.670
Yeah.
I mean while it's this guy with this swollen,

1297
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:16.730
inflated gut filled with undigested food and feces that hasn't been pushed out

1298
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:19.500
yet.
Yeah.

1299
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.500
Fat that permeates all the different layers of his skin and tissue

1300
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:29.430
<v 1>muscle left under there.
The muscles are all gone.
I'm here to throw you.</v>

1301
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.990
Dick came broken.
I mean to tell you my Dick's leaking.
Trust me.

1302
01:12:33.991 --> 01:12:37.540
Just wear a Tampon.
Keep leading them.
Fucking meatball subs.
Volition.

1303
01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.400
Fuck girlish over here with these meatballs.

1304
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.200
Got me balls and saw they got Monica God.

1305
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.270
They got good at little peppers to get the good peppers they put on the top day

1306
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.220
society like my mother,
bless her soul.
God bless her.

1307
01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:55.230
She died of a heart attack at 51 she weighed 300 pounds.

1308
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.750
He's the guy driving the truck that beeped at me.

1309
01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:02.990
Fucking God got ahead and make back,
Eh,
I got my fucking peppers.
She,

1310
01:13:02.991 --> 01:13:06.780
I got my meatballs.
I know when I walk my,

1311
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:10.260
the fat on my feet spills over the outside of my sneakers.

1312
01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:15.180
I like how that looks like a little waterfall into my heel who have my step
down.

1313
01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.260
Just who's over rolls over.
I liked,

1314
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:23.580
I liked the wattle cause my fucking guns,
my gun sticking out.

1315
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:28.260
My legs can't stay the way the back of my head looks to the hot dog roll.
Look,

1316
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:33.010
I look fat sausages that are grown out of the base of my skull.
Just you.

1317
01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.320
It looks like it makes you hungry for the fucking,

1318
01:13:35.321 --> 01:13:39.520
the either the fucking nice assume sausage.

1319
01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.400
I like,
look at my face.
You see a wrinkle in my face.

1320
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.490
You see any spider mocks by my eyes?
Fuck no,

1321
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:51.210
because the flesh is pushing out against the skin all the time.

1322
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.390
It's pulled tight.
It makes me look young and vibrant.

1323
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.180
Look at my Chin's tight.
All of them

1324
01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.490
<v 0>I had to do to told me that that was William Shaffner's.</v>

1325
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:03.690
William Soccer for said this to him.
He said,
uh,
he goes,
wow.

1326
01:14:03.691 --> 01:14:06.330
He was interviewing them and we're shocked.
Apparently he's like 80 years old.

1327
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.370
And he goes,
you look great.
And he said,
well,

1328
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:12.340
I realized that a certain year that if I just put on five pounds a year,

1329
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.640
I never get really wrinkly because my face is like pushing fat out.
Right?
Like,

1330
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.120
and he goes,
I'm serious.
Like apparently like he,

1331
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:23.740
it was a strategy to like to stay young looking like,
but keeping your fake.

1332
01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:27.580
But I don't think you're supposed to be that fat when you're 80 I think that's

1333
01:14:27.581 --> 01:14:28.960
like super bad for you.
Right.

1334
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.460
<v 2>That's just bullshit.
Like cause he's fat.
He's just made that shit.
Right.</v>

1335
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:36.380
He's working backwards.
But it is true.
If you'll get older fat people,

1336
01:14:36.381 --> 01:14:39.500
they look way better than fat joggers or then older joggers.
No,

1337
01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:43.430
I started running two years ago and I lost weight in my face and now I look like

1338
01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:46.670
a fucking skull.
I take my hat,
I looked like a look at this.

1339
01:14:46.671 --> 01:14:49.190
When I tell you I had,
I looked like a light bulb.
There's no,

1340
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.640
the light hits it and there's just like a,

1341
01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:55.640
I just all my face and sunken and you liked it better when you have like a

1342
01:14:55.641 --> 01:14:58.830
little plump edge.
I wasn't even plugged,
but this is like,
Eh,

1343
01:14:58.831 --> 01:15:00.110
it received at my chin.

1344
01:15:00.111 --> 01:15:04.190
Looks like it's sticking out and I don't know how to put weight on in my face.

1345
01:15:04.191 --> 01:15:06.140
You know?
That's once it's gone,
it's gone.

1346
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.430
<v 0>Yeah.
That's the thing that happens with a women.</v>

1347
01:15:08.431 --> 01:15:12.000
They get fat injections in their face because you're,
as you get older,

1348
01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:15.660
you're thin.
You tend to thin out in the face makes a lot of,

1349
01:15:15.661 --> 01:15:19.010
I'm not like the way that looks.
So they get those crazy fillers too.

1350
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.750
You see the fillers now?
Ooh,

1351
01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.140
that's a regretful decision that they decided to do this.
It's not silicon.

1352
01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:28.350
It's like actual tissue.
What it is man.
I mean sometimes they do,

1353
01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:29.820
they do do it with fat,

1354
01:15:29.821 --> 01:15:34.210
but they use artificial fillers on their faces and when they use filler it,

1355
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:38.190
you've given this like pull up some images to try to be kind.

1356
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:41.520
Some find one that has a woman's face blacked out or something,

1357
01:15:41.521 --> 01:15:44.130
so we don't have to mock her.
But these poor people,
they,

1358
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:49.020
they go to these doctors and they get this stuff injected in their face and it

1359
01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:50.610
makes it look like someone beat them up,

1360
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:55.660
like their cheek start puffing out and the cheek puffing out look sort of like

1361
01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:59.280
diminishes wrinkles and it gives us like fuller effect,

1362
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.350
but it looks so monster life.
Yeah.

1363
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.920
There's a lady at my daughter's school and she seems to be in real nice lady,
but

1364
01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.470
<v 2>oh,
that's a bad example.</v>

1365
01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.200
<v 0>That's a lady who did it at seven 11 yeah,
that's about,</v>

1366
01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.900
that's someone who did it badly.
I was wondering like,
you know

1367
01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.400
<v 2>if you're married and you get a face lift or a boob job,</v>

1368
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:24.450
you really just think like you get ready to leave your husband because he

1369
01:16:24.451 --> 01:16:25.410
doesn't give a fuck.

1370
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.610
<v 0>I bet he gives a fuck.
Maybe he wants to.
Maybe it's a woman's idea.</v>

1371
01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.120
Maybe it's the man's idea.
You know,
every,
every situation is different,

1372
01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:35.530
but some guys get psyched.
It's like,
Hey,
my wife could have booked Jeff.

1373
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:40.310
I want to see a picture.
Big Touch.
No fucker.
You want to fuck.

1374
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:44.300
Come on Bro.
Fuck my wife.
Come on.
It's the way that juicy Posey,

1375
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.610
she had a couple of babies but they tied it up nicely.

1376
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.230
<v 2>Tighten up the under carriage.</v>

1377
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.460
We tossed a little bit of a silicon down on the taint strip cause all your

1378
01:16:52.461 --> 01:16:54.970
before and after.
I feels like a baby's fist.

1379
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:58.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Let's not show this poor woman.
I don't,
that's not a good example either.</v>

1380
01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:01.640
<v 2>Some people really get away with it like,
I don't know.
I have no idea.</v>

1381
01:17:01.641 --> 01:17:04.520
Found generous.
Got a work done,
but she looks,

1382
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.090
can you pull up a before or after on Ellen?
I don't know if she's doing exercise.

1383
01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.220
They're taking vitamins,
whatever it is.
Her face

1384
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.870
<v 1>looks 20 years younger than it used still.
It's called having $1 billion.</v>

1385
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.090
Yeah,
yeah.
I'm sure.

1386
01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:20.390
Probably as doctors injecting fetus cells into her body on a daily basis,

1387
01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.840
any of that kind of cash fetus cells she had.

1388
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:28.310
So she had some house that she just sold recently.
The,
you know,

1389
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:31.160
it was like on a website that showed the house like,
oh my God,

1390
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.590
so fucking $28 million house was,

1391
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:37.790
she bought Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's house.
They built it and then they,

1392
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:42.410
uh,
which,
which she used to,
now that's not the example,
Brian.
He just nailed it.

1393
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.740
Wow.
Look what she used to look like.
That was crazy.

1394
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:48.350
But the one on the right would still be the before.

1395
01:17:48.351 --> 01:17:52.940
There's an after that shows her face much more filled out.
Uh,
less,

1396
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:56.410
less deep lines.
Um,

1397
01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.470
do you worked for her to avid say the first two years of the show,

1398
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:04.390
what was that large?
I won four Emmy's.
That's really good.

1399
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:06.640
Yeah.
What was it like though working there?

1400
01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.640
The Emmy's or a heavy and they're gold says my name on them.

1401
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:18.480
Hmm.
I understand.
Made a lot of money.
I was on daily,

1402
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:23.180
probably was,
I know he's a superhero,
is that right?
Yeah,
I was just up as,
uh,

1403
01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:23.651
they,
they,

1404
01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:26.570
they just grabbed people off of this park bench and they were like meet at this

1405
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.590
park bench,
hang out on park.
And I was,
I was just,
I was in Burbank.

1406
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.460
They filmed me in Burbank and uh,
I was driving and just when Twitter first,

1407
01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:38.030
she first got on Twitter and she tweeted something like egg meet,

1408
01:18:38.031 --> 01:18:41.360
meet at this bench in the next five minutes,
dresses up as a superhero.

1409
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:44.810
So I was driving and I'm like,
that's the binge and why was driving by,

1410
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:47.840
so I just like pulled over real quick and like tried to make something out of

1411
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:49.010
shit that I had in my car.

1412
01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.740
And so I just dressed up in all blue and light blue scrubs.

1413
01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:54.860
It was my girlfriend girlfriend's like,
er scrubs shit.

1414
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:59.620
And I made myself look like the blue guy from a,
what's that movie?
Avatar?
No,

1415
01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:02.500
the doctor.
Manhattan.
Yeah,
the watchman.

1416
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.200
Now I even had a dick also cause I had a sleeve.
Where did you get the deck?

1417
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.100
I had a sleep.

1418
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:13.140
I had a sleeve put like a pillow in it to make it look like a dick.

1419
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:17.280
So I like like walked out with like a fake Dick.
It's tiny.
You got on TV?
Yeah.

1420
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:19.210
Very creative.
When you consider the fuck is,

1421
01:19:19.211 --> 01:19:22.300
this was all constructed based on things that he had the sliding around in his

1422
01:19:22.301 --> 01:19:25.800
car,
right?
Yeah.
Use Condoms.
Starbucks cut the shows.

1423
01:19:25.801 --> 01:19:29.680
A level of commitment that neither you nor I would have because what's the big,

1424
01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:33.790
what's the pay off?
No pay off.
He gets to meet Ellen.

1425
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:39.900
Did you see the new video of Rob Ford got busted smoking crack again?
No,

1426
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.060
he's going to rehab now.
We've got busted.
Slept in the commitment.

1427
01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:49.950
I love the commitment of a drug deal or video tapes him.
Oh

1428
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:52.211
yeah,

1429
01:19:52.211 --> 01:19:56.800
she goes dancing and then she's talking about how I just got Twitter and then

1430
01:19:56.801 --> 01:20:00.710
I'm sitting at this,
hey,
why is she wearing a tie?
There's,
I like to wear ties.

1431
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.290
I friends with this guy also,
but she's a woman,
but she's a lesbian.

1432
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:07.120
Oh,
you didn't know that.

1433
01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:10.980
There's now big stupid Dick that's,
you

1434
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:17.670
have to go back pillow.
I'm such a terrible a superhero.

1435
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.010
That's the dumbest superhero ever actually get to meet her in person though.

1436
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:23.460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1437
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.340
And she showed me a bunch of presence and when we were on the whole episode,

1438
01:20:26.341 --> 01:20:29.420
like she kept on going back to us and wow.
Yeah,

1439
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:33.630
she does have a tie on just like at God.
That's weird.
I still have that shirt,

1440
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.930
my tweets or what does the shirt say?
Oh that's cool.

1441
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:41.880
<v 3>Great.
As a,
we did this thing for Christmas,
the 12 days of Christmas.</v>

1442
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.390
And so they would kind of like Oprah.
Like you get a car and you get a car.

1443
01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:49.620
But every day for like 30 days leading up to Christmas,

1444
01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.630
they gave the audience something huge.

1445
01:20:51.631 --> 01:20:55.690
And so as a producer we got whatever it was every day.

1446
01:20:55.691 --> 01:20:59.220
So one day I'd come home with like a Dyson vacuum cleaner.

1447
01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.810
The next day was like a Posturepedic mattress.
Uh,
you know,

1448
01:21:03.811 --> 01:21:07.650
it was like crazy big gifts.
You know,
at the time an iPod was a big deal.

1449
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:12.080
They had just come out,
you got iPods one day,
fucking TV set the next.

1450
01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:16.990
<v 1>Wow,
that's crazy.
Yeah.
There's a lot of Schwag promoting stuff on television.</v>

1451
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:20.320
Like if you're on television and you're promoting items,

1452
01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:23.860
like to think of the impact that must have to have your product on the pipe,

1453
01:21:23.890 --> 01:21:25.360
the prices,
right.
Or something like that.

1454
01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.480
That's what people understand with product placement.
It's like,
you know,

1455
01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:32.000
people probably send you shit.
Right.
And you talk about it on your shell.
Yeah,

1456
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.411
definitely.

1457
01:21:32.411 --> 01:21:35.440
I mean think about what that's worth you talking about something on the shell.

1458
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.840
More people should send you stuff.
No,
I'm sending it out right now.

1459
01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.440
Laying around here.
Yeah,
there's too much stuff,

1460
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:43.780
but it's nice to be able to help people to look.

1461
01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:46.270
You find out about something that you really liked get to.
Yeah.

1462
01:21:46.271 --> 01:21:47.900
This dude is down in,
um,

1463
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.660
Chile and they're taking this so much plastic and the,
uh,
in the ocean.

1464
01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:56.530
And so they're taking it all and a fisherman,
a lot of it is fish,
fish nets,

1465
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.860
fishermen's nets,
and they take it and recycle it and making it a skateboards.

1466
01:21:59.861 --> 01:22:01.800
And now they're,
they're selling them all over the country.
So yeah.

1467
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.780
<v 3>Dude's gonna come in,
he's sending me escape you,</v>

1468
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:07.200
me and my son make skateboards together.
So he heard about that.
So He's,

1469
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.870
he's sending me a bunch and then he's going to come in and do the show.

1470
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:11.600
He's doing a tour of the U s selling escape.

1471
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:14.420
<v 1>So how do they,
how do they extract it from the ocean?</v>

1472
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.200
The fishermen collect it and bring it into the guy.
Oh,
that's a good move.

1473
01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:20.460
You make it worth something like Cam.
Right.
Thanks.

1474
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:24.860
That's actually probably the smartest move when it comes to figuring out how to

1475
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:27.590
do that garbage patch in the middle of the Pacific.

1476
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.240
Because if they can make it so that it's like a recyclable,
like,
you know,

1477
01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:34.400
just like cans are worth x amount of dollars.

1478
01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.520
If you could bring in x amount of plastic waste and then companies would want to

1479
01:22:40.071 --> 01:22:41.210
develop some sort of a,

1480
01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:45.980
that's like here's $1 billion worth of plastic waste just floating around the

1481
01:22:45.981 --> 01:22:48.920
ocean.
If you can figure out how to extract it,
you could profit.

1482
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:53.030
So I might spend millions to try to extract billions.
Right,
right.

1483
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:56.600
And it's um,
it's also like a,

1484
01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:00.350
how do you get people to,
I think it's the iPhones,

1485
01:23:00.351 --> 01:23:01.880
they have a covering on the,

1486
01:23:01.881 --> 01:23:05.500
on the face of it that's titanium or it's some kind of metal that's really

1487
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:06.070
precious

1488
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.480
<v 2>that in Africa it's another one.</v>

1489
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:09.460
He sinks where there is mines where people are killing me.

1490
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.970
<v 0>Java think to think of a coal town.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
it's a,</v>

1491
01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:17.500
it's a conductivity,
uh,
item,
I think aids and conductivity.

1492
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.510
It's inside the actual phone itself.

1493
01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.520
<v 2>Yeah.
They need,
they need a better program to recycle phones.</v>

1494
01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:23.990
A lot of them are getting thrown out.

1495
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:26.090
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
but you're right man.</v>

1496
01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:29.540
They also need another way to do it when they don't have to use these conflict

1497
01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:32.460
minerals.
Yeah.
There's a phone that they came out with,

1498
01:23:32.461 --> 01:23:35.780
so it's like a Karma free phone.
Like that was what we call that.

1499
01:23:35.781 --> 01:23:37.610
We started calling the Karma free phone.
But what was it?

1500
01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:39.650
What's the name of that phone?
It did come out.

1501
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:43.790
<v 2>Well,
why don't you look it up?
It was,
she'd make a flip phone out of it.</v>

1502
01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.610
<v 0>Well it was that make a flip phone.
There was a,</v>

1503
01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:51.020
there was a phone that it came out like a year ago,

1504
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:53.600
but the issue about it was that it was only three g.

1505
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:57.620
It wasn't four g.
L t e people like,

1506
01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.340
well I want Karma but I want

1507
01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:03.570
<v 2>get my email really quick.
Anything,
man.</v>

1508
01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:07.740
It's so funny.
It is funny.
Yeah.
I mean we want,

1509
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:11.250
we want it all.
We can't take a step back.
It's,

1510
01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:15.900
it's crazy and I get caught up in it.
I get all the latest shit.

1511
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:20.150
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a,
that's a good one though.
That's a good one because it was like,</v>

1512
01:24:20.151 --> 01:24:22.910
it was almost like a test for the human race.
You know,

1513
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:27.080
it's a great android phone.
It's very beautiful.
It's kind of Nice screen,

1514
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:28.820
but it only has three j what?

1515
01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:33.830
<v 2>Eh,
I mean that one that they make with babies and isn't that amazing?</v>

1516
01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:37.310
Because it was personal in your life.
If somebody said,
if you do x,

1517
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.100
your child will be killed.
Or if you do x,
uh,

1518
01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.060
somebody's going to get their arm cut off by the John Jewy somewhere in the

1519
01:24:44.061 --> 01:24:47.060
Congo to get it,
then you wouldn't do it.
But,

1520
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.250
but somehow because it's far away place,

1521
01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:52.760
we don't take the exact connection that we know about that.

1522
01:24:52.761 --> 01:24:53.930
If you buy this product,

1523
01:24:53.931 --> 01:24:57.440
you're supporting this and somehow it doesn't mean anything to us.

1524
01:24:57.710 --> 01:24:58.820
I'm talking about myself.

1525
01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.570
<v 0>No tool.
Almost everybody.
If it's not as good,
you don't care.
You're like,
fuck,</v>

1526
01:25:03.571 --> 01:25:05.370
I don't want the best shit.
I've always had the best shit.

1527
01:25:05.371 --> 01:25:08.080
The Best Shit's always what I've been reaching for right now.

1528
01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:11.050
The best shifts here,
and there's this new thing,
it's called a Fairphone.

1529
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:13.110
Once you play the video because they have a video on their website.

1530
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:16.980
<v 2>Do you think that if you knew that every time you masturbated,</v>

1531
01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:19.950
you would lose 10 minutes from your life?

1532
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:24.090
Do you think you would stop masturbating or would you do it in a controlled way

1533
01:25:24.091 --> 01:25:25.380
or would you just say,
fuck it?

1534
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:29.810
<v 0>I think you'd say fog it cause your life without masturbating would be so</v>

1535
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.540
frustrating.
It's like whatever,
10 minutes you give up,

1536
01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:34.460
it's a lot of 10 minutes in a day.
I mean,

1537
01:25:34.461 --> 01:25:37.550
if you're a maniac and you jerk off every day,
five times a day,

1538
01:25:37.551 --> 01:25:38.540
you're gonna have a real problem.

1539
01:25:38.541 --> 01:25:42.260
But if you're one of those once every few day guy,
yeah.
What are you giving up?

1540
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.450
Giving up 30 minutes a month?
Who gives a shit

1541
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.130
<v 2>30 this year?
What is it?</v>

1542
01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:51.110
<v 4>Same.
But what we don't have</v>

1543
01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.233
<v 0>a clue</v>

1544
01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:55.320
<v 4>about what's inside this stuff.</v>

1545
01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:59.190
We don't know where it comes from or who made it.

1546
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.890
We know almost nothing about our stuff.

1547
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.650
That's why we started with an alternative for the thing.
We can't live without

1548
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:14.680
our phone.
We the people their phone

1549
01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.710
today and this,

1550
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:26.240
this is what we're building
a smart is on the phones,

1551
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.410
but fan,
which makes it more than a photo.

1552
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:34.430
It's a beginning step in the right direction and we're making it happen.

1553
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:39.350
A small phone.
This made in a way that puts people and environment.
Yeah,

1554
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.440
they looked happy.
We'll already working hard on the first batch.

1555
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.990
We're much there unless way you come in,
just don't making them.

1556
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:52.100
We need you to preorder.
It caused what?

1557
01:26:52.101 --> 01:26:53.420
Buying and owning this phone,

1558
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.200
you can make a difference and you become a part of change by or five stalls and

1559
01:27:00.071 --> 01:27:02.110
movement at Fairfield,
fine.com

1560
01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.630
<v 1>it sounds like a good idea.
However,</v>

1561
01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:07.360
you're not getting my money before I see your fucking product.
Yeah.

1562
01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:10.210
I want it reviewed before I buy it.
It's going to suck.

1563
01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.000
I'm not going to Kickstarter my fucking life.

1564
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:15.340
You know like your whole life depends on your phone.

1565
01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:18.280
They're going to use the android operating system,

1566
01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:21.100
which is no nice and established and it works and everything like that.

1567
01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:24.250
But I need to know that it's not just a terrible,

1568
01:27:24.251 --> 01:27:27.820
horrible piece of shit before I give you to make a prototype and put it out to

1569
01:27:27.821 --> 01:27:31.030
the reviewers so they can let me know if it's worth your money.
Yeah.

1570
01:27:31.031 --> 01:27:35.440
And you also like this,
the reason why people invest in companies,

1571
01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.180
like you bring in investors,

1572
01:27:37.181 --> 01:27:40.450
you don't get it from white getting it Kickstarter style for a phone.

1573
01:27:40.451 --> 01:27:45.130
That's just,
that's not a smart thing for a person who invest in.
Right.
I mean,

1574
01:27:45.131 --> 01:27:48.490
I guess the thinking behind it might be if a corporation comes in and they're

1575
01:27:48.491 --> 01:27:52.150
going to demand that you use those metals because they want the pricing as low

1576
01:27:52.151 --> 01:27:56.800
as possible and you know,
uh,
but if you would,
they definitely though,
I mean,

1577
01:27:56.801 --> 01:27:57.401
does it seem,

1578
01:27:57.401 --> 01:28:01.270
it doesn't seem like to me that it's impossible to find an ethical company,

1579
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.810
right?

1580
01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:04.650
There's companies out there that would look at what they're doing and say this,

1581
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.840
love it.
I mean,
I'm watching the commercial,
I'm like,
I love this.
It makes,

1582
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.050
it makes you feel good.
I mean,
I want to buy shit that makes me feel good.

1583
01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:13.340
I think a lot of people respond to that now.
Yeah.

1584
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.130
I wonder if it's all conflict free too.
I wonder if they use Colton.
I wonder,

1585
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.380
you know,
it said titanium and aluminum conflict free.
Right?
That's what one said.

1586
01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:26.920
It's,
it's well,
even if it's a step in the right direction,
it's worth it.
Yeah.

1587
01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:29.500
Well,
it's nice that people are thinking that way.
They,
they also,

1588
01:28:29.501 --> 01:28:31.360
and they also realize that there's a market for it.

1589
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:34.600
That's the other thing that's nice is it blew people away with the Prius.

1590
01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:38.590
They had no idea it would be as successful as it was.
People felt good buying it.

1591
01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:42.880
I drive one and I hate it.
I want a Mustang and a half to drive.

1592
01:28:42.881 --> 01:28:45.850
My car wins.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll drive around the neighborhood.

1593
01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:50.050
Go really fast after this.
Yes.
Yes.
It'll change.

1594
01:28:50.051 --> 01:28:53.790
Your life is going to be awkward if I get an erection while we're driving.
No,
no,

1595
01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:56.600
no.
I'll be fine.
Just don't beat off on my dashboard.
Show.

1596
01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:59.740
Take care of that direction.
Yeah.
I'll just handle it for you,
my friend.

1597
01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.980
This is going to be a good ride.
I had a buddy jerked his

1598
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.880
<v 0>dog off,
jerked his dog off with his foot and I go,
why?
He goes,</v>

1599
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:06.840
because he needs relief.

1600
01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.830
See what the dog would lie on its back and he'd put his foot on the dog's Dick

1601
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:14.060
and go like this and it talks Dick and talk.
It's squirt all over his stomach.

1602
01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:17.080
<v 2>You don't talk to this friend anymore?
I hope.
No.
Well,</v>

1603
01:29:17.081 --> 01:29:19.930
you know what's amazing about that is it's illegal.

1604
01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:23.740
Even though the dog like my dog,
every time I pet my dog,

1605
01:29:23.741 --> 01:29:27.430
he tries to put his dick in my hand.
So who's the victim?

1606
01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:32.050
Who's the victim and the crime?
Is it illegal to jerk your dog?
Fuck yeah.

1607
01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:38.120
Yeah.
It's okay to finger,
but you can't jerk it off
now.

1608
01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:40.360
But that which means I was thinking about this.

1609
01:29:40.361 --> 01:29:44.020
It means that if there's a law against jerking off your dog,

1610
01:29:44.021 --> 01:29:49.021
that means that some congressmen stood on the floor and said he proposed a bill

1611
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:53.390
saying you can't jerk off your dog and every other congress and looked down and

1612
01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:56.950
went,
just guys.
Jared got off his dog.
Yeah,
this guys angry.

1613
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:59.710
He's angry at his own instincts.

1614
01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.790
It's the only way he thinks he can stop is if there's a law against it.
Crazy.

1615
01:30:03.791 --> 01:30:05.680
Son of a bitch.
What are you trying to call?

1616
01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:09.160
Did you hear about that?

1617
01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:14.140
<v 0>Can KKK guy who,
uh,
who's,
I think he's one of the ones that just shot up a,</v>

1618
01:30:14.141 --> 01:30:15.250
a school recently.

1619
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:19.560
It turned out that they had busted him years back with a male prostitute of

1620
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:21.970
black male prostitutes.
Wow.

1621
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:26.290
And he's like this anti gay K K K cat,

1622
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:30.050
<v 2>probably all about family because the KKK is all about family.
They'll tell you,</v>

1623
01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:35.020
<v 0>this is so many people that are like that,
just angry at it because they're,</v>

1624
01:30:35.021 --> 01:30:38.900
it's in their system when they're just fighting it.
They're fighting off the gay.

1625
01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.360
Are they fighting off the wanting to fuck dogs?

1626
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.430
<v 2>Right.
It is</v>

1627
01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:48.740
<v 0>busted with black male prostitute,
Grand Dragon.</v>

1628
01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:53.050
He killed three people outside of the Jewish center in Kansas and they turned

1629
01:30:53.051 --> 01:30:54.230
out to not even be Jewish.

1630
01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.120
<v 2>So he failed on three counts.
Number one,</v>

1631
01:30:58.330 --> 01:31:02.290
he didn't even kill the people who supposed to hate number two,
he's fucking,

1632
01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:05.890
he's not,
he could have been a hero if he'd shot real Jewish people,

1633
01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.550
but then he would have been rejected because then all his brother is the KKK.

1634
01:31:09.551 --> 01:31:12.220
Know that he was fucking a black male prostitute.

1635
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:15.930
<v 0>Well now they know but he's going to say that that's just propaganda.</v>

1636
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:18.990
That's what it is.
The government

1637
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:22.630
<v 2>gay star is going to say this is the best website ever.
What</v>

1638
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:29.110
you should do a segment on your show where every episode you check in on the top

1639
01:31:29.111 --> 01:31:32.590
stories on Gay Star News.
I'm for it.
It's pretty smart.

1640
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.060
That will be funny on a podcast to find some really obscure specific website and

1641
01:31:39.521 --> 01:31:43.270
just check on it every week.
You know like uh,
like a,

1642
01:31:43.271 --> 01:31:45.520
you know tulip growers.com

1643
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:48.130
<v 0>we'd have to be careful with what you promote though.</v>

1644
01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:52.120
Cause if you gay star news.com turned out to be like propaganda,

1645
01:31:52.121 --> 01:31:56.920
like the onion for gay news turned out to be satire and means satire.

1646
01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.190
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's that.
There's so of these fake news

1647
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.270
<v 2>websites I hate like there's that Joe Rogan one that got banned from the UFC</v>

1648
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:06.670
cause you failed your drug test that's going around right now that everyone

1649
01:32:06.671 --> 01:32:07.340
thinks it's real.

1650
01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Everyone thinks it's real.</v>

1651
01:32:08.811 --> 01:32:12.590
So much so that a friend of mine sent me a text saying how much it was bullshit.

1652
01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:15.260
Like this is crazy.
They're out of their mind.
Oh God.

1653
01:32:15.261 --> 01:32:19.600
The guy came up that idea got fired.
Like,
oh Christ,
what is it?

1654
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.610
There's a website that made a parody.

1655
01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:27.530
Things saying that I got drug tested at the UFC and I failed my drug test,

1656
01:32:27.531 --> 01:32:29.690
so they suspended me.
Oh no shit.

1657
01:32:29.691 --> 01:32:33.410
And then they fired the guy who came up with the idea to drug test me.

1658
01:32:33.411 --> 01:32:36.110
He's now fired.
Like the whole thing is so stupid.
It's all fake.

1659
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.270
It's someone just made it up.
But it's not even funny.

1660
01:32:38.271 --> 01:32:40.040
It's like that's the thing that people are doing these days.

1661
01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:43.250
They just make up stories like the onion.
We'll make something up.

1662
01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:46.400
But it would be so ridiculous that it's funny.
Yeah,
but these,

1663
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:49.340
these guys aren't doing that.
They're just making up stories.

1664
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:53.030
It's like they call themselves,
they call themselves a parody website,

1665
01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:55.010
but most people don't realize the parody website.

1666
01:32:55.011 --> 01:32:58.280
So even if it says in a disclaimer,
you know,
everything on this side,

1667
01:32:58.281 --> 01:32:58.980
it's full of shit.

1668
01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:02.630
Even it says that you don't read that you read the fucking story because you get

1669
01:33:02.631 --> 01:33:05.420
a link to the stories.
Right.
Click on the link,
you go to it,
you go,
oh my God,

1670
01:33:05.421 --> 01:33:07.690
I can't believe they would do this.
You send it to a million other people.

1671
01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:11.040
They sent it to a million people.
You read it on your phone.
You're at,
at the

1672
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.520
<v 2>getting the context of it.
You're never seeing the disclaimer.
Exactly.</v>

1673
01:33:14.521 --> 01:33:18.060
If somebody googles Joe Rogan and UFC that might lead them to that,

1674
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.440
right to the article.

1675
01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.910
<v 0>Probably been seen by hundreds of thousands of people already,</v>

1676
01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:25.420
Christ and passed on.
I mean,
it hit me on Twitter.

1677
01:33:25.421 --> 01:33:29.350
Who knows how many times it makes it into the mainstream press in anyone?
No,
no,

1678
01:33:29.351 --> 01:33:33.730
no,
no.
It's,
it's pretty obvious.
I'll do it.
I mean,
they have been duped before,

1679
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:35.950
right.
You know,
where people didn't do their due diligence,

1680
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:38.920
but I think the mainstream press is a little bit more aware of that now.

1681
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:42.220
So they'll go and look at the source and then say,
Oh look,
this is a parody site.

1682
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.020
Yeah.
People look for a parody site.
Like right away now,
but they,
CNN

1683
01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.910
<v 2>duped.
It seems like weekly they get fucking caught on something.</v>

1684
01:33:49.911 --> 01:33:51.730
I remember I went to Boston bombing.

1685
01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.610
Remember they pointed out and the suspect who was not a suspect and people

1686
01:33:55.611 --> 01:33:59.930
surrounded his house and his name is probably still shit because people won't

1687
01:33:59.931 --> 01:34:03.140
even forget.
They'll forget that it wasn't right.

1688
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:06.720
<v 0>Right.
Like you remember that guy,
the Atlanta bomber,
the Olympic bomber.
Yeah.</v>

1689
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.190
I didn't do anything and they accused him of it.
He was a security guard.

1690
01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:12.530
They might get ruined,
ruined him,
ruined them.

1691
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:16.960
And they must trust that guy got because of that hate that guy got because of

1692
01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:20.840
that must've been unbearable.
Everywhere you go,
people think you're a terrorist.

1693
01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:23.150
You're getting death threats on a regular basis.

1694
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:26.090
Some dude is in his car right now loading up his gun,

1695
01:34:26.091 --> 01:34:30.210
driving from Louisiana to your house,
cause he wants to defend America.
Right.

1696
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.750
He knows where it is.
I know where that mother fucker lives.

1697
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.740
It's time to rock and roll and fucking gets in his car and starts driving.

1698
01:34:36.741 --> 01:34:40.240
You cause of cause of seeing him.
What's he listening to on the radio right?

1699
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.830
I love
food and

1700
01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.430
I'm driving over poop.
Andrew Orleans width on the wheel bearing down

1701
01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:53.130
<v 2>Kevin Meeney right after nine 11 he was the airport in San Francisco with his</v>

1702
01:34:53.131 --> 01:34:57.260
wife and kid and like his daughter ran through airport security and she was

1703
01:34:57.261 --> 01:34:57.561
young.

1704
01:34:57.561 --> 01:35:02.510
She was like three and he went to go get her and the police grabbed him and he

1705
01:35:02.511 --> 01:35:06.080
struggled and he got arrested and got into the press that he was and you got to

1706
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:08.630
remember how sensitive this was.
It got,
you know,

1707
01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:13.550
they wrote it that he was like fucking with airport security and he got blown

1708
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.540
up.
It was fucking brutal.
It was all all over the news.

1709
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:20.150
You don't remember that.
I remember that.
Now that you bring it up.

1710
01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.130
<v 0>Yeah,
that was crazy.
The airport security,</v>

1711
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:26.550
you can get really wacky with the rules and you know,

1712
01:35:26.551 --> 01:35:28.960
the not understanding that it's a fucking three year old,

1713
01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:30.570
the most ridiculous thing ever.

1714
01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:32.970
Like you're going to try a person with three year old's not going to be a

1715
01:35:32.971 --> 01:35:36.180
terrorist.
You dip shit.
They,
the average person with three year old,

1716
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.800
three year olds saying,
Daddy,
is that Daddy?
Yeah.
Relax,
relax.

1717
01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:43.630
Let the guy go back through.
Everything's going to be fine.
Yeah.

1718
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:48.220
<v 2>Well it's,
you know,
it's,
it's getting to the point where they,
there's,</v>

1719
01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:50.260
you gotta have some profiling.
I mean,

1720
01:35:50.261 --> 01:35:54.160
that's why ll the Israeli airlines never had a terrorist strike because why

1721
01:35:54.161 --> 01:35:55.420
don't we follow their methods,

1722
01:35:55.421 --> 01:35:59.050
which is take a look at situations like that and put it lower on the priorities

1723
01:35:59.051 --> 01:36:02.980
and then take people like yourself with a shaved head.
It's kind of bulky.

1724
01:36:02.981 --> 01:36:07.270
You've got that look in your eye and a swat you down,
you know,
get it.

1725
01:36:07.271 --> 01:36:08.500
Get a cavity search going.

1726
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:11.170
<v 0>I think it's the same thing that leads people to shoot dogs.</v>

1727
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.390
It's just an abuse of power situation.
You know?

1728
01:36:13.391 --> 01:36:15.490
It's the same thing where they know they can get away with it.

1729
01:36:15.491 --> 01:36:19.510
So they do it and they're frustrated and that role,
just look at it.

1730
01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.130
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1731
01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.520
<v 0>Yes.</v>

1732
01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:29.150
They're patting down these little kids combing through the hair.
Look,

1733
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:33.860
they're looking in the hair.
That's not real.
It's totally real.
So 100% real.

1734
01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:34.250
They do do.

1735
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:37.640
<v 2>They're grabbing her ass.
Yeah.
They have to make sure it's a real ass.</v>

1736
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.860
It could be a bomb.
Holy Shit.
Look at that.
They're touching.

1737
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:44.660
Are they Middle Eastern?
Is that why they're doing it?
Who knows?

1738
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:48.440
They look kind of Middle East.
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Wow.

1739
01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.480
People are fucking crazy.

1740
01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.080
<v 0>And I'm glad people make this.</v>

1741
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:57.760
<v 2>Yeah.
That,
that parents supposedly did this,
uh,
filmed it of the two.</v>

1742
01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:02.330
These two kids going on forever.
I've never know.

1743
01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.870
So stupid.
Shut it off,
man.
It's making me,
so usually they just grab,

1744
01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.990
they don't grab your Dick,
but they touch you.
And then they go to the,

1745
01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:14.790
they just graze the size of your penis on the front of your leg to make sure

1746
01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:19.250
it's on a bullet.
You think my penis looks like a bullet missile.

1747
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.580
I like a missile.
Right,
right,
right.

1748
01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.860
<v 0>No little bullet.
No,
no.</v>

1749
01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:26.690
Like I'll fucking go fucking sausage

1750
01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.420
for the feast.
San Genero.
You know,

1751
01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:34.980
we'd go down a little bit when we get the fucking sausage,
the sausage,

1752
01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.520
they put the peppers,
you know,

1753
01:37:36.521 --> 01:37:40.630
they got the moon Yeesh and they thought the bread they use,

1754
01:37:40.631 --> 01:37:44.070
it's like a mama used to meg.
What they used to fax your back.

1755
01:37:44.071 --> 01:37:47.860
A Moblers thrown though.
You went with Youso fashion.
Do you remember that?

1756
01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:52.330
Fucking that festivals engineer but was on my block.
I lived on Mulberry Street.

1757
01:37:52.331 --> 01:37:56.010
That's right.
People to send in my lobby.
I was like,
I can't believe this crazy

1758
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.250
<v 3>asshole lives here.
Right.
You lived like in the heart of little Italy.</v>

1759
01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:03.240
Right in between Prince and spring on a five story walk up with John.

1760
01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.690
Why did you choose to live there?
What was that about?
Well,
you remember,
uh,

1761
01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.070
Paul Lyons,
comedian,
Paul Lyons,
his guy who had,
he had an opening,

1762
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.520
I was moving to New York and he said,
this is a,
I can sublet my,
my unit.

1763
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:15.510
And I moved,

1764
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.090
I moved in there for three months and I fell in love with the neighborhood.

1765
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:19.290
I was all like,
you know,

1766
01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:23.160
everyone knew each other and everybody was a character and I met a couple of

1767
01:38:23.161 --> 01:38:27.090
Nice people in the building.
So place opened up next door and it was a,

1768
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:31.440
it was a one bedroom connected to a studio and they'd eat illegally,

1769
01:38:31.441 --> 01:38:35.430
popped out the door in between and raised a family there for like 40 years.

1770
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:40.710
And it was Tony and Gladys Ray Goo.
And so they,
uh,

1771
01:38:40.711 --> 01:38:43.380
and they and I,
I met them and they were,

1772
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:47.370
they had a place around the corner there,
son Tony,
who works in construction.

1773
01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:51.030
He lives in Staten Island now,
a nice house.
He bought the Macondo around the,

1774
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.300
around the corner because they were too old to climb up those steps anymore.

1775
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:56.760
So they're going to sublet it to me.
I mean,

1776
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:59.640
they still play like 400 bucks for this unit.

1777
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.010
And they were paying like 200 bucks was rent controlled and every and every,

1778
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.970
maybe I was paying like 600 and every month I'd walk around the corner and I had

1779
01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:12.570
to pay them in cash.
But I'd go around and first I would,
they,

1780
01:39:12.571 --> 01:39:17.220
they'd make me a Cappuccino that have canolas and I would give them a $400 in

1781
01:39:17.221 --> 01:39:19.560
cash.
And then when Tony would leave the room,

1782
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:23.760
I'd give Gladys the other 200 on the side.
That's my bingo money.

1783
01:39:23.761 --> 01:39:26.760
Tony doesn't need to know about that.
No Way.

1784
01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:30.510
And when I first moved to two different prices to different prices,

1785
01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:34.800
there was a little kickback.
And then the place was literally one door over in,

1786
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:39.360
upstairs from,
from the um,
uh,
what was the club that,

1787
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:43.770
um,
that God,
he belonged to the,
where he was arrested.

1788
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:47.010
And so,
uh,
so social club

1789
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.190
shit.
But,
but Tony says to me,
anything ever happens to you?

1790
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:57.600
You tell me.
Cause you know,
I know people,
I'm not,
not going to say,
well I know,

1791
01:39:57.990 --> 01:40:02.280
but,
uh,
I think you know who I knew and uh,
and so like,

1792
01:40:02.281 --> 01:40:03.150
and so we,

1793
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.360
I opened up that they left their furniture and it was all like literally the

1794
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:11.220
plastic on the couch.
It was everything had like a,
for Micah on it.

1795
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.300
And the end table had,
uh,

1796
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:18.300
an eavesdropping device on the phone and it had bullet casings.

1797
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:20.820
Whoa.
And it was like,

1798
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.450
everything was just really fucking weird.

1799
01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:28.290
But Reaganite the Raven I'd social club.
Exactly.

1800
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:30.210
<v 0>Apparently they were there.</v>

1801
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.360
The associates frequented by John Gotti and his associates in the late 1970s in

1802
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:37.140
1980s.
Yeah,

1803
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.450
around 1990 Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to infiltrate the mafia

1804
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:44.730
using secret electronic surveillance.

1805
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:47.470
<v 3>Well,
you know what they did?
They couldn't bug the place.</v>

1806
01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:50.170
They bug the place itself and then they found it.

1807
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:54.010
So what they started doing was God,
he and his would walk up and

1808
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.870
<v 2>down Mulberry Street and have conversations.</v>

1809
01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:00.640
So what the FBI did was they started parking cars on Mulberry Street and putting

1810
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:03.100
eavesdropping devices in the hubcaps,
the cars.

1811
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.890
So they would pick it up as they were moving.

1812
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.890
They would grab the conversation and that's how they actually put them away.

1813
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:12.190
<v 0>Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

1814
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.150
<v 2>And every shop on the street,
there was pictures of God he up,</v>

1815
01:41:16.151 --> 01:41:18.010
they fucking love this guy.

1816
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:23.170
And then at the time there was this one dude who was a,
he was up on charges,

1817
01:41:23.171 --> 01:41:24.760
so he was trying to get an insanity plea.

1818
01:41:24.761 --> 01:41:27.220
So He'd walk around the neighborhood and Pajamas,

1819
01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:31.950
<v 0>Vincent the Chin Get Janti.
Is that his name?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
He,
you,
uh,</v>

1820
01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.470
not only did they do that,
but when they would talk about him,

1821
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.030
they would just point to their chin.

1822
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:39.210
They would go and it was probably a good idea,
but you know,
he's,

1823
01:41:39.211 --> 01:41:41.190
you got to know about it.
Oh Shit.

1824
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.040
There are points of the Chin and then they would know who they were talking

1825
01:41:44.041 --> 01:41:44.860
about it.

1826
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:48.600
He didn't allow anybody to use his name and he would pretend to be crazy.

1827
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:51.810
So yeah,
walk around shuffle.
I don't think it worked.
I think he,

1828
01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.810
I think we're talking about them right now.
So

1829
01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:58.170
we know we're pretty far on the outside.

1830
01:41:58.610 --> 01:41:59.151
<v 2>Well,
the A,</v>

1831
01:41:59.151 --> 01:42:02.810
and then there was this woman named Gina and she had these three dogs and she'd

1832
01:42:02.811 --> 01:42:03.381
walk around,

1833
01:42:03.381 --> 01:42:07.460
I mean literally did laps of the neighborhood just walking around and she ran

1834
01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:10.580
the numbers and if you wanted to bet on the numbers you'd give her,

1835
01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.380
he'd give her money.
And then,

1836
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:16.280
you know how they picked the numbers is the last three numbers of the person

1837
01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.810
aqueduct.
The day before.

1838
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:21.560
Those were the three numbers and whatever it was,

1839
01:42:21.561 --> 01:42:25.130
they paid out on it and she was all cash and she would go,

1840
01:42:25.131 --> 01:42:27.440
there was the shark bar on the corner and uh,

1841
01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:29.240
that was like a main place you hung out.
But I mean,

1842
01:42:29.241 --> 01:42:31.770
just walking and people walking up to her shaking her hand,
given a,

1843
01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:36.470
like a dollar,
here's a dollar on three 87.
Yeah,

1844
01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.960
my grandmother used to do that.
Itchy.

1845
01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:42.400
<v 0>My grandmother went to jail for six months because she,
uh,</v>

1846
01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:46.810
she's running numbers and um,
they wanted her to rat out the mob.

1847
01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.860
She wouldn't do it.
She was running the numbers sell.
She was selling.
I mean,

1848
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:54.470
she was moving around,
she was doing it for the mob,
but you know how it works,

1849
01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.050
you know,
they'll have someone go and,
you know,

1850
01:42:57.070 --> 01:43:00.760
place bets and talk to this and Marjorie wants 50 on that.

1851
01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:04.150
And Gina,
you know,
thinks this is her numbers.

1852
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.720
She would collect the numbers and she then she'd bring them the whole,
you know,

1853
01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:09.880
she wasn't like making a ton of money off of it.
Right.

1854
01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:12.610
But they wanted her to rollover.
Yeah.

1855
01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:18.140
So my grandmother went to jail for six months and we would go to those.

1856
01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.290
She was in jail.
Not until later.
I was not until I was like a teenager.
Yeah.

1857
01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.780
I thought that she would just was visiting.
Her aunt was like,
where's the,

1858
01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:29.920
where's grandma?
Grandma's with aunt Mary.
That was always the story.
So she,

1859
01:43:29.921 --> 01:43:31.480
for six months,
she was in the pokey.

1860
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:35.470
She would knit fucking sweaters for the guards and Shit,
you know?

1861
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:36.850
But just kept her in jail.

1862
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.380
<v 2>Wow.
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
Pretty hard.
You never talked to her about it?</v>

1863
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.960
<v 0>No.
She would have never admitted to me anyway.</v>

1864
01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:46.810
True to my grandmother wore a wig and she was crazy.
Yeah.

1865
01:43:46.811 --> 01:43:51.440
She was always sidekick.
You know,
there was always a ghost nearby was like,

1866
01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:55.250
there was a lot of,
oh,
she was nuts.
Yeah.
She was a really eccentric woman.

1867
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:57.470
<v 2>That's a fine grandma to have though,
is I had Martin King,</v>

1868
01:43:57.670 --> 01:43:58.480
<v 0>she had a monkey.</v>

1869
01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.470
She danky named Chichi that used to live in the attic and he would bite people,

1870
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.850
cheat.
She would chew gum.
You give Chia pet sticker gum.
He'd open up the gum,

1871
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:08.370
take it out of the wrapper and put it in his mouth,

1872
01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:10.540
chew it and look at you all fucking crazy.

1873
01:44:11.130 --> 01:44:15.280
Scream at the kids came near me would start screaming and climb on her.
Yeah,

1874
01:44:15.281 --> 01:44:18.700
she had a monkey.
My fucking grandfather hated that monkey.
Oh my God.

1875
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:21.730
He must have loved visiting her.
Oh,
it was fascinating.

1876
01:44:21.731 --> 01:44:26.380
But it was the main reason why I was averse to relationships.
That and my,

1877
01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.680
my own parents' relationship,
which was horrific when I was a little kid.

1878
01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.420
My Real Dad and my Stepdad is a great guy and he's been with me since I was like

1879
01:44:34.421 --> 01:44:38.560
seven years old.
He's a sweetheart.
Like he's never,
uh,
never hit my mom once.

1880
01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.000
But the fights that my mom and my dad got into before my mom left when I was

1881
01:44:43.001 --> 01:44:45.040
little,
I was like five years old were horrific.

1882
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.490
And I remember violence and screaming.
It was really,

1883
01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.440
really hard to like ever think about wanting to be in a relationship because of

1884
01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:55.540
that and that grandparents and screaming at each other.

1885
01:44:55.630 --> 01:44:58.640
Now grandparents wasn't violent,
but my grandmother would like,

1886
01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.380
they're both named Joe was Josephine and uh,

1887
01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.430
my grandfather was Joseph Joseppe,
but you know,

1888
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:08.350
in Italy they would call them that in America,
call him Joseph,

1889
01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:12.630
but they would fucking scream at each other screaming match Rashmi Joe,

1890
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:14.320
because my grandmother was late for everything.

1891
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:17.800
He would have to tell her that something was at two o'clock if it was at six

1892
01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.240
like this bitch was just late.
She was always,
she wanted to put her wig on again.

1893
01:45:22.241 --> 01:45:25.200
This wig doesn't work.
I need another wig.
And she put it another wig on.

1894
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:28.780
It was just craziness.
Yeah.
She was always putting food together.

1895
01:45:28.781 --> 01:45:30.150
Like she was a killer cook,

1896
01:45:30.151 --> 01:45:33.970
so she'd always like make homemade pasta and she would like,
if she would like,

1897
01:45:33.971 --> 01:45:35.380
say we all had to meet somewhere,

1898
01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:38.260
like my grandmother was not just not going to be ready on time.

1899
01:45:38.261 --> 01:45:41.680
If there was a family gathering and everybody was meeting at six o'clock you

1900
01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:41.771
know,

1901
01:45:41.771 --> 01:45:44.980
my grandfather would be all frazzled and they would be screaming at each other

1902
01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.690
just so I all,
I would ever,

1903
01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:51.460
I would associate relationships with screaming at each other and possibly

1904
01:45:51.461 --> 01:45:55.090
hitting each other.
That's what I saw.
So I was like,
fuck all that.

1905
01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:58.850
<v 2>I before seven.
I mean,
you,
you know this with kids.
I mean,</v>

1906
01:45:58.851 --> 01:46:01.690
your kids are getting to that age where it's like you did the,

1907
01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:06.290
the learning happens in the first like Ericsson,
you know,
uh,
Freud,

1908
01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:09.890
they all say the learning happens in the first five,
six years after that.

1909
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:11.110
You just corralling them.

1910
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.340
<v 0>There's a little bit of that.
I mean,</v>

1911
01:46:13.341 --> 01:46:16.880
you're certainly changing the way they interact with people.

1912
01:46:16.881 --> 01:46:19.070
You shape it and I don't totally buy it.

1913
01:46:19.071 --> 01:46:22.210
I think there's a lot of times that's when people stopped paying attention.
They,

1914
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:24.770
they have them for our first couple of years.
They'd do that and then they think,

1915
01:46:24.771 --> 01:46:26.000
wow,
the kids can walk.
Yeah.

1916
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:28.700
The kid can talk and they sort of just let them walk and talking the wall.

1917
01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.130
You know,
I'm also,
their learning is done within the first couple of years.

1918
01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:35.180
I ain't get to say that because I've learned and grown as an adult.

1919
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:39.360
<v 2>You have a year,
an exception.
You're no,
you really are.
I mean,</v>

1920
01:46:39.361 --> 01:46:41.850
I've said this before on the show.
Like I,
I've known you,

1921
01:46:41.851 --> 01:46:44.880
I feel like before and after,
not that before was bad,

1922
01:46:45.090 --> 01:46:50.040
but your energy changed so dramatically and I think you're,
um,
part of it

1923
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.610
<v 3>is we were young so we were so hungry to make it that we were just,
you know,</v>

1924
01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.170
competitive and fucking,
the anger was working in a good way,
but then you,

1925
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:02.430
you changed and that's rare.
A lot of them,
a lot of people don't change.

1926
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:03.960
Most people don't change at all.

1927
01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.700
<v 0>Well,
I came from a crazy competitive,</v>

1928
01:47:06.701 --> 01:47:10.150
the world of martial arts competition growing up,

1929
01:47:10.151 --> 01:47:14.290
doing that like that in forming my personality through high school,

1930
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:17.470
competing in mixed martial arts,
martial arts tournaments,

1931
01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:21.190
full contact taekwondo tournaments and stuff.
It was just too violent.
Right.

1932
01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:25.870
The idea of that being what shapes your life and then trying to interject

1933
01:47:25.871 --> 01:47:28.990
yourself into a normal society,

1934
01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:32.570
like you're always on hair trigger.
You always ready to smash things.

1935
01:47:32.571 --> 01:47:34.450
They're always ready to fight.
It's like,

1936
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:38.140
it's a really weird way to develop as a human being.

1937
01:47:38.290 --> 01:47:41.250
So it took me a long time to calm that down.
Mm.

1938
01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:41.791
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1939
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:46.020
Because if you were raised with that kind of anger and that kind of physical

1940
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:46.854
violence,

1941
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:52.040
then the martial arts was actually taking that and putting more focus on it and

1942
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:57.330
developing it as opposed to developing other facets of your personality.

1943
01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:01.120
<v 0>Sort of.
Um,
it w w certainly controlled at though too,</v>

1944
01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.690
in a way better way than just,
you know,
being angry,
wandering through the city,

1945
01:48:04.691 --> 01:48:07.150
like training and discipline and focus.

1946
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.600
The character development of martial arts had a huge impact on just me moving

1947
01:48:13.301 --> 01:48:17.410
out of where I was when I was a young boy to move in where I was as a young man.

1948
01:48:17.411 --> 01:48:22.030
So even though I might've been more prone to having violent tendencies because

1949
01:48:22.031 --> 01:48:25.450
of my background,
it was way more in control because of martial arts.

1950
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:29.990
Way More in control,
but it's just,
it wasn't just martial arts,
it was competing.

1951
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:34.270
Just the,
the,
the hardcore competition of national tournament's was just,

1952
01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:35.790
it's really fucked with you.

1953
01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.800
It fucks with your brain to wires your brain in a very strange way because it

1954
01:48:41.531 --> 01:48:45.640
would be prepare for a tournament,
be terrified,
fight,

1955
01:48:45.850 --> 01:48:49.840
be relieved for a little while,
a little while,
and then,
okay,
when's the next one?

1956
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:53.950
And then start Tara being terrified again.
Start the stress again.

1957
01:48:53.951 --> 01:48:57.940
Start the training again.
You know,
you can't slack off,
can't,
can't get injured.

1958
01:48:57.941 --> 01:49:00.850
You gotta you know,
it was just,
it was so much of,

1959
01:49:00.851 --> 01:49:04.060
it was like so much more stressful than just regular life.

1960
01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:06.760
<v 3>But in a way it made you engage.
I mean,</v>

1961
01:49:06.761 --> 01:49:09.970
I think kids that come from a childhood like yours have two options.
You,

1962
01:49:09.971 --> 01:49:10.900
it's fight or flight.

1963
01:49:10.901 --> 01:49:15.901
You either get into drugs and fucking up and rejecting everything socially or

1964
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:20.650
you can focus hyper focus in on something which in a sense made you show up for

1965
01:49:20.651 --> 01:49:21.810
life and made you engage.

1966
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:25.800
<v 0>Yeah,
it makes you,
it lets you control that thing inside of you too.</v>

1967
01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:30.270
You figure out how to discipline because if you don't those crazy wild emotions

1968
01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:34.410
like a lot of people that engage in violent crime if violent activities and make

1969
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.750
horrible mistakes socially.

1970
01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.380
A lot of that is this overwhelming response,

1971
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:44.640
this overwhelming energy that you've developed from just being raised in a

1972
01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:48.700
terrible environment and my environment was nothing compared to a lot of

1973
01:49:48.701 --> 01:49:49.630
people's,
I mean my,

1974
01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:53.440
my environment up until I was five was pretty violent with my mom and my dad.

1975
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:58.210
Nobody hit me,
you know,
I was okay.
It was what?
It could have been way worse.

1976
01:49:58.211 --> 01:50:01.900
We always had food and then we got to live with my grandfather and my

1977
01:50:01.901 --> 01:50:02.980
grandmother when I was five,

1978
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:07.930
so I got to see that my mother was a strong woman and she set a positive
example.

1979
01:50:07.931 --> 01:50:10.280
When someone's abusing you,
you don't just take it.
You can now.
Right.

1980
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:11.630
So the first time I ever saw

1981
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:13.240
<v 3>did you,
and that's huge.</v>

1982
01:50:13.241 --> 01:50:17.470
I think one of the most difficult things with domestic abuse is to see that the,

1983
01:50:17.471 --> 01:50:20.860
that your mother is not fighting back and you see then you become a victim

1984
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:24.280
yourself.
Yes.
And that you feel like also you,

1985
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:28.030
you're a vulnerable human being at that you need to be protected.

1986
01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:30.010
That's the number one thing a parent is doing.

1987
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:34.330
And when you feel like you're not being protected,
your world is fucking chaos.

1988
01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.680
<v 0>Well,
no,
not only that,
it was important to me,</v>

1989
01:50:36.681 --> 01:50:40.400
I think to see that my mother stood up for herself and that she realized that

1990
01:50:40.401 --> 01:50:43.560
this is no way to live life.
And no matter what a person tells you,

1991
01:50:43.561 --> 01:50:45.620
if they tell you they love you and they hit you,
this is not love.

1992
01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:49.550
You got to get out of there.
And so it made sense that we left.

1993
01:50:49.551 --> 01:50:51.680
Like I never felt bad that we left my dad.
I've,

1994
01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:54.530
I've felt weird that they weren't together anymore,

1995
01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:58.190
but I never felt like my mom did the wrong thing.
I knew she did the right thing.

1996
01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:00.440
Really?
Yeah.
It was no doubt about it.

1997
01:51:00.441 --> 01:51:03.850
Even at five I knew we had to get away from him.
You know,

1998
01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.680
<v 3>that's really weird because most kids,
there's,</v>

1999
01:51:06.690 --> 01:51:10.620
you know that that relationship with your parents being together is,

2000
01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:13.890
it's life itself.
It is sustenance,
it's food,

2001
01:51:13.891 --> 01:51:16.650
it's protection that their units thing together.

2002
01:51:16.651 --> 01:51:20.790
So for you to feel otherwise is,
that's very rare.

2003
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.380
<v 0>It was pretty obvious man.
When,
when you see your dad hit your mother yeah.</v>

2004
01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.140
When you see an [inaudible],
I remember just,

2005
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:33.280
I remember what the Sheetz looked like on the bed.
I remember the,

2006
01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:35.760
the layout of the house.
I was five.

2007
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:39.510
I remember the path that I ran to get out of the kitchen when he hit her.

2008
01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:43.510
I remember all that Shit.
My mother brought home hamburger and uh,

2009
01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.580
she knows she went out to get something to for dinner and my dad got upset that

2010
01:51:47.581 --> 01:51:50.250
it was just hamburger.
So he slapped her in the face,

2011
01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:55.170
just whacked her in the face and she dropped and I ran.
And you know,

2012
01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:58.560
I was probably around five,
somewhere between four and five.
I guess,

2013
01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:02.790
and it just is it stained my brain,

2014
01:52:02.791 --> 01:52:07.791
like I'll never forget it because sometimes if you see a conflict and you walk

2015
01:52:08.491 --> 01:52:12.300
in while the conflict is happening,
you don't know what happened.

2016
01:52:12.330 --> 01:52:15.450
You just see violence.
You don't know why someone's hitting someone.

2017
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:18.630
That's very confusing.
But when you see it from the beginning,

2018
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:21.330
there was no room for rationalization.

2019
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:24.810
There wasn't like my mother tried to stab him and then he slapped her.

2020
01:52:24.811 --> 01:52:28.320
There was nothing.
There was just my mom came home,
she had hamburger,
he hit her,

2021
01:52:28.321 --> 01:52:29.460
he's evil.
It was like

2022
01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.360
<v 3>immediate.
He's an animal.
All</v>

2023
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.470
<v 0>I could think of as a little kid was,
wow,
my dad's a piece of shit.</v>

2024
01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:39.700
You know that all these ideas that you have about every kid wants to think that

2025
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:41.740
his dad is the greatest.
Like his dad,
Superman.

2026
01:52:41.741 --> 01:52:45.740
His Dad is the most righteous and the smartest and coolest.

2027
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.840
But I knew my dad was BZ shit.
Yeah,
cause my mom was,
my mom was a sweetheart.

2028
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:53.600
She was just,
my mom is because of the fact.

2029
01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:55.970
I think that my grandparents screamed at each other all the time,

2030
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.310
like the yell constantly.
My mom rejected that whole heartedly.

2031
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.190
She never screams.

2032
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:05.600
I don't think I've seen my mom scream in her entire life in the 60 plus years.

2033
01:53:05.601 --> 01:53:10.460
I've known her that she's a rather been alive in the 46 that I've known her.

2034
01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.930
<v 2>But she also never seen her.</v>

2035
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:16.000
<v 0>Yeah.
She's,
she's a great mom.
She's,
she's a nice person.</v>

2036
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:19.060
She's a kind nice person.
But

2037
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:23.000
<v 2>well,
they say if you,
if you know,
if it,
no matter how bad your childhood is,</v>

2038
01:53:23.001 --> 01:53:27.100
if your mother is strong and you have a connection with her,
you're,

2039
01:53:27.101 --> 01:53:28.250
you're going to be okay.

2040
01:53:29.110 --> 01:53:33.580
<v 0>Uh,
it,
I think it certainly is way better than not having that for sure.</v>

2041
01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:38.080
But I think that not having a relationship with your father or having a terrible

2042
01:53:38.081 --> 01:53:40.600
one can really fuck a guy up.
You know,

2043
01:53:40.601 --> 01:53:44.830
I know a lot of men that are grown men that will still complain about the

2044
01:53:44.831 --> 01:53:46.540
relationship that they have with their father,

2045
01:53:46.541 --> 01:53:48.970
but their father did this and you didn't encourage me.

2046
01:53:48.971 --> 01:53:50.920
Did that and there's certain point in time,

2047
01:53:50.921 --> 01:53:52.960
it's like you got to let all that shit guy.

2048
01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:56.840
Like you got to move past that and it's hard to move past that if that guy is

2049
01:53:56.841 --> 01:53:58.510
still in your life.
You know,

2050
01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:02.950
I have a friend who was a bad relationship with his dad and you know his dad's

2051
01:54:02.951 --> 01:54:06.550
and salting and his dad blames him for his own childhood and they have this

2052
01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:10.490
crazy flare ups and then they'll cut them off and won't talk to him and he's

2053
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.341
born and then it was dad.

2054
01:54:11.341 --> 01:54:14.440
I'll send him a long email apologizing than to let them back in.

2055
01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:18.120
<v 2>Yeah.
And nothing's changing.
The father is staying the same.</v>

2056
01:54:18.121 --> 01:54:19.530
So it's really about your,

2057
01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:22.230
it's always at your weakest point that you let him back in again.

2058
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:25.700
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean there was a divorce at an early age and you know,</v>

2059
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:30.470
they would split time between the dad and the mom and
it's hard,
you know,

2060
01:54:30.471 --> 01:54:34.000
cause my advice,
it's like cut them off his cancer man.
Fuck them.
Move,

2061
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.290
change or change number,
move.
Don't let them know.

2062
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:37.460
Just get that dude out of your life.

2063
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:42.110
You don't need that idiot 60 fucking years old and he's still stupid.
Yeah.

2064
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:46.340
He's still some dumb asshole that ruins everything.
Just move on,
man.

2065
01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.170
<v 2>Yeah.
And that hitting is not coming from a place like you said,</v>

2066
01:54:49.171 --> 01:54:52.290
you saw your mother did nothing.
And so you realize that,
uh,

2067
01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:56.230
anytime somebody is hitting a child or a spouse,
it's their own anger.

2068
01:54:56.231 --> 01:54:57.480
Something's happening in their life,

2069
01:54:57.481 --> 01:55:00.450
that they're out of control and they're venting it.
It's not like,

2070
01:55:00.451 --> 01:55:03.450
especially you're hitting a kid.
Some people will kids,
I love them comics.

2071
01:55:03.451 --> 01:55:06.750
Talk about that.
Like when I was a kid,
there was no timeouts.

2072
01:55:06.751 --> 01:55:11.640
There was a fucking smack and there was a knock out.
And it was like,

2073
01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:14.460
yeah,
and that was really fucked up.
It's no,

2074
01:55:14.461 --> 01:55:16.830
don't be nostalgic about child abuse.

2075
01:55:16.831 --> 01:55:20.520
It meant that the dad didn't know what the fuck he was doing and he was letting

2076
01:55:20.521 --> 01:55:21.360
off steam.

2077
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.460
<v 0>It's effective.
It definitely puts you in line,
but it also ruins you.
Right.</v>

2078
01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:28.970
Fucks your head up.
The idea that that's a beneficial thing is so stupid.
Right.

2079
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.290
It's never good to hit kids.
Nope.
You know,
but we,
you know,

2080
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:35.810
the nostalgia for shitty parenting,

2081
01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:38.630
the way their parents were raised and their pencils,
right?

2082
01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.570
People got to get past that.
You've got to get past all that.

2083
01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.180
That's the number one problem with humans today is they're raised poorly.

2084
01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:50.210
The human body and mind together as a cohesive unit is like the most complicated

2085
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:56.060
piece of machinery in the world and developing it is free.

2086
01:55:57.151 --> 01:55:59.940
Anybody can do it.
There's no one can tell you how to do it.

2087
01:55:59.941 --> 01:56:04.050
And it's the most important resource in our entire society is new human beings,

2088
01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:09.130
nice human beings and they're all being developed by fucking idiots.
Shit,

2089
01:56:09.131 --> 01:56:13.020
heads and idiots who are responsible for a great percentage of the world's

2090
01:56:13.021 --> 01:56:16.200
population.
Like as far as like how many they're shitting out.

2091
01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.030
<v 3>And there there is,
there is no training,
no training.</v>

2092
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:23.620
Parent parenthood with Kiana raves.
Ray said like,

2093
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:27.970
what was the famous line about like,
uh,
any asshole can,
uh,

2094
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:32.350
if you want to get a fishing license,
you have to take a test,

2095
01:56:32.351 --> 01:56:34.900
but any asshole can have a kid.
And it's like,

2096
01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.430
it really is amazing that there is not more and they're starting to see more and

2097
01:56:39.431 --> 01:56:39.731
more of that.

2098
01:56:39.731 --> 01:56:44.440
I just did this benefit for this amazing place in Cleveland called the,

2099
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:47.050
um,
fuck off.
I'll think of it.

2100
01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:51.430
But you day take families in when they're in crisis.

2101
01:56:51.431 --> 01:56:54.430
If the mother feels like she's gonna be here,
she's hit her kid.

2102
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:55.660
She doesn't want to hit them again.

2103
01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:59.180
They're about to get thrown out because they don't have rent money.
Uh,

2104
01:56:59.230 --> 01:57:03.280
they providence house,
they come in and they can,
how's the kids,
you know,
for two,

2105
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:03.880
three months.

2106
01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.630
It's sort of a buffer before you go into like a homeless shelter and they give

2107
01:57:07.631 --> 01:57:11.650
coaching to the parents.
Here's how you deal with it.
When you're freaking out,

2108
01:57:11.651 --> 01:57:15.100
you think you're going to hit your kid.
Here's some substance abuse problems.

2109
01:57:15.190 --> 01:57:16.900
Here's parenting classes.

2110
01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:20.080
And at the same time the kids are being taken care of and they're being given

2111
01:57:20.081 --> 01:57:21.730
tools and it's amazing.

2112
01:57:21.731 --> 01:57:25.240
I know you're starting to see more and more of these kind of stop gap,
uh,

2113
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:29.140
agencies coming up that can get,
get in there where there's a problem.

2114
01:57:29.141 --> 01:57:31.690
And you know,
reformat the hard drive so that,

2115
01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:34.960
that parents are getting what they should have gotten when they were younger,

2116
01:57:34.961 --> 01:57:36.460
which is an instruction manual.

2117
01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.300
<v 0>And even as they're older,</v>

2118
01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.360
it's like the amount of time that we spend doing things that are important,

2119
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:45.920
like,
uh,

2120
01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:51.260
food and exercise and making money and having a career.

2121
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.000
Those are all important things,
right?
And we spend a tremendous amount of,

2122
01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.160
of time doing those.

2123
01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:00.400
But managing your mind and understanding how your mind works and understanding

2124
01:58:00.681 --> 01:58:04.160
the bad patterns that your brain can get into and giving yourself tools,

2125
01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:08.180
whether it's meditation,
whether it's Yoga

2126
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:11.160
<v 3>self help books,
can be profound.
Sure,
sure.</v>

2127
01:58:11.230 --> 01:58:12.790
<v 0>Without a doubt.
Without a doubt.</v>

2128
01:58:12.791 --> 01:58:16.780
But time and focus on improving the quality of your thinking,
right.

2129
01:58:16.810 --> 01:58:19.870
Improving the quality of the way you interact or relationships that you have

2130
01:58:19.871 --> 01:58:24.060
with other human beings.
Tom,
spin on that.
It's so,
um,
under emphasize.
Right,
right.

2131
01:58:24.250 --> 01:58:28.600
And it should be a core part of what it means to be a part of a civilization.

2132
01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:28.930
Yeah.

2133
01:58:28.930 --> 01:58:33.930
We should have community groups where we meet together and we all like exchange

2134
01:58:33.941 --> 01:58:38.941
ideas and reemphasize the idea that it's important to have community reemphasize

2135
01:58:40.031 --> 01:58:41.980
the idea that it's important,
treat each other

2136
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.820
<v 1>well to the kids to treat each other well.
All of this should be passed down.</v>

2137
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:49.000
That those aren't enemies out there in the street.
Those are all your friends,

2138
01:58:49.001 --> 01:58:49.900
that we're all in this together.

2139
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.390
<v 3>Right.
In a big problem is that we no longer have communities.</v>

2140
01:58:53.391 --> 01:58:54.920
I mean he's talking about Italy and you know,

2141
01:58:54.921 --> 01:58:58.370
I just read this piece about these people that live really long in this small

2142
01:58:58.371 --> 01:59:02.180
village in Italy.
And it's not just the diet,
it's the fact that there's,
you know,

2143
01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:06.260
200 people in the village and every day you walk to your job and you stop along

2144
01:59:06.261 --> 01:59:07.720
the way and you talk to,
you know,

2145
01:59:07.730 --> 01:59:10.040
Mrs Mark Gotti of what's going on with your husband and,

2146
01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:14.020
and there's this interconnection that makes people feel,
and like you said,

2147
01:59:14.150 --> 01:59:16.650
you said things get in perspective.
You know,
you,
you,

2148
01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:19.400
the balance of your life is there.

2149
01:59:19.401 --> 01:59:22.940
And when you lose that and you move to cities,
I mean,
think of,
look at us.

2150
01:59:22.941 --> 01:59:26.210
We don't,
we live on the other coast from our family,
you know,
and the people,

2151
01:59:26.211 --> 01:59:29.810
I don't know,
the people in my neighborhood and it's just like,
who the fuck am I?

2152
01:59:29.811 --> 01:59:34.130
And so it's like you do have to create,
you have to like,
let's go to dinner,

2153
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:37.700
you know,
let's get,
you know,
uh,
there's mommy and me groups where,
you know,

2154
01:59:37.701 --> 01:59:38.780
Mommy's in their kids.

2155
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:42.380
That was a really great experience for my wife having that.
But you know,

2156
01:59:42.381 --> 01:59:44.420
creating what,
what we're lacking now,

2157
01:59:44.421 --> 01:59:47.510
which is the groups of people communicating and supporting.

2158
01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.493
<v 1>Without a doubt.</v>

2159
01:59:48.710 --> 01:59:52.400
It's one of the most important things as a human being to have to be like a lone

2160
01:59:52.401 --> 01:59:57.230
wolf.
Every Lone Wolf I've met as a dick just cuts through all dicks.

2161
01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.360
Like that was always like the thing that everybody wanted.

2162
01:59:59.361 --> 02:00:02.300
The guy could just get on his motorcycle,
on fraud across the country by himself.

2163
02:00:02.301 --> 02:00:04.450
He didn't need anybody drive off into the sunset,

2164
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.920
would not have a hundred friends.
Like,
what's going on?

2165
02:00:06.921 --> 02:00:10.730
Why is this guy just hopping on a horse showing up in town shooting everybody

2166
02:00:10.731 --> 02:00:12.050
cause he's an asshole.

2167
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:18.640
<v 2>This fucking lone riders a Dickhead,
right?
Right.
40 years old.</v>

2168
02:00:18.641 --> 02:00:22.060
Where's his friends?
The fuck's going on his horses out front.

2169
02:00:22.061 --> 02:00:25.660
He sits down orders a shot of whiskey,
flicks a nickel on the bar,

2170
02:00:25.661 --> 02:00:29.990
fucks a whore and leaves again.
What an asshole at nickel.

2171
02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:35.080
A fucking nickel for a glass of whiskey and you just dumped a hot load and that

2172
02:00:35.081 --> 02:00:38.830
horse is going to have a baby.
Why are you riding a horse across the country?

2173
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:42.160
2014 the fuck you friends,
man.

2174
02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:47.890
He wouldn't.
He got a flip phone for,
you've got to get in touch with people,
man.

2175
02:00:49.150 --> 02:00:52.840
<v 1>It's a fun thing that we always romanticize the lone wolf,
right?</v>

2176
02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:57.280
Those guys are almost always idiots.
It's the Marlboro man.
Look at him smoking.

2177
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:58.390
Those guys all died.

2178
02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.280
Every one of those diet guys in the ads died of lung cancer and they died of bad

2179
02:01:03.281 --> 02:01:04.970
way.
It's okay.
Is it?

2180
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:07.360
<v 3>It's a way of saying stay away from me.</v>

2181
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:11.560
I'm blowing a fucking stinky cloud around my face.
My breath is shit,

2182
02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:12.850
my teeth are brown.

2183
02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:18.130
<v 1>Tell smokes two packs a day.
So that's unbelievable.
Two pracs.
Yep.
That's a lot.</v>

2184
02:01:18.610 --> 02:01:21.550
Standups probably close.
My Dad smoked three and a half packs a day,

2185
02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:26.380
drop dead at 51 of a heart attack from it.
Boom.
Wow.

2186
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:29.860
Three and a half packs a day and a half pack.
He used to get up in the morning.

2187
02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:33.220
That's like one every seven minutes or something isn't it?
Hey that.
Yeah,

2188
02:01:33.221 --> 02:01:35.380
that's what I figured out.
It's about five,
seven medicine.

2189
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.980
He would light a cigarette and and smoke it on the edge of his bed.

2190
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.280
Throw it in the toilet.

2191
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:42.440
<v 2>Because I was,
I would always remember I'd any,
wouldn't flush it.</v>

2192
02:01:42.441 --> 02:01:45.710
I come down and there would be yellow water and there would be a cigarette.

2193
02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:49.760
Just you know,
floating in that.
Then he would light another one.

2194
02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:53.780
He'd put it on the basin of the shower,
get in the shower halfway through,

2195
02:01:53.781 --> 02:01:58.640
lean out,
take a couple of drags a cigarette.
Yeah.

2196
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:03.710
And he was in radio.
He would just sit there and just when you were too.
Yeah.
Yup.

2197
02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:07.790
And I had asthma as a kid.
My mother smoked a pack a day and this is New York.

2198
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:11.000
Our windows are closed most of the year cause it's cold and they would just

2199
02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:14.730
chain smoke driving in the car.
And Jane Smoking?
Yes.

2200
02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:19.430
You in the right,
right.
Oh amazing.
You don't smoke.
I did smoke for,

2201
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:23.480
you know,
you know,
typical teenager,
early twenties and then I had asthma.

2202
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:24.680
It would give me fucking asthma.

2203
02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.920
That's crazy that they would like leave you in the house

2204
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:31.830
<v 0>with all their smoke.
Right.
There's no way it gets out.
It's just you would smoke.</v>

2205
02:02:31.831 --> 02:02:34.560
You were smoking when you were going to add,
how do you recognize it or not?

2206
02:02:34.561 --> 02:02:35.350
You were a smoker.

2207
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:36.580
<v 2>Right?
Wow.</v>

2208
02:02:36.610 --> 02:02:39.910
And I remember we used to have to change the carpets and the and the couch every

2209
02:02:39.911 --> 02:02:44.080
once in a while because they would,
it would stink from all the smoke being,

2210
02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:46.930
oh my God,
mom's a chain smoker,

2211
02:02:46.931 --> 02:02:51.340
dad's a chain smoker and the kids are just suffering and they don't even care.

2212
02:02:51.370 --> 02:02:54.070
Right.
They're not even paying attention to the fact that blowing smoke on their

2213
02:02:54.071 --> 02:02:56.590
babies.
Right.
Taking the kid,

2214
02:02:56.650 --> 02:02:59.950
taking the kids to the doctor's office once a week to get shots for his asthma.

2215
02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.510
No connection there whatsoever.
Yeah,
it was nuts.

2216
02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.910
It makes me sad.
That's why I tried to watch mad men,

2217
02:03:06.911 --> 02:03:11.740
but I get so bummed out with all the smoking.
It starts to really bother me.
Wow.

2218
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:12.190
<v 0>Derek,</v>

2219
02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:16.720
what a fucking amazing trick they pulled on the American people or people in

2220
02:03:16.721 --> 02:03:19.600
general,
get them to poison themselves.

2221
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:22.780
Make it acceptable to not just poison themselves,

2222
02:03:22.781 --> 02:03:26.800
but poison themselves in a way where your babies get exposed.
Your ignorance.

2223
02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:30.300
<v 2>We didn't know it was bad for you.</v>

2224
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:35.410
A fucking lit flame that you're inhaling.
Get the fuck out of here.

2225
02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:38.380
Are you smoking?
Kools you didn't know it was bad for you.
My mommy smoke.

2226
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:42.680
Kools she black.
No,
no Italian though.
Uh,

2227
02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:46.140
Santa Maria.
Is it?
Talk about marketing.
Look at how many black people smoke.

2228
02:03:46.141 --> 02:03:47.850
Kools white people.

2229
02:03:47.851 --> 02:03:51.300
It's like you can pick a race and I can tell you what fucking cigarettes they

2230
02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:54.790
smoke.
Tying smoke Kools seven days.
Yeah.

2231
02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:59.120
My mom smoked crack days.
You lived in the city though,
right?
Newark?
Yeah.

2232
02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:01.980
That's why she smoked.
Cools.
That was probably a lot of people around.

2233
02:04:01.981 --> 02:04:02.410
You smell smoking

2234
02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:06.470
<v 0>well,
it was a confused neighborhood man there when it was,
uh,</v>

2235
02:04:06.490 --> 02:04:07.580
one of my grandparents,

2236
02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:11.930
my grandparents moved to this place called North Ninth Street in Newark,

2237
02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:12.501
New Jersey,

2238
02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:17.501
which in this day is more of like a South American or maybe Dominican's and

2239
02:04:18.411 --> 02:04:23.300
some,
some other,
uh,
Spanish speaking people.
But when they first moved there,

2240
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:25.670
it was all Italians.
It was an Italian neighborhood.

2241
02:04:25.671 --> 02:04:28.820
The Italian immigrants would come in and my grandparents came in from Italy when

2242
02:04:28.821 --> 02:04:32.420
they were children,
their grandparents were full grown.
They took their family,

2243
02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:33.560
brought them over to Italy.

2244
02:04:33.561 --> 02:04:37.380
So both my grandmother and my grandfather were both born in Italy on my mom's

2245
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:40.260
side.
And so they,
they come over to America.

2246
02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:43.440
They all moved to this North Ninth Street neighborhood.
They have a family.

2247
02:04:43.441 --> 02:04:46.680
And then when my mom and her brothers were young,

2248
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:48.570
they did a thing called blockbusting.

2249
02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:51.870
And that's how they got people to move out of neighborhoods.

2250
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:56.150
Real estate people to generate sales would sell a house to,

2251
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:58.200
<v 3>right,
right,
right.</v>

2252
02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:00.940
<v 0>And then tell everybody,
hey,
the blacks were moving in,</v>

2253
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:03.460
<v 3>you guys are going to go down you bell south.</v>

2254
02:05:03.650 --> 02:05:07.820
<v 0>So people would sell in a panic.
But my grandfather was like,
I like black people,</v>

2255
02:05:07.821 --> 02:05:10.910
get the fuck off my lawn.
Me some cool.
He kicked him out of there.

2256
02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:11.930
My grandfather was like,

2257
02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.610
that's one thing you know you think of old Italian people's being racist.

2258
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:21.230
My grandfather,
I never saw him ever say a racist thing in his life.

2259
02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.100
His next door neighbor was black.
There's a black family that lived next door.

2260
02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:27.650
Like all throughout my childhood.
This kid,
I would play with them,

2261
02:05:27.651 --> 02:05:29.780
I would go next door and play with them.
Was this a,

2262
02:05:29.781 --> 02:05:32.980
this black family that moved next door and my grandfather and the,

2263
02:05:32.981 --> 02:05:35.780
the guy who lived next door,
they would hang over the fence.
You know,

2264
02:05:35.781 --> 02:05:38.330
the guys would like sit on the fence.
They were like,
hang her arms over.

2265
02:05:38.331 --> 02:05:40.900
So what's going on with Bobby?
How's he doing now?
Bobby's,
it's cool.

2266
02:05:40.901 --> 02:05:42.950
Like it was like they would have this bond.

2267
02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:46.670
So like racism to me was completely alien,

2268
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.370
but because of my grandparents,

2269
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:54.040
<v 3>but it's actually very empowering for a child to see their parents interact with</v>

2270
02:05:54.041 --> 02:05:55.570
different races because you,

2271
02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:58.900
you're getting different that that child is seeing other messages out there that

2272
02:05:58.901 --> 02:06:02.730
are racist.
And when you see your parent,
you know,
have a relationship,

2273
02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:07.630
it really makes you feel like,
wow,
life isn't bad.
It can be,
you know,
this is,

2274
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:10.810
<v 0>well,
there was a really poor neighborhood.
But,
um,</v>

2275
02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:14.620
my grandparents neighbors were very friendly and they got along great.

2276
02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:17.880
But the neighbor on the other side was a crack dealer.
And,
uh,

2277
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:20.380
he was a kid when I met him.
It was just a young kid.

2278
02:06:20.381 --> 02:06:25.270
We were around the same age blanket.
Yeah.
And then when I went back,
um,

2279
02:06:25.570 --> 02:06:30.100
they didn't live there anymore or do they live?
They did live there.
But anyway,

2280
02:06:30.101 --> 02:06:32.950
the kid next door was selling crack.
This was,
and I was like,

2281
02:06:33.130 --> 02:06:34.540
maybe in my twenties,

2282
02:06:34.541 --> 02:06:37.720
I came back to stay with my grandfather for awhile when I first moved from

2283
02:06:37.721 --> 02:06:39.810
Boston,
New York.
And,
uh,

2284
02:06:39.850 --> 02:06:44.620
they battering rammed his door and he fucking broke his door down like right

2285
02:06:44.621 --> 02:06:46.420
when I was moving in.
And they,
they,

2286
02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:51.060
they broke this kid's door down to rest of me at an Audi in the driveway that,

2287
02:06:51.061 --> 02:06:56.061
so the neighborhood changed radically and went from being all Italian to a black

2288
02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:59.080
and a few Italians that held out like my grandparents.

2289
02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.230
And then there was like this bakery that was down the corner that had been there

2290
02:07:02.231 --> 02:07:05.560
since like 1920,
that was all Italian.
And then,
you know,

2291
02:07:05.561 --> 02:07:09.010
my grandparents would walk to the bakery and the bread every day,

2292
02:07:09.610 --> 02:07:14.200
but then they sold the black folks sold and left two and then it became like

2293
02:07:14.201 --> 02:07:17.590
Dominicans and Puerto Rican.
Right.
It's like sort of like,

2294
02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:22.150
like in a lot of countries you have waves of immigrants.

2295
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:24.440
<v 3>Yeah.
The Dominican's have been the,
they're,</v>

2296
02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:28.280
they're not the most recent way of I now you've got eastern Europeans coming in,

2297
02:07:28.281 --> 02:07:32.840
but I mean the,
the,
when the Dominicans came in,
man,
they fucking came in.

2298
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:36.010
You talk about like,
I was born in the,
and this neighborhood called

2299
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.220
<v 2>Throggs neck.
I live at a child.
Was like five.
And that's where my mom grew up.</v>

2300
02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:41.320
That's where my,

2301
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:45.820
my wife's mother went to the same high school as my mom.

2302
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:48.760
Wow.
Saint Helen is in the Bronx and uh,

2303
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:51.940
it was a pocket of solidly Irish people and Italians.

2304
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:56.950
And to this day you walk through that neighborhood,
it's all Irish,
Italian,

2305
02:07:56.951 --> 02:08:00.700
still still some Dominican's.
Wow.
They got in there,
but it's like,

2306
02:08:00.850 --> 02:08:04.930
it didn't change.
It's still got like you go to the meat store,
you go to the,
uh,

2307
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:07.300
you know the cheese shop.
It's all,
you know,

2308
02:08:07.301 --> 02:08:11.620
there's ice cream parlor from way back when it's all,
it's like fucking Europe.

2309
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:14.380
<v 0>That's what the W W W for people don't understand.
Like,</v>

2310
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:18.610
like spike Lee was trying to fight against gentrification in Brooklyn.
You know,

2311
02:08:18.611 --> 02:08:21.520
he was talking about how it's so crazy that you know,
they,
they,

2312
02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:24.940
all these people move in and then they make these rent's expensive and the

2313
02:08:24.941 --> 02:08:28.150
people that have lived there for years and years can't live there anymore.
Right.

2314
02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:33.010
And He,
the way he's talking about like,
people are like,
well,
do you know,

2315
02:08:33.011 --> 02:08:36.010
do you live there anymore?
And he was like,
well,

2316
02:08:36.011 --> 02:08:39.760
I can't live there anymore cause I did.
But people get ringing my doorbell.

2317
02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:42.850
You know,
they knew where spike Lee lived,
lived in a normal place.

2318
02:08:42.851 --> 02:08:46.450
They just ring his door.
But y'all spike.
And he goes,
my wife made me leave.

2319
02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.550
Like you could tell when he was saying that it was true.
He goes,

2320
02:08:48.551 --> 02:08:52.300
but I still have love for that city.
But that cities like those cities,

2321
02:08:52.301 --> 02:08:54.550
especially like Brooklyn,
there's areas of Brooklyn that are just,

2322
02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:59.920
they're just moving people in and it becomes trendy to live in this once quaint

2323
02:08:59.921 --> 02:09:02.950
neighborhood.
And then the real estate just doubles.
Yeah.

2324
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.340
<v 2>Changes Venice where I,
I've got a house in Venice last 13 years and we,</v>

2325
02:09:07.341 --> 02:09:08.270
when we moved in,

2326
02:09:08.271 --> 02:09:12.770
it was like 10 years earlier was the number one homicide place in the country.

2327
02:09:12.771 --> 02:09:16.940
It was all gangs.
And then they got the gangs out and they're cute houses.

2328
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.470
Not Big,
but you know,
craftsman style houses,
but all walk streets.
So you gotta,

2329
02:09:21.471 --> 02:09:24.380
you know,
a sidewalk with house on either side.
But Calvin used to live there.

2330
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:28.130
Right,
exactly.
So,
uh,
you know,
that neighbor is fucking beautiful,

2331
02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.070
great neighborhood.
And so,
uh,
all of a sudden though,

2332
02:09:31.071 --> 02:09:33.950
it's getting to the point where my buddy was renting an apartment three doors

2333
02:09:33.951 --> 02:09:36.440
down from me.
This is the guy who I lived next door to.

2334
02:09:36.441 --> 02:09:38.840
And when I was talking about neighbors,
I was friends with a Mulberry Street.

2335
02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:42.890
This guy,
gay guy,
I became really good friends with,
he moved out to Venice.

2336
02:09:42.891 --> 02:09:46.640
So we bought,
we bought a house three doors down from him,
one of my best friends,

2337
02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.060
he's got to move their fucking tearing down his apartment and they're putting up

2338
02:09:50.061 --> 02:09:53.210
like luxury,
uh,
duplexes.
And he's like,

2339
02:09:53.211 --> 02:09:55.340
I can't afford to live in this neighborhood.
He doesn't make any money.

2340
02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:56.930
So he's like,
I gotta move back to New York.

2341
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.580
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2342
02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:03.580
Callan sold his place just when they turned the neighborhood turned because

2343
02:10:03.771 --> 02:10:08.080
Google opened up an office there.
So as Google was setting up shop there,

2344
02:10:08.090 --> 02:10:10.010
a bunch of people started looking for places to buy,

2345
02:10:10.011 --> 02:10:13.820
like executives and stuff and count and a really cool place and he made this

2346
02:10:13.821 --> 02:10:16.670
insane profit.
He's like,
just when I put it on the market,

2347
02:10:16.671 --> 02:10:18.260
that's when the property values went crazy.

2348
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:21.560
<v 2>But it's still going up.
I get,
I get offers all the time.</v>

2349
02:10:21.561 --> 02:10:26.000
I get unsolicited offers on my house for like two and a half times what I paid

2350
02:10:26.001 --> 02:10:29.960
for the house.
But I guess hanging onto it good.
Because it's got,
it's got,

2351
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:34.100
I think we're going to retire in that house some day,
but,
but the front,
it's,
we

2352
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.640
<v 3>out grew at it.
Say,
you know,
there's a front house with like,
um,
you know,</v>

2353
02:10:37.641 --> 02:10:39.410
a big bonus house in the back,

2354
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:43.160
but it's got a two bedroom apartment above that and a studio next to it.

2355
02:10:43.161 --> 02:10:47.570
So we rent out three units in the house and that's going to put the kids through

2356
02:10:47.571 --> 02:10:51.530
college and then we're going to live in it when,
uh,
when they move out.

2357
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:54.670
<v 0>That's a good idea.
That's a good move.
That community,</v>

2358
02:10:54.671 --> 02:10:58.960
like I have an affinity to be for beach communities.
Yeah.

2359
02:10:58.961 --> 02:11:02.440
I think there's something about living near the ocean that has this sort of

2360
02:11:02.441 --> 02:11:06.070
unspoken mellowness to it that just comes from being next to something so

2361
02:11:06.071 --> 02:11:09.750
humbling.
Right.
Oh,
well you can't like thank you,
really important.

2362
02:11:09.751 --> 02:11:13.150
Or you're the shit or life was so powerful and meaningful when you're standing

2363
02:11:13.151 --> 02:11:15.970
next to the most insane body of water.
Known demand

2364
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:19.460
<v 3>surfers really seem to be the happiest,
most balanced people you meet.</v>

2365
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:22.670
Their priorities just are different.
They get up early in the morning,

2366
02:11:22.671 --> 02:11:25.520
go ride some waves and then nothing else seems to matter.

2367
02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:30.490
<v 0>Oh,
I don't get it.
I mean I,
I do get it,
but I'm scared of sharks.</v>

2368
02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:31.423
So surfing.

2369
02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:35.620
<v 3>Yeah.
Surfing's a,
it's a pretty intense thing.
I mean,
I've done it.</v>

2370
02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:39.570
My daughter's really into it,
so we go a lot.
Yeah.
We,

2371
02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:41.350
last summer we would go like three,

2372
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.240
four days a week and big fucking eight foot long board and she's tiny and she

2373
02:11:46.241 --> 02:11:46.751
gets on that.

2374
02:11:46.751 --> 02:11:50.260
She's got great balance and she gets on it and she just jumps up and rides these

2375
02:11:50.261 --> 02:11:53.770
waves,
not,
she doesn't ride the big waves.
Like once they crash,

2376
02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:58.090
there's like that giant foam.
She kind of rides that.
Oh Wow.
But,

2377
02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:00.430
but actually riding a wave as a whole different story.

2378
02:12:00.431 --> 02:12:04.150
I've tried a bunch of times and man,
if the front tip of the board goes down,

2379
02:12:04.630 --> 02:12:08.470
you just flip and that Shit's flying over your head.
It's like fuck this.

2380
02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.990
<v 0>Oh,
where do you guys go?</v>

2381
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:14.640
<v 3>Venice beach.
No Shit.
Straight out.
Everybody thinks Venice beaches.</v>

2382
02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:18.720
It's got this reputation for being dirty and whatever.
That was years ago.

2383
02:12:18.721 --> 02:12:22.500
There's this thing called heal the bay that there's a lot of big celebrities

2384
02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:27.390
like Julia Louise Dreyfus and uh,
uh,
what's her name?
It was married to um,

2385
02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:28.520
Swarts and Egger.
Um,

2386
02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:33.570
Maria Shriver dare Dave been all over the shit for 20 years.

2387
02:12:33.571 --> 02:12:36.960
And the beaches they have a rating on if you've got to heal the bay.com,

2388
02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.070
it gives a rating on the cleanliness of the water from Malibu all the way down

2389
02:12:41.071 --> 02:12:44.670
to Marina del Rey and Venice beach a plus all the time.

2390
02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.480
<v 0>Wow,
that's amazing.
I didn't know that.
I had no idea.</v>

2391
02:12:47.770 --> 02:12:50.930
Does there ever any assholes surfing?
Cause that's one thing I have friends.

2392
02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.660
There is,
let's say there's a lot of arguments,
right?

2393
02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:56.470
<v 3>It's very,
um,
because it's trendy.</v>

2394
02:12:56.471 --> 02:12:59.380
You got all these guys that these newbies come in and they get their board at

2395
02:12:59.381 --> 02:13:01.450
Costco and they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

2396
02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:04.220
And it's all about when you drop into the wave,
you know,

2397
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:06.010
if another guy's already on the wave,

2398
02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:09.190
you can't get in his path or he's going to get fucking pissed and yeah.

2399
02:13:09.191 --> 02:13:10.510
There's like fist fights out there.

2400
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:14.720
<v 0>Yeah.
Some I have,
um,
a friend,
uh,</v>

2401
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:18.440
who would go surfing there and always tell some new story about almost getting

2402
02:13:18.441 --> 02:13:21.230
into a fight.
Oh,
Teddy Eft,
but Eddie F oh yeah.
Right.

2403
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.840
He tells a story about almost getting into a fight everywhere he goes,

2404
02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:28.340
it will be the fucking supermarket and I'm telling this guy,

2405
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.100
fuck you and fuck your mother.
How about that?
Right.
I know it's

2406
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.500
<v 2>true.
He's always got a story about almost getting in a fight.</v>

2407
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:37.640
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm like,
at certain point in time it might be you.</v>

2408
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:42.290
<v 2>Yeah.
What's the common denominator here?
A little wired little wire it up.
Yeah.</v>

2409
02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.520
Fucking tense young man.
All right.
That's a dangerous way to go through life,
man.

2410
02:13:46.521 --> 02:13:49.100
I realized there's Times where I'm fucking,

2411
02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.870
I'm on my edge so hard that I'm scared because I know if somebody cuts me off or

2412
02:13:53.871 --> 02:13:58.550
whatever,
yeah,
I'm going to go and I get a really fucking breathe.

2413
02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:01.520
Then I get an Irish temper.
I got a power of now at down.

2414
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.180
<v 0>Yeah,
and you have some nice guy too.
It doesn't make any sense.
Nobody.</v>

2415
02:14:06.210 --> 02:14:09.630
He'll tell these stories and you're like,
wait,
wait,
wait,
what?
Going on.

2416
02:14:09.631 --> 02:14:10.590
My interaction with them,

2417
02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:14.130
which has never been anything other than pleasant and fun like I love hanging

2418
02:14:14.131 --> 02:14:16.110
out with that guy.
I love having them on podcasts.

2419
02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:19.020
Doing comedy shows with them has always been fun.
He's a fun guy,

2420
02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:22.200
but they'll tell you these stories about told me the story about a bar.

2421
02:14:22.201 --> 02:14:23.610
We told some woman,

2422
02:14:23.611 --> 02:14:27.120
you're the worst fucking human being I've ever met in my life.

2423
02:14:27.330 --> 02:14:28.770
I hope you die in a fire.

2424
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:31.340
And he's saying all these horrible things in the fucking bars.

2425
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:34.230
Patrons are chasing them out into the parking lot and like,

2426
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:38.970
what are you doing Eddie?
What is that?
What's causing this?

2427
02:14:39.090 --> 02:14:43.010
<v 2>Right.
I like when you see comics that are like otherwise Nice,
calm,</v>

2428
02:14:43.011 --> 02:14:47.100
cheery comics and they can't handle hecklers and they just go to a fucking like

2429
02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:50.900
remember Frank Santa Rally.
Oh yeah.
Great comic.

2430
02:14:50.901 --> 02:14:52.430
One of the most underrated comics.

2431
02:14:52.431 --> 02:14:55.160
Talk about guys that didn't leave Boston that were phenomenal.

2432
02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.580
I mean the timing on that guy in his writing and everything.

2433
02:14:58.670 --> 02:15:00.560
But he did wait for a while,
didn't he?
Didn't he?

2434
02:15:00.561 --> 02:15:05.120
He wasn't surprised was the bartender,
but he didn't leave beat him up.

2435
02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:08.960
Remember?
Yeah.
I beat the shit out of him.
But he would snap man,

2436
02:15:08.961 --> 02:15:09.890
when he got heckled,

2437
02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.920
that dude got dark and he couldn't get back into his act because when you show

2438
02:15:15.471 --> 02:15:18.350
the crowd that side of you,
you can't suddenly start though.

2439
02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:20.690
And you ever noticed pigeons or Nah,

2440
02:15:20.691 --> 02:15:23.280
you just fucking almost killed somebody pray.

2441
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:29.690
<v 0>Oh yeah.
There was some dudes,
it just didn't,
not only could they not handle it,</v>

2442
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:34.250
they just,
they're,
they're cool with just evaporate right before your eyes.
Right.

2443
02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.590
You'd see what's going on really in the,
and then you couldn't,

2444
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:38.810
you couldn't take their acts seriously anymore.

2445
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:41.620
<v 2>Yeah.
Cause it was seem like you.
So that's not really you.</v>

2446
02:15:41.650 --> 02:15:44.950
I want to see that other guy.
That guy was compelling.

2447
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:46.721
Make him funny.

2448
02:15:46.721 --> 02:15:50.650
I mean that's why people loved Hicks and Kennison cause they took the two things

2449
02:15:50.651 --> 02:15:53.200
and brought them together.
Well they figured out a way.
Right.

2450
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:55.280
<v 0>Do you remember the,
the Hicks thing where he's,</v>

2451
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:58.550
some woman's heckling them in Chicago and he starts calling screaming at her,

2452
02:15:58.551 --> 02:16:03.230
calling her,
look at me.
I'm a con.
It's fucking great.

2453
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:06.140
I have carte blanche cause I've got a pussy.

2454
02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:10.620
It's hilarious.
But screaming,

2455
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:14.240
screaming as some woman who's heckling.

2456
02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.830
<v 2>It's a good release man,
man.
Anytime it happens I just make sure I tee it up.</v>

2457
02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:21.590
If there's,
if some some bitch heckling me or some guy,

2458
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:24.740
I just make sure keep giving them rope,
keep giving them rope.

2459
02:16:24.741 --> 02:16:27.950
So the crowd starts looking at you like,
hey,
you gotta do it now.

2460
02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:30.130
And then you can take all the anger

2461
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.670
<v 3>that's pent up inside of you and unleash it on this mother.
Yeah,</v>

2462
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:35.180
<v 0>that is the key,
isn't it?
You've got to play the bow.</v>

2463
02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:38.750
You gotta like pull the bow back all the way before you shoot the Arrow.
Yeah,

2464
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:42.020
if you just pull it back a little bit and shoot the air like,
oh,
what'd you do?

2465
02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.420
And they were like,
he's one of us.
Turn this up

2466
02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:47.060
<v 5>it so</v>

2467
02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:48.290
<v 0>pull it out.
So see you here.</v>

2468
02:16:48.630 --> 02:16:53.460

2473
02:17:12.170 --> 02:17:15.200
You're everything that America should be flushed down the toilet.

2474
02:17:15.201 --> 02:17:20.060
You fucking car.
Fuck you.

2476
02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.170
Go see fucking Madonna.
You fucking idiot.
Yeah.

2477
02:17:35.710 --> 02:17:39.200
The,
you can yell at a comedian.
He's not my drunk.

2478
02:17:44.310 --> 02:17:45.200
I can do it.

2479
02:17:47.430 --> 02:17:51.720
I get yelled at Barnard and I both don't get it yet cause I got it

2480
02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:58.430
fucking Scholl.

2481
02:18:01.470 --> 02:18:02.910
<v 5>Well that's some real anger,
man.</v>

2482
02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.500
Did you see him run across the stage and it was beautiful and some real anger?

2483
02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:08.990
<v 6>No.
Y'All ready to see that?</v>

2484
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:21.980
<v 0>That was ahead of its time.
Nobody did that.
Nobody.
Nobody did that back then,</v>

2485
02:18:21.981 --> 02:18:24.830
but people started doing that.
After that,
I started doing that.

2486
02:18:25.170 --> 02:18:29.660
I started going after after hecklers in the audience in a better way.

2487
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:32.540
After I saw things like that,
you realize that you,
you can,

2488
02:18:32.630 --> 02:18:36.500
it doesn't have to be nice.
Like you can get away with some shit,
right?
Yeah.

2489
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:39.950
As long as it's got enough of a buildup.
As long as the audience is on your side.

2490
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:41.520
<v 3>Yeah.
Give it context.</v>

2491
02:18:41.550 --> 02:18:45.810
Put a black hat on that motherfucker and then pull out your revolver and just

2492
02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:48.740
starts here.
And the thing is,
is like you,

2493
02:18:49.010 --> 02:18:53.310
you have to gauge any,
any,
in any given interaction to the audience.

2494
02:18:53.311 --> 02:18:58.310
You gauge who the,
you got to fucking figure it out fast.
Are they going to,

2495
02:18:58.350 --> 02:18:59.810
are they going to charge the stage?

2496
02:18:59.830 --> 02:19:02.110
Are they gonna keep heckling or are they going to leave you?

2497
02:19:02.130 --> 02:19:04.470
Gotta you gotta tear it out.
Stitches.

2498
02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:07.860
Stitches in Boston's you got into like physically attacked.

2499
02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:11.460
You got in a wrestling match with some dudes wrestling match.
No,
the guy came up.

2500
02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:14.670
He,
uh,
he took a swing at me.
I ducked,

2501
02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:18.630
I hit him in the head with a microphone.
And then he was from the Israeli army.

2502
02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:21.300
He was a cab driver who was there.
His name is [inaudible].

2503
02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:24.180
I still remember that because I said,
you know,
that's the name of the village,

2504
02:19:24.181 --> 02:19:27.830
idiot and Woody Allen's movie,
love and death.
Right.
And he came up

2505
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.610
<v 2>and he got me in a fucking headlock and that dude was spinning me around the</v>

2506
02:19:31.611 --> 02:19:36.460
stage and knocking down tables.
I couldn't get out.
And the ballot,

2507
02:19:36.461 --> 02:19:40.180
you know,
stitches.
It's,
it's the stage is surrounded by the crowd.

2508
02:19:40.181 --> 02:19:43.520
So of course everybody stands out cause they want to see the fight and the

2509
02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:47.690
bouncers can't get up there.
And so it just fucking went on for a while.

2510
02:19:47.691 --> 02:19:50.510
And then finally the bouncers came up and two of my buddies,
you know,

2511
02:19:50.511 --> 02:19:54.860
Mike Gibbons and they're at the bar and they're trying to get up there.

2512
02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:57.710
They can't get out there.
And,
uh,

2513
02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.390
the got 'em out and then the owner,
do you remember that guy?

2514
02:20:02.391 --> 02:20:06.930
I'm hairy little dude,
Harry.
He goes,
uh,
Susie.

2515
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:10.760
Yeah,
Harry could afford it.
He goes,
uh,
okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Fits you.

2516
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:14.870
Gotta you got 10 minutes left and they reintroduced me.
I'm like,
what?
Oh,

2517
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:15.690
you got fucking done.

2518
02:20:15.690 --> 02:20:19.670
So I go up and I get on stage and I got a standing ovation because they would,

2519
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:22.790
they rather see Boston.
They rather see a fight.
Then his comedy show,

2520
02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:26.650
my first standing ovation of my life and then I went to the chiropractor.

2521
02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:30.050
My neck was fucked.
Do you remember what you said to the audience?
Yeah,

2522
02:20:30.051 --> 02:20:34.220
I walked up and uh,
and they clapped and once they calmed down,

2523
02:20:34.221 --> 02:20:36.230
I looked around and I go,
all right,
who's next?

2524
02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:40.250
<v 0>Yeah,
I remember that.
I wasn't there for it.</v>

2525
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:43.730
I remember you telling me that and everybody else was talking about how you said

2526
02:20:43.731 --> 02:20:45.350
that too.
And I was like,
that's hilarious.

2527
02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:48.700
<v 2>Well actually Brian Frazier gave me the line.
He was,
he was laying on it.</v>

2528
02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:54.040
<v 0>Oh,
that's hilarious.
Yeah.
Brian Frazier,
he was fucking funny.
Tiny yet.</v>

2529
02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:57.250
He was a guy that I had to tell to stop wearing tee shirts on stage.

2530
02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:01.220
He was a rough number.
How big he was when he was doing bodybuilding.
Yeah.

2531
02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:06.730
And he,
he was like ridiculously huge.
I mean,
just giant,

2532
02:21:06.731 --> 02:21:07.564
giant arms.

2533
02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:10.450
And he would go on stage and he was wearing like a golf shirt on like a collared

2534
02:21:10.451 --> 02:21:14.620
golf shirt.
I told him,
I go,
dude,
you can't wear that.
I'll go,

2535
02:21:14.621 --> 02:21:15.750
it's too distracting.
Oh,

2536
02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:18.420
everybody's doing is looking at the size of your fucking arms.
You're,

2537
02:21:18.421 --> 02:21:21.360
you're intimidated and you're angry and you're like,
what is this?

2538
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:25.810
Like that's his act that he's getting all fired up.
Big giant fucking arms.
Right.

2539
02:21:26.290 --> 02:21:29.260
He a almost attacked a club owner in Vermont with me.

2540
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:31.690
I took him up there to Vermont,

2541
02:21:31.691 --> 02:21:36.380
we did a Gig together and Brian had sore throat and,
um,
he was,
uh,

2542
02:21:36.430 --> 02:21:40.360
he had a really good set,
but he was,
he was real conscientious,
you know,

2543
02:21:40.361 --> 02:21:44.890
and so he was apologizing to the,
the owner that his throat sore,
you know,
like,

2544
02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:49.090
he was just,
you know,
just being a good guy,
uh,
you know,

2545
02:21:49.091 --> 02:21:51.220
feeling bad that he didn't,
you know,

2546
02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:54.040
do the performance that he wanted because his throat throws a little sore.

2547
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:57.430
Meanwhile,
I was still great.
And so the club owner was like relaxed.
Like,

2548
02:21:57.431 --> 02:21:59.920
why are you,
you know,
what do ya,
what are you apologizing about?

2549
02:21:59.921 --> 02:22:01.570
Why he complained about it?
What are you Jewish,

2550
02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:05.980
he didn't look Jewish because Brian looked like he was Irish.

2551
02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:12.100
He was Jewish,
he was big giant guy with blonde curly hair.

2552
02:22:12.130 --> 02:22:14.770
Right.
So you didn't expect him to be Jewish,

2553
02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:19.780
but he was Jewish and he was really sensitive to antisemitic stuff.

2554
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:22.810
So this guy calls him,
you know,
what are you chewing?
And he goes,

2555
02:22:22.811 --> 02:22:26.730
I am fucking Jewish.
And he got really angry and you know,
he's fucking huge.

2556
02:22:26.731 --> 02:22:29.970
He's screaming at the guy with his course voice,
I'm a fucking Joe,

2557
02:22:29.971 --> 02:22:33.750
I am a fucking jail.
And it's like whoa.
He,

2558
02:22:33.751 --> 02:22:38.430
I saw him snap a few times.
You use,
he was wired tight.
He was,
yeah,

2559
02:22:38.431 --> 02:22:39.630
he had a hair trigger.

2560
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:42.810
I didn't know what was gonna happen cause he was like leaning over this guy's

2561
02:22:42.811 --> 02:22:47.490
desk and the guy was just,
you know,
fat millage dude wasn't shape at all.

2562
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:50.550
And Brian was my friend and I had to figure out like,

2563
02:22:50.610 --> 02:22:54.210
what would I do if the shit went down cause he was way stronger than me.

2564
02:22:54.211 --> 02:22:57.510
Frazier was like way bigger than me.
Right.
So I was like,
this kid get crazy.

2565
02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.510
I know what the fuck am I to deal,
but talk them out of it.

2566
02:23:00.810 --> 02:23:02.850
I'm not going to hit him.
You know,
he's my friend.

2567
02:23:02.930 --> 02:23:06.180
I hope he doesn't kill this guy.
Jesus.
If he does kill this guy,
have,

2568
02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:08.940
what does that make me in a complex?
Like how's that work?

2569
02:23:08.941 --> 02:23:10.230
I got to drive home after that.

2570
02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:15.090
It makes me in a cop taking a fugitive across state lines.
Right.

2571
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:18.660
He didn't do anything.
I mean,
boys scared the fuck out of that dude.

2572
02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:22.830
Like I never expected him to be Jewish and he also never expected him to be

2573
02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:27.360
fucking crazy either.
So when he's,
you know,
angry,
not just anti,

2574
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:32.430
you know,
not just angry about the antisemitism,
but like violently angry.

2575
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:32.900
Yeah.

2576
02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:36.050
<v 3>Plus he was,
he was frustrated.
He hadn't had a good set,
so he's already pissed.</v>

2577
02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.070
<v 0>That was fine.
That was what the guy was sad about it.</v>

2578
02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:43.630
He was just being conscientious.
Think right.
It wasn't a bad set at all.
You know,

2579
02:23:43.631 --> 02:23:47.830
it wasn't a set that you would ever be in.
There's Brian.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2580
02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:49.530
<v 4>When I was a little kid,
I was so impatient.</v>

2581
02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:52.710
I would actually just take my slinky and brought down the stairs.

2582
02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:01.420
<v 0>So you would never imagine that guy's Jewish</v>

2583
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:03.690
<v 4>people.
That's pretty much my hobby now bothering people.</v>

2584
02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:06.840
I like to go to laundromats and hide in the washing machines.

2585
02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:10.410
Someone opens up the lead to put their clothes and I pop out and go,

2586
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:11.244
I'm using this one.

2587
02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.580
<v 0>Huh?
He's a funny dude.
He was a writer.</v>

2588
02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:20.770
<v 3>Yeah,
he wrote on some shows.
I think I wrote with him on one show,</v>

2589
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:25.030
but I'm never popped as a writer.
I Dunno why,
but he's doing some other shit now.

2590
02:24:25.031 --> 02:24:27.880
It's like,
I don't know if he's doing art or a,

2591
02:24:27.881 --> 02:24:30.580
he got into something else as well as comedy.

2592
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:33.090
<v 0>Yeah.
He was always a dude with a lot of other interests.</v>

2593
02:24:33.210 --> 02:24:37.920
<v 3>This guy,
my next door neighbor in Venice,
this guy,
uh,
Danny,
he became,</v>

2594
02:24:37.921 --> 02:24:42.750
he act or one of these dudes that I'm telling you for the last 12 years,

2595
02:24:42.900 --> 02:24:47.900
he's had development deals Orlando at a pilot every single year.

2596
02:24:47.941 --> 02:24:50.880
Okay,
good looking guy.
Good Act or funny.
Not a stand up,

2597
02:24:50.881 --> 02:24:53.730
but just made for sitcoms and uh,

2598
02:24:53.731 --> 02:24:58.530
and yet hasn't really been in a show that's been on the air really at all.

2599
02:24:58.531 --> 02:25:02.310
I was on one show that was on for like four or five episodes and that's it in 12

2600
02:25:02.311 --> 02:25:04.600
years,
but the checks fucking roll in it.

2601
02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.350
So he got somehow involved,

2602
02:25:07.351 --> 02:25:09.570
but he grew up in La and he knows a lot of famous people.

2603
02:25:09.571 --> 02:25:12.990
I mean he went to school with like,
you know Jared Leto Leto or Lettow,

2604
02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.510
I'm not sure,
but he,
he's like his best friend.
And anyway,

2605
02:25:16.511 --> 02:25:19.170
so you know that artist Banksy,

2606
02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:24.490
he became the rep for banks,
these work in Los Angeles.

2607
02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:28.940
So he goes off and he is selling Banksy art too.

2608
02:25:29.770 --> 02:25:33.940
You know,
he's got a couple dozen big celebrities that buy art and you know,

2609
02:25:33.941 --> 02:25:38.560
the commissions on these million dollar pieces are fucking huge.

2610
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:41.230
And then he started getting into other,
other artists,

2611
02:25:41.231 --> 02:25:43.420
other galleries approached him.
He came over my house last night.

2612
02:25:43.421 --> 02:25:48.220
He's telling me all this shit and he is moving expensive art constantly.

2613
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:51.970
And he's like,
t he just landed another pilot.
He's like,
Dad,
I hope it goes,

2614
02:25:51.971 --> 02:25:55.570
but it doesn't mean what it is too.
That's interesting.
Yeah.

2615
02:25:55.850 --> 02:26:00.620
<v 0>Well it's,
it's smart to diversify man.
How,
especially in that business,
AL,
yeah.</v>

2616
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:04.520
Business of auditioning and trying to get someone to accept you to put you on a

2617
02:26:04.521 --> 02:26:08.510
show.
Right?
There's a reason why the culture of La so fucking Wacky,

2618
02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:12.200
and it's not just because actors are shallow,

2619
02:26:12.201 --> 02:26:13.940
it's not just because the,

2620
02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:19.050
the pursuit of fame is sort of a frivolous and ultimately like it's a pretty,

2621
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:23.690
pretty selfish pursuit.
Right?
It's not just that

2622
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:25.780
<v 3>by nature it's promoting yourself.</v>

2623
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:28.940
<v 0>Yeah.
And that that just encourages douchey behavior.</v>

2624
02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:33.230
But then you factor in the fact they're always trying to get accepted.

2625
02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:36.380
So you take people who are most likely damaged,

2626
02:26:36.381 --> 02:26:39.230
which is why they want all this additional acceptance in the first place.

2627
02:26:39.231 --> 02:26:43.450
Like why do they want to be considered to be set exceptional or f or a,

2628
02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:45.980
why do they want to be the one person everybody looks at when they walked on the

2629
02:26:45.981 --> 02:26:47.930
street?
Usually it's because they weren't,

2630
02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:51.950
they didn't feel like they were worth anything when they were young.
Right?
Right.

2631
02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:53.720
So then you take that and you have,

2632
02:26:53.721 --> 02:26:57.260
I'm auditioning for things all the time and constantly being rejected and seeing

2633
02:26:57.261 --> 02:26:59.960
other people get things and realizing that networking is important,

2634
02:26:59.961 --> 02:27:02.830
so you've got to develop your own personality so that you,
you,
you,

2635
02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.340
you fit into the establishment,

2636
02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:04.701
<v 3>Eric.
Yeah.</v>

2637
02:27:04.701 --> 02:27:08.160
You want to be what they want and you're not longer trying to be yourself.
Yeah.

2638
02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:09.133
You have to

2639
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:13.070
<v 0>aspire to whatever,
whatever political ideal that they have,</v>

2640
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:14.390
you have to adopt those.

2641
02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:19.790
Like how many people are these buttoned down liberals in Hollywood that have

2642
02:27:19.791 --> 02:27:22.070
literally never thought about any of the issues.
Right.

2643
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:23.870
And so you have discussions with them,

2644
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:27.650
whether it's a discussion about affirmative action with this discussion about

2645
02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:29.690
global warming,
whether whatever it is,

2646
02:27:29.691 --> 02:27:32.300
you find out how woefully uninformed they are

2647
02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.650
<v 3>and how awkward it is when you hold opinions that are different than theirs</v>

2648
02:27:36.651 --> 02:27:40.580
because it's really about let's all sit together and pile on the right side of

2649
02:27:40.581 --> 02:27:45.560
an issue together.
If you're not on that side,
it gets fucking weird.
Yeah.

2650
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:48.230
It's like that conversation we had about the owner of the clippers.

2651
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:51.990
Try having that shit in the,
in the lobby of the Improv with a bunch of,
you know,

2652
02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:56.930
comics that are showcasing for something.
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
Yeah.
You can't,

2653
02:27:57.020 --> 02:27:59.480
you can't,
they're all panicking.
Yeah.
It really is.

2654
02:27:59.481 --> 02:28:00.920
It's not that the people are shallow,

2655
02:28:00.921 --> 02:28:03.650
it's bringing the shallow part out of people and it really is,

2656
02:28:03.651 --> 02:28:06.050
if you put yourself like you moving to Colorado,

2657
02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.270
are you moving outside of La the way you did?

2658
02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.770
It's a choice to try to get your balance back and try to,
you know,

2659
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:17.240
work against what you ultimately have to feed into to some degree.

2660
02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:19.580
But if you live in like people that live in Hollywood,

2661
02:28:19.581 --> 02:28:20.900
I just think you don't have a fucking,

2662
02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.070
<v 0>yeah,
you're swarmed.
You're,</v>

2663
02:28:23.071 --> 02:28:25.710
you're in the cult of personality right in the middle of the wave.

2664
02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:27.800
[inaudible] trying to keep your head above.

2665
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:29.390
<v 3>You go to Ralph's to get groceries,</v>

2666
02:28:29.391 --> 02:28:32.510
you're going to bump into another actor or an agent and you're just always

2667
02:28:32.511 --> 02:28:35.990
thinking about what am I wearing?
And Yeah,
fuck that.

2668
02:28:36.030 --> 02:28:38.340
<v 0>Well,
they're also just not that fascinating.</v>

2669
02:28:38.390 --> 02:28:42.780
Now people themselves like the pursuit of fame,
the ultimate pursuit of fame,

2670
02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.370
like what we were talking about,

2671
02:28:44.371 --> 02:28:48.660
the Kim Kardashian thing is one of the best examples because it's the ultimate

2672
02:28:48.661 --> 02:28:52.820
pursuit of frame with no context behind it.
There's no substance,

2673
02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:57.870
there's no literature,
there's no,
there's no art.
There's just a person,

2674
02:28:58.110 --> 02:29:02.370
just a person that's not exceptional getting attention and that being the

2675
02:29:02.371 --> 02:29:06.330
ultimate in shallow pursuits.
If you're surrounded by all that,

2676
02:29:06.331 --> 02:29:09.030
it becomes a competitive thing where other people want to be a part of it.

2677
02:29:09.210 --> 02:29:11.190
They want to do the same thing.
They want to get in there too,

2678
02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:15.900
and if you are in that,
you step into that soup,
you're like,
ah,

2679
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:19.620
it's a lot of noise.
Nothing's happening here,
and the noise is contagious.

2680
02:29:19.690 --> 02:29:20.650
<v 3>It's contagious.</v>

2681
02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:25.651
Suddenly you find your values changing because the way you get to be Kim

2682
02:29:26.650 --> 02:29:29.830
Kardashian is you make alignments with people like Paris Hilton.

2683
02:29:29.831 --> 02:29:32.110
I mean that's how she got there.
They were best friends,

2684
02:29:32.410 --> 02:29:37.150
and then you start to realize as a person in Hollywood,

2685
02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:38.950
every conversation you have,

2686
02:29:38.951 --> 02:29:43.090
every relationship there is a power structure and somebody's trying to get

2687
02:29:43.091 --> 02:29:45.880
something from the other person and you start to think that way.

2688
02:29:45.881 --> 02:29:49.270
When you're around that all the time,
you can't.
You can't.
Especially if,

2689
02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:52.870
here's what the payoff of fame is.
Every person that's coming to you,

2690
02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:56.830
you know that they have an agenda.
That's your life.

2691
02:29:57.340 --> 02:30:01.030
<v 0>That's a lot of people's lives for sure.
Especially if you're like,</v>

2692
02:30:01.031 --> 02:30:04.870
say if you're an actor and you're in movies all the time to imagine if you are

2693
02:30:04.871 --> 02:30:09.700
Brad Pitt and you,
you'd go and anything you're doing,

2694
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:12.160
you were running into people in various walks of life.

2695
02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:15.160
How many of them are bringing you scripts?
How many of them have an idea?

2696
02:30:15.310 --> 02:30:17.830
How many of them want you to set up a meeting for them?

2697
02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:22.210
How many of them want to know if you know you have any pull on your next film,

2698
02:30:22.211 --> 02:30:26.230
like getting my brother's an actor and he's really trying hard to get his first

2699
02:30:26.231 --> 02:30:29.020
big break.
Maybe you can put them on one of your movies.
I mean,
that shit must be,

2700
02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:32.180
<v 3>or are they just want a little piece of you.</v>

2701
02:30:32.181 --> 02:30:33.710
They want to be able to take a picture.

2702
02:30:33.711 --> 02:30:36.950
They want a story that they're going to tell the rest of their life about when

2703
02:30:36.951 --> 02:30:37.761
they met Brad Pitt.

2704
02:30:37.761 --> 02:30:41.240
It's not going to be like you meeting somebody on neutral ground and saying,
Hey,

2705
02:30:41.241 --> 02:30:45.020
what's up?
Who are you?
You know,
get to know each other.
No,
it's,
this is Brad Pitt.

2706
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:48.920
I'm gonna grab a little piece of Brad Pitt that I'm going to carry with me and

2707
02:30:48.921 --> 02:30:51.980
I'm going to shit.
And you want,
and that's why people love to say,

2708
02:30:51.981 --> 02:30:55.850
Brad Pitt's an asshole.
Everyone's an asshole because that's a better story.

2709
02:30:55.851 --> 02:31:00.230
Then I walked up to him on the street.
He was busy.
He took a second out,

2710
02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:03.590
he had things to do and so we moved on.
It's much,

2711
02:31:03.591 --> 02:31:07.220
it's a much better story to go and,
Oh,
and he's fullest was fucking asshole.

2712
02:31:07.221 --> 02:31:11.540
He ignored me.
And you know,
so everybody's collecting those stories.

2713
02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:14.800
<v 0>Well,
there's always weak,
weak people that you're going to run into the,</v>

2714
02:31:14.801 --> 02:31:18.210
for whatever reason,
choose to say that you're an Asshole,
right?

2715
02:31:18.280 --> 02:31:19.760
Because of their interaction.
You,
yeah.

2716
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:22.230
If you're a guy like a Brad Pitt and you're,
you know,

2717
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:26.610
you have some weird magic trick where you,
everywhere you go,

2718
02:31:26.611 --> 02:31:27.690
everybody wants to pay attention to you.

2719
02:31:27.691 --> 02:31:31.170
And as a another person who values being themselves,

2720
02:31:31.171 --> 02:31:34.900
who thinks of themselves highly and wonders why,
you know,

2721
02:31:34.901 --> 02:31:37.590
it was fucking Brad Pitt,
what's so special about him?
You know,

2722
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:41.020
and then you meet him,
you're like,
Hey Brad,
how you doing?
He's like,
Hey Dick,

2723
02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:44.400
you fucking dick thinks he's too good for us.
Fucking Dick.
I mean,

2724
02:31:44.401 --> 02:31:46.590
when you're concentrating on him,
why are you concentrating on him?

2725
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:48.590
Cause he's got some weird magic trick and you,

2726
02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:50.690
you think that magic trick should be yours,
right?

2727
02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:52.980
<v 3>You're the one being a dick because you're walking,</v>

2728
02:31:52.981 --> 02:31:55.320
he's having dinner with his family and you're walking up to his table.

2729
02:31:55.350 --> 02:31:56.430
That's a dick move.

2730
02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:59.150
<v 0>That is a dick move.
And that's the one time I never take pictures of people.</v>

2731
02:31:59.390 --> 02:32:02.870
I've had people do that.
The come to the table to take pictures,
move.
It's like,

2732
02:32:02.871 --> 02:32:06.590
come on man.
Right?
It's so Douchey,
right?
But people don't realize it.

2733
02:32:06.591 --> 02:32:09.650
They feel like anybody they run into,
they run into someone famous.

2734
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:13.760
They can't imagine that that person gets run into people all day long.

2735
02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:18.220
They think,
hey,
this is my chance to big moment.
Kim Kardashian,

2736
02:32:18.250 --> 02:32:22.670
O m g Kim,
you're one of my personal heroes.
Can I take a photo with you?

2737
02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:27.610
<v 3>As you say,
yeah,
you're my role model.
I'm a big fan.
I love your shoes.</v>

2738
02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:30.970
Feed them whatever shit you think is going to make a connection with them.

2739
02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:36.070
But you,
you're really good after shows at meeting people,

2740
02:32:36.071 --> 02:32:38.710
you look them in the eye,
you shake their hand,
you take the picture,

2741
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:41.810
but yet you're able to fucking keep them moving.
That's,

2742
02:32:41.850 --> 02:32:46.120
that's really hard because people want to latch on.
Can I take a picture?
Uh,

2743
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:47.700
give the wife to fucking cameras.

2744
02:32:47.701 --> 02:32:50.380
She doesn't know how to work and all sudden you,
I see your lines.

2745
02:32:50.381 --> 02:32:52.990
It shows you have 50 or a hundred people waiting to say hi to you.

2746
02:32:53.350 --> 02:32:55.180
And it's hard to keep those people moving.

2747
02:32:55.310 --> 02:32:56.320
<v 0>No.
Sometimes it is.</v>

2748
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:59.140
The real problem is when people aren't even thinking about the other people

2749
02:32:59.141 --> 02:32:59.974
behind them in line,

2750
02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:02.020
like there's a bunch of other people waiting and they want to tell you some

2751
02:33:02.021 --> 02:33:04.930
story.
Like you can't tell me that story,
man.
Right.
So many people are.

2752
02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:06.670
Then some people wait till the very end.

2753
02:33:06.671 --> 02:33:10.810
They want to be last in the line and then they want to tell you this long stupid

2754
02:33:10.811 --> 02:33:15.700
thing describing some project that I'm not going to invest in.
I'm like,
dude,

2755
02:33:15.701 --> 02:33:18.460
no,
I'm not,
not interested.
I'm busy.
Well,
listen,

2756
02:33:18.461 --> 02:33:21.160
you can make a lot of money to stop.
Stop.
I'm not doing it.

2757
02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:23.860
I'm not investing in some fucking,
it's not happening.

2758
02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:24.990
<v 3>So what do you do if somebody,</v>

2759
02:33:24.991 --> 02:33:27.510
half way through the lines starts digging into a long story?

2760
02:33:27.570 --> 02:33:31.790
<v 0>Tell there's a lot of people behind them.
Yeah.
It's like,
you know,
you can't,</v>

2761
02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:34.880
you're rude.
You're being rude to these other folks.
Really rude.

2762
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:39.140
It's not going to happen.
Yeah.
The,
it's the,
it's the people that do it.

2763
02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:41.210
The people that really want to tell you the long dumb story,

2764
02:33:41.211 --> 02:33:46.090
like invest in my idea,
my,
my company,
my thing.
They're always there.

2765
02:33:46.091 --> 02:33:48.710
They're always like sort of like so bullheaded and,

2766
02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:53.180
and like really obsessed with getting someone else involved and whatever idea

2767
02:33:53.181 --> 02:33:55.340
that they're pitching,
but they're not thinking about it.

2768
02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:58.280
They're not thinking about the other people on the line and I'm thinking about

2769
02:33:58.281 --> 02:34:02.240
you or your attention span.
They're thinking about their idea.
Here's my shot.

2770
02:34:02.330 --> 02:34:05.040
Let me get it out there.
You know,

2771
02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.420
I was talking the other day about this guy who gave me his fucking movie script.

2772
02:34:08.421 --> 02:34:11.390
He wanted me to read his movie script and then get it to producers.
You know,

2773
02:34:11.391 --> 02:34:13.820
I really need a break and you've got your break and I'll go,
look dude,

2774
02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:16.250
I'm not even in the movie business.
You can't,

2775
02:34:16.251 --> 02:34:19.360
you can't just give scripts and tell me,
read them.
I don't know you.
Yeah,

2776
02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:20.141
I don't know the script.

2777
02:34:20.141 --> 02:34:22.870
You're asking for an hour and a half out of a person's time.
Yeah,
look bro,

2778
02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.110
it's really good.
It's really good.
Okay.
Then ticket to a fucking book agent.

2779
02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:30.700
That's easy for you to say,
okay,
it's easy for me you to say you helped me.
Yeah.

2780
02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:33.480
<v 3>And then also I get people that send me,
uh,</v>

2781
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:36.980
pitches for sitcoms or whatever and I always,
I don't read it.

2782
02:34:36.981 --> 02:34:39.680
I as soon as I see that's what it is,
I reply and I go,
look,

2783
02:34:39.681 --> 02:34:43.910
I'm in the writer's guild.
I am pitching my own shit.
If this is,
I didn't rate it.

2784
02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:45.620
But if it's similar to what I'm doing,

2785
02:34:45.621 --> 02:34:49.160
I don't want to be in a position where then you're claiming that it was your

2786
02:34:49.161 --> 02:34:52.430
idea.
So I'm very polite,
but I say it's just as a rule,

2787
02:34:52.431 --> 02:34:54.320
I can't read people's pitches.

2788
02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:58.050
<v 0>Yeah.
I've talked to people who say they're suing someone cause they sent them</v>

2789
02:34:58.051 --> 02:35:01.530
something and then this person had an idea that's similar and they start doing

2790
02:35:01.531 --> 02:35:05.100
it.
I know they stole my idea.
Well did they solicit that idea?
No,

2791
02:35:05.101 --> 02:35:08.730
you just send it to them.
Like what are you doing to sending people ideas?
Right.

2792
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:12.390
Well when you send it through the email,
it's like you patent it.
Like,
okay,

2793
02:35:12.530 --> 02:35:16.890
all right.
That ain't the way to do it.
Okay.
And in this weird day and age,

2794
02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:20.370
it's there's more distribution methods for ideas than ever before.

2795
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:22.350
And if you have some really cool ideas,

2796
02:35:22.650 --> 02:35:24.930
you could put your cool ideas on a website.
You know,

2797
02:35:24.931 --> 02:35:26.460
if you want to start writing books,

2798
02:35:26.610 --> 02:35:30.480
the best way to start writing is make a blog that people think is popular,

2799
02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.140
that people liked your ideas and then then sell a book from there.

2800
02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:37.590
Make something where people can share it to people for free with other people

2801
02:35:37.591 --> 02:35:38.424
for free.

2802
02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:42.380
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's a meritocracy.
I always say this about especially about stand up.</v>

2803
02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:43.540
If you're a funny Stan,

2804
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:46.330
I don't want to hear anybody complain that they can't get a break or can't get

2805
02:35:46.331 --> 02:35:49.690
seen.
If you are working hard and you're funny,

2806
02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:52.240
you will be found because there's money in it.

2807
02:35:52.241 --> 02:35:56.050
There's agents and managers and producers and studios that are looking for the

2808
02:35:56.051 --> 02:36:00.550
next fucking,
you know,
a name a star.
They,

2809
02:36:00.570 --> 02:36:04.780
there is equity in that.
So just focus on your fucking work.

2810
02:36:04.781 --> 02:36:08.200
And the same thing with writing.
Like you said,
put it out there.
If it's good,

2811
02:36:08.201 --> 02:36:09.610
it will be found

2812
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:14.710
<v 0>and stand up as an interesting thing for women too because although it's harder</v>

2813
02:36:14.711 --> 02:36:18.010
I think to be a woman and to be a standup comic,

2814
02:36:18.011 --> 02:36:21.520
I think there's like more subjects that they have a hard time covering that they

2815
02:36:21.521 --> 02:36:24.310
have a hard time audience getting the audience to accept them.

2816
02:36:24.311 --> 02:36:28.060
Talking about things like having an opinion on politics or having an opinion on

2817
02:36:28.061 --> 02:36:31.390
certain social issues that may be,
yeah,
that may be controversial.

2818
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:33.640
Whereas the guy can maybe guys,

2819
02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:39.150
other guys will listen to a guy having opinions on those things before they'll

2820
02:36:39.151 --> 02:36:42.170
listen to a woman.
But if a girl can be funny,
the,

2821
02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:46.270
the possibilities are giant.
Like for a really funny woman,

2822
02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:48.710
like doors just opened up like there's so many,

2823
02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:53.620
<v 3>well look at it right now.
You look at Chelsea handler and Whitney and um,</v>

2824
02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:57.730
uh,
what's your name on comedy central that has that Amy Schumer?

2825
02:36:58.210 --> 02:37:03.010
I mean it is a time when the industry is looking for strong female voices and

2826
02:37:03.011 --> 02:37:07.030
they're getting ratings and a,
and once you get it,
you write the book.

2827
02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:09.400
You didn't stand up dates,
you get the shell.
I mean,

2828
02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:11.630
Whitney at one point at three fucking shows on last,

2829
02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:15.880
<v 0>Kathy Griffin,
this,
this,
the ones that were really Sarah Silverman,</v>

2830
02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:20.870
the ones that are really good,
they just become,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

2831
02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:23.780
there's a huge market for a really funny woman.

2832
02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.400
It's also like their comedy relates to women in a lot of ways that are common is

2833
02:37:28.401 --> 02:37:32.870
just not going to just like music,
just like writing.
Like anything else.

2834
02:37:32.871 --> 02:37:36.560
Like women have,
a lot of women have a very different sense of humor than men do.

2835
02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:36.891
<v 2>Well,</v>

2836
02:37:36.891 --> 02:37:41.891
and also they say that women are the ones that primarily decide when and if

2837
02:37:42.291 --> 02:37:44.570
you're going to a comedy show and who you're going to go see,

2838
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:45.770
because think about it,

2839
02:37:45.771 --> 02:37:49.160
you're sitting at home on a Friday after work and your wife goes,

2840
02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:52.730
what do you want to do?
And I,
oh no,
no.
Well there's this and then you've,

2841
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:53.960
you do what she says.

2842
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:58.700
<v 0>I think maybe 30% of the people that come see me or women.
That's it.
Yeah,</v>

2843
02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:03.020
maybe.
Probably about 30 yeah,
it's mostly dudes.
Yeah.

2844
02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:05.120
Nothing you can do about that.

2845
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:10.180
Comedy central show at one of the highest male percentage audiences they've ever

2846
02:38:10.311 --> 02:38:10.540
seen.

2847
02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:14.290
<v 2>Well,
that's what the network wants.
75% and they want that.
Yeah.</v>

2848
02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:17.080
You are the sought after demographic.
Well,

2849
02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:19.640
I think the women is a sought after demographic too.
I mean,

2850
02:38:19.641 --> 02:38:21.130
you look at Chelsea handler,
look at,

2851
02:38:21.131 --> 02:38:25.180
you know Amy Schumer Shields,

2852
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:30.010
the gay men know they both have huge gay male populations.
That's interesting.

2853
02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:34.240
And those guys are great because they have disposable income because majority of

2854
02:38:34.241 --> 02:38:35.110
them don't have kids.

2855
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:36.100
<v 0>Right?
No babies.</v>

2856
02:38:36.101 --> 02:38:38.920
And they don't have to impress each other the same way that men have to impress

2857
02:38:38.921 --> 02:38:39.970
women.
They're both men.

2858
02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.240
<v 2>Right?
You want to fuck?
No,
I was going to ask you if you wanted to fuck.</v>

2859
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:47.560
Let's fuck
both hitting not each other.

2860
02:38:47.561 --> 02:38:51.040
They look fucking head budding.
Right,
right,
right.
Hey,
you want to fuck?

2861
02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:53.460
Fuck you man.
I was about to ask you.
Oh,

2862
02:38:53.470 --> 02:38:55.830
I said at first I was thinking that you read minds.

2863
02:38:55.870 --> 02:38:59.090
I wonder if you get to fuck the guy.
If you ask first,
maybe that's,

2864
02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:04.120
that's really,
really horrible things.
It's not a horrible thing to say.

2865
02:39:04.121 --> 02:39:05.980
The only id,
the only reason why it's a hard,

2866
02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:11.020
<v 0>bold thing to say is because really ultra sensitive progressive's have made such</v>

2867
02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:14.880
a big deal out of gay people that you think it's a horrible things.

2868
02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:17.890
<v 2>You think they do rock scissors.
That's probably what they do.</v>

2869
02:39:18.310 --> 02:39:20.920
They probably are messed up to see who gets to suck cock first.
Yeah.

2870
02:39:20.921 --> 02:39:23.800
Maybe it's like Dick Condom balls.
There's something

2871
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:27.680
<v 0>run with that idea and it's probably likely,
but you know,</v>

2872
02:39:27.681 --> 02:39:32.120
you gotta be real sensitive about even cracking a joke about gay men lest you be

2873
02:39:32.121 --> 02:39:36.350
considered homophobic.
Yeah,
that's it.
That's a weird thing,
man.

2874
02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:39.410
Just because you make fun of gay people doesn't mean you're homophobic.

2875
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:41.630
Gay people or men or men are hilarious.

2876
02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:44.900
We're hilarious in our pursuit to dump loads,
right?
You know,

2877
02:39:44.901 --> 02:39:48.470
find people to help us release loads.
Help me please.

2878
02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.990
And Gay guys are just as Hilarious as we are.

2879
02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:53.310
<v 2>Well,
and the beautiful thing is like with women,</v>

2880
02:39:53.311 --> 02:39:57.330
you really got to gauge their mood,
their cycle there.
You know what,

2881
02:39:57.331 --> 02:39:58.830
what conversations you've had lately,

2882
02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:02.610
don't be disrespectful and treat them like meat.
Men want to be treated,

2883
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:05.160
not treated like meat.
There's no emotions here.
I got to,

2884
02:40:05.161 --> 02:40:09.660
I got a sack that needs emptying and you're a human.
Let's do it.

2885
02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:14.760
Fuck,
I wish I was gay,
man.
I really do.
They got,
you got options.
Damn.

2886
02:40:14.761 --> 02:40:18.630
Especially if you could date a guy who's into sports that just hangs out and

2887
02:40:18.631 --> 02:40:21.660
then you just happen to dump loads in each other.
I just,
Scott Kennedy,

2888
02:40:21.690 --> 02:40:22.410
so he's joking.

2889
02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:26.160
<v 0>Roundabout.
Yeah.
Scott can bless him.
God bless him.
Rest his soul.</v>

2890
02:40:27.090 --> 02:40:29.610
He used to always joke around about it cause he was like a real,

2891
02:40:29.730 --> 02:40:34.320
he was a gay guy,
but he was like this real like jockish gay guy.

2892
02:40:34.321 --> 02:40:37.400
Really big.
Always were football jersey.
Yeah.

2893
02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:40.410
And just gay unabashedly gay as fuck.

2894
02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:44.760
And he would let the audience know like quite a few minutes into his is
actually,

2895
02:40:44.761 --> 02:40:46.350
if you can find any scar Kennedy Online,

2896
02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:50.220
he would let the audience know like you know,

2897
02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.570
oh well he would wait a while into his act before he ever let him know that he

2898
02:40:54.571 --> 02:40:55.150
was gay.

2899
02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:58.250
<v 2>And you,
and then he would say it.
You thought he was kidding at first?</v>

2900
02:40:58.251 --> 02:40:59.590
The took a while to sink in.

2901
02:40:59.790 --> 02:41:03.150
<v 0>Yeah,
I saw him in Houston.
I first saw him in Houston.
He was a Houston comic.</v>

2902
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:04.290
Right.
And uh,

2903
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:08.430
he was a part of that wave of really good guys that came out of the laugh stop

2904
02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:12.430
in river oaks.
Yes.
Sean rouse.
Yup.
Uh,

2905
02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:16.980
John Wesleyan came out of the day.
Matt Kirsh.
Yup.
And there he is.

2906
02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:18.420
Look at that.
That guy's gay guy.

2907
02:41:18.670 --> 02:41:20.570
<v 5>Good on you.
Good</v>

2908
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:23.800
<v 7>to be honest.
Every day at work be like,
yes.
Snickers or three for a dollar,</v>

2909
02:41:23.801 --> 02:41:24.910
but your fat ass doesn't need,

2910
02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:31.060
do I have a supervisor?
Yeah,
he'll be back in like an hour.

2911
02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:33.490
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

2912
02:41:34.930 --> 02:41:38.820
<v 7>Tock Tick Tock.
You got to go.
Ah,</v>

2913
02:41:39.250 --> 02:41:42.700
I read this in the paper today.
Made me feel really old.
Uh,
the show cops,

2914
02:41:42.701 --> 02:41:46.930
the TV show cops has now been on the air for 20 years.
I know,

2915
02:41:47.430 --> 02:41:49.210
but you know why it's been on the air for 20 years.

2916
02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:52.030
It makes us feel better about our lives.
Don't you think?

2917
02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:54.940
Cause I don't care how messed up your family is.

2918
02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:58.080
Never quite as screwed up as the people on cops.
You know,

2919
02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:01.840
<v 2>what show was he on his,
obviously some television,
right?
Ferguson,</v>

2920
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:04.510
which by the way,
he just,
uh,
he just quit.

2921
02:42:04.511 --> 02:42:08.710
Did you hear about the stories and just sharing to why ran out of funny?

2922
02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:14.200
Well,
listen,
real,
there's some real estate out there right now.
You know,

2923
02:42:14.201 --> 02:42:18.130
there's some empty time slots,
comedy central and um,
you know,

2924
02:42:18.131 --> 02:42:20.950
with Letterman leaving,
I think that's why you retired to go over there.

2925
02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:23.970
They may be,
who knows if there's a deal in the works.
I mean they,

2926
02:42:23.971 --> 02:42:27.700
they gotta they gotta replace a a bunch of spots now.
Right.

2927
02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:29.200
<v 0>Well he does a lot of stand up.</v>

2928
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:33.280
I know that any probably also makes a lot of money and probably maybe it got to

2929
02:42:33.281 --> 02:42:35.230
a certain point in time.
He does.
Once it kicked back.

2930
02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:37.980
<v 2>I don't think he makes shit on that show either.
I know,
I know.</v>

2931
02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:40.530
The Kilborne wasn't making shit one time spot.
Yeah.

2932
02:42:40.531 --> 02:42:44.500
It's a Letterman owned a piece of property.
It's worldwide pants.
Uh,

2933
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:47.310
they control that hour after letterman's.
What are you saying?

2934
02:42:47.370 --> 02:42:52.050
Wasn't making shit like what do you mean?
I'm talking 10 grand a week.
What,

2935
02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:57.030
what?
Wait.
Oh,
when the show started out,
remember when Kilborne left?

2936
02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:00.780
They had auditions.
Remember they rotated people in.
They had like five,

2937
02:43:00.781 --> 02:43:04.160
six people coming.
Jeff Ross did a week.
Um,

2938
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:08.700
Mike Lee Black did a week and Ferguson did a week and it was like five of them

2939
02:43:08.701 --> 02:43:12.280
and then they chose the host based on,
and I happen

2940
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.420
<v 3>to have,
I had access to what those people were being paid for that week.</v>

2941
02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:20.710
And the understanding was that's what you're going to make for the series.

2942
02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:24.190
And the money was like 10 grand a week.

2943
02:43:24.250 --> 02:43:26.530
There had been some sort of a renegotiation,
well,

2944
02:43:26.531 --> 02:43:28.180
I'm sure I definitely has gone up,

2945
02:43:28.181 --> 02:43:31.330
but when you start at that pay scale and you know,
the Ray,

2946
02:43:31.331 --> 02:43:35.080
I don't know what his ratings were,
but um,
you know,
you look at these,
I mean,

2947
02:43:35.081 --> 02:43:36.910
what was the Letterman make in a year?
20 million?

2948
02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:40.120
<v 1>I Dunno.
I've never paid attention.
Yeah.</v>

2949
02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:43.710
But I bet it was a lot more than 10 grand a week.
All right.
Holy Shit.

2950
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:47.350
<v 3>So I think he was anytime a guys touring on the weekends while he's got his own</v>

2951
02:43:47.351 --> 02:43:51.010
nationally syndicated nightly shell things are a little light.

2952
02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:53.600
<v 1>Why doesn't he like live in New York also?</v>

2953
02:43:53.601 --> 02:43:57.090
And like fly in right before the show every day and then fly backwards.

2954
02:43:57.110 --> 02:44:01.730
He doesn't want,
I heard something isn't just don't speculate.
Yeah.
Wow.

2955
02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.200
And then he had some books that did extremely well.
Really well.
He's huge.

2956
02:44:06.201 --> 02:44:10.480
And uh,
you know,
the United Kingdom.
Oh,
is he?
Yeah.
And then,
yeah,

2957
02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:14.750
he started out.
He was big over there as a comic.
Yeah.
It's a good comic.

2958
02:44:15.090 --> 02:44:18.640
That's interesting,
man.
I think he's gotten better.
I think he was,
you know,

2959
02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:21.860
a lot of these British comics have a hard time translating to American crowds.

2960
02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:25.870
I think he made the adjustment over the last few years.
I've,

2961
02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:28.220
I've done gigs like right after he was there.

2962
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:31.940
He's done like some of the same theaters that I've done and they stay here,

2963
02:44:31.970 --> 02:44:33.080
comes in,
just leaves.

2964
02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:37.070
Does this show and bolts is in right before lands?

2965
02:44:37.071 --> 02:44:38.990
Private jet takes off afterwards.

2966
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:40.650
<v 3>Would I do if I was wearing,
you know,
how much,</v>

2967
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:44.640
how hard is doing daily fucking shell.
And then on the weekend you're flying out.

2968
02:44:44.641 --> 02:44:47.370
I'd be in and out.
You got,
I mean,
guys get to sleep.

2969
02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:51.920
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
It's interesting because those,</v>

2970
02:44:51.921 --> 02:44:53.270
I think those shows,

2971
02:44:53.810 --> 02:44:58.700
those nightly talk shows the way in the format they're currently stuck in.

2972
02:44:58.730 --> 02:45:02.690
I think that's like,
it's like old movies.

2973
02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:05.350
It's like watching like a silent movie,
right?

2974
02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:08.870
It's like why would anybody want to come on and talk for five minutes?

2975
02:45:08.871 --> 02:45:11.930
We'll be right back and pray that the band plays you out.

2976
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:15.830
Why is there a band play?
What the fuck is going on?
What am I,

2977
02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:19.420
you're just keeping my attention.
It's got pants,

2978
02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:24.640
Dota and the band and the cuts to tide is the best thing I've ever had at

2979
02:45:25.071 --> 02:45:29.270
getting the shit stains out of my diaper.
I Shit my pants.

2980
02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.620
<v 3>I know.
I was thinking about that this morning.</v>

2981
02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:36.240
I was thinking about Kimmel and about his great fucking guy and he's a friend of

2982
02:45:36.241 --> 02:45:39.960
mine and I think about what he puts himself through on a weekly basis.

2983
02:45:39.961 --> 02:45:43.200
You got to get there in the morning,
starting from scratch.

2984
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:44.880
You're going to do a show in eight hours.

2985
02:45:44.881 --> 02:45:49.350
That's going to be an hour long packed with jokes,
topics,
opinions,

2986
02:45:49.410 --> 02:45:51.750
interviews,
uh,
taped pieces.

2987
02:45:51.751 --> 02:45:55.320
You've got to shoot during the day approving stuff.

2988
02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:57.570
You got network notes you've got,

2989
02:45:57.630 --> 02:46:02.040
I mean it goes on and on every day,
week after week.

2990
02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.020
Why?
What the fuck?
That's crazy.
I mean it's one thing.

2991
02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:08.250
You're doing a podcast.

2992
02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:13.460
This is with very little prep with good support and the expectation that you

2993
02:46:14.571 --> 02:46:16.940
know what you're going to do is free and loose and honest.

2994
02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.640
That is so formulated.

2995
02:46:20.130 --> 02:46:23.970
<v 0>It's very formulated,
very time intensive,
requires a lot of PR,</v>

2996
02:46:23.971 --> 02:46:26.580
a lot of people to book things and schedule things.

2997
02:46:26.581 --> 02:46:29.760
You've got to get the network behind everything.
You have to have commercials,

2998
02:46:29.761 --> 02:46:32.970
you have to have promotion,
you have to have support.
Who's on before you?

2999
02:46:32.971 --> 02:46:37.260
What's your lead in?
You know a,
well if this guy does Kimmel,

3000
02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:39.600
they won't let them do Fallon and then you've got to deal with,

3001
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:43.430
<v 3>Paul was doing radio interviews around the country every day to promote the</v>

3002
02:46:43.431 --> 02:46:44.264
shell.

3003
02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:49.580
I mean I used to think that was the dream that I,

3004
02:46:49.581 --> 02:46:53.390
that was the job I wanted,
but I think I'd only want it for like a year.

3005
02:46:54.050 --> 02:46:55.580
I think that you could do it online.

3006
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:57.440
<v 0>You can do almost the exact same thing.</v>

3007
02:46:57.530 --> 02:47:00.320
If you look at some of the lineups that you see,
like even on Letterman,

3008
02:47:00.321 --> 02:47:02.240
you see some of the people that are on Letterman,
you're like,
hmm,

3009
02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:05.480
how's that any different than a podcast?
It's really not.
I mean,

3010
02:47:05.481 --> 02:47:09.350
occasionally they,
they get like u two or something like that.
Right.
You know,

3011
02:47:09.351 --> 02:47:10.410
and you can't get that.

3012
02:47:10.850 --> 02:47:14.060
I think you probably would be really hard to get you to the play on your
podcast,

3013
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:18.470
but it might happen.
And lab in a year from now.
I mean,
look,

3014
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:21.580
we have Everlast plays on the podcast.
How's it pains?

3015
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:25.580
One of my all time favorite rap bands that have done the last Everlast spin on a

3016
02:47:25.581 --> 02:47:30.320
bunch of times,
but he plays,
he plays acoustic songs on here all the time.
So,

3017
02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:34.830
you know,
we've had,
we've had a lot of Dave Nevara interesting people.
Hey,

3018
02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:37.460
you and Dave had like a little few.
Danny became buddies.

3019
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:41.900
<v 3>Yeah,
I was talking shit.
Well,
I did the porn awards and I hosted the porn awards.</v>

3020
02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:44.360
Uh,
mostly it was just a dream of my mothers.
And,
uh,

3021
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:49.190
and so I went off and I was in Africa with my family.

3022
02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:52.700
We were in South Africa on vacation for like three weeks and they were staying

3023
02:47:52.701 --> 02:47:55.720
another week.
And I had to go home to go.

3024
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:59.030
I flew directly to Vegas and told the story along with the joke,
right?

3025
02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:02.090
And I said,
I say to my wife at the airport,

3026
02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.500
who's more likely to get aids this weekend?
May Are you.
And so,
uh,

3027
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:09.020
so I go there and I'm,
I'm doing my,
you know,
you do like 10,

3028
02:48:09.021 --> 02:48:14.021
15 minutes at the beginning and is 5,000 coked up porn stars and they're all,

3029
02:48:14.930 --> 02:48:15.171
you know,

3030
02:48:15.171 --> 02:48:18.500
they got a camera in the audience and the chicks are showing their tits and you

3031
02:48:18.501 --> 02:48:23.450
know,
porn stars,
it's all about them.
And you got to make it all about you.

3032
02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:25.910
So it was tough.

3033
02:48:25.940 --> 02:48:29.060
And then I got him and I couldn't get Dave Navarro.

3034
02:48:29.061 --> 02:48:32.810
He's sitting in the front row and the dude is just like looking down,

3035
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:37.250
he's not making eye contact,
get sunglasses on.
And I start to feel like it's,

3036
02:48:37.310 --> 02:48:41.510
you know how it is a comic,
you step one person's not laughing,
it bothers you.

3037
02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:44.270
Now,
make it a big celebrity and now make it,

3038
02:48:44.271 --> 02:48:45.980
you feel like everybody's looking at him,

3039
02:48:45.981 --> 02:48:50.000
looking at you because he's a big star and that's affecting how they're
laughing.

3040
02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.180
So I go on stern the next week and I start talking about it and I,

3041
02:48:54.470 --> 02:48:57.440
I went too far.
I called them a Douche and whatever.

3042
02:48:58.610 --> 02:49:03.260
I called him the Mexican prince.
And uh,
and so anyway,
uh,

3043
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:07.170
so then he went on stern and of course stern pulled up the clip and played for

3044
02:49:07.171 --> 02:49:08.004
Dave

3045
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:11.550
<v 2>and Dave.
He called me a cunt.
And then it,</v>

3046
02:49:11.551 --> 02:49:14.340
when I was doing Carolla's podcast and I talk shit about,

3047
02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:18.780
and it went back and forth,
mostly mostly me.
And then I was a,

3048
02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:22.500
I was the head writer on David tells show the Gong show and they used to bring

3049
02:49:22.501 --> 02:49:26.850
in celebrity judges.
So Navarro is one of the three celebrity judges.
It's,

3050
02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:31.530
it's triumph,
the insult dog comic.
And I forget the other guy,
I,
Andy,

3051
02:49:31.531 --> 02:49:35.610
Dick and uh,
Dave Nevara.
And so before the show,

3052
02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:39.600
one of my jobs was we had jokes prepared for each of the acts that they were

3053
02:49:39.601 --> 02:49:42.750
going to see.
And we would basically put them all up on the board and say,

3054
02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:46.350
who wants what?
And they'd read them and they'd pull the index card down.
Like,

3055
02:49:46.351 --> 02:49:49.690
all right,
I got this one on the guy on stilts and Andy Dick's.
Got It.

3056
02:49:50.010 --> 02:49:53.580
So they're all picking the jokes and then Navarro is there and we're standing

3057
02:49:53.581 --> 02:49:58.560
there and he's looking at the jokes and I go,
if there's anything you need,

3058
02:49:58.561 --> 02:50:01.650
he goes,
oh.
And I threatened to kick his ass

3059
02:50:04.050 --> 02:50:07.230
on the air.
And he goes,
so you still want to kick my ass?

3060
02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:11.040
But he said it with this little glint in his eye and we both just started

3061
02:50:11.041 --> 02:50:14.210
laughing.
You know,
it's funny,
we just laughed.
And then,
uh,

3062
02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:17.820
by the end of the show he gave me his number.
I started texting with him,

3063
02:50:17.821 --> 02:50:21.150
he came on my radio show,
my podcast,
and we,

3064
02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:23.730
and these come back a bunch of times since.
Great fucking guy.

3065
02:50:23.810 --> 02:50:26.410
<v 0>That's hilarious.
Did you apologize?
Did He,</v>

3066
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:31.190
<v 2>yeah,
I apologize.
Oh,
that's funny.
I said,
I was out of line.
He goes,</v>

3067
02:50:31.191 --> 02:50:33.650
you know,
he goes,
you know what the worst part is?
The truth is,

3068
02:50:33.860 --> 02:50:35.120
I thought you were fucking hilarious.

3069
02:50:35.121 --> 02:50:38.330
I told all my friends about how funny you were.
He goes,
I just,
he goes,

3070
02:50:38.331 --> 02:50:42.200
I had had a Gig the night before.
I flew to Vegas.
I did red carpet all day,

3071
02:50:42.470 --> 02:50:46.310
and then I was so tired of that thing.
Wow.
Yeah.

3072
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:49.130
I stopped doing that shit.
I used to,

3073
02:50:49.131 --> 02:50:53.480
I used to fucking call people out all the time.
I,
it's not worth it anymore.

3074
02:50:53.481 --> 02:50:55.010
You're wrong.
Most of the time

3075
02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:59.510
<v 0>it's also a negative.
Yeah.
Ignore them,
but better off ignoring,
I mean,</v>

3076
02:50:59.511 --> 02:51:00.620
it's one thing to make fun,

3077
02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:02.810
like if Dave Navarro was wearing something really silly,

3078
02:51:02.811 --> 02:51:06.860
if he starts wearing dresses,
you know,
which he might,
you know,

3079
02:51:06.861 --> 02:51:10.940
you could start mocking them.
Nothing wrong with that,
but to just get angry,

3080
02:51:10.941 --> 02:51:14.450
fuck that Douche,
like that Kinda,
that's encouraged.
And a lot of radio shows,

3081
02:51:14.451 --> 02:51:15.950
like that's a big thing with radio,

3082
02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.550
like these angry call outs where people just as a,
you know,

3083
02:51:19.551 --> 02:51:22.970
ranting and screaming about someone who's not there and shitting all over them

3084
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.740
unless they really fucked up,

3085
02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:27.950
unless there's something really wrong with them or they did something really

3086
02:51:27.951 --> 02:51:30.530
offensive most of the time.
Still worth it.
Yeah.

3087
02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:36.060
<v 2>And I've done it to comics and then you're in a green room at a fucking show,</v>

3088
02:51:36.061 --> 02:51:39.540
you know,
like an la show and you just kinda like,

3089
02:51:39.541 --> 02:51:44.100
I had an experience with a comic like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just,
um,

3090
02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:48.990
I apologize.
Oh,
and then I shit on carrot top one time on Stern,

3091
02:51:49.230 --> 02:51:52.440
you know,
when you were young coming,
like when I first started doing stern,

3092
02:51:52.441 --> 02:51:56.640
I was still like that,
you know,
that shit on carrot top that makes me edgy.

3093
02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:00.300
And so I'm making fun of carrot top.
And then like,
uh,

3094
02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:03.450
about a month later I'm at the Improv and I'm waiting at the valet parking for

3095
02:52:03.451 --> 02:52:05.800
my car and then he walks out and waiting and,

3096
02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:10.300
<v 3>and I,
I look at him and he looks at me and then I go,
uh,
I go,
hey man,</v>

3097
02:52:10.301 --> 02:52:13.750
I'm sorry about what I sat on Stern.
It goes,
and he goes,
hey,

3098
02:52:13.751 --> 02:52:16.990
don't worry about it man.
We're comics.
We just fuck around.
It's just jokes.

3099
02:52:17.230 --> 02:52:22.150
Totally let me off the hook was so cool that it made me feel even worse.

3100
02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:24.730
Apparently his name's Scott something who needs just,

3101
02:52:24.731 --> 02:52:28.270
apparently he's just the nicest guy in the world and you get older and you

3102
02:52:28.271 --> 02:52:32.170
realize who the fuck am I?
Carrot top is really,

3103
02:52:32.171 --> 02:52:36.100
really good at what he does.
Like no one's doing prop shit anymore.

3104
02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:39.220
And then I watch them.
It's like,
it's clever.
His audience loves it.

3105
02:52:39.250 --> 02:52:43.360
He ain't taken asses out of my seats.
My fans aren't going to see Karen Thomas

3106
02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:47.300
<v 1>was,
who cares?
Cares.
Yeah.
He um,</v>

3107
02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:49.220
Hicks used to shit on carrot top.

3108
02:52:49.370 --> 02:52:52.820
Of course I saw Hicks do a whole bit where you will start reading off of like,

3109
02:52:52.821 --> 02:52:54.500
who's going to be there at the,
uh,

3110
02:52:54.501 --> 02:52:57.920
the upcoming like things on the pamphlets that they would move on the desk and

3111
02:52:57.921 --> 02:53:01.220
he picks up,
he goes,
oh,
carrot top.
So that's for people to think Gallagher's too.

3112
02:53:01.221 --> 02:53:04.520
Heady.
He goes,
I like gallery,

3113
02:53:04.521 --> 02:53:06.230
but I don't understand all the references.

3114
02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:13.740
