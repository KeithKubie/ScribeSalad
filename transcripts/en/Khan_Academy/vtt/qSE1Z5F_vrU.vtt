00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:02.446
- [Voiceover] How much time has passed

00:00:02.446 --> 00:00:03.527
from the time on the left

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:04.972
to the time on the right?

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:06.720
So, we have a clock on the
left and a clock on the right

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.718
with different times shown,

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:10.825
and we want to know how much
time since the clock said,

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.657
that read this first time,
'til it read the second time.

00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:18.598
We're also told the time
passed is less than 12 hours.

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:19.951
That's helpful.

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.906
That means we know that
this first clock wasn't

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:23.372
say some time on Monday

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:25.435
and the second was sometime on Wednesday,

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:28.649
and these hands have been
going around and around.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.566
We know that time passed
is less than 12 hours.

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:35.099
So, the first thing I think we should do

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.634
to find out the difference in these times

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:38.757
is to figure out what are these times.

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:40.672
Let's read these clocks.

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:42.490
Over here on the left,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.650
looking at our hour hand first,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.402
it's between six and seven.

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:49.539
So, the hour hand starts at the top

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.956
and it's gone passed six o'clock,

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.919
but it's not quite to seven.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.406
So, it's six something.

00:00:55.406 --> 00:00:57.424
Could be six fifteen, six twenty,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.187
we'll figure out the minutes next.

00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.977
But we know it's some
amount of minutes after six,

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:03.477
but not yet seven.

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.213
And now let's look at those minutes.

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:08.784
The minute hand, again started at the top,

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:10.101
and it's gone five minutes,

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.351
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:18.853
Can't go to 45 here, so
we've got to count by ones.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:19.770
41, 42, 43!

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:26.464
It is 43 minutes after six
o'clock, or 6:43 on the left.

00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:33.147
On the right, our hour hand
is just after the nine,

00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:35.223
so it's soon after nine o'clock,

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:37.389
but it's definitely not to 10 yet.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.117
And then our minute hand, right here.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:42.042
Start at the top

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:45.792
and it's five, 10, 11
minutes after the hour.

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:48.709
On the right.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.666
So, the clock on the right is 9:11.

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.730
And now what we want to know
is how long does it take

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.266
to get from this first time, 6:43,

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:02.099
all the way to the second
time, which is 9:11.

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:04.779
One way we could figure
this out is to break it

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:05.972
into little parts.

00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:07.722
Let's first, let's first just see

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.032
how long does it take
to get to seven o'clock?

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:13.145
So, in this first clock
as soon as the minute hand

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:15.466
gets up to the top it'll be seven o'clock.

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.845
Let's see how long is that.

00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:21.128
From here where it is,
it has two more minutes

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:23.054
to get to the nine.

00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:27.392
And then from there it has
five, 10, 15 more minutes

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:30.497
to get all the way to
the top of the clock.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.574
So, until seven o'clock
it'll be two minutes

00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:34.308
plus 15 more minutes,

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:37.225
or we can write that as 17 minutes.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.953
Then from seven,

00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:46.771
let's stick with the hours for a second.

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.236
Let's just get from seven to nine o'clock.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.713
So, from seven to nine.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.425
At seven o'clock the hand is at the top,

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.066
it'll go all the way around one hour

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.541
to be eight o'clock.

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.056
All the way another
hour to be nine o'clock.

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.442
So that's a total, from seven to nine,

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:02.525
of two hours.

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:07.689
And then finally from nine

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.388
to 11 minutes after nine.

00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:12.623
The minute hand will be at the top

00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:15.961
and it'll go five, 10, 11 minutes.

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.711
So, this will be 11 more minutes.

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:22.866
So, in total,

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:26.305
from 6:43 all the way to 9:11

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:31.979
is 17 minutes, plus two
more hours, plus 11 minutes.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.907
So, we could write that,

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.899
that's going to be two hours,

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.147
and then we can combine
our minutes, 17 and 11.

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:41.980
17 and 11.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.781
That'll be eight ones,
a 10 and a 10 is 20.

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:48.031
So, 28 minutes.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.294
It takes two hours and 28
minutes for the clock to go

00:03:56.294 --> 00:03:59.820
from 6:43, this time on the left,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.343
until 9:11, the time on the right.
