00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today's experiment is sponsored by HelloFresh. Hey guys

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.850
I'm Nate and today we have taken a coconut, made a mold of it,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.080
And we're going to see if we can make a candy coconut using chocolate, white chocolate, and Sprite. you can hear liquid swishing around inside

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.309
It and when you crack it open

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.038
You can see the shell, the meat, and the liquid just like a real coconut. This box mold should seal up nice and watertight

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.619
But just to make sure it doesn't fall apart while we're molding in it. Let's use some tape wrapped around it to hold it closed

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.139
With the Box taped up you'll now be able to pour the melted chocolate in and swirl it around without any worry about it leaking out the sides

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
To get the right color for the shell. I think milk chocolate is the clear winner

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.789
Ice and liquid looking chocolate once you've got your chocolate nice and liquid from the microwave

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.429
Pour in much more than you're going to need to make sure you can swirl it around and get a nice even coat inside

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.339
Now you want to make sure you pour out any excess chocolate so you don't have a shell, that's an inch thick--that's no good

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.439
To get a nice even coating it helps if you can keep the block rotating every once in a while while the chocolate cools down

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.500
As soon as it gets to a point where it's not really runny anymore

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.740
And it's not swirling around the sides you should put it in the fridge for

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.500
15 to 30 minutes to help it cool down so that it doesn't get melted by the next layer

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.540
With the first layer nice and cool

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.380
It's time to add another one

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280
One one layer of this chocolate may not be quite thick enough to represent the shell of the coconut you can easily have two bags

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.769
Of the chocolate to microwave and pour into your mold

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
I didn't use all the chocolate from my first bag, so instead of using a second one

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.680
I kept it in a small bowl

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.499
Surrounded by hot water that did a really good job of keeping the chocolate nice and liquid as our shell cooled down

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.659
So now it's time to repeat the same process

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.939
Pour too much chocolate into the mold

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.719
Swirl it around until it coats everything and then pour out the excess

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.559
Keep it swirling until it's coated everything and the chocolate has started cool

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.739
And then pop it back in the fridge for another 15 to 30 minutes

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.559
Two layers of the milk chocolate should be enough to build up a nice

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.270
shell around our coconut

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.419
So now it's time to do the meat of the coconut the white portion

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.540
This of course is thicker than the shell in a coconut

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.519
So we're going to try and do three or maybe even four layers of the white chocolate inside our mouth chocolate

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.700
With the white chocolate we need to do the same thing we did with the milk chocolate

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.970
Pour it in more of the white chocolate then we're going to need swirl

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
It around so it coats every edge pour out the extra and then pop it in the fridge

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280
After the last pour you'll want to leave the mold and the casting in the fridge for at least an hour

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.770
We really want it to cool down inside

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.439
We're gonna be using some sprite as the liquid inside the coconut, but if there's too much carbonation

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.279
Then when we try and seal the coconut off all the pressure is going to break it apart

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.850
So we really need to make this some very flat soda

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.359
So let's pour some of this off into a cup and then pop it in the vacuum chamber

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.970
To really pull out all the extra carbonation

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.779
That might have been a little bit more than was necessary

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.439
We did have a little bit more liquid in the cup than I was anticipating so we had some spillage, but I

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.209
Believe what we have in this cup is probably just the right amount of very flat

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.590
Lemon-lime soda give it a quick taste see if there's any fizz left in it

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.370
No

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.840
No, there's not while we're waiting for the mold and casting you cool down

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.869
We can throw the cup in the fridge with them, so the liquid is cold as well

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.489
At this point the casting inside the mold should be all cooled down, and we have some very flat

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.819
Pool sprite which at this point really looks just like water

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.850
But it is still lemon-lime flavored so that's gonna count

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.729
We do want to patch this hole up after we fill the sprite, so I do still have some of our milk and white chocolate

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.130
Let's clean up all the edges pour the sprite in and then see what we can do about patching it up

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.459
using some of our extra chocolate your goes let's try adding our flat sprite into our candy coconut

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.810
It's not filling it all the way

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.039
But that's what we want you can hear the empty space sloshing around inside the coconut

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:50.939
So we're not going for 100% full because we do want to get that sound of liquid jostling around in there

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:56.279
That's pretty full and I think it will do a pretty good job of emulating the inside of coconut now

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.179
Let's take some of our extra white and milk chocolate and try and seal it in there

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.030
With all of the chocolate cooled down nicely inside our mold it is time to remove it and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.399
Reveal our coconut within but first let's learn about our sponsors. If you like to cook at home hello

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.269
Can hear the liquid sloshing around that's a good side

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.619
The tricky part of course is getting the coconut out of the mold without breaking it hopefully

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.929
We've got a nice strong shell and interior made of five layers of cast chocolates

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.669
Yes

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.130
Half a coconut

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.289
That is half of a coconut

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.889
This is the easier side to get off because the back of our coconut has all of this husk bit on it and it makes

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.889
For a much more grippy side of the mold

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.050
still

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.620
If it's a very good start, I'm seeing a little bit of leakage I

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.130
Think our sprite is making it out of the stopper

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.659
Change up our angle of attack just a little bit keep it vertical

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.910
Yes

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.349
haha

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:29.510
now for the most part

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.839
This is looking good our pour spout as you can see is still a little bit sloppy

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.289
And it's very hard to work with the chocolate inside the mold

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.189
So let's just level off our pour spout and touch it up with a bit more of the milk chocolate

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:57.279
Well let's look at our comparison test between the Real coconut and the chocolate coconut they have about the same weight

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.949
Which I think is a good sign. They're obviously the same size and shape since one is molded and cast off of the other I

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.059
Hear liquid sloshing around in that one I

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.660
Hear liquid sloshing around in that one at this point what we really need to do is see the inside

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.280
So let's crack this sucker open

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.519
I am told the best way to crack a coconut is to strike it against a sharp rock perpendicular to the seam

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.369
Opposite the largest of the three portions, so that's right here. We've got ourselves a sharp rock

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.570
I'll try it with the real coconut first, and then see how the chocolate coconut reacts

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.680
There it is let's put pretty nicely in half right there Cheers

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.230
So that's what happens with the real coconut pretty good half split now

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.809
Let's see if we have a similar result with our chocolate. I know that the chocolate is more fragile

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.030
I just don't know how much more fragile

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:06.969
Just like our real coconut though. This is full of liquid so it's gonna spill out quite a bit

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:12.760
I'm hoping I have a nice big piece kind of like this that I can catch some of the liquid in and drink it out

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.550
it

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.550
here goes I

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:26.410
Guess this is harder than I anticipated all right. I'm gonna try this again. I'm just gonna hit harder one two three

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.389
Think the chocolate is harder than the real coconut

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
Oh

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.180
Oh, it's cracking there. We go. Oh there it is

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.539
our chocolate coconut insides

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.589
Well the two liquids definitely didn't taste the same one of course tasted like coconut water and the other one tasted like flat sprite, but

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.380
The shell on the chocolate one

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Is a lot better

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.179
Now this doesn't have a perfectly even distribution of the chocolate unsurprisingly

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.459
It's a lot thicker down at the bottom where I would set it down to cool even though I tried to let the chocolate cool

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.950
Down before I put it into the refrigerator

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:21.460
I guess it was still slumping a little bit so we have thinner walls near the for spout thicker walls near the bottom

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.459
But overall I'd say that it's unmistakably a coconut

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.519
