[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:09.272
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:10.248
CASPER KLYNGE: Hello.

00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:10.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:11.700
RASMUS GREVE: Welcome.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.787
Thank you for coming.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.870
I guess we can take a seat
or something like that.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.960
CASPER KLYNGE: Sure.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.418
RASMUS GREVE: We
can also stand up.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:19.440
I don't really
have a preference.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.050
Welcome here today,
your "Tech-cellency,"

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.462
if I'm allowed to call you that.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:31.050
I mean, I've been in talks
with you for a little while.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.390
I am super, super
excited about you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.940
coming today and talking
to us, and telling us

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.450
about what you do.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.542
But before we begin, since--

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.250
I've been at Google
for a very long time,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.570
but I also know people
that work in the embassies

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.485
and in diplomacy, and that's
a lot of different approach

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.110
to things-- can you
please just tell me

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.030
about your first
meeting with Google

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.897
in this capacity
as an ambassador?

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:53.730
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.729
Well, first of all, thanks
for hosting me today.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.650
And thanks, also,
for listening in.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.200
Yeah, I'm a career
diplomat so, you know,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.317
normally this is the kind
of gear that you wear,

00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:05.400
and we're here because of
the UN General Assembly.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.860
So suits and,
actually, ties is sort

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.570
of part of the uniform today.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.125
But when I arrived in
Silicon Valley 12 months ago,

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.000
one of the first meetings
we had was actually

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.040
in Mountain View with
the Google headquarters.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.374
And it was a clash of
two different cultures

00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:22.290
and, to some extent, a
clash of civilizations.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.930
Because, together with
my deputy, we went there,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.060
more or less, dressed like this.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.180
And our counterpart came out
in flip-flops and short shorts,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.294
and I think an old
Metallica t-shirt.

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:35.460
And we actually have a
fantastic picture where we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.150
standing next to each other.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.762
And for me, this
was the wake-up call

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:40.470
that we actually need
a dialogue, the two

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.430
different worlds.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.014
And after that, we also went
out to buy a lot of jeans

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:45.180
and a lot of white sneakers.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.720
And now the uniform
is different,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.560
and we also, in that area, are
a little bit different than what

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.049
diplomats are normally like.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:51.840
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.564
I did hear about you saying
that you'd made really

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:55.605
poor financial decisions.

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:56.317
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:56.317 --> 00:01:58.525
CASPER KLYNGE: I have too
many suits, basically, now.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:01:59.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.290
RASMUS GREVE: So you're the
world's first tech ambassador

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.090
appointed by a country.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.850
Can you explain to the
audience a little bit more

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.010
about what a tech
ambassador does,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.110
and the whole idea behind it?

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.610
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah, sure.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
Well, if we go back a
year or so and, perhaps,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.870
one and a half years ago,
there was an innovation process

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900
inside the Danish government
and inside the Foreign Ministry,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.730
where we looked a
little bit on trends

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.130
and how to bring, basically,
the Foreign Ministry

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.020
into the 21st century.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.990
And some very talented
younger colleagues came up

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.420
with a number of
different ideas.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.080
And one of them was to
appoint a tech ambassador.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.840
And the reason for this are
two trends, if we look at it.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.930
One being that we think
technolo-- and probably,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.846
I don't have to convince
anybody in this room,

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:52.351
or anybody watching in--

00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.600
that technology is going to
be one of the main drivers

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800
for global development.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.960
It's going to have a
lot of positive effects,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.240
but it might also have a couple
of challenges along the way.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.590
In other words, technology
will be defining the winners

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.300
and losers of tomorrow,
but it will also

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.280
define some of the
foreign policy,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.050
or international
relations, of this world.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.440
Also, balance of
power, where I think

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.690
things like machine learning,
artificial intelligence,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.050
perhaps even IoT, is
going to be as important

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440
as conventional weapons,
or even nuclear weapons.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.420
So the mindset of
looking at technology

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.430
from a foreign
policy point of view

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.830
goes to the core
of this initiative.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.890
And the other trend, or
the other main reason

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.146
why we did this was, of course--

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:35.520
and this one, I
know I don't have

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.630
to convince anybody about
sitting here today--

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.990
is that some of the big
technology companies,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.160
not least in the US, are
becoming very, very big, very

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.350
influential, not least
with the platforms

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.890
that you guys have developed
and built and utilize.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.330
But we also see, increasingly,
that companies are perhaps

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.840
using that platform
power also to begin

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.040
influencing policies, and
the direction of this world.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.650
So we, basically-- or
the Danish government

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
basically decided that
instead of just watching

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.170
the future pass by
outside the windows,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.750
we wanted to actually
begin treating

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.810
the industry and technology
and digitalization

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.339
as a foreign policy priority.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.720
And by creating this
first-ever tech representation,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.580
and begin dealing
with these issues,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.010
to seek to influence the
direction despite being a very

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.400
small country.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.590
RASMUS GREVE: And what
would a company like Google

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.780
have to gain by engaging and
meeting with a tech ambassador?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.530
CASPER KLYNGE: I think
you have a few more

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.060
users than the size of
the Danish population.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.650
But I think the basic
idea behind this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.467
is actually that we
can't do it alone.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:48.300
I think government is
always trailing behind

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.600
on new technologies.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.780
We don't necessarily get
it right on regulations,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.670
on legislation.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.140
Our policies are
being challenged

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.070
because of the fast pace
of these new technologies.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.730
And whether you call
it the digital age

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.150
or the fourth
Industrial Revolution,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.191
it doesn't really matter.

00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:05.610
Because I think the gap is
widening on our ability,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.740
as governments, or as
international organizations,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.740
to actually cope
with the future.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.640
But I don't think
that companies are

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.404
able to do it alone, either.

00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:17.070
And of course, we
might discuss a couple

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.220
of examples over the
last couple of months,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.550
or the last year or so.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.800
But I think the point here
is that we need each other.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.380
We need to work closer
together than we have, perhaps,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.490
in the past.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.830
And we need to find
joint solutions

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.990
on some of the big issues,
both global issues,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.590
but also national issues.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.860
So this is basically a
very big, warm, fuzzy hug

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.310
from the Danish government
to the tech industry.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.520
But also a subtle way of saying,
we need to come closer together

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.631
and we need to find,
together, solutions

00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.880
to some of the big issues
that we are faced with, also

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.980
on a global level.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.360
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.177
And as we talked about, there's
one part where you're always

00:05:54.177 --> 00:05:56.010
saying, oh, governments
are trailing behind.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.300
And digitalization for
governments and all that.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.850
But tech companies,
as well, need

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.660
to also be really
at a level of how

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.270
governments are thinking about
protecting their inhabitants.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.710
And not only
protecting, but also

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.330
offering them
opportunities, and not

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.770
letting them get caught behind
in this global tech revolution

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.520
that we're seeing.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.470
Let's just call it the
fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.886
I think that's a
nice term for it.

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:22.146
Because there are so many things
that are happening out there.

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.850
And just to dial it back a
little bit-- because we start

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.490
out-- we always talk
about it like it's

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.047
Denmark and, full disclosure,
I am from Denmark.

00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:31.630
I've been living
here for eight years,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.270
but I still have
a very big stake

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.450
in thinking how interesting
this is, you know?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.320
So maybe you could explain
to the world, why Denmark?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.010
Such a small little country
on the northern tip of Europe,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.730
with the population size
of Colorado, for Americans.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.300
Why is it Denmark, of all
countries, that start--

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.720
that becomes the first to
appoint a tech ambassador,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.230
and give them the mandate,
you, to go out there and try

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.022
and engage with us?

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:01.355
CASPER KLYNGE: Well, I think
there are three reasons why

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.290
we came up with this.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.140
First of all, we had
some extremely talented

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.537
younger colleagues, who saw this
and who came up with the idea,

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.870
and who were able to convince
the senior management back

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.960
home that we needed to
go in this direction.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.210
The other reason is,
of course, that we

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.360
have a little bit of street
cred on digitalization

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.180
because we are a
very digital country.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.666
Whether you look at UN
assessments or European Union

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:29.040
assessments, we
normally come out

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.860
at the top of these
assessments, in terms

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.050
of public digitalization.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.440
You probably know that
90% of all communications

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.590
between the government
and citizens in Denmark

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.190
are, today, electronic.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.762
I think that's an
all-time world record.

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:45.470
Which means that, if
my grandmother needs

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.480
a new driver's license, She
has to log on to a computer

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.160
and go online to
actually get that.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.290
And so we have a tradition
for being quite digital,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.550
and also using this
as an actual thing.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.000
If you look at something
which every single Dane has,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.100
that's a civil registry
system, something

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.660
called the CPR system.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.439
It's basically a number--

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.980
a personal identification
number that

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.260
is given to you within
minutes after your birth,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.150
and it follows you
throughout your life.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.920
And that contains
a lot of the data

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.290
that other countries are, today,
discussing whether you need

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.220
sort of a whole of
government approach,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.270
or a universal identification
system, where you can store

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.610
medical records or
educational records,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.800
and so on and so forth.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.194
And that's an integral
part of the Danish society,

00:08:33.194 --> 00:08:34.860
and I think it's also
one of the reasons

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.929
why we have a high degree of
trust in public government.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.760
That's perhaps actually
one of the differences

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.610
between Denmark and the US.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.199
We tend to trust the
government quite a lot.

00:08:47.199 --> 00:08:49.740
I think, at least in the part
of the world, or part of the US

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.360
where I'm living,
in Silicon Valley,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.700
there seems to be a
little larger trust

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.450
in the private sector
and in companies.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.710
But the way we use that
trust in government

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.160
is that we have the system.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.670
It hasn't been
breached or hacked yet.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.580
And hopefully, it
will never do that.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.040
But it actually offers a lot
of opportunities for using

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.700
this data which is available.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.870
So I think those
two, three things

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.390
are one of the reasons why
we came up with the idea.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.370
But the last one
being that we've

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.400
always been a small
country, an open country,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.130
very dependent on others,
also because of our size.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.000
So looking into how we prepare
ourselves for the future--

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.920
what will it mean
for our labor market?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.230
What will it mean for
full global affairs?

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.100
How can we continue to
take a responsible approach

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.860
to helping other parts of the
world that are, perhaps, doing

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.570
less well than we are?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.040
So that's the last reason why, I
think, we took this initiative.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.290
RASMUS GREVE: And in that
vein, and our history

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.520
of using big data as a
way of the population

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.240
trusting the governments with
our data and, you know, we--

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.310
it is quite wild to
think about that.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.750
The government
actually has access

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.460
to all your health
information, and all

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.250
your income tax information
and all these things.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.920
Do you feel that
that's a driving force?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.970
That the population of
Denmark says, all right.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.840
We trust the government to
forge these relationships

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.160
with tech companies.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.460
And this is why it's not the
US or China or France that's

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.822
gone out and done
this initiative?

00:10:24.822 --> 00:10:26.280
CASPER KLYNGE: I
think, by the way,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.310
we might come back to that.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.110
Other countries are
looking at what we're doing

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.290
with quite a lot of interest.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.790
And I think a lot
of other countries

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.720
are considering whether to
appoint tech ambassadors,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.220
whether it will be
in Silicon Valley

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.530
or in Beijing or in
Hangzhou or somewhere else.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.456
I think that's not
the important bit.

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:41.830
But the fact that
other countries

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.120
are getting
inspiration from what

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.911
we're doing, and
acknowledging that we need

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:48.160
to treat technology and
digital platforms in a more

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.650
systematic way, is positive.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.750
To some extent,
it's part of my KPI

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.130
that we deliver other countries.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.380
Also because it's super
lonely to sit out in Palo Alto

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.630
all by yourself.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.380
I really miss the
National Day receptions,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.890
which are such an important
part of diplomacy these days.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.300
I don't, actually.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.560
But nobody is watching, right?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.870
So I can be completely
honest here.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.370
RASMUS GREVE: They
will, eventually.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.467
It's going into the blog.

00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:12.800
CASPER KLYNGE: But I think
the trust thing is important.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.591
But I also, to be very
honest, sitting here

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.560
in front of techies,
who understand this much

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.050
better than I do, we
have a high degree

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.140
of confidence between
the citizens of Denmark

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.150
and the public sector.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.650
When you look at perception
data on globalization,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.090
or where the world
is heading, the Danes

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.880
are, generally, also
quite optimistic.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.330
They look at the future
in a positive light,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.270
even despite global
affairs and issues

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.345
that you might
point to currently.

00:11:42.345 --> 00:11:43.720
But I think it's
also fair to say

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.460
it doesn't take too much or
too many Facebook Cambridge

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.610
Analytica cases to perhaps
tilt that confidence.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.550
And we spoke a little bit about
the CPR civil registry system

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.051
before.

00:11:55.051 --> 00:11:56.716
And of course, one
of the reasons people

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.850
trust this is because
it hasn't been breached,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.580
it hasn't been hacked.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.020
But one could
imagine, of course,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.710
that the public trust
in these systems

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.495
could go sour if we see
more of these big scandals.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.620
So that's another reason
why we need a conversation

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.000
with technology companies.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.375
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:17.480
we have a lot of focus,
right now, on data ethics,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.910
also on cyber security issues.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.540
So we make sure we protect these
systems against malign actors,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.320
basically.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.940
RASMUS GREVE: And I would
also say, as a comment,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.620
working at Google--
and I've been here

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.030
for these last 9,
almost 10 years.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.240
What's happened over
the last year has--

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.950
for the first time--

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.040
from a personal perspective,
I work on these platforms--

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.190
is that we are, all of a sudden,
on the wrong side of the trust

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.600
conversation, right?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.070
That's kind of new for us.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.360
It's always the governments
that the public mistrusts.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.415
It's usually the
tech companies that

00:12:51.415 --> 00:12:54.460
have been good beacons, and
stewards of all this data,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.470
and all these things,
which we still are.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.990
But it's just the-- the fact
is that many of the things

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.510
that we offer and have has
far-reaching implications

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.977
that we might not have
been able to predict.

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:06.810
But I can say that the
discourse, internally

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.800
in the company, is very much
what you're saying there.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.780
We need to make sure
that we get around that.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.350
CASPER KLYNGE:
That's good to hear.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.141
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:14.800
I guess that's why
you're here today.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.660
It's not a, oh, tech diplomacy?

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.340
We're just going
to shut the door.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.270
It is a thing that's
on everybody's mind.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.200
And we can also see there's
a lot of audience here.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.660
That's a good point, right?

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.100
I started out saying,
ask questions,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.250
because technology can
really cover everything.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.440
There's not a lot
of things that's

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.190
not influenced by technology.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.340
Your water is data-driven.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.920
Everything that is put into
it, that's tech-driven water,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.420
whatever.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.670
But I would say that
a fair question could

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.810
be what have been at the core
of your work the last 12 months

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.960
that you've been
a tech ambassador?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.020
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.360
Well, one of the differences
between the job I have now

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.860
and some of the jobs I've
been doing previously is I

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.240
get one question all the time.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.770
What on earth are you doing?

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.440
And what is the success criteria
for actually doing that?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.910
And I can tell you, nobody--

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.640
I came directly from
Jakarta in Indonesia--

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.440
nobody ever asked
me the question,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.940
what do you actually
do, and what's

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.880
the added value of having
an embassy in Indonesia,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.470
or having an ambassador
in Indonesia?

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.440
I get that question
all the time.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.770
And my answer is not
very sexy, but I'll

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.100
give it to nonetheless.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.040
What we are trying to do is
basically elevate our dialogue

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.990
with the tech industry,
with the companies,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.490
but also with
other countries and

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.200
international organizations.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.170
It's not a coincidence we're
meeting today during the UN

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.720
General Assembly week, because
technology and digitalization

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.750
is going to be an important
topic on development,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.712
on the future of the
multilateral systems.

00:14:50.712 --> 00:14:52.420
But the core of what
we are trying to do,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.794
and what my team
is trying to do,

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:56.620
is to offer to
Danish authorities

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.980
a formalized platform for
having a dialogue with companies

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.540
like Google, or
some of the others--

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.141
Alibaba, Tencent-- on
a wide range of topics.

00:15:05.141 --> 00:15:06.140
And what does that mean?

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.310
It means that we're
doing exactly the same

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.090
as other embassies all
over the world, not

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.830
only Danish embassies, but US
embassies or Belgian embassies.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.980
And that is represent Danish
authorities on whatever

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.150
topic might be relevant.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.650
So in other words,
one day, it might

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.441
be coming soon to
Mountain View and saying,

00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:25.870
we'd like a conversation
about data privacy.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.450
The next day, it might be a
question of digital taxation,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.550
because that's a
topic that is very

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.620
much on the agenda
in Europe these days.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.440
A third day, it might
be, how could we

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.320
get access, or convince
Google to do investments

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.284
in data centers in Denmark?

00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:42.700
And the third day, it might
be on some difficult questions

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.660
on, how do we avoid
platforms being

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.520
misused for radicalization,
extremism, or terrorism?

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.550
So that wide range of
topics goes to the core

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.444
of what we're trying to do.

00:15:53.444 --> 00:15:55.360
I think it's important
to say that this is not

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.400
a pessimistic tech agenda.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.550
And I'm not saying this
to be friendly to techies

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.660
in this room.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.130
But this is really
about using and reaping

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.440
all the opportunities that
technology brings about.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.970
And we, fundamentally,
think that technology

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.680
will do good for this world.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.716
But we also have a
realistic view on it,

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:15.340
where we think we
have to work together

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.010
with Google, with others, to
make sure that we mitigate

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.220
those areas where there are real
dangers and real difficulties.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.010
For example, on creating
global inequality

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.920
or a digital poor part of
the world, which I personally

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.350
think is going to be one
of the major challenges,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.330
getting the
remaining 3.5 billion

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.030
people online so
they can also reap

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.370
the benefits of these issues.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.120
But at the core of
what we're trying to do

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.370
is really this
government-to-industry

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.150
conversation.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.920
And in that sense, what
I do was very old school.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.910
In fact, I would argue that it's
sort of bringing diplomacy back

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.590
to its roots.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.140
Diplomacy has always been about
putting people into hotspots

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.060
where changes were underway.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.630
In the old days, it was
typically into war-prone areas,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.340
or where conflict existed.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.110
Today, it's about
putting diplomats

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.750
into the heart of
Silicon Valley so that we

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.420
can have conversations with you
guys on how we fix the world,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.599
or we make sure that
we don't undermine

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.700
some of the key values
and institutions

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.800
that we've been working
on for a very long time.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.440
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:14.940
I think--

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.060
CASPER KLYNGE: So
small, easy issues.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.851
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:17.680
Small, easy issues.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.762
But we also have to
cope with the fact

00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:22.470
that there's something
called legislation

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.240
that you guys represent.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.060
We must-- looking
at legislation,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.060
which is a tool you guys
have, is a tool that

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.530
the governments--

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.330
the US, everybody has.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.820
You can say legislation and
technology definitely does not

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.120
always move at the same speed.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.430
And obviously, we can talk
about GDPR as an example.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.430
Many people in here has
been involved with that.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:51.790
And while it has
been in the works

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.310
for several years, when
you look at how long it

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:59.720
takes from just an example to
actually be put into practice.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.380
We can also see that,
in California, they

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.380
can push the Consumer Privacy
Act through in, I guess,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:05.980
two months.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.140
That was real fast that
they do these things.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:14.560
That's a part of it that's very
interesting to how legislation

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.230
and the political
agendas and all that

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.350
is not always fine-tuned.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.709
To come up with
emerging technology,

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:21.250
and then we look at
what is coming up

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.790
with blockchain and AI,
when we look at decision

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.740
making in governments.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.455
What do you feel that we--

00:18:29.455 --> 00:18:30.970
you and I, and
everybody else here--

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.589
can do to close the gap between
technology and regulation?

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:37.630
And we can start saying,
what can governments do?

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.463
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:18:38.463 --> 00:18:41.570
Well, a couple of different
angles on that question.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.150
Of course, the million
dollar question,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.702
how do we fix these issues?

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.660
Well, I think, from a
government point of view,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.270
we have to recognize
that we are going

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.520
to be challenged over
the next couple of years,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.150
over the next decade, because
of the pace of new technologies.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.710
You mentioned blockchain.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.350
I think IoT is
another good example.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.808
And of course, machine learning
and artificial intelligence

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:03.740
is probably going to
transcend everything we do.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.960
I mean, no sector will
be left untouched.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.580
No industry will
be left untouched.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.900
And therefore, no government
will be left untouched.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.200
I think, from the
industry side--

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.920
and I don't want to be
too rough on big tech.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.420
But what I would
say is that I think

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.910
we have a shared
responsibility here.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.580
One of the things that I
continue to argue quite a lot

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.770
is that we might not see
eye-to-eye between Europe

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.720
and the US on some
of these issues.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.850
There has been a bit of
tech clash in Europe.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.460
And I think, on the US
side, there has been,

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.130
perhaps, some concerns
about the direction

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.380
that Europe is taking,
GDPR being one of them.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.659
I think anti-trust
legislation is another one.

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:45.200
But it doesn't change the fact
that we have to stick together

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.690
because we're still
products of the same values

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.345
that we paid a very
high price to get to.

00:19:51.345 --> 00:19:53.720
And the conclusion of that is
that we have to work, also,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.239
to find the right way forward.

00:19:55.239 --> 00:19:57.280
And just to take one
example, if you'll allow me,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.470
Rasmussen, digital taxation.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.990
I know it's a tricky issue.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.502
It's a tricky issue
in Europe, and I

00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:04.460
know it's a tricky issue
also with headquarters

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.320
of tech industries.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.840
But if you look at Europe,
technology companies

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.990
pay around half of what
traditional companies are

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.102
paying in taxes.

00:20:13.102 --> 00:20:15.560
And you could say, well, that's
a smarter way of operating.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.730
But for most European countries,
this is an existential issue.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.040
Because this is what basically
undermines our ability

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.800
to pay for education,
health care, basically

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.430
to uphold the welfare state.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.290
There are a couple of proposals
from the European Commission

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.994
currently being discussed.

00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:33.410
I don't think
they're particularly

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.230
popular in Mountain View,
but you can correct me

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.770
if I'm wrong on that one.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.320
But it doesn't
really change what

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.090
I think is the way
forward, and that

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.790
is that we have to work
together on finding solutions,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.146
also on, for example,
on digital taxation.

00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:47.520
So what I mean by
that is I think

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.170
we need to enter a
contract where we come

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.230
to the industry also
looking for advice,

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.880
looking for some suggestions on,
what is the right way forward?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.710
Not to stifle
innovation, to make sure

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.950
that we have a pro-tech,
pro-platform environment

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:04.790
in Europe.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.250
But we also expect,
from the tech industry

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.140
and from the senior
management teams,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.640
that they help us to find
the right way forward.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.300
It's not good enough to say
we don't like the European

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.542
Commission's proposal.

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.000
And when you then
ask the question,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.290
so what should we do
instead, the answer

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.100
is, well, that's not
up for us to define.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.920
I think it is, and I think
that's where we are today.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.170
A crossroad where
we have to expect,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.840
from the senior management
of the tech industry,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.270
that they help us define
the right way forward,

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.040
whether it is on
digital taxation,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.487
or whether it's on regulation,
or whether it's on legislation.

00:21:37.487 --> 00:21:40.070
Because the absence of that is
not going to help the industry,

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.570
and it's certainly
not going to help

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.560
the governments or, in
our case, Europe, either.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.364
So that's the way
forward, in my view.

00:21:46.364 --> 00:21:48.530
That's what we're trying
to do with this initiative,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.580
I believe.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.730
RASMUS GREVE: I see it,
and I could, at some point,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.680
say the communication is pretty
much one-way, as you're saying.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.640
We do get engaged and
say, we don't like that.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.130
But maybe we could build a
feedback loop, in that sense.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.720
But yeah, that takes
time, and that's

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.220
why you're the first
tech ambassador

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.750
to start getting
these things going.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.070
It's a legislation again.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.820
That's the tool that
sets in one way,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.360
and maybe there's a gap
in legislation in Europe

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.400
that needs to be
fixed, and agreed upon

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.340
by member states in
the European Union.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.930
CASPER KLYNGE: No, absolutely.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.145
Can I just add
one thing, Rasmus?

00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.353
RASMUS GREVE: Yes, of course.

00:22:21.353 --> 00:22:22.910
CASPER KLYNGE: I think--

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.860
I don't think I'm
revealing any state secrets

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.200
by saying that, of course,
Europe is not always

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.380
united on how we deal with
technology and digitalization,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.980
how we deal with the big
technology companies.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.870
There are different
views among the EU-28--

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.142
or EU-27, soon.

00:22:39.142 --> 00:22:41.600
But what we offer-- and I think
that goes a little bit back

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.670
to one of your first
questions-- what's

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.920
the value proposition
that we bring also

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.690
to a company like Google?

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.000
Well, that is to have a
dialogue, also on the issues

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.250
we might not see eye-to-eye on.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.790
It's also an opportunity
to begin discussing,

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.910
how do we create the
regulation of tomorrow

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.820
so it doesn't undermine
the commercial activities

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.850
of the tech industry?

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.229
Which is perfectly fine for us.

00:23:04.229 --> 00:23:06.020
We don't have any
problems with monopolies.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.690
We don't have any problems with
companies growing and making

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.500
money, as long as
that is not misused--

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.960
that dominant position
is not being misused.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.890
So I think companies
like Google or Facebook,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.280
or Alibaba and others, they
will find no better friends

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.560
than Denmark, in the sense
that we have always been light

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.210
on regulation,
but we have always

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.420
been right on regulation.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.870
We have to make sure that we
go in where it matters, also

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.080
to protect our institutions and
democracy and human rights--

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.480
all the big stuff
which is important,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.730
and which we fought
quite a long time for,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.700
over several centuries.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.240
We have to make sure we don't
undermine those institutions.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.976
And having that discussion,
and bringing the two parties

00:23:43.976 --> 00:23:45.350
together, I think,
is going to be

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.019
essential in the next decade.

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:49.310
RASMUS GREVE: And I think,
from a personal perspective,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.050
and all that, and I
think I'm speaking

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:56.480
for many that it is actually a
point where we should get to.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.640
Technology moves at such
an increasingly fast pace,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.056
that even if you
are in it, you're

00:24:00.056 --> 00:24:03.720
not necessarily always able
to protect the influences

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.470
it has all around.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.120
And this is the
exponential change, right?

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.725
It is faster and
faster and faster,

00:24:08.725 --> 00:24:10.100
Moore's law and
all these things.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.250
And the human brain
thinks linearly,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.310
and so does organizations.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.850
You don't necessarily
get into that,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.490
but we'll try and
get ahead of that.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.510
It would be the
aspiration, in that sense,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.050
and why you are here.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:28.840
But let's try it and look
at a little bit of a wider

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.380
perspective.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.540
Because your mandate
is actually global.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.940
We've been talking about the
US and the European Union

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.815
and all these complicated,
dense matters that are there.

00:24:36.815 --> 00:24:38.440
But let's talk a
little bit about where

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.210
some exciting opportunities
is out in tech diplomacy.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.870
So your team is kind of like--

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.930
you work from Mountain
View-- you work from Silicon

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.639
Valley, sorry about that.

00:24:51.639 --> 00:24:53.180
But you also have
a part of your team

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.727
that's situated in
Copenhagen and in Beijing.

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:56.560
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.393
RASMUS GREVE: For you,
what does it actually

00:24:58.393 --> 00:25:00.945
mean to be an ambassador
to a global industry?

00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:01.570
It's not just--

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.030
CASPER KLYNGE: It means having
meetings at horrible times

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.810
almost every day.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:05.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.086
Because finding a common
time to have the whole team

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:10.210
present is basically
impossible because of the time

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.310
differences.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.260
This is also a foreign
policy experiment.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.030
I think it's important
to mention that.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.960
We haven't done it before.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.610
We don't think anybody
else has done it before,

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.040
but we think it's the right
way to look at diplomacy

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.090
in the 21st century.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.390
That it's not only about having
one embassy to one country,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.860
but it's, in fact, looking
at an industry or a sector

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.560
in a holistic way.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.396
Again, I represent
the foreign ministry,

00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:35.770
so it goes without
saying that we

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.080
are focusing on the global
aspects of new technology.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.270
So I think if you look at
the US or the Americas,

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.540
if you look at Europe
and you look at Asia,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.860
changes are underway.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.150
It goes without saying that
there is a shift, or a change,

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.696
also on balance of power.

00:25:53.696 --> 00:25:55.570
I think, when you look
into the crystal ball,

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.140
it's evident that, in Europe,
we say it will move east.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.440
I guess, where we're sitting,
it could also move west.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.890
But the point being that China
and other Asian countries

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.620
look as though they're
going to be using technology

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.720
as a game-changer,
also for their position

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.670
on the global scene.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.280
It's interesting, if you look
at investments in artificial

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.100
intelligence-- the last year of
venture capital investments--

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.740
I think 30% or so went to
the US, 48% went to China,

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.360
and the rest went to the rest
of the world, which by the way,

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.120
includes the European Union.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.150
I think it doesn't require
too much creativity

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.380
to see that that's perhaps the
contours of a new global order,

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.460
and that we might
see technology being

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.264
a driver for significant change,
also in the global scene.

00:26:45.264 --> 00:26:46.930
I think where we're
struggling in Europe

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.410
is, of course, to have a
better focus on innovation.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.260
We need to also build
some of the unicorns

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:58.420
that the US and China and Asia
is extremely good at doing.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.206
And I think that requires us
to take a look on regulations,

00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:02.830
on legislation.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.500
But it also requires us
to take a look on mindsets

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.870
and, perhaps, a little
bit on access to capital

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.520
for some of these big companies.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.150
I think Europe has
a role to play.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.610
I know we're
sitting in New York,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.390
but I think Europe could play
a role, in the sense of help

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.100
define the boundaries
for new technology.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.305
I know that GDPR--

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.120
the Data Protection
and Regulation--

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.850
is not necessarily
popular everywhere.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.930
It's not popular
everywhere in Europe,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.960
either, with small and
medium-sized enterprises.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.380
But it's a first attempt to
try and define the boundaries,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.810
and to make it crystal clear
that data is something which

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.870
is also personal, something
that you can own yourself,

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.450
and that you have the right
to be forgotten further

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.270
down the road.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.250
Is it perfect?

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.084
Perhaps not.

00:27:43.084 --> 00:27:44.500
But it's an attempt
to try and set

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.270
some boundaries for
new technologies.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.140
Between the Wild West of Silicon
Valley, where everything goes,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.990
and where it's all about
building and creating.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.550
But also the Wild
East, where you

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.150
see the utilization of new
technologies happening in,

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.680
perhaps, not an
unregulated space,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.971
but certainly a space which
is very different than what

00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:03.460
we're seeing in
Europe right now.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.050
So again, from
our point of view,

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.000
from a Foreign
Ministry point of view,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.150
this is also about looking at
where the world is going to be,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.486
not only in five years, but
also in 15 years, or 25 years.

00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:14.860
Because that
matters, even though

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.739
you are a very small country
at the top of Europe.

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:18.530
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.200
Now you're talking
about, I guess, looking--

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.690
when we talk about the
East and China and all

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.380
that, you're looking into
the private sphere, what

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.990
sort of innovation
we can find there.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.530
But we are talking, also, a
little bit about influencing

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.790
foreign policy and
all that, which

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.280
we were talking about before.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.710
What kind of similarities
or differences

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.820
do we see between trying to
do that in the US and Europe,

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.920
and in Asia, trying
to get in there

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.337
and see if you can
influence that.

00:28:45.337 --> 00:28:47.086
CASPER KLYNGE: On the
foreign policy side?

00:28:47.086 --> 00:28:48.080
RASMUS GREVE: Yes.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.225
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:50.600
It goes without
saying that we've

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.040
been spending
quite a lot of time

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.750
with US technology
companies, to begin with.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.920
Also, again, for
transatlantic reasons,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.900
we think it's important
to stick together.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.850
And what we've been
trying to do is

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.780
to use all diplomatic
tools, which

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.270
is going to have-- going
to the headquarters

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.910
to have conversations,
trying to convince,

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:14.202
in a gentle and nice way, the
headquarters to begin focusing

00:29:14.202 --> 00:29:15.410
more on some of these issues.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.140
Also, to take action
in particular areas

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.140
where we might have
issues or challenges.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.080
That has worked well
with some companies.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.110
Perhaps a little less
well with other companies.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.270
Some of it is also
because of curiosity.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.140
What is this about?

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.840
Is this TechPlomacy
initiative, is this

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.940
all about bringing the
big stick of regulation,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.440
and trying to do damage to the
opportunities of big companies?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.320
Well, it's not.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.840
And once we've had
the opportunity

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.180
to explain what we're trying to
do, most companies have said,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.240
well, we actually see
that this makes sense,

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.780
and we would like to work
with you on this agenda.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.522
But we need more people
around the table.

00:29:52.522 --> 00:29:53.480
We need more countries.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.434
We need all the international
organizations around the table.

00:29:56.434 --> 00:29:58.100
Which is, by the way,
one of the reasons

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.130
we're sitting in New York,
again, during the UN Week.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.430
We welcome the UN Secretary
General's decision

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.245
to set up a high-level panel
on digital cooperation.

00:30:08.245 --> 00:30:10.370
So I think that's-- and
the European Union has done

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.540
something similar under the high
representative for Mogherini.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.160
So I think this is a trend.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.660
We are seeing more
countries, we are

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.076
seeing international
organizations

00:30:19.076 --> 00:30:21.080
beginning to step
up to the plate,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.610
and focusing on digital issues
and on technology, per se.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.330
So there are some differences.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.121
And of course, there
are differences, also,

00:30:29.121 --> 00:30:32.330
when you look towards China and
some of the big companies they

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.070
have there.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.320
My prime minister is going to
meet Jack Ma later this week,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.900
so perhaps I can
come back on Friday

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.180
and give you feedback on
how that discussion was

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.990
compared to some of the
other discussions we've had.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.240
RASMUS GREVE: That'd be great.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.932 --> 00:30:49.010
No, actually, it is fascinating.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:53.630
And you were talking about
the investments into AI

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.930
that the US is making, that
China is making, which--

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.510
we move into a decision making--

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:05.090
faster decision making
world, which is really--

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.620
yeah.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.690
No, but-- I want-- and this
is my own little thing.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.810
I always feel that that's
so interesting to look into.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.790
For you, in 10 years,
giving everything

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.160
that we're doing with
AI and everything that--

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.990
in 10 years, how do
you think the Security

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.284
Council will look like?

00:31:20.284 --> 00:31:21.700
CASPER KLYNGE: I
think it'll look,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.120
more or less, as it does today.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.948
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:24.954 --> 00:31:25.620
It's difficult--

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.950
RASMUS GREVE: You don't think
Google will have a seat, huh?

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:27.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.500
CASPER KLYNGE: We
can do a sweepstake

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.345
and see where it hits.

00:31:32.345 --> 00:31:34.970
I think it's important to say
that, although we are arguing

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.270
for a closer public-private
partnership on some

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.280
of the big issues,
they are still

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.210
a domain which should remain for
states and for nation states.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.450
And I think the UN will remain,
or the Security Council,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.720
will remain a forum where
states are discussing

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.920
some of the big issues.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.540
However, I think
what we will see

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.310
is a small revolution, where
all these discussions will also

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.020
take place in the
margins of the UN

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.170
or in the margins of the
European Union, where we begin

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:08.690
having discussion groups,
or discussions fora,

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.307
to bring about the opportunity
to sit together with industry

00:32:11.307 --> 00:32:13.640
and actually talk about issues,
including foreign policy

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.340
issues.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.880
Including how do we make
sure that you guys will also

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.800
take responsibility for bringing
the next 3 billion people

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.020
online?

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.640
You will also take
responsibility

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.620
to make sure that we don't have,
again, parts of this world that

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.839
will fall behind.

00:32:26.839 --> 00:32:28.880
Because we shouldn't forget
that this is not only

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.200
about bringing health care
or education to people

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.156
that are less
fortunate than others.

00:32:35.156 --> 00:32:37.280
This is also about making
sure that the root causes

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.800
of extremism, or
migration flows,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.630
that they will not
be nurtured simply

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.430
because of global inequalities.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.715
So these are real issues.

00:32:44.715 --> 00:32:46.340
There might be
commercial opportunities

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.450
for a company like Google.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.040
But also, from a
government point of view,

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.040
it is incredibly important
that we work together

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.270
to try and fix some of
the inequalities that

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.740
might exist on a global level.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.580
RASMUS GREVE: And
then, you answered

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.950
one of my next questions.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:00.380
CASPER KLYNGE: I'm sorry.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.620
RASMUS GREVE: No,
that's completely fine.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.120
That's--

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.640
That's where we
should go, right?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.900
We should meet-- instead
of the problems popping up,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.304
you should be verbalizing them.

00:33:09.304 --> 00:33:11.720
But we're also talking about
privacy and fake news and all

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.520
that, and where we are there,
and how we can work together.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.310
But I do feel that that's
the future of collaboration

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.090
and the UN.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:24.590
And if you can talk about
what the last 60 years to find

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.962
the Security Council, and
the end of World War II,

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:28.670
and where we're moving
with the Cold War,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.800
whether that's relevant in
the next 10 years, perhaps.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.740
But then, as we
move beyond that,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.520
it is bigger challenges that we
will need to partner ourselves.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.200
We cannot have the
hammer of communism,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.883
the power of capitalism, to
solve some of those things.

00:33:43.883 --> 00:33:44.716
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:46.507
RASMUS GREVE: Well, in
my personal opinion.

00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:48.380
Anyways, I have two
more questions left,

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.080
and then I think I'm going
to start opening it up

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.390
to the floor for questions.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:59.600
And I've been listening
to your podcasts,

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.240
and we also met last year right
when you became newly-minted.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.664
And the one thing you did say
was that, after the first year,

00:34:09.664 --> 00:34:11.080
your success
criteria would really

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.440
be that you weren't the first
and only tech ambassador.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.130
How's it going out there?

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.650
CASPER KLYNGE: Relatively well,
but not exactly as good as I

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:21.969
hoped.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.969
We are seeing a lot of
other countries coming up

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:27.239
with similar appointments.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.280
I don't think anybody else
has been given exactly

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.929
the same title,
but I have a group

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.239
of colleagues around the
world that are dealing

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.530
with some of the same topics.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.821
Some of them are called cyber
ambassadors, some of them

00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:39.909
are called ambassadors
for digitalization.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.520
Others are called ambassadors
for entrepreneurships

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.350
and startups.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.139
But I think we will
see a wave coming

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.610
in not too distant a future.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.000
And again, I think that would
be absolutely fantastic.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.416
And we actually
think that this is

00:34:53.416 --> 00:34:55.030
in the interest of everybody.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.970
Not only governments but, in
fact, also of the industry.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.270
It would also enable us to
take collective meetings,

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.000
so we don't have to open
the doors every time

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.010
an individual tech
ambassador comes by,

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.630
but that we can
actually begin looking

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.430
at how to cooperate together.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.380
And perhaps I can
deliver a small teaser.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.134
We're not ready
with it yet, but one

00:35:13.134 --> 00:35:14.800
of the things that
my team is working on

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.460
is, in fact, to perhaps
create a coalition

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.910
of like-minded countries,
and a couple of companies

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.280
where we actually create a
forum where we can discuss

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.730
the broad range of topics
in relation to technology,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.140
and where technology is heading.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.500
So perhaps, soon, when we
have a conversation next year,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.750
that will be established,
and we can talk a little bit

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.360
about the mission, and
where we see that heading.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.760
I think that's about
what I can say today.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.680
So stay tuned for more
information on that.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.860
But it actually goes
to the core of what

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.020
we're trying to achieve with
the TechPlomacy initiative.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.645
RASMUS GREVE: But
that's actually true.

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.260
It makes bigger
companies easier to--

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.700
because we're
organizations, right?

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.745
We at fault for everything that
happens, it's very top-down,

00:35:55.745 --> 00:35:58.120
to try and say, hey, there's
something really interesting

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.490
we need to engage on here.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.580
And sometimes it's hard
to get that bubbled up.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.640
So the bigger you have,
the bigger the brand,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.700
and umbrella organizations,
and we are engaging with that.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.870
Because the UN, even, for us,
can be hard to engage with.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.910
Or even state
departments, which I've

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.920
tried previously, in my job.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.040
We did work very close
to the Danish state

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.870
for various things.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.200
So that would be
a very good thing.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.140
Again, I need to refer
back to me listening

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.400
to the podcast and all that.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.804
By the way, it's called
"TechPlomacy Talk,"

00:36:34.804 --> 00:36:36.970
and it's an amazing podcast,
and you should really--

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.847
Casper has fantastic
people he interviews.

00:36:39.847 --> 00:36:42.180
CASPER KLYNGE: I paid him to
say that, just to be clear.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:42.380
RASMUS GREVE: Yeah.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.284
Get a little-- it's
on podcast [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:44.284 --> 00:36:46.450
You can easily find it on
SoundCloud and everything.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:47.360
No, it's good.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.481
And on iTunes, right?

00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:48.980
Yes.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.250
CASPER KLYNGE: Sorry.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.630
Yes.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.380
RASMUS GREVE: Yes.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.754
That's OK.

00:36:51.754 --> 00:36:52.670
It's an open platform.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.430
CASPER KLYNGE: We diversified.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.096
RASMUS GREVE: No,
it's an open platform.

00:36:55.096 --> 00:36:56.420
It's all good.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.380
But really, if you have any
interest in this sort of thing,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.920
please get into that.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.980
And if anybody has
any questions, please

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.820
get to the microphones.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.350
But you always finish with
the question of these talks,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:15.850
saying like, hey, what question
should I have asked you that I

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:16.990
didn't?

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.047
And what's the answer
to that question?

00:37:19.047 --> 00:37:19.880
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.380
It's the poor
man's response when

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.495
you know that you're not
clever enough to come up

00:37:23.495 --> 00:37:24.370
with a good question.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.610
So it's a nice way to
get people to come up

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:29.910
with some interesting answers.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.230
I think the question you
should have asked, Rasmussen--

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.510
I sort of indicated a
little bit the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.250
is, what can you do for us?

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:40.800
What can Google do to support
an initiative like that?

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:46.330
And I think what is important is
that we experience and we see,

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.072
also publicly, a renewed
societal responsibility

00:37:50.072 --> 00:37:51.030
from the tech industry.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.655
I'm not only talking
about Google here,

00:37:52.655 --> 00:37:54.100
but the industry, per se.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.920
We need to see a societal
responsibility, which

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.500
is proportional to the kind
of influence you guys have

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.100
when you look at the platforms,
and all the new technologies

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.100
that you're rolling out.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.050
We haven't spoken too
much about health care.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.370
I know it's a massive
investment, also,

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.940
for a company like Google.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.820
I think there is a
commercial dimension to this.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:18.220
And that is, I think we all
are desperate to see a lot more

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.330
responsibility, a lot more
engagement, also a lot more

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.020
creativity in finding
answers to some

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.100
of these difficult questions.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.010
So I think what
you can do for us,

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.830
which should serve Google's
own interest, or the industry's

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.290
own interest, is actually
to open the doors

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.420
and begin becoming more
comfortable with having

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.069
discussions with governments.

00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:40.360
We're not out there to get you.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.760
In fact, we are out
there to work with you

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.650
and help each other
solve what I think

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.900
are really timely and incredibly
important questions, not least

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.147
in this time and age.

00:38:52.147 --> 00:38:53.730
We're talking about
democracies, we're

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.150
talking about human rights
issues, about gender equality.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.076
We're talking about inequality
at the global scale.

00:39:00.076 --> 00:39:01.200
These are not small issues.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.104
These are incredibly
important issues,

00:39:03.104 --> 00:39:05.020
regardless of whether
you work for government,

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.820
on the dark side,
or whether you work

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.867
for an upcoming tech industry,
a company like Google.

00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:13.950
RASMUS GREVE: Duly noted,
and thank you very much.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:14.750
CASPER KLYNGE: So
sign here if you--

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:15.500
RASMUS GREVE: Yes.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.660
I think I'll let
somebody else do that.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:23.810
But no, I think everybody
is always looking

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.430
for making collaboration.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.390
Google has a mission,
and that is making

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:36.110
the world's information--

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.890
come on, help me here-- free
and universally accessible?

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:40.390
Exactly.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.910
Right?

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.240
Which really ties into--

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.100
CASPER KLYNGE: I guess
you have a test when

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.100
you move into Google.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.330
You have to be able
to answer this.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.079
RASMUS GREVE: That's
true, but yeah, yeah.

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:47.980
That's our mission.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.480
Yeah.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.790
Now I'm getting a little bit
flustered, in that sense.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.040
Can't even recite the mission.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.090
But anyways, let's start with
questions for the time we have.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.110
Let's start with the
right side microphone.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.610
Hi.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.276
If you could state
your name, and then--

00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:02.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Gabriella.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.500
I'm a designer here at Google.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.170
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.750
So my question is--

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.720
I'm from Mexico, where the
idea of the government knowing

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.430
everything about you is bad.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:14.642
Just you don't want that.

00:40:14.642 --> 00:40:16.100
So I'm curious,
how did you achieve

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.570
this 90% of your interactions
with citizens being digital?

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.350
Is there a lot of
infrastructure?

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.760
Do people have
computers at home,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.843
do they all have internet?

00:40:25.843 --> 00:40:28.150
Do they have that
internet literacy?

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.900
And the second one is, did you
have to persuade them at all,

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.660
or do they just trust you?

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.030
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.830
A really good question.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.280
And thanks for posing it.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.854
We're not-- let me
put it this way.

00:40:43.854 --> 00:40:45.770
Of course, I acknowledge
that it's much easier

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.360
to implement systems
like that when

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.120
you have a small, homogeneous
country like Denmark.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.750
Where the distances
are relatively small,

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.980
and where we already have a
high degree of digitalization.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.644
But if I'm going to say it a
little bit black and white,

00:41:00.644 --> 00:41:02.060
one of the reasons
I think we have

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.820
such a high degree
of penetration

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.590
of digital solutions
is, in fact,

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.720
because we didn't
ask the population.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.060
This was something which
was implemented gradually.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.670
Initially, primarily out
of efficiency reasons.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.970
We wanted to save
resources, be more--

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.520
get more bang for the buck
in our communications,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.920
in our service
delivery to people.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.750
And going digital was certainly
part of that direction.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.500
I think that discussion
has changed today,

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.230
where it's much more
about quality, not

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.480
only about efficiency.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.850
But the honest answer is it
was gradually introduced.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.610
And the interesting thing
was that the public sector

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.670
took the lead.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:42.200
This was not something that
came from the private sector.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.970
The public sector took the lead.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.210
It was not incredibly popular,
neither in the private sector,

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.110
to begin with.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.310
But people got used to it.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.650
And today, it's actually
a competitive advantage

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.030
because Danish companies
are used to this.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.990
They've been doing it forever.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.530
But also, the people
are used to it.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.590
And actually, one thing
which might be shocking

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.990
if you live in the
US is, on average, it

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.880
takes a Dane 15 minutes
to do the tax report--

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.080
the annual tax report.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.050
15 minutes.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.150
Because everything is
provided digitally.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.790
You just go in and
you check the numbers.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.899
Are they-- do they look OK?

00:42:15.899 --> 00:42:18.440
Most people go to the end and
see, are we getting money back,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.474
or do we need to pay some money?

00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:21.890
But that's some
of the advantages,

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.840
and people enjoy that.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.400
So I think the popularity
is certainly there.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.669
And sorry, the
second question was?

00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:29.960
AUDIENCE: Oh, did you have to--

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.626
I guess you kind of
already answered it.

00:42:31.626 --> 00:42:33.920
Did you have to actually
persuade them to get on board?

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.480
But I think you said that
you implemented it gradually.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.200
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah, we did.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.500
But of course, as I
said, what I think

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.570
we had to pay attention
to was to make sure

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.070
everybody was on board.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.470
So there is an analog
way of replying

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:52.790
to government questions, or to
interact with the government.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.669
Because of course, not
everybody is online.

00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:56.210
And I think that's
the important bit,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.760
that you have a safety
net around those

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.530
that are not online.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.750
But the direction
is crystal clear.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.680
We want to have
everybody on board.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.830
And I think, with
the next generations

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.720
coming on board, that
will be even more

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.630
natural than it is today.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.230
But again, it is easier
in a country like Denmark

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.404
than it might be in a
big country like Mexico.

00:43:16.404 --> 00:43:17.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.462
CASPER KLYNGE: Thank you.

00:43:20.462 --> 00:43:23.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, Your
Excellency, my name is Klaus.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.770
Welcome to Google.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.899
I'm an analyst here.

00:43:26.899 --> 00:43:28.440
I'm also a fellow
Dane, and I'm going

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.180
to preface my first
question with saying I used

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.388
to work at your organization.

00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:33.259
I've since switched
your nice dress shoes

00:43:33.259 --> 00:43:34.800
with these very
comfortable sneakers.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.000
CASPER KLYNGE: Good for
you, and condolences

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.385
about your experience before.

00:43:37.385 --> 00:43:38.120
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.280
So my first question is on
foreign relations, in general.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.450
So Google is pretty good at
making decisions based on data,

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.034
and informing our
product development.

00:43:47.034 --> 00:43:49.033
How do you see that
informing foreign relations?

00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:50.640
For example, in your
own organization,

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.490
are we taking in more data
to make informed decisions?

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.619
And the second question is
more on the monopolistic nature

00:43:56.619 --> 00:43:59.160
of a lot of these companies in
the [? neighboring ?] economy,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.170
and regulation of the same.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.157
So a lot of the innovation
that Google is doing

00:44:03.157 --> 00:44:04.740
is often when we go
to the marketplace

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.550
and say, actually,
we can do better.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.340
So take, for example,
Google Chrome.

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.759
There might be several
reasons for that.

00:44:10.759 --> 00:44:12.300
Or Google Fiber,
where Google decided

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.030
to go out and challenge some of
the incumbents of the market.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.840
How do you avoid regulating
some of that innovation that

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.170
also comes from big companies?

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.280
And when you do that, once you
start to meddle in the market,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.080
how do you avoid then,
for example, saying,

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.538
well, we're going
to regulate maybe

00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:28.110
some of the American companies
and the European companies.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.840
But maybe the Alibabas
and Tencents of the world

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.267
would then go in and get a
bigger share of the market.

00:44:34.267 --> 00:44:35.100
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.662
Super good questions.

00:44:36.662 --> 00:44:39.889
On the first one, how do we
use data in foreign policy?

00:44:39.889 --> 00:44:41.430
Well, I think we
don't use it enough.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.830
And part of my mandate,
together with my team,

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:48.800
is also to help change the
mindset inside the government,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.485
or inside the Foreign ministry,
in a more digital direction.

00:44:51.485 --> 00:44:52.860
What does that
mean, in practice?

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.276
It means, for example, that
when we look at our developing

00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.620
cooperation with Africa or with
Asia, we're also taking, now,

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.950
a firm view on whether
we're doing the right stuff.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.640
Is it good to focus on delivery
of water in Tanzania, in Kenya?

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.610
Or should we, in fact,
look at infrastructure,

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.740
and building the right
competences for people

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.300
so they can, again, reap the
benefits of the digital age.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.730
That's one area to look at it.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.040
The other area is, of course,
to see whether we, as a delivery

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.370
mechanism, can use data in a
better way inside the Foreign

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.270
Ministry.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.100
And last year, we--

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.840
I'm sorry I have to
name a rival company,

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.490
but it's a US rival company.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.310
We supported a collaboration
between the Danish Refugee

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.350
Council and IBM.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:42.037
And that partnership was about
using data on migration flows.

00:45:42.037 --> 00:45:44.370
First of all, to better
predict, in Europe, where people

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.320
are coming from, what
are the reasons why

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.310
people are migrating.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:51.190
But it was also to help deliver
better humanitarian efforts.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.390
So in other words, people in
extremely difficult conditions,

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.330
and dire needs, how do we get
the right kind of assistance

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.240
to them so we don't
send out the wrong stuff

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.390
that they don't need?

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.540
And I think data is
going to be creating

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.960
a small revolution in how we
deliver those kind of services.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.770
So we get more
bang for the buck--

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.779
so efficiency, again.

00:46:09.779 --> 00:46:11.570
But actually, also make
a bigger difference

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.070
for the people on
the receiving end.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.430
So I think data will play an
incredibly important role.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.320
But as with any
other organization,

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.320
it takes a little while
to get the mindset going

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.160
in that direction.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.910
But that's part of what
we're trying to help with.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.720
On the other issue, I think
you point to one thing

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.700
which we're still
struggling with in Europe,

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.130
and that is, how do
we support innovation?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.340
How do we make sure that we
don't regulate technologies

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.920
in a way that actually
we'll be shooting ourselves

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.850
in the foot in the long term?

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.310
There is a lot of focus on
antitrust and competition.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.870
And I'll be honest
with you, to share

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:53.100
that when I moved
to the US last year,

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.350
and when I went to the
headquarters in Silicon Valley,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.220
one of the first questions
was always, your Danish?

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.400
I said, yeah.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.160
Isn't the EU commissioner
for competition--

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.270
isn't she Danish, as well?

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.359
I said, Yeah.

00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:06.150
And they said, how does
that work together?

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.380
Because you just said this is
a tech-positive environment.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.840
But I think-- and I told
Commissioner Vestager myself,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.962
so I can tell this honestly.

00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:16.920
The interesting thing
is, just in the 12 months

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.110
we've been on the
ground, I think

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.591
there has been a convergence
of view across the Atlantic

00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:22.590
on some of these issues.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.715
Where there is a recognition
that regulation is not

00:47:24.715 --> 00:47:29.260
only a bad thing, as long as
we do it in the right areas,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.630
and then leave the
other areas alone.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.630
So I think if you look
at Commissioner Vestager,

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.690
she's gone from being persona
non grata in certain parts

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.640
of Silicon Valley,
or the Bay Area,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.410
to become a little
bit of a rock star.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.840
And you know things are
changing when the venture

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.970
capitalists are saying,
well, perhaps we

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.560
need to take a
look on regulation,

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.570
and we need to invest
more in companies

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.150
that have a bigger
social-corporate

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.210
responsibility.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.550
Then things are changing.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.210
I think that's a positive thing.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.690
And I think that will
actually also build

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.720
better companies, and more
commercially sustainable

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.495
companies.

00:48:01.495 --> 00:48:03.120
But I think the jury's
still out on how

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.580
we get it right in Europe.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.530
We can't fix that,
as a small country.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:10.410
But I would argue, not to be
too focused on my own country,

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.780
that we punch above our
weight on these issues.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.990
Simply because we have the
degree of digitalization

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.840
and we have a positive
approach to technology.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.100
So we can, hopefully,
also help make sure

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.200
that Europe moves in the
right direction on some

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.460
of these difficult questions.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.017
But again, we need the industry
to help us to find what

00:48:27.017 --> 00:48:27.850
the right direction.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.410
So that's why we're
inviting everybody

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.907
for a long-term dance.

00:48:31.907 --> 00:48:32.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:34.137 --> 00:48:36.470
RASMUS GREVE: And we have a
question over here, as well.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.670
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.253
Appreciate it.

00:48:37.253 --> 00:48:39.850
Thank you for coming and
speaking to us today.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.530
As a veteran myself of
a similar organization--

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.660
I worked at the US government--

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.542
US e-government and IT office
while I was getting started up.

00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:50.500
I have a great appreciation
for the opportunity

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.050
and the challenges you
have in front of you.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.841
And you sort of answered
this a little bit,

00:48:53.841 --> 00:48:56.770
but as you speak about the
breadth of what you're doing,

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.140
and the purview of it, I'd
imagine there are probably

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.380
some legacy pieces of the Danish
government that may not want

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.810
you meddling in their business.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.260
How have you been able to
get the opportunity with them

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.170
to create the influence you
need to enact these things back

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.307
on homeground?

00:49:12.307 --> 00:49:13.140
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.460
That's evidently an
insider's question.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.010
You know how difficult it
is to get bureaucracies

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.790
to move in the right direction.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.336
Well, the interesting thing is--

00:49:22.336 --> 00:49:23.710
I come from the
Foreign Ministry,

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.126
but I would actually
argue that we

00:49:25.126 --> 00:49:27.070
work as much on
the domestic agenda

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.614
as we do on the
foreign policy agenda.

00:49:29.614 --> 00:49:31.030
There are numerous
activities back

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:32.590
home which is about
preparing Denmark

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:35.207
for the fourth
Industrial Revolution.

00:49:35.207 --> 00:49:36.790
And one of the things
that we're doing

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.123
is actually linking up with
a lot of the ministries back

00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:40.820
home, or a lot of
the authorities--

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.700
whether it's the
ministry for labor

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.410
or the ministry
for transportation,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.600
or the ministry for health care.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.850
And the thing we're
doing with them

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.000
is both to be a
forward-operating post

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.322
in the epicenter
of new technology.

00:49:54.322 --> 00:49:56.530
So basically, being out
there collecting information,

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.720
doing small analysis.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.150
Telling colleagues
back home, you better

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.970
be aware that Google
is looking at retina

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.730
scanning for diabetes patients.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.860
That will have an
impact also on the way

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.350
we treat patients back home.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.060
How do we prepare our
health care systems

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.640
for that kind of new
technologies coming

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.100
to a theater near us very soon?

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.610
So being that beacon out there,
bringing information back home,

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.040
I think plays an
incredibly important part

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.690
in both changing
the mindset back

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.470
home, but in fact, also
in a very practical way,

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.210
help look at is our
legislation prepared

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.280
for those opportunities?

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.750
Or are there areas where we
want to work with Google,

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.440
or other companies, to make sure
that, when you do health care,

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.220
or when you do education,
that we get it right?

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.132
So it also fits together
with our approach.

00:50:46.132 --> 00:50:47.590
I don't know whether
you know this.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:49.300
But Uber was
introduced in Denmark,

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.150
and then it was banned, I
think, more or less a year

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:55.590
after its introduction for a
number of different reasons.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.300
I'm not going to say
that my office-- had

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.640
it been in existence
five years ago,

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.140
that it would have
fixed everything.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.681
What I would argue,
though, is that I

00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:06.580
think Uber is a pretty good
example of a new technology,

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.970
or a new platform, coming into
Europe, coming into Denmark,

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.750
where had we had a tech
ambassador at my office

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.934
a few years ago, we could have
identified that and said, well,

00:51:16.934 --> 00:51:18.850
let's work with the
Ministry of Transportation

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:21.610
back home, or the
appropriate authorities,

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.580
and see what we can do.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.700
What are the fine lines?

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.190
What are the red
lines for Denmark?

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.350
And then have a dialogue with
the headquarters over here

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.580
to make sure that it's not
introduced in the wrong way.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.080
And I think that should be in
the interest of the companies,

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.620
but it's certainly also in the
interest of a country our size.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.606
Did you notice how I
avoided answering exactly

00:51:40.606 --> 00:51:41.272
how [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:41.272 --> 00:51:41.772
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:41.772 --> 00:51:42.855
But anyway, good question.

00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:44.772
AUDIENCE: A very positive
answer to, I'm sure,

00:51:44.772 --> 00:51:45.855
other existing challenges.

00:51:45.855 --> 00:51:46.480
But thank you.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.620
CASPER KLYNGE: No, but
to be honest with you,

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.940
it's not always easy.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:53.607
But I think, in any organization
or in any big industry,

00:51:53.607 --> 00:51:55.440
there's always resistance
when you're trying

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.640
to do things in a new way.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.080
We've experienced that.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.900
But I think the
goal is so important

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.370
that we get this right
that, eventually, it

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:08.830
will cause a lot of
changes, both in mindsets

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.360
and also how we do business.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.600
And we've seen this just in the
12 months we've been underway.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.290
RASMUS GREVE: I
want to make sure we

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:15.640
get through all our questions.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.473
CASPER KLYNGE: Sure.

00:52:16.473 --> 00:52:18.420
RASMUS GREVE: I can
see people lining up.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.045
Over here, yes?

00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:20.336
CASPER KLYNGE: I'll be briefer.

00:52:20.336 --> 00:52:21.670
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Jimmy.

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.800
I'm a former Googler,
and my question

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.010
is, anyone who has been
paying attention to the news

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.980
has seen there's
increasing evidence

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.890
that Russia, for example,
is using technology

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:36.550
platforms-- whether it's
Twitter or Facebook, advertising

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.930
platforms-- to try to
influence democracies.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.450
Do you see that these sort
of geopolitical conflicts

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:47.450
have a risk of increasingly
spilling over into tech?

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:51.440
And what would-- what's
your expectation,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.590
or the Danish Foreign Ministry's
expectation for Google

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:57.960
and other tech companies' role?

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.430
As a neutral
arbiter, or would you

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.740
expect them to take
proactive measures

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.247
in these sorts of conflicts?

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.080
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:05.370
Super good question.

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.870
RASMUS GREVE: So happy
you got that question.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.578
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah,
super good question.

00:53:08.578 --> 00:53:11.590
And it enables me
to say that I think

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:16.090
we've realized that
cybersecurity issues is not

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:17.420
something that will go away.

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.794
In fact, it might increase
over the next couple of years,

00:53:19.794 --> 00:53:23.400
also as we digitalize more and
more parts of our societies.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.019
And of course, we
are-- and my government

00:53:26.019 --> 00:53:27.060
has said this repeatedly.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.120
We're extremely concerned about
the way Russia is operating

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.260
in the cyber security arena.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.727
And we need to have better
defensive mechanisms,

00:53:35.727 --> 00:53:37.560
but we also need
international collaboration

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.870
to try and mitigate
these issues.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.510
These are not small
destructive incidents.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.890
This is about potentially
meddling with elections,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.310
or undermining public confidence
in institutions, et cetera.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.030
So these are real issues that
we take extremely seriously.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.880
We need an international
collaboration, also

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.210
to make sure that those malign
actors that are actually

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.700
performing these things,
that they are brought out

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.490
in the open, and in the
right circumstances.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.650
That we have attribution
in that case.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.280
But we also-- and
that's to answer

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.020
the last part of your question.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.000
We certainly expect
the industry to take

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.370
a responsibility in this area.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.530
And we know it's
incredibly complex,

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.220
and there is a very fine
line between meddling

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.300
with the freedom of speech
and freedom of expression.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.980
And then, of course,
removing content

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.360
that you identify, positively,
as being not truthful

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.840
or basically based on
profiles that doesn't exist.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.710
And I think that
dilemma is going

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.881
to be important to try and
find the silver bullet for.

00:54:40.881 --> 00:54:42.630
It's not going to be
easy, but we're going

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.220
to put a lot of effort into it.

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.830
And we expect-- and
we are going to work

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:50.360
very hard to make sure the
industry also plays its part.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.217
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:51.217 --> 00:54:52.550
RASMUS GREVE: So we are at time.

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.900
However, I would like
to, if possible--

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.300
and I get an OK from the
control room back there--

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.290
to get the last few
questions through.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.880
So over here.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:04.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.830
I'm Keira, and I actually
just joined Google New York

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.140
from Google Denmark.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:12.090
So I have lived and
worked in Denmark

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:14.760
for about a year and a
half, and in the last 10

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.000
years, that was the 10th country
in which I lived and worked.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.390
So what I see is that
there's actually this growing

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.330
population of people who--

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.870
they might not be
just digital nomads,

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.830
but obviously, that's
part of the group,

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:32.850
as well, who are in
different countries.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.100
And obviously, they're
experiencing the digitalization

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.440
level in different
countries differently.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.100
And what I noticed
is that, actually,

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.910
no country that I've
lived and worked in really

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.760
think, in any way,
about people like that,

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.440
who actually have their
presence beyond the country.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.190
So I know that, obviously,
Denmark has done a lot,

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:53.340
and with Estonia, with
their [? e-citizenships, ?]

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.380
they're looking
at that, as well.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.090
But I have kind of
a two-fold question.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.450
Could you share-- is this part
of a discussion where people

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:03.300
are becoming more globalized,
and they're not really

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.820
looking at any single one
country as the source of truth

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.680
of their identity, or of
their digital identity?

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.700
And number two, do you feel
that you, in your position, can

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.470
you actually do
something about that?

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:19.320
Or are you having these
discussions in your circles,

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.830
as well?

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.120
CASPER KLYNGE: Oh, enormously
difficult question.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.100
What I would say
is that, I think

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.660
you represent a group which is
growing in numbers these years.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.946
I think, if you look at it
from a country point of view,

00:56:34.946 --> 00:56:37.800
what there is renewed focus on
is that we need people like you

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.130
with skills and competences
to help drive the economy,

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.744
and build the new
technology companies.

00:56:43.744 --> 00:56:45.160
And I can tell
you, very honestly,

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.730
that I haven't met a single
Danish tech company who

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:51.360
hasn't said, well, we're in
desperate need for skills

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.000
and competence that are
very difficult to find even

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.340
in Europe or in Copenhagen,
or wherever it might be--

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.590
Stockholm, Estonia,
and so on and so forth.

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:03.660
So I think a lot of focus will
go into that direction, both

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.240
to make sure we educate
a new generation that

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.180
has the right skill sets
to work in a digital world.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.130
But also to make
sure that we can

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:14.850
attract the kind of competencies
that we need for the companies.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.820
The problem is, of course,
it's a global competition.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.269
When you sit in
Silicon Valley, I

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.310
don't think I've met any
company who hasn't said,

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.490
well, it's damn
difficult to find

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.810
the right engineers, or
the software engineers

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.940
that we need.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.710
The competition is fierce.

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.020
And I think that competition
will become increasingly

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:34.920
global, so we also need global
solutions to those aspects.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.710
Whether I can do anything
in that dimension-- well,

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.050
I think what we can do is
to bring back information

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:42.383
and knowledge that these are
discussions that are taking

00:57:42.383 --> 00:57:47.130
place, also among the next
generation of tech-savvy people

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:51.610
that we would like to
attract to Denmark.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.655
We can't offer any good
weather in Denmark.

00:57:53.655 --> 00:57:57.150
But the city's not too bad, and
you can bike around everywhere.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.650
So there are pros and cons.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:00.930
So perhaps we need to be
better at branding them also.

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:03.750
Not because of the weather, but
because of the quality of life,

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.737
as well.

00:58:04.737 --> 00:58:06.570
RASMUS GREVE: And that's
where he can pay me

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:08.911
back money for being able
to pitch Denmark as a tech

00:58:08.911 --> 00:58:09.410
capital.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.715
CASPER KLYNGE: Exactly.

00:58:09.715 --> 00:58:10.020
Right.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.190
RASMUS GREVE: All right.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:14.812
I know we are way over time, but
last question from over here.

00:58:14.812 --> 00:58:16.020
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Tim.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.180
I'm a software engineer here.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.730
My question is,
traditionally, when

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.320
new technologies
came into space,

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.570
we generally didn't
have an ambassador.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.770
We didn't have an ambassador
to, say, Standard Oil.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.750
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.900
AUDIENCE: And
traditionally, when

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.470
you wanted to get access to
technology, or to a skill set,

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.560
you would usually work
with the State Department

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.150
or whatnot of whatever country.

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:44.460
And through that, you'd create
economic deals or whatnot.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.700
And that's been the
case, I guess, until now,

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.470
to some extent.

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:51.900
So another way of
asking the same question

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:57.630
is, I understand the
initiative of trying

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.670
to outreach to
the tech industry,

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:04.685
but can you give me an idea of
what's the urgency coming from,

00:59:04.685 --> 00:59:05.310
to some extent?

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.270
CASPER KLYNGE: Yeah.

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:08.760
Really a relevant question.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.090
And perhaps I can
begin by giving you

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.620
an example of the
kind of critique

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.710
that we've been faced
with in the first year.

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:18.670
It's quite often that
we are being asked,

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.930
so are you now putting
companies before countries?

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:24.120
So in other words,
is this elevating

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.660
Google to a de facto state
without having democracies

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.460
below it and all of that?

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.830
And my reply to that,
or our reply to that,

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.360
is always, well,
this is, in fact,

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.272
about trying to protect the role
of states in future governance.

00:59:37.272 --> 00:59:38.730
Because I think
governance is going

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:41.717
to come under a lot of threat,
or face a lot of challenges,

00:59:41.717 --> 00:59:43.800
because of the kind of
platforms that you guys are

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.506
building and rolling out.

00:59:45.506 --> 00:59:47.130
It doesn't respect
the national borders

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:50.160
as, perhaps, some of the
old industries would.

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.942
But I think the real--

00:59:51.942 --> 00:59:53.400
the pertinent part
of your question

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.020
is, why is it
different now than it

00:59:55.020 --> 01:00:00.000
was 50 years ago, when the oil
industry began to roll out?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.190
And that, I think, is
because of the pace.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:03.211
So I do think that--

01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:04.710
I don't want to
call it exponential,

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:06.870
but I think what we're
seeing is incredibly

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:09.870
fast-paced of the new
platforms being rolled out.

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.240
The way that
technology basically

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.430
penetrates everything we do--

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:15.580
all sectors.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.580
It doesn't matter whether
you're in construction

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.954
or whether you're
in health care,

01:00:18.954 --> 01:00:21.690
technology is going to be
a game-changer, potentially

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.040
within a very short time span.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.390
So I think that's the reason
why we think time is ripe.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.850
And it is something
different than oil.

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.050
I think data is not
a finite resource.

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:35.160
So you will continue to
expand and build on that,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.890
and it gives enormous
opportunities.

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.350
And it might also challenge
a country like Denmark,

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:43.590
or the European Union, or
the United Nations in a more

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.000
profound way than
what we've seen

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.910
with some previous technologies.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.960
So that's at least
our argumentation,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.290
that this is different.

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:51.300
It feels different.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.880
And therefore, we need a
different reply or response

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.560
to that.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.300
And that reply or
response, in our case,

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:02.890
is part of TechPlomacy, and
what TechPlomacy is here to do.

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:04.060
RASMUS GREVE: OK.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.945
Well, thank you.

01:01:05.945 --> 01:01:07.330
A billion thank you.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.579
Everybody, if you could
give a hand to Casper.

01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:10.620
CASPER KLYNGE: Thank you.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.570
[APPLAUSE]
