need for this kind of talk in the sense

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
need for this kind of talk in the sense
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280
need for this kind of talk in the sense
that one of the beauties of the web is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
that one of the beauties of the web is
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.740
that one of the beauties of the web is
the fact that if you've got a browser it

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
the fact that if you've got a browser it
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690
the fact that if you've got a browser it
does mean that you can sit there and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
does mean that you can sit there and
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.200
does mean that you can sit there and
develop for it but the biggest issue

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
develop for it but the biggest issue
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970
develop for it but the biggest issue
with mobile devices you can imagine a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
with mobile devices you can imagine a
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.229
with mobile devices you can imagine a
scenario like this this poor guys in

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
scenario like this this poor guys in
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.400
scenario like this this poor guys in
there thinking I'm going to develop for

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
there thinking I'm going to develop for
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.709
there thinking I'm going to develop for
all those and it's going to be great by

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
all those and it's going to be great by
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799
all those and it's going to be great by
his face maybe not so much and I think

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
his face maybe not so much and I think
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.929
his face maybe not so much and I think
the main reason that it kind of becomes

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
the main reason that it kind of becomes
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.120
the main reason that it kind of becomes
a bit difficult is you you have this

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
a bit difficult is you you have this
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.230
a bit difficult is you you have this
environment on your desktop we're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
environment on your desktop we're
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.469
environment on your desktop we're
developing what is the road to go from

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
developing what is the road to go from
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899
developing what is the road to go from
your desktop to supporting all these

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
your desktop to supporting all these
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580
your desktop to supporting all these
devices what are going to be the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
devices what are going to be the
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.700
devices what are going to be the
obstacles how do you get around them

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710
obstacles how do you get around them
 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.109
obstacles how do you get around them
what how do you essentially smooth out

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
what how do you essentially smooth out
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.880
what how do you essentially smooth out
that path and we've all seen that whole

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
that path and we've all seen that whole
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.609
that path and we've all seen that whole
dragging backwards or forwards a window

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619
dragging backwards or forwards a window
 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.780
dragging backwards or forwards a window
and I think generally people will fall

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
and I think generally people will fall
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.219
and I think generally people will fall
into two camps pretty quickly like they

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
into two camps pretty quickly like they
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719
into two camps pretty quickly like they
think no that's not mobile development

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
think no that's not mobile development
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.429
think no that's not mobile development
that's awful how could you claim that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
that's awful how could you claim that
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319
that's awful how could you claim that
the other side to be like well it's not

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
the other side to be like well it's not
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.090
the other side to be like well it's not
that bad it kind of it just helps you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
that bad it kind of it just helps you
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910
that bad it kind of it just helps you
get there my kind of opinion is it helps

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
get there my kind of opinion is it helps
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160
get there my kind of opinion is it helps
you focus on the content rather than

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
you focus on the content rather than
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170
you focus on the content rather than
necessarily devices which is the right

way of doing things in my opinion but at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
way of doing things in my opinion but at
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550
way of doing things in my opinion but at
the same time you can imagine a scenario

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
the same time you can imagine a scenario
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.120
the same time you can imagine a scenario
like this where if you take a nexus 4

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
like this where if you take a nexus 4
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.219
like this where if you take a nexus 4
you put it in landscape is sort of the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
you put it in landscape is sort of the
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.050
you put it in landscape is sort of the
same size as a nexus 7 in portrait and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060
same size as a nexus 7 in portrait and
 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.249
same size as a nexus 7 in portrait and
realistically I don't want to give users

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
realistically I don't want to give users
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139
realistically I don't want to give users
the same experience on both those

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
the same experience on both those
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.230
the same experience on both those
scenarios based off a width and then you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
scenarios based off a width and then you
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.730
scenarios based off a width and then you
can start obviously doing media queries

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
can start obviously doing media queries
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.080
can start obviously doing media queries
with orientation but unless you actually

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
with orientation but unless you actually
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639
with orientation but unless you actually
sit there with a device in your hand

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
sit there with a device in your hand
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.210
sit there with a device in your hand
playing around

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
playing around
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.880
playing around
it the incentive to go and do that extra

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
it the incentive to go and do that extra
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.120
it the incentive to go and do that extra
work may not be apparent so we get to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
work may not be apparent so we get to
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.230
work may not be apparent so we get to
this point where we say whoa ok I need

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
this point where we say whoa ok I need
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.210
this point where we say whoa ok I need
to support these devices and this kind

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
to support these devices and this kind
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.740
to support these devices and this kind
of looks like a nice structured way of

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
of looks like a nice structured way of
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.000
of looks like a nice structured way of
having all your device in a nice

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
having all your device in a nice
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.300
having all your device in a nice
beautiful wall but it's still daunting

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
beautiful wall but it's still daunting
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.760
beautiful wall but it's still daunting
as to how you can actually utilize this

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
as to how you can actually utilize this
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.580
as to how you can actually utilize this
and develop arm in the same way so for

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
and develop arm in the same way so for
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.940
and develop arm in the same way so for
me I kind of I still break things down

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
me I kind of I still break things down
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770
me I kind of I still break things down
into three buckets for how I like to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
into three buckets for how I like to
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.900
into three buckets for how I like to
approach these kind of things number one

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
approach these kind of things number one
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670
approach these kind of things number one
is this the iteration speed when i'm

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
is this the iteration speed when i'm
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.960
is this the iteration speed when i'm
developing i want to be able to get a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
developing i want to be able to get a
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.810
developing i want to be able to get a
fast turnaround over what I'm doing

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
fast turnaround over what I'm doing
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.460
fast turnaround over what I'm doing
second one is launching and that kind of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
second one is launching and that kind of
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.260
second one is launching and that kind of
sounds a bit insane the fact that I'm

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270
sounds a bit insane the fact that I'm
 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.640
sounds a bit insane the fact that I'm
going to tell you how to launch a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
going to tell you how to launch a
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.610
going to tell you how to launch a
browser like tap that little icon but

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
browser like tap that little icon but
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.340
browser like tap that little icon but
I'm going to and then there's emulations

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350
I'm going to and then there's emulations
 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.630
I'm going to and then there's emulations
as mr. Poulos has shown you there's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
as mr. Poulos has shown you there's
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.300
as mr. Poulos has shown you there's
already one tool so iterations for me

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
already one tool so iterations for me
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.550
already one tool so iterations for me
one of the main reasons people like

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
one of the main reasons people like
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.960
one of the main reasons people like
tools like live reload to the fact they

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
tools like live reload to the fact they
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.180
tools like live reload to the fact they
don't have to hit this icon and it's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190
don't have to hit this icon and it's
 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.259
don't have to hit this icon and it's
kind of insane to say but there are

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269
kind of insane to say but there are
 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.420
kind of insane to say but there are
still people who are constantly just

still people who are constantly just
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.250
still people who are constantly just
hitting refresh I watched one guy who

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
hitting refresh I watched one guy who
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.199
hitting refresh I watched one guy who
had made a change in his text editor

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209
had made a change in his text editor
 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.380
had made a change in his text editor
went to Chrome he hit a plug-in that

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
went to Chrome he hit a plug-in that
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.420
went to Chrome he hit a plug-in that
would clear the cache then hit the

would clear the cache then hit the
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.280
would clear the cache then hit the
refresh button he was doing that for

refresh button he was doing that for

each change looks like what are you

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
each change looks like what are you
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.000
each change looks like what are you
doing just open devtools it clicks the

cash and then use live reload and you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540
cash and then use live reload and you
 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.509
cash and then use live reload and you
don't touch anything and for me I grant

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
don't touch anything and for me I grant
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.030
don't touch anything and for me I grant
for a build tool but one of the nice

for a build tool but one of the nice
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.070
for a build tool but one of the nice
things is you get a load of these extra

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080
things is you get a load of these extra
 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.020
things is you get a load of these extra
modules for free and one of those that

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
modules for free and one of those that
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.509
modules for free and one of those that
literally rely on is library load so if

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
literally rely on is library load so if
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.090
literally rely on is library load so if
you're not familiar with grunt I think

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100
you're not familiar with grunt I think
 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.039
you're not familiar with grunt I think
about that was like half that maybe used

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049
about that was like half that maybe used
 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.430
about that was like half that maybe used
it it's essentially a way of pulling in

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
it it's essentially a way of pulling in
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.840
it it's essentially a way of pulling in
third-party modules and tasks that would

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850
third-party modules and tasks that would
 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.900
third-party modules and tasks that would
essentially perform some action for you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910
essentially perform some action for you
 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.720
essentially perform some action for you
so the main one for live reload is this

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
so the main one for live reload is this
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.680
so the main one for live reload is this
watch task right here and basically what

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
watch task right here and basically what
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.090
watch task right here and basically what
this is doing is saying whenever a file

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100
this is doing is saying whenever a file
 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.039
this is doing is saying whenever a file
changed in my file system I want you to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
changed in my file system I want you to
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.190
changed in my file system I want you to
perform certain tasks so here we've got

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
perform certain tasks so here we've got
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.219
perform certain tasks so here we've got
our compass task and whenever a sass

prefix a task now I loved flexbox when

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710
prefix a task now I loved flexbox when

it first started coming out and I was

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790
it first started coming out and I was
 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.030
it first started coming out and I was
playing with it the thing I hated was

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040
playing with it the thing I hated was
 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.980
playing with it the thing I hated was
the fact that I had multiple versions

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
the fact that I had multiple versions
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.870
the fact that I had multiple versions
with multiple vendor prefixes that I had

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
with multiple vendor prefixes that I had
 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.360
with multiple vendor prefixes that I had
to deal with auto prefix I just took all

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370
to deal with auto prefix I just took all
 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.790
to deal with auto prefix I just took all
of that away and I've literally never

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
of that away and I've literally never
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.390
of that away and I've literally never
looked back so once we've got these

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400
looked back so once we've got these
 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.920
looked back so once we've got these
other tasks that have run through and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
other tasks that have run through and
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.360
other tasks that have run through and
changed whatever we need we have this

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370
changed whatever we need we have this
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.909

library load task now what live reload

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919
library load task now what live reload
 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.240
library load task now what live reload
will do is it will inject a script into

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250
will do is it will inject a script into
 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.960
will do is it will inject a script into
my HTML and then basically it will start

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970
my HTML and then basically it will start
 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.159
my HTML and then basically it will start
running the library load server in the

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169
running the library load server in the
 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.740
running the library load server in the
back end as well so what that means is

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750
back end as well so what that means is
 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.510
back end as well so what that means is
whenever I make a change it'll tell the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
whenever I make a change it'll tell the
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.200
whenever I make a change it'll tell the
browser to update so that's definitely

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210
browser to update so that's definitely
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.159
browser to update so that's definitely
not what I want there we go so what that

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169
not what I want there we go so what that
 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.879
not what I want there we go so what that
means is as soon as I come into here I

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889
 
 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:36.850

this applies to mobile as well but you

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469
this applies to mobile as well but you
 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.439

grunt file and all the stuff that you've

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110
grunt file and all the stuff that you've
 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.369
grunt file and all the stuff that you've
done is kind of horrible and I'd

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379
done is kind of horrible and I'd
 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.050
done is kind of horrible and I'd
completely agree with you if I were to

completely agree with you if I were to
 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.999
completely agree with you if I were to
write that I would fail miserably and

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009
write that I would fail miserably and
 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.170
write that I would fail miserably and
probably spend several hours crying

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180

it's at that point you can use something

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279
it's at that point you can use something
 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.820
it's at that point you can use something
like human if you haven't who's heard of

out what tools people actually want to
 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.689
out what tools people actually want to
use so we came up with the mobile

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699
use so we came up with the mobile

all those people who test their multiple
 

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.989

devices who also then regularly tests

across multiple browsers on those

00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:06.439
across multiple browsers on those
 

00:12:06.439 --> 00:12:12.519
across multiple browsers on those
devices okay handful of people and it

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:12.529
devices okay handful of people and it

you can kind of imagine wire right like

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:14.089
you can kind of imagine wire right like

it's kind of a pain in the backside and

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360
it's kind of a pain in the backside and
 

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.340
it's kind of a pain in the backside and
the main reason for that is you've got

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.350
the main reason for that is you've got
 

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.419
the main reason for that is you've got
to go across each of those devices

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:19.429
to go across each of those devices
 

00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:20.889

select each of the browsers do you want

00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:20.899
select each of the browsers do you want
 

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.749
select each of the browsers do you want
to test against and then repeat for the

00:12:22.749 --> 00:12:22.759
to test against and then repeat for the
 

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:23.889
to test against and then repeat for the
next version if you want to test across

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:23.899
next version if you want to test across
 

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:27.460
next version if you want to test across
that and then also you've got to enter

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.470
that and then also you've got to enter
 

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.600
that and then also you've got to enter
in the IP address and you could argue

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:28.610
in the IP address and you could argue
 

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.030
in the IP address and you could argue
well you put a bookmark or hopefully no

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040
well you put a bookmark or hopefully no
 

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.710
well you put a bookmark or hopefully no

that browser it's pointing to my machine
 

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.439
that browser it's pointing to my machine
and no one ever touches it and it's all

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:35.449
and no one ever touches it and it's all
 

00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:37.900
and no one ever touches it and it's all
fine and dandy you still got to touch

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:37.910
fine and dandy you still got to touch
 

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.759
fine and dandy you still got to touch
the browser anyway and it's kind of a

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:39.769
the browser anyway and it's kind of a
 

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:41.139
the browser anyway and it's kind of a
bottleneck for the number of devices you

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:41.149
bottleneck for the number of devices you
 

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:45.789
bottleneck for the number of devices you
test against so I came up with this

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:45.799
test against so I came up with this
 

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.769
test against so I came up with this
thing to scratch that itch for myself

and all the other stuff and I kind of

00:16:20.119 --> 00:16:20.129
and all the other stuff and I kind of
 

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:21.379
and all the other stuff and I kind of
expect most you might be say the thing

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:21.389

we all hang on you've talked about
 

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.819
we all hang on you've talked about
devtools emulation now you're talking

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:25.829
devtools emulation now you're talking
 

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:27.139
devtools emulation now you're talking
about devices and now you're talking

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:27.149
about devices and now you're talking
 

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:30.470
about devices and now you're talking
about emulators as well why do I need

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480
about emulators as well why do I need
 

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.730
about emulators as well why do I need
all these different options what the

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740
all these different options what the
 

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.530
all these different options what the
hell are you talking about and they all

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540
hell are you talking about and they all
 

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.019
hell are you talking about and they all
have pros and cons devices that the big

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:39.029
have pros and cons devices that the big
 

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:40.400
have pros and cons devices that the big
con of these is you have to buy them

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:40.410
con of these is you have to buy them
 

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.780

kind of things at the same time you kind

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:45.569
kind of things at the same time you kind
 

00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:47.629
kind of things at the same time you kind
of need them like you get close to what

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639
of need them like you get close to what
 

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.949

well from the sdk tools it basically
allows the emulator to get access to the

have it there we go so they basically

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520
have it there we go so they basically

have it there we go so they basically
take builds of Android and I believe

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:27.580

again you can just install it on there

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:45.820
again you can just install it on there
 

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.399
again you can just install it on there
it's quite a nice option I think there

00:19:48.399 --> 00:19:48.409
it's quite a nice option I think there
 

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:50.950
it's quite a nice option I think there

you just need to support the Android
Browser like it's already there so it

00:19:58.659 --> 00:19:58.669

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.519

might be a slightly nicer way to support
