00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,680
The New Year. Yeah, the crunchy
meat [inaudible] I don't know that.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,020
Hey [inaudible] come on.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,240
[inaudible] I don't know why she just
got [inaudible] 2014 was the year of

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:16,590
getting to know these guys. Had you
guys a bit better. I'm not shy about it.

5
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,750
You really are the best
bits of this channel.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,100
It was a year for experiments we've
dropped on linguistic teaks of travel

7
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,740
destinations. We pondered
whimsical questions.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,850
Now that's not pondering Mr. Raff
give us a good pondering. There it is.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,030
We even wandered off into an
invalid creativeness. Okay,

10
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:40,050
I retract we from that
last one. I dragged you.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,300
Some of you may be against your will.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,340
We skipped from idea to idea with
little care for what the Internet's was

13
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,690
yearning to learn about language.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,080
Many questions when an answered
many fears surfaced because, oh,

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,060
what happened to the lessons
and how we ended up poetically,

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,950
right back where we started pondering
language. That's a good pondering.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,930
December cleared up my backlog and ended
us in a den of animal communication and

18
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:10,590
now as promised, I'm face
to face with decipherment.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,670
I'm even taking a step back to think
about writing systems in general.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,010
So alongside and unwieldily
awesomely growing list of languages,

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,400
suggestions from you since the grapher
illogical threat and reveling throughout

22
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,170
2015 so keep on keeping me in
check after all. We will senior,

23
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,400
super good at that.

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,380
Subscribe for Happy New
Year and happy language.
