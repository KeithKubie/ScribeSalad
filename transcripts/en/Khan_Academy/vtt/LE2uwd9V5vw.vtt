00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.107
- [Voiceover] So in this
video we're goint to talk about

00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:03.347
Euler's formula.

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:06.252
And one of the things I
want to start out with is

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.638
why do we want to talk about this

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:10.438
rather odd looking formula?

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:12.327
What's the big deal about this?

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:14.095
And there is a big deal.

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:15.928
And the big deal is e.

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.255
We love e.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.997
And I'll underline that twice.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:25.806
Now the reason is, because

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.407
when we take a derivative of e

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:29.240
D DT

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:32.395
of e to the x

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:35.303
equals e to the x.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:38.598
And D DT

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:42.650
of e to the ax

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.657
so where a is anything

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:47.324
equals ae to the ax.

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:52.382
And so the property is that
when you take a derivative

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:54.404
of the function, the
same function comes out.

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:57.046
Or, if you take a
derivative of the function

00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:00.558
a scaled version of the
same function comes out.

00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:02.044
And we love this, because why?

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:05.461
Because when we do differential equations

00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:08.424
e to the x

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.662
is the solution.

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:15.067
Almost every time.

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.538
Whenever we did a circuit

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:18.205
e to the x was the answer.

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:20.359
If you recall from when we were solving

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.910
circuit simple circuits
with differential equations

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.434
that we always said something like

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.185
well we're gonna guess that V of T

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.768
is some constant times e to the

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:31.716
st.

00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:34.662
That was a proposed solution.

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.303
This turned out to work every time.

00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:38.909
So there's something else we love, too.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:39.965
And that is

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:40.798
sinusoids.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:45.758
Or, sines and cosines.

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:50.237
Okay.

00:01:50.237 --> 00:01:51.404
We love these.

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:54.676
And that gets two lines.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:55.755
Now why do we love these?

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:58.505
Is because they happen in nature.

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.368
If you whistle

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.807
the air pressure looks like a sine wave.

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:08.848
If you ring a bell

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:11.448
the bell moves in a sine wave.

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:13.115
In any kind of music

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.519
if you look at the notes in music

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.526
the sound they make

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.152
the pressure waves look like

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:20.899
sine waves.

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.950
And circuits make sine waves, remember?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.931
We analyzed this circuit in great detail

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.931
it was the

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:28.283
LC circuit.

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:30.436
We looked at the natural response of this

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:32.519
and that was a sine wave.

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:34.804
Okay.

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:36.358
So, electric circuits make sine waves.

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:37.629
All these things make sine waves.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.570
They occur in nature.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.420
And we want to be able to analyze

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.101
things that happen when
sine waves are present.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.244
So, we have two things we love and we want

00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:47.686
to relate these two things.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.547
And these are going to be related

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:51.364
through that.

00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:52.655
Euler's Formula.

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.702
That's how we connect
these two separate ideas.

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:57.785
Let me, let's go do that.

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:03.037
So Euler's Formula says that

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:03.954
e to the jx

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:08.625
equals

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:11.257
cosine

00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:13.533
X

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:14.691
plus

00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:16.072
j

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:17.155
times sine x.

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.878
Sal has a really nice
video where he actually

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:26.974
proves that this is true.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:29.208
And he does it by taking the MacLaurin

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.380
series expansions of e,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.017
and cosine, and sine

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:35.577
and showing that this expression is true

00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:38.767
by comparing those series expansions.

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:40.474
And I'm not going to repeat that here

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.680
we're just going to state that as fact.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.309
And now we're going to look at
this equation a little bit more.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.161
So, this is the expression
that relates exponentials

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:52.330
that we love, to sines
and cosines that we love.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.488
And part of the price of
doing that is we introduce

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.491
complex numbers into our world.

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.970
Here's two complex numbers.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.803
Okay.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:02.285
This is where complex numbers come into

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:04.948
electrical engineering.

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.422
So we have to mention the other form of

00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:08.172
this formula which is

00:04:09.653 --> 00:04:11.388
e to the, I put a minus sign in here,

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:12.888
e to the minus jx.

00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:15.384
And that equals

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:17.060
cosine X

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:19.344
minus J

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:21.834
sine X.

00:04:23.447 --> 00:04:26.069
So these two expressions together

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.666
are Euler's Formula, or Euler's Formulas.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:30.997
And we're gonna exploit this by taking

00:04:30.997 --> 00:04:34.209
we'll be able to take
the cosines and sines

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:35.389
that we find in nature

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.231
we're going to be able to fashion
them into exponentials.

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.928
And these exponentials then go into our

00:04:39.928 --> 00:04:42.561
differential equations
and give us solutions.

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:44.764
And we're going to come back
and pull out the cosines

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:45.597
and sines.

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:49.031
That's the rhythm of how
we're going to use this equation

00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.198
to help us solve circuits.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.751
One small point I want to share,

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.837
notice that in both these
equations the sine comes first?

00:04:57.837 --> 00:04:59.279
And the sine is over here

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.834
on the imaginary side.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.855
So the cosine is the real side.

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:05.842
This is the reason that we
have a preference in the future

00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:07.214
we're going to have a preference

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.214
if we're talking about
our real world signals

00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:10.973
in terms of the cosine function.

00:05:10.973 --> 00:05:12.892
It's because in this Euler's Formula

00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:16.059
the cosine comes first, in both cases.

00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:19.272
So what I want to do now is

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:21.547
take a second and I want to see

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:25.457
if we had our signal expressed
in these exponentials

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:29.155
how do we recover the
cosine and the sine term?

00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:31.543
How do we flip these equations around

00:05:31.543 --> 00:05:34.185
so we can solve for the
cosine and the sine?

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:35.912
It's a simple bit of algebra here.

00:05:35.912 --> 00:05:37.891
It's good to see.

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:42.058
All right, so if I want to
isolate the cosine term.

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:44.616
If I want to isolate the cosine term

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:47.449
let me get rid of these guys here.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.624
So now to isolate the cosine term

00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:55.335
what I'm going to do is add
these two equations together

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.244
and that plus and minus
are going to cancel out

00:05:57.244 --> 00:05:58.839
this second term here.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.137
That's what I'm going for.

00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:01.137
So, if I add

00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:05.312
I'll get e to the jx

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:08.928
plus

00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:11.360
e to the minus jx

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:15.095
equals, cosine doubles,

00:06:16.364 --> 00:06:17.447
two cosine X.

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:22.366
And the two sine terms cancel out.

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:23.727
All right?

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.287
So then I could write

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:27.628
I'll write it over here.

00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:29.628
I can write, cosine of X

00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:33.288
equals

00:06:34.963 --> 00:06:36.296
e to the plus jx

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.579
plus e to the minus jx

00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:42.978
over two.

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:45.589
All right?

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:46.441
So that's the expression

00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:48.384
that's the expression
for cosine in terms of

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:50.134
complex exponentials.

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:53.086
Okay, let's go back and
see if we can get sine.

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:54.872
So what I'm gonna do with sine

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.705
is I'm going subtract.

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:04.058
And that gives me

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:05.996
what that'll do is that'll
get the cosine terms

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:07.722
to fall away.

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:09.652
And then I get

00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:10.569
e to the jx

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.277
subtracting, right?

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:16.194
Minus e to the minus jx

00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:18.774
equals

00:07:20.454 --> 00:07:22.951
cosine terms, they subtract out.

00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:24.534
And I get two times

00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:27.065
j

00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:29.977
times sine X.

00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:35.497
All right, and that means I can write

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.330
sine X

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:38.880
equals

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:41.239
e to the plus jx

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:44.768
minus e to the minus jx

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.556
over two j.

00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:53.729
And it's really easy

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.273
that j term is down there.

00:07:55.273 --> 00:07:57.501
That's easy to forget sometimes.

00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.072
So I put a square around these guys

00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:01.838
'cause that's important.

00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:04.926
So there's the two expressions.

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:06.693
That's the two expressions for

00:08:06.693 --> 00:08:08.737
if you have complex
exponentials and you want

00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:10.310
to extract the cosine,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.398
this is how you do it.

00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:13.308
And if you want to extract the sine

00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:15.340
this is how you do it.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.173
Okay?

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:18.405
And you can either

00:08:18.405 --> 00:08:20.460
you can put these in your head or

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.840
probably easier for me,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.406
if you just remember

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:25.830
Euler's Formula, this is
a pretty straightforward

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.247
quick derivation.

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:31.127
So the other thing we put a square around

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:32.544
is this guy here.

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:36.104
So we have Euler's Formula.

00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:39.222
And basically the cosine
and sine extracted

00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:41.029
from Euler's Formula.
