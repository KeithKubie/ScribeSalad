WESLEY CHUN: Hey, developers.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.090
Welcome to the "G
Suite Dev Show."

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.770
I'm your host, Wesley Chun.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.350
Today I'm joined by G Suite
engineer Grant Timmerman, who's

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.140
going to help me show you how
to enhance the Google Slides

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.930
experience for both
presenters and audiences.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.630
Grant, can we get a
quick intro to add-ons?

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.590
GRANT TIMMERMAN: Sure.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.600
Add-ons let you take
popular GC apps,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.290
such as Gmail, Google Sheets,
Slides, Docs, or Forms,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.290
and extend their functionality.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.130
Add-ons give
developers the ability

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.549
to integrate your
apps with ours.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.840
WESLEY CHUN: Add-ons are
powered by Google Apps Script,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.480
a customized server-side
flavor of JavaScript that

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.600
gives your apps controlled
access to G Suite data

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.079
and other Google and
external services.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.370
Check out the intro video if
you're new to Apps Script.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.380
Or, if you already
know Apps Script,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.697
check out our first
video on Slides add-ons.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:52.030
GRANT TIMMERMAN: Whether
you're attending a presentation

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.800
or delivering one,
sometimes it's

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.840
good to know how
far along you are.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.760
The problem is that
Google Slides itself

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.390
doesn't have a progress bar.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.657
So let's add one.

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:02.740
Let's get to the computer,
where Wes will walk you

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.525
through the add-on.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:05.650
WESLEY CHUN: Thanks, Grant.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.530
By the way, the code is also
available at the progress bar

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.280
source code link.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.390
So feel free to follow along.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's get started.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.790
At the top are the variables
for an arbitrary progress bar

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.660
ID, as well as the desired pixel
height, and finally a handle

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.065
to the current presentation.

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:23.440
The first pair of
short functions

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.600
form the boilerplate
necessary to designate

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.970
this Apps Script as an
add-on and what shows up

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.640
in the add-on menu,
toggling the creation

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.790
or removal of the progress
bars on the slides.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.060
The Create Bars function adds
progress bars to each slide,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.790
and similarly Delete
Bars removes them.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.070
Both of these functions
loop through each slide,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.940
either creating the progress
bar rectangles or removing them.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.460
When adding them,
Create Bars calculates

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.860
the correct percentage,
so the rectangle

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.540
added to the bottom
of each slide

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.670
accurately represents
how far along it

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.530
is in the presentation.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.870
The Bar ID is used to flag
the progress bar rectangles

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.710
so that Delete Bars
removes only those

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.750
and not rectangles
that are actually

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.640
part of the slide content.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.289
You put hours into
this presentation,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.080
so obviously you wouldn't
want this feature

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.180
to mess around with your
current masterpiece, right?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.790
And using the add-on
is just as simple.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.170
Add the code to
the script editor

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.450
for any Google Slides
presentation for which you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.100
have edit access.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.920
You'll see the show-and-hide
progress bar menu items

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.050
and can use them as if
Google Slides already

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.305
had this feature built in.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.430
Let's scroll down so we
could see the progress bars

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.210
as I add them then
move to another slide

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.380
so you can see them
disappear when I remove them.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.710
To distribute your add-on to
others, you must publish it.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.900
Users can install
published add-ons directly

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.150
to their presentations
without knowing or seeing

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.710
any of your code.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.320
This demo shows how you
can add core functionality

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.180
to your favorite G Suite apps.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.630
And best of all, it doesn't have
to take too many lines of code.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.536
Thanks for making this
cool add-on, Grant.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:57.660
GRANT TIMMERMAN: Sure, Wes.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.600
To dig deeper into the code
and read more about the add-on,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.902
check out the Quickstart
pages in the docs.

00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:04.860
WESLEY CHUN: To learn
more about other add-ons,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.841
like for Docs, Sheets, or Forms,
check out the Add-ons Overview

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:08.340
page.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:10.831
GRANT TIMMERMAN:
Outside of Apps Script,

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:13.650
you can write regular web or
mobile apps using the REST API.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.780
Check out the other
developer videos

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.410
which show you how to use
Apps Script or the API

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.090
to integrate with Google Slides.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.340
WESLEY CHUN: This is just
one of the many ideas of how

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.170
you can extend G Suite apps.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.550
We invite you to
enhance this example.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.240
For instance, I find the
progress bar's default color

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.320
a bit too light.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.760
Can we darken them?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.250
Well, the rectangle's
color is called the fill.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.820
So your hint is look for
the getFill and setSolidFill

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.714
methods.

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:41.130
GRANT TIMMERMAN:
A progress bar is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.900
a great feature
for both presenters

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.736
as well as the audience.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.110
And this short
example shows you,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.580
one, that you can add
missing features and two,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.370
you don't need a full
blown app to implement one.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.771
The sky's the limit to what
you can do with add-ons.

00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:57.520
WESLEY CHUN: Glad you
could join us today.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.467
And special thanks to
Grant for helping out.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:00.300
This is Wesley Chun.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.210
I'll see you upstairs
in the G Suite.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.560
