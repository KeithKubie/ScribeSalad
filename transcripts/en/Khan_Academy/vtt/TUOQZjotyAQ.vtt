00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.990
So let's see where
we left off.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.130
We were studying the balance
sheet of this Bank A, I think

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.180
that's what I called it.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.380
And we said, OK on the assets
side, had some government

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.540
bonds, had some AAA
corporate bonds,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.970
some commercial mortgages.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.530
And then this is the thing
that I really wanted to

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.160
highlight, that it also had
$4 billion of residential

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.600
collateralized debt
obligations.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.070
And I explained little bit
about what those are.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.850
And I have several videos
where I explain

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.170
that in more detail.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.460
And how they probably led, or
most definitely led, to the

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.390
housing bubble.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.950
And then we have a little bit
of cash on top of that.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.530
On the liability side,
the bank just owes a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.340
lot of money to people.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.120
If this were a commercial bank,
kind of your Bank of

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.340
Americas, or your Chases of
the world, then one of the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.590
liabilities here would have also
been the deposits of the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.270
people who keep their
money at the bank.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.510
But we're not going
to assume that.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.040
This could be just
kind of any bank.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.100
Actually, this could be any type
of financial institution.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.640
Frankly, it doesn't
have to be a bank.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.690
This could be the balance sheet
of a hedge fund, or a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.800
private equity firm, or pretty
much any type of financial

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.600
institution.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.810
But anyway, back to where
we were in the example.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.950
We said, and we learned it in
the first video, and we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.990
learned it in the balance sheet
video, that if you take

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.550
your assets and you subtract
out your liability-- so you

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.420
take what you have, you subtract
out what you owe,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600
you're left with what
you're really worth.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.250
And that's called your equity.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.330
And if you're a publicly traded
company, actually you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730
don't have to be publicly
traded, but if you're a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.760
corporation, that's called your
shareholders' equity.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.390
And what does that mean?

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.400
Well that means the people who
own a stake in the company, or

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.300
the shareholders, they
share this piece.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.130
And just to hit the point home,
and I think this is an

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.000
important one because I
feel like people kind

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.480
of talk past this.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.920
There's two notions, there's
your book value of equity, and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.240
that's the value of the equity
that comes out of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.070
your balance sheet.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.530
So if you assume that
everything, all of these

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.690
numbers, are accurate-- and
we're going to think a lot

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.530
about what it means to have an
accurate number here-- and you

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.600
assume that all of these
numbers are accurate.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.970
Then the number that pops out on
the equity side, that is a

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.340
book value of your equity.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.710
And just as an example, I said
well let's say that Bank A is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.430
a public company.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.750
It has 500 million shares.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.820
And so that means that if you
take its $3 billion of equity,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.980
divide by 500 million shares,
that means that there is $6.00

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.350
of book equity per share.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.870
So that means if all of these
numbers are correct, then the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.490
stock of that company is
worth $6.00 per share.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.470
Exactly $6.00 per share.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.230
And you're saying, wait Sal,
that doesn't make sense, we

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.290
all know that the stock market
is a wild ride, especially

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.420
banking stocks.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.180
They swing left and right
and up and down.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.290
And how can you tell me that you
know just by looking at a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.020
balance sheet, you can give an
exact amount for what its

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.220
equity value is?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490
And that is an important
distinction.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.190
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.140
Maybe I'll erase this.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.810
Actually, let me
clear this out.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.550
I think it's a distraction.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.010
You might just want to watch the
video on mortgage-backed

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.420
securities and collateralized
debt obligations if you need a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.680
refresher there.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970
So what does it mean when, I'm
telling you right now that you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.660
can look at it company's balance
sheet, and if you

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.520
believe what they say, you can
actually calculate a book

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.100
value per share.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.640
So why do stocks fluctuate
wildly left and right?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.750
Well, it's interesting.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.420
It actually tells you a lot
about what the market thinks

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.860
about a company's
balance sheet.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.910
Let me fill this in.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.310
This was $26 billion
of assets.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.540
And then I had $23 billion
of liabilities.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.970
And that's how we got equity
of $3 billion.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.830
And book equity per share,
or the book value

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.810
per share of $6.00.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.910
Now let's say we go on to Yahoo
Finance and we type in

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.236
the ticker symbol for this
bank-- Bank A, whatever we

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:46.960
want to call it.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.840
And let's say that its market
price is I don't know, it is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.560
$12.00 per share.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.380
So what is happening here?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.180
The book value is $6.00, but the
market saying no, no, no,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.380
we are willing to pay
$12.00 per share for

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.900
one of those shares.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.240
And just to make a point here,
when you look up a share price

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.550
in the stock market, or even
better, when you buy a stock

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.720
on the stock market,
that money is not

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.170
going to the company.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.660
The company initially raises
money by selling shares.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.980
And that's often done with an
initial public offering.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.360
They will sell some shares
directly to the market.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.230
And that money goes directly
to the company.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.120
Or they might do it in an
offering, and we'll talk more

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.820
about that later.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.260
But 99% of the time, when you
buy a share, it is not going

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.180
to the company.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.070
It is going to the previous
person who held that share.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.660
That's why it's called
a secondary market.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.780
It's not going to the company.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290
So it's just a bunch of people
trading the share price.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.720
And the only reason why that
share price really

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.930
fundamentally matters to the
company is if the company were

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.370
to raise money at
a future date.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.700
So let's say the share price
today is $12.00.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.860
Let's say I bought a share for
$12.00 dollars a share today,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.520
that means maybe I bought
it from you.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.710
I didn't buy from the company.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.010
But that at least tells the
company that if it needed

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.520
money, if it needed to raise
money, it could sell shares

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.200
probably at something close
to $12.00 a share.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.490
It also tells someone who wanted
to buy out the whole

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.890
company, so if they wanted to
take over the company, that

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.400
maybe if they offered some type
of a premium to $12.00 a

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.700
share, they could buy out
all of the stock.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.130
But that's not the
topic for this.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.920
And actually, the more I think
about it, I really should do

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.980
videos on all of
these concepts.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.960
But anyway, so the market is
giving a $12.00 per share

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.860
value, what does that mean?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.860
The person who's paying $12.00
a share is assuming that this

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.290
is understated, the book
value is understated.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.610
And so if the book value is
understated, that means that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.180
either the assets are
understated, or the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.530
liabilities are overstated.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.510
Most times the liabilities
are pretty easy to

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.220
get a handle on.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.300
Sometimes pension liabilities
or some type of litigation

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.140
liabilities, that's hard
to get a grasp on.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.470
But most times, you can look
at a balance sheet and you

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.300
say, OK this is the
money they owe.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.560
That's not too hard to value.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.250
What is often very interesting
to value are the assets on a

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.200
balance sheet.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.650
So, with this balance sheet, you
would say $6.00 per share,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.380
but the market is willing
to say $12.00.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.920
Then you say, either these
assets or somehow being

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.930
undervalued or the company might
have some assets that

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.850
somehow are not captured on
the balance sheet, right?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.380
Maybe they're intangible
assets.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.130
Or there's some type of earning
power that in some way

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.030
is not captured here.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.515
I think when I originally did
the videos on balance sheets,

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:31.820
I actually talked about you
can't quantify charisma and

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.500
good looks.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.665
And so that's maybe why I have
more assets than might balance

00:06:36.665 --> 00:06:37.370
sheet might predict.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.450
Well, this notion is
the same thing, but

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.640
on the company level.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.370
Maybe, if this were Goldman
Sachs' balance sheet, maybe

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.810
its book value per
share is $6.00.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.220
But the market is willing to pay
$12.00 for it because it's

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.450
Goldman Sachs.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.550
That's the corporate equivalent
of charisma and

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.190
good looks.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.580
They say, just by their brand
they're able to make more

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.570
money than everyone else.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.340
They're able to do more with
whatever assets we give them.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.240
So I'm willing to pay a premium
to their book value.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.580
And whether or not that's true,
that's a tough case.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.200
I think that argument can very
easily be made with a company

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.140
like Coca-Cola, where it does
have a very powerful brand.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.180
Where that brand and that
formula, that secret formula,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.540
really are the value of the
firm, and they probably aren't

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.960
captured on their
balance sheet.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.250
With a bank, I'd be a little
more skeptical of paying a

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.220
significant multiple
of this, right?

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.650
Here, what multiple
are we paying?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.670
If this is the market value-- so
let's say this is the stock

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:38.900
price, or the market stock
price-- I'd be skeptical of

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.830
paying two times
the book value.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.110
But it's actually not hard to
find a lot of companies that

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.670
are trading at far more than
two times the book value.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.460
So that's what it means.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.980
That's what the market is
essentially saying if they're

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.300
paying $12.00 a share for
something that essentially has

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.130
a book value of $6.00
per share.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.660
Or maybe one of these assets
are worth more.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.320
Maybe they had, on the books,
there's a property here in

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.990
Manhattan that they bought 50
years ago that they have it on

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.950
the books for $0.50.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.580
But maybe the shareholders say,
oh no that's really worth

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.640
a million dollars or something,
I don't know.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.570
Another way to think about it
is, if the market is paying

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.710
$12 million per share, what's
the market cap of the company?

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.020
And the market cap of the
company is really what's the

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.370
market's guess of what the
shareholders' equity is?

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.870
So the market cap, you take $12
per share, multiply it by

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.010
500 million shares.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.930
So 12 times 500 million, or
let's say 0.5 billion.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.580
And you get a $6 billion
market cap.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.750
So if the equity is trading,
or if the stock is trading,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.940
that day at $12.00 dollars per
share, that says that the

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.620
market, or at least the people
on the margin trading that

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.760
stock that day-- and I'll do
not another whole set of

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.350
videos on what that means
and how prices are set.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.250
But that means that they think
that this equity isn't $3

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.680
billion, that it's actually
worth $6 billion.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.630
I told you for all the reasons,
maybe the brand is

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.640
worth a lot, or they have some
secret formula, or one of

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.120
these assets somehow
is understated.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.690
So that's fine.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.700
That's the situation where
the market price is

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.090
above the book value.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.210
But what's the situation where,
let's say that on that

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:18.830
day of trading, the share price
is that $3.00 per share.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.770
Well if we say 3 times 0.5
billion, that means that the

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.040
market says that this company's

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.150
market cap is 1.5 billion.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.950
Or another way of viewing it,
is that this is the market's

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.730
guess, or you could
call it the market

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.610
value of the equity.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.880
This is the market's guess
of the value of

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.520
this company's equity.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.800
So the market says, OK I don't
care that Bank A says that

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.090
they have $3 billion, that their
assets minus liabilities

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.150
are $3 billion.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.100
We don't buy it.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.510
We actually think this is
only worth $1.5 billion.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.380
And it's probably because they
think that one of these things

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.390
on the left-hand side of the
balance sheet, one of these

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.120
assets, are worth less
than what the bank

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.340
says they're worth.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.540
It could be that one of these
liabilities is worth more.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.180
Maybe there's some type of
environmental liability that

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.310
the company is somehow
understating.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.000
But let's not get too
complicated right now, I'll do

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.200
a bunch of videos on that.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.240
But when the market value, or
the market cap, is below the

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.040
book equity, that's the market
just saying, hey we're calling

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.920
your bluff.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.510
Something here doesn't
smell right.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.030
Something here isn't worth
what you say it's worth.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.390
And I just realized that
I'm out of time.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.470
And I will continue this
in the next video.
