00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.560
Ok, Matt, I know blood cells are

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.530
important, especially the red blood cells, because

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.470
we hear about them all the time, but what exactly do blood cells do?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.280
&gt;&gt; Well, red blood cells are one of the most populous cell types in your body,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.090
because they carry out a very important function.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.906
There's a very special molecule inside red blood cells

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:17.780
called hemoglobin that binds oxygen and carries it

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.320
to all the cracks and crevices in your

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.990
body. Its role is to actually go to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.810
all these places and exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.790
It's the gas waste of our bodies. And even the shape. Everything about a red

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.360
blood cell is essentially tailored to help maximize

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.700
the efficiency of exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt; Wait. But then, what does that have

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.000
to do with blood type? Why does that matter?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.260
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. Blood type doesn't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.370
directly affect any oxygen consumption. But, on the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.450
surface of red blood cells, like most cells

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.060
in your body, they're covered with different molecules

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.290
that determine the blood cell's type, as we

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.950
call it. This carbohydrate may or may not

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.970
be modified to have three different types. The

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.290
addition of an A antigen, the addition of a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.420
B antigen, or no addition at all. And

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.530
whichever combination of these antigens you have is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.760
called your blood type. Now the protein that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.090
modifies the carbohydrate is an enzyme, a protein itself.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.480
An enzyme is anything that catalyzes a biological reaction.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.540
So if you look and see this enzyme adding the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.700
A antigen, or the B antigen, or no antigen,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.080
where do you think this enzyme, this protein, comes from?
