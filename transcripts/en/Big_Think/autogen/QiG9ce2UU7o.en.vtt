00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000
ended up in 2007 it's a remarkable run
of success and it's partly because we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
of success and it's partly because we
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.620
of success and it's partly because we
did some things right and it's also

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
did some things right and it's also
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990
did some things right and it's also
partly because we got very lucky in

where the country was located the fact

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
where the country was located the fact
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940
where the country was located the fact
that the native population turned out to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
that the native population turned out to
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.970
that the native population turned out to
be very susceptible to disease that was

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

brought over from Europe the fact that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
brought over from Europe the fact that
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850
brought over from Europe the fact that
the European countries kept beating each

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
the European countries kept beating each
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069

other up while we sat here and became

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
other up while we sat here and became
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900
other up while we sat here and became
more productive so we've been very

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
more productive so we've been very
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.639
more productive so we've been very
fortunate so we have this view of the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
fortunate so we have this view of the
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.520
fortunate so we have this view of the
world that everything tends to go well

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
world that everything tends to go well

and therefore your question you know how

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
and therefore your question you know how
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450
and therefore your question you know how
can we solve all these problems so this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
can we solve all these problems so this
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939
can we solve all these problems so this
happy story continues well of course it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
