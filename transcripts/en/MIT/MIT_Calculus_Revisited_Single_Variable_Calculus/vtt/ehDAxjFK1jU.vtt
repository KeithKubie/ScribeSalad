HERBERT GROSS: Hi, our lecture
today, if we're looking at

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.140
this from an analytical point
view, should be called 'Maxima

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.470
and Minima'.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.510
And if we're looking at it
from a geometric point of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.470
view, 'High Points
and Low Points'.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.530
And actually, whichever point of
view we're looking at from,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.400
it's a very nice application off
much of the theory that we

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.260
have learned up until now.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.330
So without further ado, let's
talk a little bit about what

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.830
we mean by high points, low
points, maxima or minima.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.250
Which is, as I say, I've called
the lecture today.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.340
Now, as is always the case, we
usually have to have some sort

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.480
of a fundamental result
from which all of our

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.340
other results follow.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.620
And in this context what I call
the fundamental theorem

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.020
for a study of maxima minima
is the following.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.765
Suppose that 'f of c' is at
least as great as 'f of x' for

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.540
all 'x' in a delta neighborhood
of 'c'.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.090
In other words, we have some
open interval with delta

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.570
surrounding 'c'.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.290
And then for all 'x' in that
neighborhood, 'f of c' is at

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.110
least as great as 'f of x'.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.690
Or equivalently, it might be
that 'f of c' is less than or

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.270
equal to 'f of x' for all 'x'
in this neighborhood.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.280
And suppose also, that 'f
prime of c' exists.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.900
Then the theorem says, 'f
prime of c' in this

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.310
case, must be 0.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.530
And whereas this can be proven
analytically, again the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.190
analytical proof is motivated
by what's happening

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.160
geometrically.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.700
And the geometric demonstration
is particularly

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.380
easy to visualize in this
particular case.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.130
Let me run the risk of drawing
this fairly freehand here.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.390
See what we're saying is this.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.470
Suppose you have at the point
(c, 'f of c') on this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.840
particular curve.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.240
Suppose that this particular
curve the derivative exists

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.060
and is positive.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.070
See that's the way
I've drawn this.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.490
In other words, notice that in
the neighborhood of the point

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.200
'c' here, for example, the
derivative here is positive.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.450
The curve is always rising.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.540
Now, what we're saying over here
is that if you look at

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.660
this particular picture, observe
that 'f of c' will not

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.700
exceed 'f of x' for all 'x'
in this neighborhood.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.710
In fact, I think you can see
just by looking at this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.920
picture that as 'x' increases,
'f of x' increases.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.490
In other words, in terms of this
picture, if 'x' is less

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.140
than 'c', 'f of x' is
less than 'f of c'.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.030
And if 'x' is greater than
'c', 'f of x' is

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.730
greater than 'f of c'.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750
In other words, what we're
saying is if the derivative is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.800
positive, it means that the
curve is always rising.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.840
And hence, the point in the
middle of that neighborhood

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.060
cannot be the highest point
in that neighborhood.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.350
Nor, for example, can it
be the lowest point.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.910
In fact, a similar argument
holds if we want to illustrate

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.950
that 'f of c' is less than or
equal to 'f of x' in this

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.640
particular neighborhood.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.470
And by the way, again, observe
what we're saying.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.450
This is rather crucial
over here.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.660
First of all, we're talking
about a sufficiently small

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.040
neighborhood of 'c'.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360
What I mean by that is
something like this.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.910
And by the way, this could
cause a little bit of a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.935
problem if you're not careful
with your language.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.120
If we drew a picture like this
and you say to somebody, where

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.740
are the high-low
points on this?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.080
I think it's quite natural that
the person would say,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.820
well, this is the high point.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.350
I'll call that 'H'.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.630
And this is the low point.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.270
I'll call that 'L'.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.180
And he might tend to forget
about this point here because

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
even though it's fairly high,
it's not nearly as high as

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.160
this point.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.960
What I'd like you to see however
is that our definition

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.750
talks about what?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.430
In a neighborhood of
the given point.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.050
You see what we're saying here
is that if we pick a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.470
particular neighborhood,
an appropriately chosen

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.190
neighborhood surrounding 'c',
then what is true is that at

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.760
the value of 'x' corresponding
to 'c', 'f of c' is the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.900
highest point in a suitable
neighborhood of 'c'.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.140
In other words, if you knew that
for some reason or other,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.210
you had to be working in this
neighborhood here, you could

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.980
say, well, in the domain in
which I'm interested in, this

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.730
is a high point.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.170
And this is why we talk about
'local' or 'relative' maxima

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.080
or minima in addition to
'absolute' maxima and minima.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.980
In fact, you see, this happens
quite frequently in practice.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.420
Suppose you were doing an
experiment and you really

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.500
wanted to produce the largest
possible value of 'y'.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.000
Well, you see, utopianaly you
would like to pick 'x' out

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.140
here someplace.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.440
But suppose because of some
constraint in the laboratory,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.930
the largest value of 'x'
that you could choose

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.430
might be over here.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.670
And then you see what the
equivalent problem would be.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.410
And this is where the domain
of the function has such a

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.520
powerful meaning in terms of
practical applications.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
What you're saying is look-it ,
if the domain of my function

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.110
is limited to this interval
over here, then this

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.300
particular point as far
as I'm concerned

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.840
is the highest point.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.265
In other words then, notice
that the labelling 'N sub

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:59.950
'delta of c'' indicates that
you're talking locally rather

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.640
than globally in a neighborhood
of 'c'.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.140
And this is the important
issue here.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.560
Now, the hardest part about this
particular result as I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.520
see it, is not understanding the
result as much as it is of

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.570
reading more into the result
than what's really there.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.420
And so I have a few
cautions for you.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.800
The three commandments
they turn out to be.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.510
The first is, beware
of false converses.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.550
And before you can be beware of
false converses, you have

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.210
to know what a converse is.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.790
Roughly speaking, a converse
applies only to an if-then

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.350
type of statement.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.120
And you get the converse
of a given statement by

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.540
interchanging the clauses that
follow the if and the then.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.860
And the reason you have to
beware is that a true

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.370
statement can have
a false converse.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.250
For example, consider the
following true statement.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.390
If a person is listening to me
lecture now, then he is alive.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.140
Hopefully, a true statement.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.590
If we now interchange the
clauses to form the converse

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.460
it says if a person is
alive, then he is

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.650
listening to me lecture.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.420
A tragically false statement.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.770
But notice the difference
between inverting the clauses

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.590
of an if-then statement.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.870
And the idea is this.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:25.010
Notice that our theorem says if
'f prime' exists, then-- or

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.270
if there is a local maximum
or a local minimum, 'f

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.960
prime of c' is 0.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.020
It does not say that if 'f prime
of c' is 0 we have a

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.220
local maximum or a
local minimum.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.560
Perhaps the easiest
way to see that is

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.720
in terms of an example.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.790
That's the nicest thing to show
how a converse is false.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.550
To prove that something is true,
you can't do it just by

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.350
showing its true in
certain cases.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.180
But to show that something is
not true, all you have to do

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.060
is exhibit one example in which
the result is false.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.780
That's enough to prove that
it can't always be true.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.660
For example, in this particular
diagram, notice

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.340
that in the curve 'y' equals
'f of x', which I've drawn

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.900
here, the curve at the point
'c' comma 'f of c' has a

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.230
horizontal tangent.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.860
In other words, 'f prime
of c' is 0 here.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.520
But notice that in any
neighborhood that surrounds

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.780
'c', in any open interval that's
around 'c', notice that

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.650
if 'x' is less than 'c', 'f of
x' will be less than 'f of c'.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.610
And if 'x' is greater than 'c',
'f of x' will be greater

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.710
than 'f of c'.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.000
In other words, notice that
except for the stationary

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.370
value at which we have a
horizontal tangent, the graph

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.460
is always rising in any
neighborhood of 'c'.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.409
That's the first point
I want you to see.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.860
The second point says
beware if 'f prime

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.670
of c' doesn't exist.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.650
See all our theorem
said is, look it.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.720
If you have a relative high
point, a relative low point,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.900
relative max, or a relative min
at 'x' equal 'c', and if

00:08:53.900 --> 00:09:00.050
'f prime of c' exists, then
'f prime of c' is 0.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.060
But who said that 'f prime
of c' has to exist?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.440
Again, let's look in terms
of an example.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.830
If we let 'f of x' equal the
absolute value of 'x', recall

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:15.160
from our previous assignments
and the like that the

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.050
derivative of 'f of x',
in this case, does not

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.570
exist when 'x' is 0.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:26.500
In other words, 'f prime
of 0' doesn't exist.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500
And why is that?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.480
Well, notice that the graph of
'y' equals the absolute value

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.640
of 'x' is the straight line
'y' equals 'x' if 'x' is

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.040
non-negative and the straight
line 'y' equals 'minus x' if

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.130
'x' is negative.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.960
In other words, 'f prime of x'
is 1 if 'x' is positive.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.940
It's minus 1 if 'x'
is negative.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.460
And hence, a jump discontinuity
in the

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.840
derivative at 0.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.030
But you see, the
point is this.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.430
If you look at our graph,
do we have a low point

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.020
at 'x' equals 0?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.030
In other words, is this the
lowest point in the

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.180
neighborhood of 0?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.230
And the answer is yes.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.130
In fact, it's an 'absolute'
low point.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.030
Meaning that no matter where you
go, no point on our graph

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.550
can be less or lower than this
particular point here.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.440
But that's irrelevant.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.350
The point is what?

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.010
If we looked for a place where
'f prime of c' was 0 in this

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.620
example, we wouldn't find one.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.520
That would not mean that there
wasn't a low point.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.880
What happened was what?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.220
The low point snuck in
at a place where the

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.300
derivative did not exist.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.490
And again, you have
to be careful.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.750
All I said was what?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.210
Beware of points for which 'f
prime of c' does not exist.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.030
It does not mean that at each
point where 'f prime of c'

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.030
does not exist that you're
going to have a

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.270
high or a low point.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.090
For example, remember that the
derivative not existing

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.440
loosely speaking means what?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.570
That there's a sharp corner
to the curve.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.510
What I'm thinking of is
something like this.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.520
Let's take a curve that's
always rising, say

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.900
something like this.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.300
Now, let's suppose we put a
sharp corner in here, but in

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.940
such a way that the curve still

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.770
continues to always rise.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.180
Say like this.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.390
Now you see, at this particular
value of 'c', 'f

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.860
prime of c' doesn't exist.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.010
I think you can see intuitively

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.580
what's happening here.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.800
The slope approaches one value
as you approach 'c' from the

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.040
left and another value if you
approach 'c' from the right.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.970
Now even know 'f prime of c'
doesn't exist at this point,

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.550
notice that this point
is neither a

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.170
high nor a low point.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.830
Meaning that all points what?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.710
To the left of this point are
below it and all points to the

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.540
right of this point
are above it.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.460
So again, what?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.190
Beware when 'f prime of c'
equals 0, but don't jump to

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.020
any false conclusions.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.450
And the third caution is an
extremely important one.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.450
In fact, for the first time
from a practical point of

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.760
view, we are going to probably
see analytically what is the

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.490
difference between
an open interval

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.300
and a closed interval.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.190
Suppose I have the function 'f
of x' equals 'x squared', but

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.810
the domain of 'f' is now the
open interval from 2 to 3.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.700
In other words, the inputs of
the 'f' machine are restricted

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.850
to all those numbers which
are greater than 2,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.430
but less than 3.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.670
Now, let's take a look here.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.750
Let's first of all, see where
'f prime of x' is 0.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.610
First of all, 'f prime of x' is
'2x' and that equals 0 if

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.480
and only if 'x' equals 0.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.880
Now here's where the domain
is very important.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.870
Is 'x' equal 0 in our domain?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.920
The answer is no.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.420
'x' equals 0 is not
in our domain.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.480
Our domain is restricted to be
the open interval from 2 to 3.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.660
Therefore, as far as our
function 'f' is concerned--

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.790
and remember, way back in one
of our early, I don't even

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.270
think it was a lecture.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.620
It was in our supplementary
notes.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.700
We pointed out that when you
define a function, you need

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.510
not only the rule, but you
must specify the domain.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.110
Remember, two functions were
equal not only if they were

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.250
the same rule, but they had to
be defined on the same domain.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.160
So f here is defined on
a domain from 2 to 3.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.380
And on that particular domain
of definition there is no

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.750
place where the derivative
is 0.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.900
By the same token, since the
derivative is a polynomial and

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.620
all polynomials are
differentiable, and all

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.270
differentiable functions are
continuous, there certainly

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.750
will be no places where 'f prime
of x' doesn't exist.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:34.140
In other words, 'f prime' exists
for all 'x' in the

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.290
domain of 'f'.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.100
In other words, here is a
particular example in which a

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.350
particular function on its
domain of definition does not

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.500
have any high or low
points on it.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.100
And I'll illustrate that
graphically in a few moments.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.730
I simply wanted to put this on
the board first to put it into

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.970
sharp contrast with what we're
going to say next.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.180
If we're not careful, in fact,
the next problem looks exactly

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.340
the same as the problem
that we just solved.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.820
Namely, what we want to do now
is investigate the function 'f

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.940
of x' equals 'x squared'.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.200
But we want the domain of
'f' now to be what?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.680
The closed interval
from 2 to 3.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.080
In other words, the only
difference between this

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.300
problem and the problem that we
just solved is that now we

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.190
want the endpoints included.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.720
Now, there's no sense
repeating the

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.210
part that we did before.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:36.030
First of all, will 'f prime of
x' equal 0 in the domain of

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.110
definition?

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.990
As we saw before, no.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:50.330
Is 'f prime' nonexistent any
place in the interval?

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.400
No, it's differentiable.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.150
It's a smooth polynomial
curve.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.380
Answer is no.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.380
Now, here's where we come to two
very important points that

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.410
hopefully, will clarify certain
conventions that were

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.090
made in the textbook.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.420
In our section on continuity
there was a little result that

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.370
may have seemed a little
bit obscure.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.300
It said what?

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.190
That a continuous function
defined on a closed interval

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.760
must take on its maximum and
minimum values someplace on

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.360
that closed interval.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.630
You see, all we've proven
over here is what?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:33.640
That if 'f' has a max or min,
what we've proven is what?

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:42.625
It does not occur in the open
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:43.700
Well, look it.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.260
If the high and low points have
to occur some place on

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.120
the closed interval and they
can't appear, as we've seen,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.960
in the open interval, where
must they occur?

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.310
Well, if they can't be inside
and they have to be on the

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.850
interval, it must be that they
take place at the endpoints.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.590
Let's go back without referring

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.920
back to another board.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.400
Remember we wrote down when
we're talking about high and

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.370
low points that we talked about
'x' being in a delta

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.890
neighborhood of 'c'.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.040
It meant what?

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.390
That you could surround 'c'
by some bandwidth 'delta'.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.870
And notice that our definition
in the textbook of a

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.750
neighborhood was always
an open interval.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.440
And the reason that the
definition is given to be open

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.420
is that notice that what the
definition now says is what?

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.090
You know what's going on
on either side of 'c'.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.830
We know what's going on
either side of 'c'.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:52.050
Notice that in the case where
you have a closed interval, by

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.530
definition of a closed interval
notice that what?

00:16:54.530 --> 00:17:00.220
We know what's happening as we
come in on 'a' from the right.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.450
And we know what's happening
to 'b' as we come in on it

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.420
from the left.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.740
But allegedly, meaning that
since the function is only

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.470
defined on the closed interval
from 'a' to 'b', we don't know

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.150
what's happening before 'a',
and we don't know what's

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.520
happening before 'b'.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.510
In other words, this is why the
test for 'f prime of c'

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:25.250
equaling 0 applies only to 'c'
being in the interior.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.040
In other words, in
an open interval.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.030
So in other words then, you see
if a function happens to

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:36.080
be continuous on the closed
interval and it doesn't have

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.990
any high-low points in the
interior of the interval, then

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.670
it must have its high-low
points where?

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.720
It must be at the endpoints.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.460
And to show you quite simply
what was going on in this

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.650
particular problem, notice
that if we graph 'f of x'

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.830
equals 'x squared' and look at
this say, first of all, on the

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.490
closed interval from 2 to 3 what
we're saying is look it,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.570
any point in which we look at a
neighborhood that isn't 2 or

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.540
3, the curve is rising on
one side of the point.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.630
In other words, the curve is
rising on both sides of the

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.030
point, so that if you are to
the left of the point, the

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.700
height will be less than the
point you're interested in.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.410
If you're to the right of it,
the height will exceed the

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.810
point that you're
interested in.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.260
But notice that at the end
points themselves, you do have

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.420
what in this case?

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.320
Not a relative high or
low, but actually an

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.220
absolute high or low.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.570
In other words, the
point '2 comma 4'.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.890
See, what is the
endpoint here?

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.800
One endpoint is 4, the other
endpoint going up on the

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.440
y-direction here is 9.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.890
What you're saying is what?

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.130
4 is less than 9.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.420
Every value of 'x squared'
between 2 and 3 falls

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.190
between 4 and 9.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.230
And what you're saying
is what?

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.800
That the lowest point occurs
when 'x' is 2, the highest

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.090
point occurs when 'y' is 3.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.410
The interesting point to note is
that if you now look at the

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.530
open interval and exclude the
endpoints, you cannot get a

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.600
lowest point or a
highest point.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.960
Namely, notice that if you allow
yourself to get as close

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.150
to 2 as you want without ever
getting there, it means you

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.290
could have done what?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.880
Moved closer to 2.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.210
In other words, if 'x' is
greater than 2, you can pick

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.190
another value that's what?

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.270
Between 'x' and 2.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.700
There's a space there.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.240
In other words, what you saying
is that no matter how

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.930
low you get here, as long as
you're not exactly at 2, you

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.820
can find the point
that's lower.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.950
And in the same way as you move
out this way, as you move

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.610
closer and closer to this point,
if you exclude this

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.300
point itself, no matter where
you stop, you could have

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.220
always found the point that
was a little bit higher.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.430
And again, you have
to be where?

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.340
When I say check the endpoints
of a closed interval, it does

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.070
not mean that the endpoints
will give

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.710
you high or low points.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.670
For example, look at the
following curve.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.220
It looks something like this.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.250
It's continuous.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.010
It's defined on the closed
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.710
Notice that at a we do not
get an absolute maximum.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.780
In fact, what?

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.180
All of these points on the curve
are higher than what's

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.480
happening here.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.790
Same thing happens, what?

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.670
All of these points are lower
than what the height is

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.500
corresponding to
'x' equals 'a'.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.250
And in the similar way, this
is what happens at 'b'.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.520
You see, with the endpoints,
obviously since you can't see

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.710
what's happening before, this
will be either the highest

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.180
point or the lowest point near
here depending on how the

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.200
curve is sloped.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.550
But all we're saying is what?

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.630
In terms of absolute high
values and absolute low

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.500
values, meaning the highest
possible points and the lowest

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.620
possible points, we must always
check the endpoints.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.970
But we can't be positive
that the endpoints

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.450
are going to be chosen.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.070
In fact, let's summarize.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.750
And I'm going to summarize
again at

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.540
the end of the lecture.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.830
But the idea is this.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.680
If 'f of x' is continuous on the
closed interval from 'a'

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.800
to 'b'-- and here's
the key word.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.310
To find candidates--

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.280
you know the old cliche
about many are

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.930
called, but few are chosen.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.860
In this case, few are called
and even fewer are chosen.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.630
Namely, what we're saying
is look it.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.580
When we're looking for
high-low points, the

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.700
candidates are what?

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.410
Those points for which
the derivative is 0.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.550
We can check those out because
those are possibilities.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.030
Those points for which the
derivative fails to exist.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.220
We can check those out because
they're possibilities.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.470
And the endpoints.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.030
Namely, if the function
is continuous,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.810
we check the endpoints.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.970
By the way, if the function is
not continuous, then there is

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.780
no need to check-- well,
let's put it this way.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.190
If you're on an open interval
there's no need to check the

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.440
endpoints because there
aren't any.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.260
In other words, notice that
I'm talking about what?

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.190
That the function 'f' is not
only continuous, but on a

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.620
closed interval.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.530
That's all there is to this.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.230
In other words, these are all
the possible candidates.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.920
Now you see the bigger
question is,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.500
how do you use this?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.140
And I thought that I would make
up a makeshift exercise,

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.840
one that's rather easy to
do at the blackboard.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.370
For deeper exercises, for more
quantitative results, we have

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.130
several exercises in the
learning exercises.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.610
Several exercises worked out

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.320
illustratively in the textbook.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.250
But let's pick a particularly
straightforward example.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:24.430
Let's suppose that what I want
to do is construct a cylinder.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.510
This is a cross sectional
view of a cylinder.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.230
'x' represents the radius of
the base and 'y' represents

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.290
the height.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.860
This is a right circular
cylinder.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.240
I'm given a constraint, namely
I'm told that for some reason

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.350
or other, and I don't know why
anybody would ever want to

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.140
impose this condition other
than the fact that we want

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.160
some condition imposed here
to see what's happening.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.270
I'm told that I want the sum of
the radius of the base and

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.040
the altitude to be exactly 30.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.400
In other words, if the radius
of the base is going to be 6

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.440
inches, I want the altitude
to be 24 inches.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.360
That's a constraint.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.090
And by the way, I'll come
back to this later also.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.330
Notice how you're almost
begging a related rates

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.050
relationship here.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.440
Or an implicit relationship
that 'x' and 'y' are not

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.280
independent.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.275
But I've now put a constraint
on here.

00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:17.990
At any rate the question is,
how shall I use up my 30

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.510
inches, say, if I want to make
the volume of the resulting

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.080
cylinder as large as possible?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.450
And notice how we
work this thing.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.640
We say, well, the volume is
equal to 'pi 'x squared' y'.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.410
In this particular case, it's
easy to see explicitly that

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.420
'y' is equal to '30 - x'.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.710
It's also easy to see physically
that 'x' must be

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.620
more than 0.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.120
You can't have a negative
radius of the base.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.180
It must be less than 30 because
if you used up more

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.080
than 30 inches in the radius
of your base, how can the

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.970
radius of the base plus the
altitude add up to exactly 30?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.180
Because physically, the
constraint is that the

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.100
altitude can't be negative.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.270
It's certainly a
positive value.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.340
So our analytic relationship
is what?

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.060
That 'v' equals 'pi 'x squared'
y', which can be

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.770
written as 'pi 'x squared'
times '30 - x''.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.290
Which in turn, can be written
as the polynomial '30 pi 'x

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.750
squared'' minus 'pi 'x cubed'',
where 'x' is the open

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.950
interval or defined on the open
interval from 0 to 30.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.730
Now, how do I proceed?

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.480
What was my test
for membership?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.630
I have three ways of
checking out where

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.380
high-low points will occur.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.190
Or max-min points in this case,
since notice that this

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.750
function does not require a
graph to understand it.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.240
I first check out to see where
the derivative is 0.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.090
Well, the derivative
is simply '60 pi x'

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.210
minus '3 pi 'x squared''.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.250
If I set this thing equal to 0,
I find upon factoring that

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.090
either 'x' must be 0
or 'x' must be 20.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:58.520
I can immediately exclude 'x'
equals 0 because notice that

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.800
my function 'v' had its domain
of definition on the open

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.430
interval from 0 to 30.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.690
'x' equals 0 is not in the open
interval from 0 to 30.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.190
Consequently, we can rule
this thing out.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.390
And what we discover is
that 'x' equals 20.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.980
So 'x' equals 20 is
the only possible

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.410
candidate that we have.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.650
And by the way, since the sum of
'x' and 'y' must be 20, if

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.240
'x' equals 20, 'y' must be 10.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.715
So the only candidate that we
have by setting the derivative

00:25:25.715 --> 00:25:29.330
equal to 0 is that 'x' should
be 20 and 'y' should be 10.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.540
We do not get any candidates
in the sense of where the

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.890
derivative doesn't exist.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.250
Because if you look at '60 pi
x' minus '3 pi 'x squared'',

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.170
this certainly exists for
all values of 'x'.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.410
And finally, we have no
endpoints to check.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.800
Because again, our
function 'v' is

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.310
defined on an open interval.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.170
By the way, if I tried to draw
this somewhat to scale, a very

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.690
interesting result turns up,
which may show the power of

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:03.280
analytical methods versus more
intuitive types of methods.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.220
You see, what we showed
here was what?

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.190
Without going into the details,
that to get the

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:11.760
largest volume cylinder,
'x' should be 20.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.210
In other words, the radius of
your base should be 20 and the

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.750
altitude should be 10.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.240
Let's take a look at that
drawn roughly to scale.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.530
The radius of the base here is
20 and the altitude is 10.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.800
By the way, that means
that the cross

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.160
section will be what?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.430
A rectangle whose height is
10 and whose base is 40.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.670
Now intuitively, I think it's
easy to see that for a

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:39.100
rectangle, for a given perimeter
the largest possible

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.880
area rectangle is the one
which is a square.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.690
Well, without even trying to
prove that, let's go to this

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.150
thing here.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.370
Instead of using up the 20 and
the 10, let's draw a second

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.940
rectangle, or a second cross
section of a cylinder where

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.350
the radius is 15 and
the height is 15.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.860
Notice that this still satisfies
the fact that the

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.520
sum of the radius and
the altitude are 30.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.890
Now, look at this.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.220
If we compute the area of this
particular rectangle, 40 times

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.350
10, it's 400.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.490
On the other hand, the
volume is what?

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.380
Pi times 20 squared.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.830
The radius of the
base squared.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.320
Times the height, which is 10.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.890
And that yields the result
of 4,000 pi.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.540
On the other hand, if we look
at our second rectangle, its

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.890
area is 450.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.240
But its volume is what?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:37.270
It's pi times 15 squared times
15, which is 3,375 pi.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.760
The interesting result
here is what?

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.050
The area of this rectangle
is greater than the

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.280
area of this rectangle.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.430
In fact, the area of the second
rectangle is 450.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.800
The area of the first rectangle
is only 400.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.840
But notice that when you revolve
this thing to form the

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:05.170
cylinder, the smaller cross
sectional area generates the

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.440
larger volume.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.340
And the reason, of course, for
that is that the relationship

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.840
in our variables
was not linear.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.860
In other words notice that
when 'x' is large, a

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.340
relatively small change in
'x' produces a large

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.760
change in 'x squared'.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.490
In other words, a relatively
small value in 'x' can offset

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.740
a relatively large value
or increase in 'y'.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.840
And this is kind of interesting
because try to

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.040
figure out intuitively how you
would figure out where these

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.880
stop compensating
for one another?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.350
Where does it turn out that
finally you've taken so much

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.100
away from 'x' that even though
you square it, it can't

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.940
compensate the change in 'y'?

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.050
How would you intuitively pick
off where the high-low points

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.900
occur in a problem like this?

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.080
And all I want you to see is
again, the beautiful gentle

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.840
balance between intuitive
calculus

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.570
and rigorous calculus.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.460
That we don't throw away
our intuition.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.160
But notice how, in many cases,
where our intuition fails us,

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.190
the analytic recipes
come to our rescue.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.550
But enough said about that, let
me now again, highlight

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.840
the difference or the
relationship between functions

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.850
and graphs.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.660
Namely, in all of this
discussion that we've done on

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.510
this particular board, we're
talking about what?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.330
'v' being a function of 'x'.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.810
We do not have to visualize
this thing pictorially.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:28.140
But if we wish, what we can say
is let's graph 'v' as a

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.560
function of 'x'.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.520
And you see, going back to the
material of last time.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.560
And notice, you see how
interrelated these things are.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.660
Notice how curve plotting
ties in very nicely with

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.740
derivatives and the like.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.120
All we're saying is what?

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.920
Given this relationship, which
is how 'v' is related to 'x',

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.530
we can form the first
derivative, we can form the

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.350
second derivative, we can look
to see where the first

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.880
derivative is 0, we can look
to see where the second

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.960
derivative is 0.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.980
I leave these details to you
because after the homework

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.370
assignment you did last time
these should be fairly trivial

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.970
exercises to do.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.580
But the idea is if you now
utilize all of this

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.300
information, you find that if
you plot 'v' verses 'x', you

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.190
get a graph something
like this.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.330
By the way, again notice that we
were not talking about just

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.410
'v' being a function of 'x'.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.010
The domain of 'v' was restricted
to be the open

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.420
interval from 0 to 30, and this
is a very crucial thing

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.580
to keep in mind.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.120
You can get into a whole bunch
of trouble if you start

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.210
looking to see what
happens out here.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.595
For example, you say, hey, this
curve is always going to

00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:34.240
keep going up.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.210
Won't this be greater than this
maximum value over here

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.040
eventually?

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.600
The answer is yes, it will be.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.600
But what does it mean to say
that 'x' is negative?

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.500
'x' was the radius
of our base.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.070
So in other words,
what we should

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.360
really say here is what?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.930
That the function that we're
talking about is not this

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.930
whole curve.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.470
Yikes, that wasn't a very
good job of drawing.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.560
But rather what?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.370
Just this portion of the curve
defined on the open interval

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.420
from 0 to 30.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.120
By the way, let me point
out something else.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.690
You recall in an earlier
lecture we talked about

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.960
related rates.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.130
We had an assignment with other
lecture where you've

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.420
solved some problems using
related rates.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.690
Let me show you how related
rates play a very important

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:21.300
computational role in dealing
with max-min problems.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.780
In this particular problem, we
had that 'v' equals 'pi 'x

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.240
squared' y', where 'y' happened
to be a particular

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.300
function of 'x'.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.270
In fact, implicitly it was given
by the fact that 'x + y'

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.970
happened to equal 30.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.730
Now let's keep track
of something here.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.220
In this particular problem,
notice that it was very easy

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.550
to change this implicit
relationship

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.180
to an explicit one.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.520
It was also easy once you
expressed 'y' explicitly in

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.120
terms of 'x' that when you
wanted to substitute into

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.950
here, it was a very easy
computational job to carry out

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.080
the operations.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.430
But suppose there happened to be
cube roots in here, or all

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.380
sorts of nasty things, whatever
they might be.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.910
And suppose instead of 'x + y'
equals 30, you had our old

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:08.870
friend something like 'x to the
eighth' plus ''x to the

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.560
sixth' 'y squared'' plus 'y
to the sixth' equals 3.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.530
How would you solve for
'y' explicitly in

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:16.870
terms of 'x' there?

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.970
And the point that I'd like
you to see is that we can

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.570
solve this problem very nicely
without having to resort to

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.460
explicitly replacing 'y'
as a function of 'x'.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.130
Namely, implicitly assuming that
'y' is a differentiable

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.270
function of 'x', we
can differentiate

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.760
this thing as a product.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.320
'dv dx' will be what?

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.280
The derivative of the first
factor, which is '2 pi x',

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.690
times the second.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.970
Plus the first factor, which is
'pi 'x squared', times the

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.730
derivative of 'y' with
respect to 'x'.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.440
So that's 'dv dx'.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.960
On the other hand, from this
relationship here, we can

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.380
conclude by differentiating
implicitly that '1

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.810
+ 'dy dx'' is 0.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:03.550
And therefore, 'dy
dx' is minus 1.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:08.130
And putting that value for 'dy
dx' in here, we wind up with

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.920
this explicit relationship.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.340
And we can now see that 'dv dx'
is 0 if and only if just

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.710
by solving this thing,
setting it equal to

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.870
0, 'x' equals '2y'.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.400
By the way, that's exactly what
happened in our problem.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.340
You'll notice that 'x' turned
out to be 20 and 'y' turned

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.050
out to be 10.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.370
You see again, 'x' and
'y' are related.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.060
You can say, gee, couldn't
'x' be 60 and 'y' be 30?

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.370
Answer, no.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.440
Because the constraint is
that 'x + y' must be 30.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.250
Well, look it.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.820
I don't want us to get too
wrapped up on the idea of

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.330
computational differences now.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:47.320
What I do want to do is review
our basic result.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.660
And in fact, let me
come over here.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.180
I hope this doesn't spoil you.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.750
I'd like to come back
to the board.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.330
And actually, since I've got
this all written down, let's

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.180
close on this particular
result again.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.170
To find the high-low points of
a function 'f of x', we first

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.700
of all, check out when 'f
prime of c' is 0 for

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.350
candidates.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.790
We check out where 'f prime
of c' fails to exist.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:12.460
And if it's a closed interval,
we check the endpoints.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.480
This is the mechanism behind
what we're doing from that

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.370
point on, as the cliche goes,
it's all engineering's baby.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.900
It's all computational
know how.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.460
At any rate, I think this is
enough in terms of emphasizing

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.060
the points that we
wanted to make.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.120
And so until next
time, goodbye.
