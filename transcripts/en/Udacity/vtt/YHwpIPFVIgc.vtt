00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. The first thing I want to know if how much time the ball spends in the air.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's governed entirely by its vertical motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Remember this equation? Let's use that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Though maybe I should write Δy instead of Δx to emphasize this is vertical motion.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I know that Δy, the total distance the ball moves, is just h,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the ball starts at rest, so I can ignore this term.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That just leaves me with this--½gt².

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Remember, instead of a I wrote g, the acceleration of gravity.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That tells me the time the ball spends in the air

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is twice the height of g and the square root of that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When you plug in 1.2 for h and 10 for g you get a value of 0.49 sec.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay, so that's how long the ball spends in the air.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now let's analyze the horizontal component of motion.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's governed entirely by the electric force.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Remember, the electric force is equal to qE,  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which in this case would be 0.1 * 100 or 10 N.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That 10 N force is causing an acceleration.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We know that F = ma, so 10 N is equal to mass the acceleration in the x direction

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I should say, because we're just looking at that component motion for now.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Solving this, I find that this x acceleration is equal to 10 divided by the mass.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
When I plug in 8 kg, I find that's equal to 1.25 m/s².

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, now I can use my good friend--Δx is equal to initial velocity times time,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but there's no initial velocity, so I'll ignore that,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
plus ½a--that's this a--times the time squared.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The time we're going to use is that 0.49 sec we found before.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That gives me distance of 0.15 m.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Actually, if this is was 1.2 m, it only moved about to here. Good work.
