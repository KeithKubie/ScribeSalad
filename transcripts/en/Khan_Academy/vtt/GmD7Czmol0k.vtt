00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:01.583
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can give ourselves

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.252
some practice evaluating expressions

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:06.552
that have two different variables in them

00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:08.270
So let's see if we can
evaluate the expression

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.287
seven J plus five minus eight K,

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:17.287
when J is equal to 0.5
and K is equal to 0.25.

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.461
So why don't you try to pause the video

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.702
and evaluate this first before
we work through it together.

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:26.167
Alright, so if we want
to evaluate this thing,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.232
everywhere we see a J we
want to replace it with a 0.5

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:30.556
and everywhere we see a K

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.646
we want to replace it with a 0.25,

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:33.412
so let's do that.

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:35.873
This is going to be seven times,

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:38.510
and instead of J I'm gonna put a zero,

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:42.091
a 0.5 in there.

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.667
And then we have plus five

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.360
minus eight times K.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.936
And K we're saying is 0.25.

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:55.101
0.25.

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:56.797
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:58.235
So if I were to take,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.234
if I were to take,

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.698
and I can color code this,

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.320
seven times 0.5.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.569
Half of 7, that's going to
be three and a half, 3.5.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.882
Then I have plus five.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.898
And then I'm gonna subtract.

00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:17.333
I am subtracting eight times 0.25.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.678
0.25, this is 1/4.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.257
I could rewrite this if I want.

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:24.160
0.25, that's the same thing as 1/4.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.503
Eight times 1/4, or another
way to think about it is

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:29.825
eight divided by four is
gonna be equal to two.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.518
So this whole thing over here
is going to be equal to two.

00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:35.235
So it's gonna be minus, we
have this minus out here,

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:37.231
so minus two.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:38.555
And what is this going to be?

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.041
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.990
3.5 plus five is 8.5,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.043
minus two is going to be 6.5.

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:48.860
So this is equal to this,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.996
is equal to 6.5.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.755
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:54.804
Alright.

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:55.802
And we'll, just like before,

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:56.871
try to work through it on your own

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.746
before we do it together.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:01.699
Alright, now let's do it together.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:04.370
So over here I have this expression 0.1 M

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.550
plus eight minus 12 N,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.823
when M is equal to 30
and N is equal to 1/4.

00:02:11.823 --> 00:02:12.381
Alright.

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.400
So everywhere I see an M I
want to replace with a 30.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.951
And everywhere I see an N I
want to replace with a 1/4.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.316
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:24.497
0.1 times M.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:25.982
M is 30.

00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:29.478
Times 30 plus

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.709
eight minus 12 times N,

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.678
where N is 1/4.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.028
N is 1/4.

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.095
So what is,

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:41.256
what is

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:42.231
1/10,

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.088
This right over here,
0.1, that's the same thing

00:02:44.088 --> 00:02:45.936
as 1/10 of 30?

00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:49.400
Well 1/10 of 30, that's going to be three.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.932
So this part is three.

00:02:51.932 --> 00:02:53.859
And we have three plus eight.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.785
And then we're gonna have minus.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.478
Well what is 12 times 1/4?

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:02.868
That's gonna be 12/4,
or 12 divided by four,

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:05.143
which is going to be equal to three.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.024
And now when we evaluate this,

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:08.857
so that is equal to this,

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:10.966
we have three plus eight minus three.

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:12.661
Well, threes are going to,

00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:15.029
you know positive three, then
you're gonna subtract three,

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.840
and you're just going to be left with,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.325
you're just going to
be left with an eight.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:20.113
And you're done.

00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:23.434
This expression when M is equal
to 30 and N is equal to 1/4

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:24.985
is equal to eight.
