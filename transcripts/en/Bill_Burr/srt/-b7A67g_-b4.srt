1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,620
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,310
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,320
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:15,550
[inaudible]

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,810
just checking in on you. Just
checking in on you. How are you?

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,020
How's your week going? Oh, don't worry.

8
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:27,250
It's almost over it stars day, right?
Don't you get paid on Thursday?

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:30,820
Back in the day it did. You
get that fucking check, right?

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,390
That'll piece of paper with the numbers
on it. Then you go down to the bank,

11
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,224
you fucking,

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,840
you're right on the back of you stick it
in the machine and then the numbers say

13
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,674
you got this number

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,200
right. Just a bunch of numbers.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,760
That's all it is. It's
all, it comes down to, um,

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,170
I'm actually, I'm in a great mood. I got
a great night's sleep last night. Uh,

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,820
went out and visited some friends of mine
and drove home about 80 miles an hour,

18
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:02,230
85, sometimes 90. Oh, I was
cruising. And even when, you know,

19
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:05,860
they fixed the highways at night,
you know, which totally makes sense.

20
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,140
You can't do it during the day,
but she always get mad at night.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,040
You like j just fucking cry. He
would have to Reggie traffic.

22
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:16,150
They got it unfair to traffic jam.
Right? And you get all fucking bad.

23
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:20,020
Cause if fixing a highway and fuck at
one 30 in the morning when you should be

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,380
in bed, right? When the fuck
else are they going to do it?

25
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,570
That's why I just kept telling
myself as I was getting mad,

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,770
you know I'd be cruising along. This
is fucking great. This is great.

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,280
Look at this. Flying down the fucking
highway. 90 fucking miles an hour.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,680
You should be able to
do this all the time.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,190
24 seven get the population down
with whatever I fucking want.

30
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:46,070
I can jump on the highway. Happy
then five minutes. Oh Wow. Right over

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,813
right.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,470
And then all of a sudden you come over
the hill and you see that Arrow and then

33
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,400
you see the brake lights
and he does go, ah yeah,

34
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,990
fucking assholes.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,880
You know I had AC DC cranking
cause I'm a middle aged,

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,720
not even middle aged. I'm 47 times
two is fucking 94 who's kidding?

37
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:11,580
Who you guys think all red
faces going to make 95 um,

38
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm an old fuck.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,290
I'm an all white guy who likes Facebook
and I'm listening to ACDC and I'm

40
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
rocking out.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,433
Okay.

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,460
My hybrid. Oh yeah. That's what I'm doing.

43
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm doing everything to
wearing those Mervin shoes.

44
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,470
Wear those fucking awful shoes that
people a little bit older than me wear and

45
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,680
they wear them with no
socks and dead jeans.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,030
Those slip on fucking shoes that I think
were cool for like two weeks in like

47
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,570
1993 they Mervin's right? Melvin's

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
okay.

49
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,880
What's a melon? I'm Melvin. Somebody
fucking gives you a Wedgie. MMM.

50
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,250
Okay.

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,070
Who the fuck ever thought to do
that? You realize how funny that is.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,573
Okay.

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,620
I got to say, well,

54
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,500
nobody thought to do it until it was
pants and then once it was pants,

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,610
somebody just like I had God, Damn,

56
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,630
these things are riding up on me and then
it just rode up on the wrong sadistic

57
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,210
guy's ass. And he was like, you know what?

58
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:06,190
What if I did that a lot
quicker to somebody else?

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,640
A lot harder on purpose. Premeditated,

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,170
riding up with the jeans and when he
heard the scream of, of uncomfortableness,

61
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,670
it warmed his heart.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,870
And then some other sadistic fuck
sod or maybe just some fucking, uh,

63
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,900
you know, like joke thief, except
like a fucking bully. Like thief.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,190
One of bullies do that.

65
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,410
Like they see a bully bullying
somebody else and be like, you know,

66
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm going to, you know, I'm
going to do something like that.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,110
I'm do my version of that. Then
the bully calls him out on Twitter,

68
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,180
then there's a big dust up, right.

69
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,610
Then they got to go on a bully
podcast and clear their name.

70
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,893
Okay.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,050
Anyways, um, who knows,

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,080
who knows in this day and age of non
controversies becoming controversies,

73
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:59,190
who knows what could happen.
Um, yeah, I'm in a great mood.

74
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,310
Like I got home one 30 in the
morning, I put on the Celtics.

75
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,410
I still have even watched the
Bruins beaten the Canadians.

76
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,370
I know they beat the Canadians.

77
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm fucking trying to do the
basketball and hockey thing and I'm,

78
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,390
so I'm behind like two games.

79
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,410
The Bruins and I know they got
Vancouver tonight and I just checked the

80
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,780
standings. What the fuck
happened? Or the Canadians?

81
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,960
My Boston Bruin heart was in my fucking
throat when they started off at nine and

82
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,720
Oh my God, oh no, they're going
to end the drought this year.

83
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,050
They're going to end the drought and then
what am I going to say? I got nothing.

84
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:31,884
I already have.

85
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,130
The only thing I can say is how long
it's been since they won their last one.

86
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:38,190
Cause other than that they can go like,
yeah, well we got like 52 of them.

87
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,300
It's like, yeah, but you know, the
first 12, you were beaten like,

88
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:45,780
you know the fucking Montreal Marauders,

89
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,880
the Quebec conquistadores, you
know, you one best fucking, uh,

90
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,700
best five out of nine,

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,410
whatever the fucking series
was when you played on a pond,

92
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,960
do you realize how fucked up it is?

93
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,280
And the Stanley Cup was the
size of a shot glass, you know,

94
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,700
hurry up and finish this game so we can
have world war one. Um, that's really,

95
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,440
I mean, I don't give a fuck
that they count those things.

96
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,540
I just like teasing them about it. Um,

97
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,090
even if just count the ones from the
modern era were never going to catch him.

98
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:19,700
I realized that as a fan. Um, but
wasn't going to say it. The uh,

99
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,730
I still for the life of
me do not understand as we
are now it's super bowl 50.

100
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,550
Why NFL Championships do not count.

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Nobody has ever been able to give
me a logical explanation to that.

102
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,553
All right.

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Is it because the two leaks combined
rather than the NFL absorbed the AFL?

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,550
You know, the way the NBA absorbed,
you know, like four or five ABA teams.

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,920
Is that what it is?
But for the life of me,

106
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,650
it's like those championships were one,

107
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,030
they will wonder in those years like
take like the Eagles Eagles like, oh,

108
00:05:56,031 --> 00:06:00,110
they never want to fucking
know a Superbowl gives a
fuck. I mean, that sucks.

109
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,890
I mean, it's been a long fucking time,
but they did win a championship in 1960.

110
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay. And the way, the way the NFL
acts like that was caveman days.

111
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,260
Like Mickey Mantle was in
the prime of his career.

112
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,660
Baseball still drops to
their knees, you know,

113
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,620
in honor of that guy. Okay.

114
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,890
Forget about fucking Babe Ruth. You know

115
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,530
who fucking,

116
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,920
he's who's fucking Rehab was eating hot
dogs and drinking beer and catching up

117
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,470
to the fucking the team on the train by,

118
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,320
by jumping in a biplane.

119
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,290
If he wasn't too fucking fat
with weight and balance, right.

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,860
They could find a scarf long enough to
wrap around his giant fucking elephant

121
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,700
neck. Right. Why don't they count us

122
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,940
that mood? Jim Brown's title
doesn't count. What was it,

123
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:56,140
64 65 the last time the
browns wanted slash. Ravens.

124
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,420
Um, I dunno. I didn't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

125
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,410
I thought it was in a good mood.
Marty going conti. Anyways. Yeah.

126
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,180
I don't know what happened. The
Canadians, like as of today,

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,240
they at one point they are know the
season ended today they wouldn't make the

128
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:10,030
playoffs. So I'm going to go out on
a limb and say that Canadians team,

129
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,650
I'll tell you those, those Montreal
Canadians, they're very streaky.

130
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,400
Yeah.

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll tell you right now, if
they're not looking unbeatable,

132
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,760
they are looking a unwinnable
I, whatever the fuck you'd say.

133
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,110
Anyways, let me plow ahead here. So, um,

134
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,380
I got to watch that game
at some point, but I'm, uh,

135
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,860
I'm getting ready to do the,
uh, the Patrice O'Neal benefit,

136
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,640
the wonderful Patrice O'Neil, the
best comic I ever fucking saw.

137
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,830
Um, you know, from my generation,
it's just, it, it's just a fact.

138
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:46,160
He's the best and a wonderful
positive night of, uh,

139
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,190
of hilarity supporting,
uh, the people that, uh,

140
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,630
Patrice was taking care of all his is
his loved ones. Uh, that is Tuesday.

141
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,330
And uh, from what I
hear, it's all sold out,

142
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,290
but we will be releasing it the
last second, uh, a few tickets,

143
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,580
um, here or there, which I guess is
what they do at all conscious people.

144
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,730
We say that going like, you know,
oh I wanted to see fucking whatever,

145
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,070
whatever band, you know,

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,660
and a dude you just like an hour before
you just walk up and they release

147
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,494
tickets.

148
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,270
That's like a some sick fucking level
of being able to get tickets, you know,

149
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,041
cause I'd be the asshole.

150
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:25,160
I just got a fucking stubhub speaking
of which I wanted to go see Bob Newhart.

151
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,390
Bob Newhart is doing a show out in
the desert at some casino. Right.

152
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,890
When I say on the desert, I mean
the 10 east to like lucky, right.

153
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,910
He's out there cause a, you
know that's a, that's a,

154
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,210
I think that's his generation.
That's where they fucking,

155
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,050
that's where they retired.
You know that place was like,

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,500
that place was like a
what Brooklyn is now. Oh,

157
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,380
like silver lake out here. Like
where all the hipsters are.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,740
That's what that was to his generation,
I think way back in the day.

159
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,480
And those stayed out there and they
were retired. So I fucking go on.

160
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,890
I go on the inner web, there is
Richard Rolling says on gas monkey.

161
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,560
I go on the inner web and he
and I, I try to get tickets,

162
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,140
sold the fuck out.

163
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,990
I was so upset that I couldn't get a
fucking ticket. But on the other level,

164
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:13,231
I'm like,

165
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:16,950
this guy is 83 years old and he's still
selling out the big room in a casino,

166
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,730
you know, fucking
awesome that is credible.

167
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,450
You now ridiculous is that he's worked
clean his whole career and I'm sitting

168
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,660
here cursing up a storm,
giving them compliments. I'm
going to figure out a way,

169
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm going to get to that show.
It's all not January 29th.

170
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm going to figure out a way to get
in there. I don't know what I gotta do.

171
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:33,691
You know,

172
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,180
maybe I'll fucking drive all the way
out to the desert and I'll stand around,

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
you know, hoping that maybe a
couple audience members died.

174
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,280
The tickets got freed up.

175
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,430
Um, I'll come on bill,
let's, let's, let's,

176
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,960
let's not take it to a negative place.

177
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,850
Disclose to the AFC and NFC championship
games. How could you do that?

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,160
You know, speaking it dying. By
the way, speaking of death, um,

179
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,930
you know, I went on the Internet
today and I was looking up, uh,

180
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,240
a with a fuck. Is it? Oh, here it
is. Here it is installed later.

181
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,380
Get out a beat. It trying
an hour try tonight.

182
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,340
Jesus hugging me more fucking
needy. All right. Where is it?

183
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,360
New York City.

184
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,233
Yeah.

185
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,570
Discuss is world's largest tax funded
mass grave might be turned into a park and

186
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:28,840
I lived in New York. What bad debt?

187
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,830
Start spreading the news.

188
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,830
I'm wearing sweat pants.

189
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm gonna go down to Tad stakes Eddie
some shit and I'll feel like I'm making it

190
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,260
the air, you know, successful New Yorkers
thing just cause they're in Manhattan.

191
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,800
You know what I mean? Everybody looks
at themselves like they're the star,

192
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,460
you know? No one sees themselves as
background, you know what I mean?

193
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,940
You're the ones waving up at the
Beatles. You're not in the Beatles.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,940
You understand? You're the one
in the crowd screaming, you know,

195
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,140
fainting and security takes you out as
you're looking at somebody successful.

196
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,680
Right. That's who you are. Yeah.

197
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:15,370
Those people already on the subway as
they try to jam another person in there

198
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:19,210
and the world needs you.
The world needs you. Okay.

199
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,560
If I can go to white castle and
a boat Odo 18 or those burgers,

200
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:31,060
I'll be a fat tated
fuck in the upper deck.

201
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm sorry. All right. World's
largest tax funded mass graves.

202
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,250
So there's an island out there,
which I had no idea. Uh, I mean,

203
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:42,850
I knew of Ellis Island and then as the
island at the Statue of Liberty is on,

204
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,460
then I knew there was one that
the navy owned or some shit,

205
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,790
but there's this other
island out there that, um,

206
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,870
they just bury people that don't have
any money or nobody knows who the fuck

207
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:56,800
they, it's called Hart Island. Or
is it towards some Boston would say,

208
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,570
fucking had island.

209
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,980
Let's go out to Highland Joe, and
maybe we can find a fucking goal.

210
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,990
Got In trouble with the bookie.
Um, Hart Island, New York,

211
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,950
Rosalie Grable looks down
over rows of white pipes,

212
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,220
some broken or covered in
mud, sticking out of the dirt.

213
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,810
Each tube marks the
grave of 150 adults, uh,

214
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,380
dash homeless poor veterans and
unclaimed individuals who couldn't afford

215
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:28,381
anything but a spot in what's widely to
believe to be the world's largest tax

216
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,900
funded mass grave, you know,

217
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,200
tax funded mass grave, not
mass grave. Cause believe me,

218
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,170
I think the isn't there
one underneath the,

219
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,263
okay,

220
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,490
isn't there one underneath like
Wall Street, these mass security,

221
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:48,400
a bunch of native Americans as some shit
and then they just bury them all isn't

222
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,720
what they used to do back then.
All right, that takes care of that.

223
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,820
Who wants to build a log
cabin? Right? Lunatics. Um,

224
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,930
so whatever Grable, a 64 year
old resident of the upper,

225
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,140
upper west side wants grass and wild
flowers to hide the dirty white plastic.

226
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,590
She's come here to honor her mother who
died in a hospital bed with no savings

227
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,330
to leave to her daughter. She said,

228
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm still getting used to the idea that
my mommy wound still calls her mommy.

229
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,660
That's creepy. A wound up
in a potter's grave. I know.

230
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:24,120
That's my mother. I know that my mother
was expecting something more true,

231
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,100
much more traditional. I don't
understand people who like when they die,

232
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:31,910
they want to have one of those
above ground fucking like tombs.

233
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,530
You know like the above.

234
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,750
It's like the above ground swimming
pool of grave sites. You know?

235
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,600
It's like how fucking special do you
think you are? Cause it you're dead.

236
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,730
They should just have mass graves.
They should have a giant pit.

237
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,683
You just fucking,

238
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
you know the family doesn't need to see
it but yet his fucking throat in there

239
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,810
though. It in there and
then you, your dissolve,

240
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,630
you become the next fossil fuel. Right?

241
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,180
Think about all the fucking people
that have lived in the world.

242
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:02,200
If we had in one giant fucking massive
grave and each country and you use

243
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,460
whatever fucking whenever you,

244
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,940
I don't know how the fuck he end up
turning into motor oil whenever Deli.

245
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:07,930
That's what happens.

246
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,620
I know if you jump off a building you
explode like a water balloon because

247
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:15,760
you're mostly water and a, I don't
know if you eat a lot of Italian food,

248
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,730
you know like I do. You got a lot
of olive oil in you. Who knows,

249
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,380
maybe you even help out somebody
who's fucking lawnmower in the future.

250
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,980
That's what they should do. Holy Shit.
That I just solve global warming.

251
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,830
Or maybe I solved the Middle East crisis

252
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,810
and if elected,

253
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,290
I will begin burying all dead
Americans in the same hall.

254
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,523
All

255
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,360
in a hundred years from now, we
will use the fossil fuel that,

256
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:45,550
that is created to free ourselves
from the Saudi Arabians.

257
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,830
Okay.

258
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,370
I am so sick of seeing world leaders go
to the UN and act like we have a friend

259
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,300
of some sort of a friendship.
Um, I dunno if there's,

260
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,020
that's something you
could do. But anyways,

261
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:02,050
I became fascinated with that
expression. I was saying, right.

262
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:06,130
Potter's grave. So I looked
it up and of course, you know,

263
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:10,120
my research on the Internet in the
Internet never goes past Wikipedia.

264
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,250
Never goes past it, you know?

265
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,030
Okay.

266
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,431
Uh, all right.

267
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:19,431
A Potter's Field Comma poppers field or
a common grave is a term for a place for

268
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:25,821
the burial of unknown or indigent
people or is that indigent?

269
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,130
All right. So I clicked on
indigent or ended. I don't,

270
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,160
isn't it astounding how fucking dumb.

271
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,610
I only mostly astounding about how stupid
I am is the fact that you guys fucking

272
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,803
listen to this.

273
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,450
I actually thought it was halfway smart
until I started reading out loud here.

274
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,860
I, N D I, g e n, t indigent.

275
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,570
Indigent. You say tomato. I say indigent.

276
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,130
What? And digit indigent. I'm
just going to stop saying,

277
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:01,280
I just, I'm just, I feel like every
time I say it, I'm like, fucking,

278
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm like that guy. I played blackjack.
Want to hit me, hit me, hit me over.

279
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,810
Over. Your fucking IQ is just going
down. All right, so I looked up a,

280
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,860
that word that I'm not
gonna say anymore. Oh God.

281
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,950
Is it possible to get embarrassed on
a podcast that only you are doing,

282
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,210
you know? Yep. It's possible. I'm
doing it. All right. Park and I,

283
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,280
and when the ends up coming up is poverty.

284
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,530
Poverty is a general scarcity dearth
or the slate of one's money. Well,

285
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:33,030
what the F, how did this come
to a FTE industrial revolution?

286
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:36,900
Mass production in factories made product
production goods increasingly less

287
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:39,210
expensive and more accessible of.

288
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:43,140
More important is the
modernization of the agriculture.

289
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,910
Said fertilize it dented at debit, but
the poverty reduction is a major goal.

290
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,740
Oh, give me a fee. Is it really,

291
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,520
is it really a major goal when the
fucking CEO takes 80% of the profits?

292
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,183
Huh?

293
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,010
One of the guys who's
fucking working the line,

294
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:03,790
his daughter's already hooking his
up in the CEO's office, blowing them,

295
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,730
you know, cause she can't go to fucking
call her. Then the circle is complete.

296
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,820
Oh, that was a little poetry there.
All right. The u s expression,

297
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,490
let me get back to the Potter's
field. The u s expression,

298
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,830
Potter's field derives from
the Bible. Oh, GJ page.

299
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,000
Referring to a field used for
the extraction of Potter's clay.

300
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,470
Such land used for agriculture
could be used as a burial site.

301
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,370
So after they dug out all the clay,
they just threw people in there. Well,

302
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,200
there you go. That's a good use of space.

303
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,873
Okay.

304
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,540
All right. The term comes to all,
let's, let's read some Bible. Oh my God.

305
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,270
I know. I've done this. Read some
Bible Brits read from the Bible.

306
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:47,950
The term comes from Matthew
27 Semi-colon oh colon,

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,100
three dash two seven colon,

308
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
eight in the new testament of the Bible
in which Jewish priests take it's 30

309
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:02,050
pieces of silver returned
by remorseful Judas Colon.

310
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,190
Oh Jesus. It'd be some antisemitic shit.
Okay. And then so it says then Judas,

311
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,580
who portrayed him? I
think that's Jay Star.

312
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,770
He betrayed Jay star. They're seeing
that he was condemned, repenting himself,

313
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:19,771
brought back the 30 pieces of silvers
to the chief priests and ancient saying,

314
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,920
I have sent in betraying
innocent blood. But they said,

315
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,300
what does that to us? Look
out to it. Yeah, there you go.

316
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,660
There's the antisemitism right
there. Hey, what do we give a shit?

317
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:34,840
Just give us the silver
pieces there. Rod Judy.

318
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,520
Okay.

319
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,950
And casting down the pieces
of silver in the temple,

320
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:44,240
he departed and went and
hanged himself with a halter.

321
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,260
Definitely a halter top.
They had those backs there,

322
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,670
but he hung himself with a
little fucking sports bra. Uh,

323
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,710
but the chief priests having taking the
pieces of silver said it's not lawful to

324
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,980
put them into the core. Bona

325
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,050
didn't Chrysler used to make those,

326
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,540
the Chrysler core Bono with orientee
and later the term Mike box.

327
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,760
What the f I'm Mike Box.

328
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Isn't that a bug also arms box or poor
box refers to a box that is used to save

329
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,410
coin or a piggy bank is what you
should say to save coins for charitable

330
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:22,160
purposes or for charitable purposes.
Oh, so then, okay, I get it.

331
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,390
So then they say, wait a minute,

332
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,500
this guy killed the king of the Jews and
was sitting here with the fucking loot

333
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,334
from the caper.

334
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,410
We'll go stick it in the fucking
donation box and nobody says a word.

335
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,360
You got me. All right. And then they,
after that they had consulted to get,

336
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,250
you know what? This might be a
new section. You want me to guys,

337
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,540
I'll start reading the fucking Bible and
I'll give you my interpretation of it.

338
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,530
Gradually I'll start my own church, right.

339
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,090
And I'll say that I have a direct
link to he that is the one if,

340
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,050
and then gradually I'll slide my
direct link over into just saying,

341
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:00,110
hey am maybe I'm that guy. I am that guy.

342
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:04,580
I am him a blow me. I'm
fucking all the women here.

343
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,640
A you guys get out in the field
and grow some more apples.

344
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,320
It's basically fast forwarding through
running a cult. Oh does the FBI here,

345
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,910
everybody drank this

346
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,810
over the lips and over the gums. Suck
it down. Here they come. All right,

347
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:23,900
throw the site. Refer to these
verses known as the bookbub up above.

348
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,333
Okay.

349
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,840
That's really interesting and fucking
said there is something sad about that.

350
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:30,674
Right?

351
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,750
Is anybody ever had like a fucking
marquis on their head site? You know,

352
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,570
like a big gravestone
and then just have like,

353
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,010
you know like the Chicago theater
but like to scale to a headstone

354
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,190
performing for Aternity

355
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,520
or some hacky fucking former
show business a Christ.

356
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,510
Now I gotta look this shit up. Now
I've gotta look this shit up. Yeah,

357
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,420
those people who have wacky
headstone saying, here we go.

358
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:03,310
Funny headstones.

359
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:04,930
Okay.

360
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,470
All right, here we go. What do
we got here? What do we got here?

361
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,200
Images for funny headstones.
No. What are the odds?

362
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,850
Any of these are going
to be funny. All right,

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,430
Charlie. All these are just
funny. Named Charlie loser.

364
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,450
Born in 1887 and John Loser.

365
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,020
Jesus Christ is such losers. They're
buried in the same fucking place.

366
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,450
Joke's over. Let me out now.

367
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,953
[inaudible]

368
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,840
oh, Leslie Nielsen. He's got a joke
on his, what does it say? Let her rip.

369
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,380
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Well, these are just funny names.

370
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,820
Stiff Tipman boogers spanks.

371
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,220
Who put this up here? Fucking Beavis
and buffet. Butthead ones by, I mean,

372
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,560
funny sangs. Jesus Christ, the Internet.

373
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,540
Funny sayings. Headstones. There we go.

374
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,550
Oh my God. This is a riot. Oh. Epitaphs.
Here we go. 15 are the funniest.

375
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,420
[inaudible]. All right. Somebody
has.dot, dot. Well, this sucks.

376
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,810
That's not bad. Billy
Wilder. I'm a writer,

377
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,720
but then nobody's perfect. Jesus.

378
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,720
Oh Jesus. It's such an NPR joke.

379
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,340
Uh, Jack Lemmon in, oh,
it's like a movie headstone.

380
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,830
Jack Lemmon was one hell of an
actor. And a funny one to boot.

381
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,930
Here's his Harry stars in his
final row. Well in the ground. Uh,

382
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,710
that's a good one. Uh, this one
gets to the point. Well this sucks.

383
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,203
Okay.

384
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,730
It was another one. All right.
This one. This ain't bad.

385
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,160
Once you get used to it, that's not bad.

386
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,160
I was supposed to live to be 102
and be shot by a jealous husband.

387
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,040
Okay.

388
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,710
Near this spot. You know something to
actually, if they are all interesting,

389
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:04,050
I think people would go to fucking
graveyards more rather than,

390
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,910
than getting creeped out by it. Um,
near this spot. Samuel Whitmore,

391
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:12,960
then 80 years old killed three
British soldiers. He was shot.

392
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,140
He was shot. Bayonetted
beaten and left for dead,

393
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:18,660
but recovered and live
to be 90 years of age.

394
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,990
This guy's talking shit here. I lie,

395
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:26,040
but don't you cry for one day to
you will die. Ah, what? I can't

396
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,970
Lindsey Nielsen let her rip Merv Griffin.

397
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,490
I will not be right
back after this message.

398
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,340
That's a winner right there.

399
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,680
I like that somebody wrote
high, get it. Such a comedian.

400
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,770
You can't make anybody happy. On
the Internet. All right, Bill Kugel.

401
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:48,170
He voted for Republicans and
had little to do with them.

402
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,470
If that was bad.

403
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,390
Here's one. Said I told you I
was sick. That's, that's funny.

404
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:57,830
Okay.

405
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,850
The other one, I knew this would
happen. Some of these are pretty good.

406
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,220
Rodney Dangerfield. There goes the
neighborhood here lies something,

407
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:12,170
something hanging by mistake in
1882 he was right. We was wrong,

408
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,940
but we stand him up and
now he's gone. Oh Dude,

409
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,050
you can't go with poetry.

410
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,790
I guess that's it. Well there you go guys.

411
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,220
That's about as good as it gets and
either, you know you can do better.

412
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,813
Okay,

413
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,700
well she just said, what the fuck are
you looking at? I don't know. Let's,

414
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,190
let's read the advertising. Shall We?
Lot of death. A lot of debt this week.

415
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:39,630
A lot of death on the
podcast. Um, all right. Ah,

416
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,620
here we go. The reeds for this
week club. Debbie, you club Daddy.

417
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:47,130
My daddy went to Yale. Uh, we've
been, we've all been there.

418
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,610
You come home after a long
exhausting, exhausting day, right?

419
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:54,030
You want to get shit faced and all
you want is to sip. You want to sit,

420
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,070
you want to sip a glass of wine and relax.

421
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,650
So you can lie to yourself that you're
not an alcoholic because you're drinking

422
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,480
wine. But unless you planned ahead,

423
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:02,610
you probably don't have
a bottle in your house.

424
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,230
You've already spent enough time wandering
around the grocery store. You know,

425
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,210
don't get lost in the wine aisle.

426
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,240
You just end up picking out
a bottle based on the label.

427
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,470
You don't really understand
it. You get home, you open it,

428
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,590
you realize you don't like Chardonnay
as much as you thought you didn't.

429
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,570
You're holy, big stinks, right?

430
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,470
Please include all of the
following points I'm going to,

431
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:28,640
you wrote it well with club, with
club Debbie. Daddy, can you get me to,

432
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,260
you have to swear to God. I'll study

Yeah, Christ. Um, don't
worry. Don't worry. I'm,

520
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:55,190
I'm still working on the garage and uh,

521

out how to make this fucking work. Okay.

522
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,970
It's becoming, once again, everything
in this house is, is a mother fucker.

523
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,090
And when I finally learned to do
is I'm not fighting the house,

524
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,630
I'm not fighting the house anymore.
I will adapt to it. All right.

525
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,700
Everything has to be some sort of a
geometric shape that doesn't exist yet.

526
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,650
That has no definition than God. Dammit.

527
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,440
That will be the shape of
the fucking room. All right.

528
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:21,950
Is there anything else I wanted
to talk about? Um, oh man,

529
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:26,720
this lady fucking cut me off when I was
driving and just the fucking thoughts I

530
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,720
had and everyone that you have be
like, I can't do that and go to jail.

531
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,630
I can't do that. I put
her eye up. You know,

532
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,320
I was thinking about pulling up next to
if I had a paint gun and her sticking

533
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,720
the, when her face out the window
to give me the finger like,

534
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,380
like they all do and just fucking
blast and are right in the face.

535
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:44,180
And I immediately, I was
thinking about her eyes.

536
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,920
So that's where the paint ball went
and put her eye out. And I got,

537
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,370
I don't Dunno, back the fantasy
up. Okay. Take it down a notch.

538
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Right in the middle of her forehead.

539
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,830
Hit her right in the forehead and watched
the botox shoot out on either side.

540
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,211
Nah, but then you know,

541
00:31:56,211 --> 00:31:59,030
people behind me would take down my
plate and I just was sitting at the red

542
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:03,740
light behind her. All of these
fantasies of the shit I wanted to do.

543
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,461
Follow her,

544
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:09,320
find out where she fucking works slash
all of her tires and then take the knife,

545
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,880
stick it right into the head, rest
of her driver's side seat, you know,

546
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,190
with something fucking
written in newspaper writing.

547
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:18,590
So you know when you take the
fucking letters from the newspapers,

548
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:20,680
so it looks totally even
more creepy. And I was like,

549
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,970
well why would you do that? There's
going to be cameras in the parking lot.

550
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:27,050
You can't do that. And then the light
turned green and she made a right.

551
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,800
And I kept going straight and I just
never thought about her again until right

552
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:34,820
now. And with that,

553
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,530
that is the, uh, you guys
have any yummy hears some, uh,

554
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,460
once you write in the murderer
is fantasies that you have
when somebody cuts you

555
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,600
off and fucking traffic,

556
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:49,520
all this shit that you think about doing
but you don't do because that's the

557
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,280
difference between you and a
psycho. All you do is think it,

558
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,750
but you don't fuck it. You don't
carry it out, you know all,

559
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:59,560
at least I hope you do or else I probably
just got put on some sort of watch

560
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,660
list, you know? No, it gives a fuck.

561
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,920
I'd love to be put on a watch list
and I would love to be watching them.

562
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,520
Watch me and see how long they could
watch me before they fucking nodded off.

563
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,350
See watching another hockey game. Oh my
God, this is the worst assignment ever.

564
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,340
Jesus Christ. Um, all right,
that's the Thursday afternoon.

565
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,500
Just before Monday for, uh, just for
Friday, Monday morning podcast. Uh,

566
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,180
have a great weekend. You
can, uh, let's go patriots.

567
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,030
I think this is going to be as always,
it's going to be a very tough game.

568
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,130
Going to be a very tough
game. Oh, by the way,

569
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:35,780
I finally watched the a
Carolina Seattle game and um,

570
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,660
this is what I have to say. You know, I,

571
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:41,000
I find it amazing that
the Carolina Panthers,

572
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,650
when they had two weeks before that game
even came, right, they had a week off,

573
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:50,651
so they had two weeks and millions of
dollars at their disposal to get that

574
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,350
field into a better,

575
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,920
like into much better shape
for that great Seattle defense.

576
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:02,240
It's amazing how they just for some
reason couldn't get that together.

577
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,760
Now it's not illegal.

578
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,630
All you really have to do is just have
a feel and paint some lines and put some

579
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:13,100
numbers on it. You're not required
to have it in the greatest shape,

580
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,920
but that was just one of those
things as a patriots fan,

581
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,660
you just look at and go, isn't that funny?

582
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,110
I wonder what would happen if we
were to do something like that,

583
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:24,980
even though it's not illegal.
That'd be a nice fucking five days.

584
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,840
Other patriots up to
it. Again. Um, anyway,

585
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:34,100
so we're going into a Denver, we're
going into Denver. It should be a,

586
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,930
a tough game. And, um,

587
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,590
I have a melancholy feeling about
this. Like this might be the last, uh,

588
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,530
Brady Peyton manning matchup, you know,

589
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,790
and if Peyton Manning's retires after
this year, and then there's just one,

590
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,340
right, Tom, terrific. And
then some day he'll be gone.

591
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,790
It'll be retired. And it's just,

592
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,100
it's going to be like
Jesus fucking Christ.

593
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,150
I remember when they came in the front
and when those guys came in the league,

594
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,910
I was already in my thirties,
wasn't I? When Peyton come in 97,

595
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,920
I turned 30 and 98. So 30. Yeah, 29,

596
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,490
30 years old on fucking believable.
And they're considered old.

597
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,020
I'll be in my fifties. When Tom Brady
retires. God willing, God fucking well,

598
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,850
God willing. He plays
that long and God willing,

599
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,750
I fucking make it that I am making into
my fifties and don't end up in a fucking

600
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,690
potter's grave. You know,
I wouldn't give a shit.

601
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,540
I think that's the most arrogant fucking
thing you could possibly do is, um,

602
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,580
give a fuck. I get dead bodies
presented for the rest of fucking time.

603
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,120
That's just the fucking needs.
Just like dude, just Frisbee,

604
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,120
Frisbee my body off the back
of a pickup truck down a cliff.

605
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:52,620
I don't give a shit. Um, oh by the way,

606
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,480
with that just reminds me of something.
The fuck was I going to say? Christ.

607
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:02,100
It left me. It left me like
all thoughts do. Um, all right,

608
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:05,230
so that's the podcast. Have a
great weekend. Your con, uh,

609
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,210
should be a great game out in Denver.
I love their defense. Um, of course.

610
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,150
I don't think it's going
to be an easy game and uh,

611
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,260
I am surprised that we have favorites
because we have historically not done well

612
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:19,110
out in Denver and it always
fucking snows. All right,

613
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,390
I'll talk to you a 20 cons on Monday.

614
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,460
Oh No. Why

615
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,420
Shit about the fucking guy who's

616
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,360
got that? You know, he went
over to, he went over to Uganda,

617
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,430
that Guy Kony Kony 2012. You see that?

618
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,620
You see how quickly they
brought that guy down.

619
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,140
This guy shines the light on the
a, on himself first and foremost.

620
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:17,790
And how he and his child are dealing
with it, which is really bizarre.

621
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,440
I mean, I don't know about you guys,

622
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:23,640
but it was enough for me to see the
boy soldier crying because he saw his

623
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,930
brother have his neck sliced
right in front of them,

624
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,020
you know? And he goes from that to be a,

625
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,820
now I'm going to sit my son down and
tell them about the, it's like, Whoa,

626
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,220
I didn't even get it. All right.

627
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,371
So anyways,

628
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:44,460
this guy shines a light on this bullshit
that's going on over there and all of a

629
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:46,160
sudden everybody's in an uproar. Obvious.

630
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:50,850
And everybody gives a fuck about Uganda
and these boys soldiers, you know?

631
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,640
Then all of a sudden the United
States government is going, dude,

632
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:56,280
we're fighting to boards. We can't
even afford to fight one now.

633
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,590
This guy's bringing this shit up. Gee,

634
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:02,820
wouldn't it be nice if something fucking
happened that would discredit him?

635
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:05,660
Next thing you know, a
couple of days later, a,

636
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,890
this guy connected with the film for debt.

637
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,920
Kony 2012 gets caught
jerking off in public.

638
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,810
Was that the only guy who found that
unbelievably fucking convenient.

639
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,520
I didn't buy it for a second. In fact,
I tweeted, you know, back in the day,

640
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:24,000
they used to assassinate you. Now they
just do this. You know what I mean?

641
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,330
If they can make it look like
we landed on the moon in 1969,

642
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:30,840
you don't think that they can make you
anybody they want make it look like

643
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,870
you're rubbing one out in the
fucking parking lot. I don't buy it.

644
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,570
What that fucking Douche bag was doing,
not douchebag that fucking self-serving.

645
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,660
Cont there we go. That's
what I was trying to say.

646
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,890
What he was doing with that film was
he was putting pressure on the United

647
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,890
States to go over there and fucking
somehow insert themselves into that

648
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,680
situation, which would have
cost a ton of fucking money,

649
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,733
you know?

650
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,760
But there's no way to be like,
hey, fuck those boys soldiers,

651
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,350
you know, because of,
of, uh, the way the cu,

652
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,980
because of what it says in our pamphlet,
you know, give a shit or you're weak.

653
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:11,120
Give us your pour and we'll exploit
the shit out of them. And, uh,

654
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,070
let them die of tuberculosis in a
damp apartment. And then years later,

655
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:18,590
whoever made the most amount of
money gets a statue made out of them.

656
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,610
That's all in our thing.

657
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,940
So we can't look the other way
with these fucking boy soldiers.

658
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:27,650
So what's easiest thing to do? Just just
make that guy look like a freak show.

659
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,060
First of all, who hasn't jerked
off in a parking lot? Honestly?

660
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,700
You know who hasn't done
that? You know, your,

661
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,600
you fucking girl goes in to exchange
something. You sit in there, you bored,

662
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:44,710
you can't get any radio reception
because you know, it's back in the day.

663
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,150
You just say, ah, I'm bored. Right?

664
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,380
You've got a girl in
your life. So you know,

665
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:54,180
there's gonna be some sort of Napkins
in the car. What are you gonna Dope,

666
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,520
right? You got the captain's
chairs. No one could see you.

667
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,310
Yeah.

668
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:04,050
Oh, this is taking forever. Eh, what am
I rub one out right yet that Dah, Dah,

669
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,630
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah
Webinar. Everybody's got a
fucking camera. You know?

670
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,090
You know,

671
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,220
what's amazing is that everybody hasn't
got caught jerking off in public at this

672
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,620
point. Everybody's got a camera
in their raw, their cell phone.

673
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,150
When I'm trying to say people is I
don't buy it and it doesn't matter.

674
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:23,151
I don't give a fuck whether the guy from
Coney was jerking off in a parking lot

675
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:27,750
or not. That doesn't change whether
or not this boy soldiers in Uganda.

676
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,460
But what's great is,

677
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:34,461
is then the conversation switches from
what's going on over there to low let's

678
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:39,270
this guy doing easy rubbing
his dick like we all do.

679
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,750
And then everybody would be like, yeah,

680
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:47,580
but we don't do it in public as to what
that makes you better doesn't make you

681
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:51,060
better. It just makes you
more considerate, doesn't it?

682
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:52,831
I mean,

683
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:56,340
if he had two people and they were both
shooting heroin and one person had the

684
00:40:56,341 --> 00:41:01,080
decency to do it in their house and
the other person does it out in public,

685
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,690
at the end of the day,
you're both drug addicts.

686
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,290
So if you really gonna sit there and
shit on this guy for jerking off,

687
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,020
then you would have to
basically be not jerking off

688
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,970
at all. Right?

689
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,470
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm
asking you to look into your hearts.

690
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,260
If you have not rubbed one out,

691
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,520
let he who is not rubbed worn
out in some sort of pop. No,

692
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,890
you'd never jerked off at work.
God, I'm fucking bored. Excuse me,

693
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,080
let me go to the bathroom. Maybe they
think I'm taking a shit standing up,

694
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,360
right? Come on.

695
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,500
If you're a guy in your arms along enough,

696
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,980
at some point you've jerked off in
someplace where you shouldn't have.

697
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,750
You jerked off to somebody you
shouldn't have. You've done it.

698
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,020
We've all been there. Who gives a fuck?

699
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:01,460
There's still boys fighting and
wars over this. So you know,

700
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,640
if you want to help out, help
out. If you don't, don't,

701
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:07,190
but don't let some guy rub
one out in a parking lot.

702
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,020
Change your mind either way.

703
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,850
You know what they're doing right now
that doing what women do when they argue

704
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,460
when they start to lose is they bring
up other shit and they spin it into a

705
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:22,370
different room and next thing you know,

706
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,870
you're arguing a whole different argument
and argument that they wanted you to

707
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:30,470
fucking argue so they knew that they
could win rather than keeping the argument

708
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,200
on fucking track of
saying, listen sweetheart,

709
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,370
I don't like the way you fucking
been dressing lately. Okay?

710
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,450
I got in this relationship to treat
you like a piece of fucking meat.

711
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,810
All right, and lately
you've been slacking off.

712
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,110
People are still boy soldiers and Uganda.

713
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,420
Whether or not that guys rubbing one
out are open in his ass for the world to

714
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:54,860
see. Don't ever forget that.

715
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:58,580
Don't lose sight of
what the real story is.

716
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,013
Okay?

717
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,410
That is all good night and
God bless the United States.

718
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,703
[inaudible]

719
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,230
all right. All right.
Chicken Vice. Hey Bill,

720
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm 25 and I've been listening to your
podcast for a year now and I really enjoy

721
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,060
it. I want to get your advice
on my current situation. Yup.

722
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,930
I could have assumed all of
that. Um, because I'm arrogant.

723
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,040
And why else would you write in? Okay.
After a lot of failed relationships,

724
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,220
I wanted to try a new
approach of meeting women.

725
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,210
I met a 21 year old girl through my
sister in law and figured she was

726
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:10,530
interesting and pretty enough to
consider for a serious girlfriend.

727
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:15,420
We started hanging out as friends so I
could be sure that I was in fact able to

728
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:18,750
be friends with her before I made
a move to something more seriously.

729
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,070
More serious, sorry.

730
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,550
Things have been going well for the last
two months and we get together a couple

731
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:26,070
times a week to hang
out and do stuff. Wow.

732
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,960
[inaudible] last week I finally decided
that I wanted to make my move on her.

733
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,600
I was saying goodbye to
her up to hanging out,

734
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,230
and I finally moved in for
a kiss and she backed away.

735
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,350
Yeah.

736
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,250
It got really awkward after
that and she kind of said, oh,

737
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,420
I have to go.

738
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,910
About 10 minutes later I got a text
from her saying, sorry for backing away,

739
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,810
but I don't want to
ruin our friendship. Ah,

740
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,960
AH, dude, you fucking waited
too long car. I would go,

741
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,290
go watch that Chris Rock special where
he still does the friend zone. Um,

742
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,270
anyways, he says, what
the hell do I do now?

743
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,800
She has always been very flirty with me
the entire time we've been hanging out.

744
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,350
Oh wait, she's been flirting
with you now. Fuck her.

745
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,760
She works at an all girls camp during
the summer and she always hangs out with

746
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:22,560
me on her days off. So I know there isn't
anyone else she is seeing. All right.

747
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,640
First of all, scratch that. All
right. You have no idea what, what,

748
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,750
how does that expression go?

749
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,260
Okay.

750
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,200
You know, only the devil knows
the secrets in a woman's heart.

751
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,660
Isn't that how it goes? Something
like that. Don't ever fucking,

752
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:38,400
you have no foul. I
don't give a fuck. Okay.

753
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,140
You could have a woman in a Goddamn cell.

754
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:42,030
You still have no idea what
the fuck they're doing.

755
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,623
Okay.

756
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,480
Um, the sorceress um,

757
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,853
anyways,

758
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,180
am I to believe she is so naive to think
that we were just hanging out as total

759
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,290
platonic friends.

760
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,140
The only reason I could think why she
would do that is because I am agnostics

761
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,480
and she is a semi-religious girl.
What do you think I should do?

762
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,380
You know what you should do fucking walk

763
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,450
Robert Deniro in heat.
Just walk away. All right.

764
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,100
Just walk away. This is
what you do. All right.

765
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,250
This girl's being all flirted with
you and all that type of shit.

766
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,350
She gets your Dick hard. You're
trying to be a gentleman.

767
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,610
You don't try to fucking finger blast her
on the first day cause you think she's

768
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:29,760
special. All right, so three days after
flying kites and going on picnics,

769
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,530
you go in for a kiss. She pulls up, Eh,
Eh, didn't want to ruin the friendship.

770
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,980
Give me a fucking break. She knows
what the fuck she's doing. All right?

771
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,720
She's toying with you.
So this is what you do.

772
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,180
This is the best thing that you can do.

773
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,510
When a woman does something like that
that makes you want to go out and eat

774
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:50,640
fucking sheet metal is you don't,

775
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,210
you don't give them the emotion
that they want, which is she,

776
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:58,320
they want you to be upset. And, uh, I
don't know. I don't know why I have no,

777
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:02,520
I don't know fucking why, but she wants
you to be upset. So this is what you do.

778
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,450
Okay? He just say, Oh yeah, hey, I didn't
know what I was doing. That's cool.

779
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,240
That's cool. Whatever. All right.

780
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,900
And then she had very few any fans
and be like, yeah, absolutely,

781
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,770
we can totally be friends. Alright,

782
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,890
so don't try to fucking bang
her anymore. Don't blow her off.

783
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:23,040
So she has no idea what you're doing.
Just keep hanging out with or whatever,

784
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,800
doing this and that. And then we
do just start fucking working out.

785
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,810
You get jacked, right?

786
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,990
And then on the side you start talking
to other broads and then one day you show

787
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:36,190
up with a fucking Goddamn Hickey
on the side of your neck. You know?

788
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,600
And then you fucking just don't even
address it. What said I, you know,

789
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:42,070
I was hanging out with some girl last
night. So what are you doing today?

790
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:46,810
And you just, you just, you mind fucker.
Right back. You fight fire with fire.

791
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,550
That's what you do. Get on with your
life, sir. Fuck her. That's it. All right.

792
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,310
That's it. That's, that's what I feel

793
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,210
my solution is always the same. Okay.

794
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,630
Is when whenever a girl does
some shit like that. All right?

795
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,010
Or if a girl breaks up with you
or anything like that and, and uh,

796
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,940
if a girl still wants to be friends with
you after she broke up with you, don't,

797
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,350
all right? You get the fuck
away from her hurt locker. Okay.

798
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,070
Put on your bomb suit and fucking walk
away. Don't be the, don't be the hero.

799
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,840
You fucking walk away because they just
want to keep you in their life as they

800
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:32,830
slowly get over you and just constantly
be taking a state knife and shoving it

801
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:35,920
into your heart. Fuck that. All
right? You get away from him.

802
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,080
This, there's no point
being around this girl.

803
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,090
So right now this girl just
tried to mind. Fuck you.

804
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:47,230
So if you do the automatically
just cut off being around her,

805
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,530
she's going to win on some level and
she'll actually get some sort of level of

806
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:52,840
satisfaction that you reacted that way.

807
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,720
Because because even though you
think you're saying fuck you,

808
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,930
what you're really saying is I actually
cared about you and that's gonna feed

809
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:01,600
her Goddamn Ego. So don't do
that. So just be like, yeah,

810
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:05,520
I don't know what I was thinking.
You know? Uh, yeah. You can't. Yeah,

811
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,210
you can't. You can't blame a guy for try.

812
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:11,470
And that'll annoy her like she's just
some piece of meat you took a swing at.

813
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,030
This is such terrible fucking advice,
but you know what? I believe in it.

814
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:24,280
This is how I've lived my life. If you
want to end up like me, 43 not married,

815
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:25,630
no kids, that's how you do it.

816
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,010
I Dunno. Yeah. Just whatever
she wants to hang out. Yay.

817
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:36,410
Let's hang out and don't be weird
around her. Don't be weird. Hey,

818
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:39,020
sorry about that. I don't know
I was an idiot or whatever.

819
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,280
Now that's what you do.
That's what you do. All right.

820
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,800
And then what you do is start
talking about some other girl,

821
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,040
wait a couple of weeks and just say,
hey, you know, I Kinda met this girl.

822
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,340
I kind of like her and Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. You know, this is,

823
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:56,060
this is a fucking, this is
the old hook and lateral play.

824
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,430
I don't know if this'll work.
This is definitely a hail Mary.

825
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,510
But maybe if you fucking start
saying, hey, and I met this girl,

826
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,430
hey know I kinda fucking like, or you
show up at the Hickey on your neck.

827
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,500
I don't know what happens. The spinal
cord muscles, the spinal cord muscles,

828
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:13,600
the muscles around this spinal cord get
fucking eye. They get weak, you know,

829
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:15,850
and all of a sudden they just
fall face first and the elap,

830
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,160
sometimes that happens, you know,

831
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:21,250
but you're not going to know when
they should try it. All right?

832
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,430
Don't be Chris Webber and be looking
to pass the fucking ball here.

833
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:27,680
You want to take the shot? You
understand me? So what you do,

834
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,300
sometimes I say this shit and I,

835
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,340
and I step outside of myself and I just
realized what a fucking moron I sound

836
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:36,200
like. But I don't know. For some
reason you guys listen to this shit,

837
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,720
so whatever. Good luck to you. I just

838
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,443
home green

839
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,950
[inaudible] spray and the boat

840
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,910
safe. What's different?

841
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,230
They hard to get all those time.

842
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,340
[inaudible] do some little
differences this week

843
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,270
rather than me just sitting
here in my pajamas ranting,

844
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,650
ranting and raving.

845
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,820
I decided that I would get closed this
week and have a friend of mine come by.

846
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,970
Um, the one and only dom. I rera
everybody. Thank you everybody.

847
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,820
Do you mind if I get undressed? Huh?

848
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:38,060
I would feel more comfortable doing the
show I like in the nude and the nude in

849
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:40,470
the nude, not just in the nude.

850
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:46,740
I realized now, you know, look, look
how much weight I've gained right now.

851
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:50,190
You know, I've gained since I've
known you, but 30 pounds. Right.

852
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,760
And I know that. I can tell.
Well, you don't really look,

853
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,450
you don't really check me out. It is.
Oh, duck my head. My head is bigger.

854
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:02,670
What are you wearing? That slimming black
tee shirt. I've got Barry bonds head,

855
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,240
but it's interesting because now I don't
even know if this is a bit yet built,

856
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,640
but I think there's something
minute. I have to look.

857
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,200
I don't like women my own age. Right.
I mean, I can't, I can't fake that.

858
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:20,350
I get aroused by them. I always wondered
that. No, I always wanted to lean it.

859
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,000
I wish I had that kind of
love or something that I
need like a hot young chick,

860
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,110
but the only hot young chick I'm
going to get has to be flawed. Right.

861
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,900
She gotta be as daddy issue
inside or outside. Yeah.

862
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,660
You just gotta be messed up in some
way. But that's what I'm looking for.

863
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,430
How many, uh, how many strippers
have you, have you dated, dated?

864
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,690
Uh, only a couple. I was
in love with one. How old?

865
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,780
How old were you when you did, when
you made that move? Uh, two years ago.

866
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,140
You fell in love with the
stress lower yet. First of all,

867
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,780
it's just a country song.
She was filling low. Um,

868
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,040
she was not stripping at the time.

869
00:52:56,041 --> 00:53:00,990
She was bartending and just give him
the occasional lap dance and really

870
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:04,050
beautiful girl. Been to that
bar. Fun. But I'll tell you,

871
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:07,470
oxycontin and alcohol really mess you
up. Yeah. I don't know if you knew that.

872
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,400
Yeah, I got some, but I still
love the girl, but she's a don't,

873
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,560
I don't think we're getting
back together cause that oxy,

874
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,030
her husband and her two kids
keep blocking us. Oh Jesus. Dom,

875
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:20,850
you're making me feel
good. Making me feel good.

876
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:23,840
Some of the choices I made back
in the day, dude, oxy is a,

877
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,010
that's a terrible one,
right? Yeah. That's one

878
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,620
of those things like even
when you get off at your,

879
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,310
I don't know that you're ever a,
depending on how long you do it, the same.

880
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:35,800
I lost a buddy of mine to that.
Oh really? I got another one. Uh,

881
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:36,960
he's not doing so well.

882
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:41,610
Did you grow up in a neighborhood that
was a lot of drugs? Um, not like that.

883
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,410
Not like that. It was a, I grew up, you
know it was called the sec bullshit.

884
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,000
It was weed. There was the weed guy,

885
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:52,200
there was the bookie and then w and then
there was, you know blues obviously,

886
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:57,090
but you know when some coke
when you got older, but uh,

887
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:01,350
like nobody was doing like heroin and
crack was like you're out of your fucking

888
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,660
mind. Cause everybody thought if
you smoked crack, that was it.

889
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,000
You had done well the, they say
you get addicted the first time.

890
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,060
That's what they said. But I got friends
of mine who dead and they're like,

891
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,800
yeah, maybe they're addicted to other
things they didn't have time to be.

892
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,980
Maybe they're just better people and
better, stronger. You have good friends.

893
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,030
Let me ask you this. If you had one
drug that you think you would like,

894
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,760
what would it be? I know
what mine is. If you,

895
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,970
if I could do a drug that I've never
tried and I tried and you think that they

896
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,330
like, it's not gonna have any
repercussions. Just want to the feeling.

897
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,050
What feeling would it
be? Tai, I have a tie.

898
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,930
Well is I want to know, I want
to know what it feels like.

899
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,400
Like that train spotting where you
sink into the rug the first time you do

900
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:47,880
heroin. That's exactly, that's
exactly what I want that.

901
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,700
But I got to admit the
hallucinating thing tripping,

902
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,000
but I'll put that says that
somebody told me, like you said,

903
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,620
awake when you're tripping.
It's not like you don't know.

904
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:58,230
The trepanned you see the door
fucking melting. You're like, oh,

905
00:54:58,231 --> 00:54:59,580
it's because I'm on acid.

906
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,950
It's not like those high school
films where you'd be like,

907
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,070
you thought you could fly and shit
like that jumped out the window. No, I

908
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,880
uh, what was that movie with that old
guy? Was it something funny to me?

909
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:16,350
Larry Alan Arkin did a part where he
played an old guy and he fucking, uh,

910
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,500
he just, he got addicted to heroin
like his seventies and he's just like,

911
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,370
what the fuck? I'm 70. That's a good,
actually a good idea just to try it.

912
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,780
It's 70. I mean, I'd rather go out
shooting drugs and go out taking,

913
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,550
you know, Dick in the
ass. That must hurt, man.

914
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,680
That's the thing. You ever think about
that seriously? Bill taken one? Yeah,

915
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,870
excepting one. I think taking one for
the tee and taking one for the team.

916
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,490
All tell him your number came up. Sorry.

917
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,810
You're not going to like this like this.
I don't think so. We worked this out.

918
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,900
No, I've actually thought
you, you only a priest. How I,

919
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:54,070
how I want to go out and buy
wolves eating shredded by animals.

920
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:55,320
Yeah.

921
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,490
I either want to live to be like 105
like you live so long that there's like

922
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:04,270
nobody at your funeral because you
outlived everyone who gives a shit or the,

923
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,950
you know, because cause that is what funny
image cause that's one of the things,

924
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,330
if you live long enough, this,

925
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,530
I'm pretty sure he had people that cared
about like people doing the eulogy.

926
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:17,070
Like, I mean, you know, he says I met
him when he was 87 and uh, you know,

927
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:20,610
he was all like, he like playing
cards, which those slippers,

928
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,260
I always wore those slippers.

929
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,140
But if you die, like,

930
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,160
you know, like all my friends, you know,
who have died tragically fucking young,

931
00:56:31,161 --> 00:56:34,940
it seems, I mean you pack the house
and everybody's up there flying.

932
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,810
That's the only good thing about
Diane Young is everybody gives a fuck.

933
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:43,190
If there's articles written about you,
there's nothing worse with, I mean,

934
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,250
there's nothing worse than dying
yet, but Diane old also is, you know,

935
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:50,210
you sit in there, you got that
fucking old terrified picture. Know

936
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,850
my uncle Tony when he died, he really
was very prejudiced and very angry,

937
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:00,240
but he also loved his children.
He loved God. He loved mountains.

938
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,190
And then when he died, it was so funny
that make up for the racist. Yeah,

939
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,080
but I'm saying he was that
balanced crosses on people
in the nature love birds.

940
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,550
It's true though. He was
like all that. And he's,

941
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:15,390
and what were standing around the coffin?
You see that mountain? It's for us.

942
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,380
It's for us. Not these other
people. This is God's country.

943
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,870
But when we're around the
courtroom, we're standing, you know,

944
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:25,300
people lie about people after they
died, and this guy leave for Deli,

945
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,540
who was the first Italian character
ever did? Like I got down a little, uh,

946
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,870
he said, we're staying there.

947
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:34,410
Me and a friend of mine is a priest and
like a couple of my cousins and we're

948
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,270
standing there over the body and he goes,

949
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:38,490
he never had a bad word
to say about anybody.

950
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,180
And we went from crying to fucking
laugh. And I'm thinking, like I said,

951
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:45,060
all he did was have bad words said,
but everybody, and then he goes,

952
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,010
listen to this, this is a
really old reference. He goes,

953
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:52,100
he never hated anybody except
Larry Bowa, right? Larry Bo,

954
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,230
the old for the Phillies. And he
goes and he looks up, he goes,

955
00:57:55,231 --> 00:57:59,520
he hated that mother fucker would
of vengeance. Was he a gambler? No,

956
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,900
he didn't gamble. He just hated him.

957
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,860
He hated the Larry Book cause he hit
one 75 but he was a great fielder.

958
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,910
But I mean hell, what a, what an
obscure reference to make at a funeral.

959
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,840
Right. So in general, back in the day,

960
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:13,040
he probably just didn't
like second basements right.

961
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,550
Straight in front of the board.
But I love that everybody laughed.

962
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:17,050
I've had a couple of
those that like funerals.

963
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,950
Oh, we're crying, losing from
crying, crying, crying, laughing.

964
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,470
I did that one time, a buddy of mine,

965
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:27,270
his dad died and it was just one of those
fucking, you know, tragic. You know,

966
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,730
we were young and he died on to
nowhere and the kid had already lost,

967
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:33,690
his mom was fucking horrible.
And uh, so it was pouring,

968
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:38,490
raining to make it even worse. Fucking
like the, remember the movie seven?

969
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,770
It was raining like that. Okay.
Yeah. So we, we, you know,

970
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,230
go, you know, we'll go through the
surface and now they're gonna, you know,

971
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,470
put the guy on the ground and
the guy was so popular. I mean,

972
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,510
it was just a zillion people there. So
they had like one of these, you know,

973
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:56,340
one of those pop tents with no sides to
it. So there's so many fucking people,

974
00:58:56,341 --> 00:59:00,240
everybody's jamming in there. Me
and my buddy can't get in, you know,

975
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:02,670
we're on the outer ring, we're
just getting rained on and shit.

976
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,750
And my other asshole friend is just
inside the tent and he's sitting there and

977
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,750
we're all crying and stuff and bringing
the body down. And all of a sudden,

978
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,130
just from the weight of the rain,

979
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:16,080
like this little like canal
started pouring down and
just missing my friend and

980
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:17,460
my buddy in the middle of crimes,

981
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,680
we're standing rain just reached up and
adjusted it. So it went all his coat.

982
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:25,400
But he had like this wool kind of coat
on so he couldn't feel it at first.

983
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,450
And Dude, I'm talking, crying, laughing,

984
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,870
just crying because it was so sad.

985
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,660
And that's the thing too that I never
thought people ever understand about

986
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:37,610
comics when they have a distasteful joke,

987
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,410
like of a boat sinks as a plane
crash and you have a joke.

988
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,490
They always think it's cause you're
insensitive and they'd sometimes don't

989
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:47,570
understand that it's, it's a defense
mechanism where it's sitting the pain.

990
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:51,440
Yeah, I'm feeling something bad. I don't
want to feel it. And then you, you,

991
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,370
you make a fucking joke
and then you're laughing.

992
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,990
Cause you don't want to feel that. So
you're actually doing it because you get,

993
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,720
it's kind of, I think, I
think it's like a dysfunction.

994
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,080
It's kind of a form of dysfunction.
Well, I couldn't file jokes.

995
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:07,130
We all know how terrible that is. And
yet when you give a 20 incidences,

996
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,430
but you could, you can twist
them around. I usually bring up

997
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,290
back on myself, you know, like, uh, one
joke that says, you know what about me,

998
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,450
father, I wasn't hot enough
for you. You know what I mean?

999
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,300
Like that kind of thing to make it
me. I wouldn't want to hurt a kid,

1000
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:23,150
but there's a good example of
something that's cause so many people,

1001
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:26,960
so much pain. And I'm not just talking
about the physical pain. Yeah. But, um,

1002
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,090
you know, we do.

1003
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,460
Oh No, you, you end somebody's
life when you, that's why that,

1004
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:34,700
that said Dusky guy, you know, like
they shouldn't put those good. They,

1005
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,110
they should automatically get the
death penalty just immediately.

1006
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:41,680
They take them out. Dude, if you've
got a rabid dog in your neighborhood,

1007
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:45,460
you fucking put it down. Those
sex offender guys, that's it.

1008
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,450
Because all those people
that that dude fucked with,

1009
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,830
it's like that's gonna now affect. You
want to talk about dating strippers?

1010
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:58,680
Like how that's going to affect who
they pick. You know who they pick as a,

1011
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,240
uh, a wife, how they treat
their kids. They make, they,

1012
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,360
there's a chance that they
could, you know, sometimes,

1013
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,194
I don't know if it happened.

1014
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,490
I'm going to go beyond my intelligence
on this shit, which isn't too hard to do,

1015
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:09,850
but I,

1016
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:14,550
all I know is that that's generations
of therapy because of the abuse of the,

1017
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:18,440
they repeat the whoever. Then
those guys don't get the,

1018
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,280
you can't put that guy in jail
and like, I mean, how long,

1019
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,810
like you're attracted to what you're
attracted to no amount on a cell. Well,

1020
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:27,670
especially that time. If
they suck you in a cell,

1021
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:29,890
how long before you wouldn't
like big ticket strippers,

1022
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,850
you'd come out eight years
later, I'm dumb. I wait, get,

1023
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,510
bring me to some pick tickets for
those guys. Like eight year olds,

1024
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,760
you stick him in a cell
and you talk to them.

1025
01:01:39,761 --> 01:01:43,540
You try to undo it and show them an
adult that they're wired that way.

1026
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:47,920
That's it. I'm just fucking sick
putting, put them down. It's your ethic.

1027
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:52,150
It's why I don't believe in a
higher power that gives a fuck.

1028
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,230
Well, that's a whole different
subject, but I understand that.

1029
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:59,770
But did you hear that pedophile joke
about a, you might have to tell joke joke.

1030
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,580
No, not at all.

1031
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,720
It's a two guys sitting on a bench and
see an 11 year old boy walked by one guy,

1032
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,120
pedophiles. It says to the
other one, he goes, boy,

1033
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:08,260
he must've been hot
back in the [inaudible].

1034
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,170
It must have been something
back in the day. Oh,

1035
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:17,250
that's fucking twisted.

1036
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:25,973
[inaudible]

1037
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,323
[inaudible]

1038
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:00,360
[inaudible].
