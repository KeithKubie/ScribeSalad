Just like when Georgie over our abies birthday in February.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.320

With his own little white bunny. Yes. Right now what do you got?

You got in May. Who is that? Is that April go today? I don't know.

23
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:20.680
I run out of somewhere around there. Those are weird. The dog days of the year.

24
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.880
It's like fucking, you know, a flag day.

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.190
Then I always get memorial day and Labor Day. Memorial Day is is May,

26
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.760

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.760
We recognize all the veterans, you know,

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.960

29
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:43.794
right.

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.970
Changing all your fucking VCR tapes over to fucking DVD days and then to a

31
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.840
little fucking stick, whatever the fuck it is you do that day. Right.

32
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.410
Um, and you got July 4th so everybody can go around and fucking, you know,

33
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.550
trade stories about their uncle that blew his fucking fingers off cause he never

34
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.370
got married. He was trying to impress his nephews and nieces. Right.

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.200
You're so cool. Lucky Jimmy.

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.890
<v 2>All right. See you see that right there son? You see that right there?</v>

37
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.360
That's why I told you y'all could. Jimmy ain't no fucking good title. Mom.

38
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.820
Quit your cry. Well I don't want to hear it.

39
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.790
No more weight going over uncle Jimmy's. Okay.

40
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.460
It's over there with loose fucking women and just play with them. Fire crackers.

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.090
<v 1>Right. So that's July 4th, then August, August is kind of like a month.</v>

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.590
It's up for grabs. No Jewish holidays. No. Hey,

43
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.760
remember Jesus did this for you. What did he say to him? Muslims,

44
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.000
what do you got? You got some that month. How about you?

45
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.690
Buddhist Buddhists don't give a shit, right? They're like, hey man,

46
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.700
like every day for everybody. And it's just like,

47
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.160
as long as we're sitting around and feeling the breeze,

48
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.380
that's what I'm trying to be, you know,

49
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.440
I'm trying to be that person today was to be my 10th day in a row to a meditate,

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.031
but I didn't,

51
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.920
I woke up late and I had to take my lady over to the doctors and um,

52
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.460
and I just, I just got up late. Yeah. I had this fucking weird ass dream too.

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.340
And this weird dream where I was when on my back porch I was watching these

54
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.310
helicopters flying in formation and dive bomb in my neighborhood.

55
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.930
And I was like, what the fuck did they do in that for?

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.430
And then one of them lost control and I had this weird view from my house that

57
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.600
I've never had before. And it was just basically the cockpit, you know,

58
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.920
and the engine dead part in the skids, no main rotor, no tail,

59
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.480
no tail road and nothing else.

60
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.050
And for some reason it wasn't tipping over and falling to the ground like a

61
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.140
fucking trashcan or most likely inverting.

62
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.510
It just fucking,

63
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.770
it just went straight and it sort of landed and I ran down there,

64
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.190
I was in my underwear cause you were always in your underwear, in your dreams,

65
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.500
right? You never have your pants on. It's so fucking weird.

66
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.170
This all always with mine, there's always that level of humiliation.

67
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:03.400
No matter what's going on, I can't find my pants. Right. Um,

68
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.860
anyways, so the fucking thing lands. So I run up and then I'm thinking like,

69
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.250
wait a minute, do I want to see the carnage that is in there?

70
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.000
And then all these people showed up with like cell phone cameras and stuff and I

71
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.720
was standing there in my underwear and I ran home. That was that. They go,

72
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.020
there's your dream to interpret for the week. All right.

73
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.380
Cause I'm not going to therapy anymore because I spent enough fucking money,

74
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.160
you know, with somebody daydreaming with the goddamn notebook. Right?

75
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.490
And none of them ever look like that brought on the Sopranos. Let's be honest.

76
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:37.570
Right? Um, yeah. So I started, I woke up late.

77
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.610
All right? So I need to fucking relax. Quiet my mind.

78
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.440
Make it more of a still pond. Whenever a rock falls into the pond,

79
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.980
what happens? The waters ripple. Yes.

80
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.960
The waters ripple. And if too many rocks fall in, what happens?

81
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.370
There starts to be a storm.

82
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.740
And this is what I want you to pay attention to today during today's meditation

83
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.960
is your brain is still pond.

84
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.313
<v 3>Okay,</v>

85
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.040
<v 1>well, can you hear it? This screaming,</v>

86
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.500
watery death of 1200 passengers going under the water of,

87
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.370
of your mind. Sorry, I lost it. I don't know what the fuck I was talking about.

88
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:23.070
Anyways. Um, I also, my apologies this week,

89
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.530
apology number one,

90
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.430
I own apology to the fucking Atlanta Falcons.

91
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.660
I owe an apology to the Houston Texans.

92
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.410
I owe an apology to Meryl Streep.

93
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.300
Evidentaly going into Twitter according to one person. All right,

94
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:45.780
let's start with the Seattle Seahawks, right? You know,

95
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.970
I thought those were going to be the dirty,

96
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.720
filthy stinken disease carry and birds that were going to win that gang.

97
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.220
I said last week, and I, I kind of quote,

98
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800
you know who got off easy this weekend,

99
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.040
the New England patriots and the Seattle Seahawks because the cowboys and the

100
00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:09.310
packers are going to beat the fuck out of each other and the Steelers and the

101
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.830
fucking chiefs are gonna beat the shit out of each other, right?

102
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.630
And then all we gotta do is play the winner.

103
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.313
<v 2>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.460
<v 1>That these two teams were just going to waltz to the AFC and NFC championship</v>

105
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:24.930
game as if that is a given. Well, let's start with the Atlanta Falcons.

106
00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:28.230
I picked the wrong dirty Burt's a very impressive win,

107
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.850
and I know Seattle fans are going to be like, we had some major injuries,

108
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.550
which they did coming into the game and then they lost another guy.

109
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.240
I understand that. Okay, I totally understand that. Seattle fans.

110
00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:40.740
You're 100% right. Christ.

111
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.770
<v 2>You can hear you cry in from here. Your stadium is so loud.</v>

112
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.830
<v 1>Oh my God though. Seattle. See they're so fucking lie.</v>

113
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.270
I'm so sick. I ESP and fucking like just ignoring that entire fact.

114
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.970
They just don't. They know what it is. You know what? As they can't,

115
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.720
they have the ability to separate themselves from the truth.

116
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.750
That's what I really respect from ESPN is they can just separate themselves with

117
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.910
truth and just go for the fucking money.

118
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.660
They don't give a shit about what's right or none of them give a fuck.

119
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.850
They just say in shit to say shit.

120
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.800
So idiots like me get upset and yell at their fucking TV and keep watching.

121
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.890
And then what do they do? They get some more habit dash theory, right?

122
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.870
They date, date, you know, they, they get,

123
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.440
they get a bigger fucking whatever the fuck it is thereafter over there.

124
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.070
New Tie Tech. I don't know.

125
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.000
I don't know what motivates people that want to sit around in suits talking

126
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:37.400
about sports. Why do they wear suits? By the way,

127
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:38.810
can anybody explain that to me?

128
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.760
Why are they all sitting there like there on meet the press when they talking?

129
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.790
I just, I don't fucking understand it. You know, and it's contagious.

130
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.550
Talk and standing in a fucking suit.

131
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.990
Talking about a sports is so fucking contagious.

132
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.550
Ben Roethlisberger,

133
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.910
<v 2>Ben Big Ben. I ain't wearing no fucking helmet when I ride a motorcycle,</v>

134
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.590
<v 1>showed up dressed, dare I say dressed to the fucking eye.</v>

135
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:09.890
He looked like 1 million bucks from the fucking neck. Doubt.

136
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.060
His suit was fucking sharp. He had a pocket square that tie the shirt,

137
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:19.090
the whole fucking thing. He was killing it. Okay. Oh,

138
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.530
Jay would have gone off this a second time if he wore that fucking suit yet on

139
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:25.230
Sunday. However, from the neck up, he just looked at him going like,

140
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.800
this guy crushes a 12 pack while eating. All right. A French fries.

141
00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.670
I know he does. Okay. Why? You know, you know what? He looked like?

142
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.690
He looked like a guy.

143
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.690
A kid looked like a convicted drunk driver trying to get his license back.

144
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.970
Now you promise me you're not gonna do this again? Yes, your honor. Absolutely.

145
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.790
I've seen the error of my ways, you know, it's still all puffy.

146
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.330
I'm fucking with you. I Love Ben, Ben Roethlisberger, but seeing him in a suit,

147
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.310
you know, he was, he was all grown up. I'm proud of him. Um,

148
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.040
so my apologies. The Atlanta Falcons,

149
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:58.980
and I'm not going to know anybody's fucking names. Okay.

150
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.990
I don't know anybody's names. I know Julio Jones and I know, uh, Sherman,

151
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.030
you know who Julio Jones made look, he made him look, I wouldn't,

152
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:10.920
I would never say regular because Sherman is the shit.

153
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.600
He made him look he a little bit and I've never seen him do that cause that guy

154
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.040
still shuts down his part of the fucking field. All right.

155
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.940
And he made him look a kind of a, you know, he's guy's pretty good.

156
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.680
He's got some pretty good footwork there. Um, and also I thought he, uh,

157
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.100
when cab chancellor came up where he usually just fucking lays the fucking

158
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.470
lumber. Julio Jones dropped his shoulder, absorbed the shit. And Dare I say,

159
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.270
I'm not going to say he put cam on his back, but it,

160
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:45.000
it was not an issue that cam hit him and that really surprised me. And um,

161
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.700
I don't know. I don't know any the fucking names.

162
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.650
I'll say the Atlanta's fucking running back. Whatever the fuck his name is. Uh,

163
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.380
the one who doesn't pretend to eat cereal, whenever he fucking gets a few yards,

164
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.660
that's the cowboys one. He gets up, you know, you know Jesus,

165
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.430
you ever seen a guy campaign and harder to get a lift in soup ad, you know,

166
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.270
is that guy who used to be on the giants and then did the show at that little

167
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:11.271
cutie pie in the morning and then for some reason left that show to be one of 19

168
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.330
with the guy who used to run fucking a Clinton's campaign.

169
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.390
Is it George Stephanopoulos on a morning show right now?

170
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.640
Like that guy's got to be on like what the fuck?

171
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.380
What happened and what do I, 25 fucking years ago,

172
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:26.670
I was dealing with the Russians

173
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.620
now fucking sitting here on pancake Wednesday acting like I'm excited about this

174
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:33.090
shit. Sit on this fucking couch.

175
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.660
You know what the worst parts of those shows are as the way they decorate the

176
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:39.270
coffee table? You know,

177
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.620
I can't imagine trudging in there every fucking day to do that show of like,

178
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:47.400
what fucking monkey suit are they putting you in today? You know,

179
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.510
girls have to have their Sassy. I'm a morning person. Outfits, you know,

180
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.440
the guys have to have that. Uh, you know, I'd show up in a, you know,

181
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.690
I turned the whole fucking paycheck over to,

182
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:01.410
you wouldn't pull some Angela's ashes shit and go to the pub instead.

183
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.260
They got to have that fucking look. You know what I mean? Um,

184
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.150
why did stray hand leave that show? Cause that little cutie pie,

185
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:14.040
what the fuck is her name? I said, I want to real life. She's fucking smoking,

186
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.210
smoking hot right now. It was just the two of them. They had a great time,

187
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:22.410
right? She come out on his shoulder like a parakeet. He threw the monologue,

188
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.570
she giggled alarm in. They had the whole fucking thing.

189
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.230
It was just the two of them, just the two of them,

190
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.780
and if for some reason he leaves that show,

191
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.300
Michael Strahan, arguably one of the most successful people, you know,

192
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.270
people look at Mark Cuban and they go, Amy, here's a guy you know,

193
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.640
he didn't have any fucking money. He starts some internet company.

194
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.590
He makes a zillion dollars that he buys an NBA team. Great.

195
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.290
He starts go bald, he gets the fuck in here, plugs. He goes to Vegas,

196
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.030
he's at a rave. You don't know where this guy's going.

197
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.060
He's got his own fucking jet. Everybody thinks this is the guy.

198
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.070
This is the next fucking Bill Gates Guy. He's on shark tank.

199
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.820
Okay? He's having people coming in who could barely afford the guests and their

200
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.360
lawnmower and he's listening to their ideas and then owning them and then taking

201
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:16.450
them and not giving it. You know? But you know what, guys like that too, right?

202
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:19.480
I don't know why I'm picking on this guy. He's just funny to me. Right. Um,

203
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.230
I'll go have this. Everybody thinks he's the next Bill Gates.

204
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:30.040
And meanwhile you got Michael Stray here. Okay.

205
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.030
Who came up from the hard streets or somewhere? I don't know where he came from,

206
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:38.230
but I know he's African American, so I know his streets weren't soft. Right.

207
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.690
What was the last time you saw an African American make it and they,

208
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:45.910
and they said they did not come from hard streets,

209
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:48.370
that he came from soft streets. You never see that.

210
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.790
You do not stay or no soft streets on that side of the fucking fence.

211
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.500
So we gave from the heart streets.

212
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.760
I'm not aware of where are we going to put that guy.

213
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:59.140
He doesn't seem like a New York guy. He seems like a Pennsylvania Dude.

214
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.200
I Dunno where the fucking kid, the hard streets of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

215
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.390
Allentown. I don't know where the fuck he came from. Whatever.

216
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.070
He fucking makes it. Okay. He becomes a fucking superstar,

217
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.880
right? He deals with Tiki Barber and whatever the fuck he was trying to do,

218
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.760
you know, throwing the ball low all over the carpet retires early.

219
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.050
They get him out of the way. It goes into the super bowl. Now follow back up.

220
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.180
Fucking gets the sack record. Right. You know,

221
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.070
and his last one of course was the most impressive, which bread farmers run on.

222
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.150
That was the precursor to the bud fumble. It's the exact same body motion,

223
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:37.150
except he didn't run into a giant offensive lineman's ass.

224
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.930
He just came in and just sort of laid down. All right then,

225
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:44.650
if I remember correctly, where the fuck did they go?

226
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.600
They went somewhere on the road and one,

227
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.750
then they went into green bay and one and they went into Dallas and one I might

228
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:51.460
have those two flip flops.

229
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.690
And then they went to the Superbowl play the eight New England patriots and they

230
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:58.180
fucking kick the shit out of them on the offensive line.

231
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.290
One on the last fucking play of the game. Okay. And uh,

232
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.200
when's her fucking Superbowl? And then you think that's it now? And he goes, oh,

233
00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:08.710
he's a broadcast to toe. He's fucking killing it. Ah,

234
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.130
but you know a lot of guys done that hour. We long did it. Terry Bradshaw dead.

235
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:15.310
Fucking OJ Simpson dead it. Everybody fucking did it. Right?

236
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.570
That's just what you do.

237
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:19.970
If you can actually fucking talk about the game and you can put on a goddamn

238
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.930
suit, then he does the unprecedent. Okay.

239
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.960
A visionary move that not even Mark Cuban could come up with.

240
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.590
He decides that, you know what, I am the,

241
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.150
I am the next logical choice to take over for fucking Regis Philbin.

242
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.961
Right? I mean,

243
00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.000
I did a whole bit about Arnold Schwarzenegger one time about all of his

244
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:43.840
accomplishments. I would put, I would put the straight hand right there. Okay.

245
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.210
And then he fucking, what does he do? What does he do? He gets,

246
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.480
everything's going great for whatever fucking reason he decides to join the

247
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:52.550
Partridge family on mother fucking morning show.

248
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.700
It's gonna be the same shit standing around watching somebody cook something,

249
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.950
right? Talking about us.

250
00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:02.830
Some fucking person just had the a hundred and fifth birthday.

251
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.490
Why would you want to be over there with all of those fucking ass heads?

252
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.980
You know, all of those different personalities.

253
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:11.590
You know someone's going to be a cunt, right?

254
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.540
You could have just stayed at your other show.

255
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.500
Have you ever heard somebody waste more time talking about something that nobody

256
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.960
gives a fuck about in your life? I don't know what the hell that was.

257
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.070
That was 10 minutes on Michael Strahan. All right. Um, probably like six,

258
00:15:26.071 --> 00:15:28.030
but it felt like 50. Um,

259
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.920
so my apology to the dirty birds down in Atlanta,

260
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.800
I apologize for disrespecting your team.

261
00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.390
I didn't realize how good you guys were.

262
00:15:36.391 --> 00:15:39.720
I wrote you guys off again at the beginning of the game when I heard you had the

263
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.490
, the, you know, you scored the most points,

264
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:45.030
but we're the worst in the league in the red zone. I'm like, well,

265
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.990
the game's over.

266
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.220
<v 4>Okay,</v>

267
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.180
<v 1>the game is fucking over.</v>

268
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.140
So you run up a bunch of points during the regular season against 90% of the

269
00:15:52.141 --> 00:15:55.770
teams that are not gonna make the playoffs. So that's out the window.

270
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:56.640
And then meanwhile,

271
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:01.710
you couldn't stop 100% of these cons in the red zone right there.

272
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.400
That's a formula for disaster. And what did they do? They went out,

273
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.060
they beat Seattle so bad. There wasn't one point.

274
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.370
<v 4>Okay.</v>

275
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.480
<v 1>During that game, I think on the first drive I saw Pete Carroll one time when,</v>

276
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.270
<v 5>Woo.</v>

277
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.190
<v 1>That was it. That was it. Oh Man.</v>

278
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.120
I love PKO man. He's a fucking great coach. You know,

279
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.790
he was fucking pissed when they lost. Oh, he was fucking pissed.

280
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.590
Can you imagine his family dog?

281
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:30.080
He seems like would have a little one too of just standing the equivalent in the

282
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:30.914
corner.

283
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.630
Pete walking around with his ridiculously white brand new socks,

284
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.160
walking across this carpeted floor as what he seems like to me. Right.

285
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.420
Has on his fucking docker PJ's.

286
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.030
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

287
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.950
<v 1>That dog just gets a little too close. You know,</v>

288
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:51.820
I don't understand why we didn't shut up daddy pence and fucking thing goes

289
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:56.080
flying into the fireplace. Um, anyways,

290
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.120
he's probably a cat person who knows. And my apology to the Texas used Houston,

291
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.630
Texas who without JJ fucking in and a rookie quarterback hon with the New

292
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.930
England Patriots for, uh, for three and a half fucking quarters. Um,

293
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.900
yeah, I was not impressed with us. I don't think, uh, any Patriot fan was, uh,

294
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.270
we'll see. We'll see. I hope that's not, I think,

295
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.240
I'm just hoping our offensive line had a bad game member just had a bad fucking

296
00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:26.530
game. If you're going to have a bad game,

297
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.260
you might as well do it against the team that's missing their best offensive

298
00:17:29.261 --> 00:17:32.410
player and as a brand new guy, quarterback. So maybe we got away with one.

299
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.850
I have no fucking idea.

300
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.520
All I know is we're playing Pittsburgh next week and I have no fucking

301
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:39.190
confidence in that despite the fact Pittsburgh, you know,

302
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.580
I don't know what they did. Like they, they kicked six field goals,

303
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:44.110
which is essentially, you know,

304
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.953
<v 4>I don't know</v>

305
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.300
<v 1>if you just went on field goes,</v>

306
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:51.330
you might as well have out there on like those figure skates, you know,

307
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.090
dressed up like Yogi bear or some shows like some ice capades shits,

308
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:56.610
but they did it, you know, they beat Kansas City.

309
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:58.050
I didn't see one second of the game.

310
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.130
I watched the beginning of the Dallas Green Bay game and then my wife wanted to

311
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:04.290
go to the movies. So I took her to the movies and I'm like, all right,

312
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:07.260
I'm recording this game. Let's record it. The fucking Steelers Kansas City game.

313
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.000
I saw hidden fucking fag and then I came back. Right.

314
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.190
Am I go right? You know, my wife's taken a bath. Everything's fucking cool.

315
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.720
I go to pop on the Green Bay Dallas game and I didn't fucking recorded.

316
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.893
<v 6>Let me say it again.</v>

317
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:29.110
I didn't fucking recorded it was [inaudible]

318
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.340
<v 1>sounded like an insane half and ad fucking hats off to that fucking do Crosby.</v>

319
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.950
Who I'm telling you right now. That was some Adam Finna Terry Shit.

320
00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:43.460
I never even seen Terry hit that many 50 yarders in one fucking game.

321
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.490
Forget about hitting one, get an iced and then he's got to kick it again.

322
00:18:46.491 --> 00:18:51.491
That guy kicked like 200 yards in field goals in like four attempts or some shit

323
00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:56.570
like that. Um, that's the kind of guy that's the kind of guy right there.

324
00:18:56.571 --> 00:18:57.910
You gave me a little drill again,

325
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.870
that's kind of guy when your championship right there.

326
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.380
Cause all you got fucking uh, Aaron Rogers, all he's got now,

327
00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:06.440
all you've got gotta do is just get your clothes and old twinkle tellers comes

328
00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:09.530
running out with balls the size of the fucking stadium.

329
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.710
It gives them the old right there, Fred right there. No big deal.

330
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.610
Do you realize how much fucking ass he got after that game? Even in Dallas,

331
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.170
you know those Dallas women with their fucking botox and the same amount of

332
00:19:21.171 --> 00:19:24.200
makeup as an 80 year old who can't admit that she's old. You know,

333
00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:28.310
they all came running out right? Took their hats off, take them boots off.

334
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.000
You know they all drop to the knees and their designer fucking Jordache jeans.

335
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.980
Yeah. You ever been to Dallas? This is, this day is so far behind in the styles.

336
00:19:36.981 --> 00:19:38.630
You won't even think that there's the internet anymore.

337
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.390
They all dress like Dallas is still on TV. The TV show, you know

338
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.410
[inaudible] I'm not saying they'd brought, they don't really do that,

339
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:50.210
but the through line of that is still,

340
00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:55.211
there is a lot of Larry Hagman in that city with a dash of dead JFK.

341
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.130
That is Dallas. And there's a lot of shiny fucking four door pickup trucks,

342
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.850
you know, I don't know who they're driven by, but you know,

343
00:20:04.851 --> 00:20:08.180
I think you've got to get on the outskirts to get to the [inaudible] that got

344
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.330
them longhorns walking and stopping around in the back.

345
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.160
And my apologies to Meryl Streep.

346
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:17.080
Evidently somebody had a hissy fit on the fucking Twitter telling me that I am a

347
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:18.020
typical, what did he say?

348
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.150
Postmodern cynic or I just criticized and I offered no solutions,

349
00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:27.860
which is hilarious to me. It's like, okay, so I'm in your world,

350
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.560
Meryl Streep and myself, uh,

351
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.790
should be coming up with problems, uh, problem solving things.

352
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.940
And you would say, I just took 20. The guy back goes,

353
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:39.680
I just saw him as a comedian making fun of Shit.

354
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.750
I didn't know it was a postmodern Sinek.

355
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.653
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

356
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.530
<v 1>Some people,</v>

357
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.910
the level of credit that they give people who don't even watch the news,

358
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.200
it's just fucking beyond me.

359
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.610
I had to go to summer school every year of high school except sophomore year

360
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.720
because my teacher hooked me up with a d minus and my senior year I just didn't

361
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:02.080
give a fuck and didn't go, you know, what are you gonna do? I'm done. Self.

362
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.410
I'm a loser. All right. I am on my bio.

363
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.930
<v 2>I'm on my way. Applebee's</v>

364
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.450
<v 1>wash dishes. Thank you very much. All right. So, um,</v>

365
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.590
I know way too much football. How about some hockey? Just one quick mention.

366
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.223
All right.

367
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.830
Did anybody see Adam McQuaids fight when they fucking against Nashville?

368
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.270
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

369
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.830
I don't know the name of the guy who fought,

370
00:21:27.831 --> 00:21:30.430
but that guy's got fucking balls bigger than my giant head.

371
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.030
Anybody who's got the balls that dropped the gloves,

372
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.500
I'm not shitting on the guy. I just added McQuaig that fucking guy can fight.

373
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.380
Um, agents. Like what Gash, what Gash,

374
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.350
what goes in and the guy ducked down and he fucking didn't.

375
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.220
I thought it was an uppercut that when I watched in s a m slow motion.

376
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:50.660
I think it might've been a hook. I Dunno. It just reminded me in a very,

377
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:54.800
very junior way of when Clark Gillies fucking broke that guy's face.

378
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.230
He was pounding this guy so bad,

379
00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.480
the guy just ducked down and right as he ducked down,

380
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.770
Gillies just went up or cod and his fist was big enough to cover the guy's whole

381
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:04.830
face. And it was like,

382
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.510
it was like he punched a glass coffee table and this guy just went,

383
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:13.580
he like straight down like when they pull a building, you know. Um,

384
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.810
and the first time I noticed that that guy could fight with, uh,

385
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.430
he beat the fuck out a rap.

386
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.900
Ralphie Torres when he was playing with the Phoenix coyotes.

387
00:22:26.421 --> 00:22:29.180
I'll have links to those fights, but that's, that's our,

388
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.110
I guess he is our enforcement now.

389
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.460
And what's great is he's a fucking unbelievable defenseman too. So, uh,

390
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.820
that's it. Celtics. What are we doing? We're doing what we always do.

391
00:22:37.821 --> 00:22:41.860
We beat the pretenders and we can't beat the contenders. That's our deal. Ed.

392
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.760
A enough sports. All right, let me, uh,

393
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.900
should I read a little bit of advertising for you? Huh? But evidently,

394
00:22:47.901 --> 00:22:49.630
I guess you have to apologize to Meryl Streep. You know,

395
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.540
cause I guess I preach also on my podcast,

396
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.030
which is the same as hijacking and award show, right?

397
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.650
Did Meryl Street once say, Hey, I'm a fucking more on, what do I know?

398
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:07.070
I don't think she did. All right. Oh, Billy street.

399
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.240
<v 2>Okay, here we go. Let's read a little bit. Oh Jesus. Here we go. Matt, up, up,</v>

400
00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:16.160
up beyond the swearing in fucking Trump by

401
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.060
[inaudible] makes you want to take a dump. But though,

402
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.400
fuck it worries you ball will be soft.

403
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.360
They don't care that you got a lot of shit in the back.

404
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.310
It has a trap door that you open up like old long underwear. Well Jesus.

405
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.800
All right, the Valentine's Day gift. Oh, this Valentine's Day.

406
00:23:34.801 --> 00:23:37.560
Give a gift that they can unwrap again

407
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.860
<v 1>and again. Matching underwear from me on these now Jesus.</v>

408
00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:47.830
Who the fuck was all right? Valentine's is near and it's time. It's a,

409
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:52.070
it's a goat in, in his go time. Sorry for thoughtful gift hunting.

410
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.640
Any words that have a dash in it? Like they're together. Like it's a team. Like,

411
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:57.590
I'm like a rookie quarterback. I can't, I, you know,

412
00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:59.510
I just look at my number one receiver.

413
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.480
I can't check down to the next guy and I just stumble over it.

414
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.540
It's go time anywhere. Any, I guess you put a dash there.

415
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.320
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

416
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.060
<v 1>cause I'd be like, it's go time.</v>

420

421
00:24:27.871 --> 00:24:30.720
freaked out that I'm having a kid any minute now. All right.

422
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:34.260

Flowers last a week. Oh, shots fired.

426

It's Sherry's berries in 1-800-FLOWERS.

427
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.440

that your special, someone deserves a special fabric,

442
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.930
which is why their underwear is made exclusively out of modal, modal,

443
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.960
a fabric with a touch three times softer than cotton beyond.

444

449
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.580

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.900
it's either going to be really like masculine looking or really feminine looking

451
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:19.830
or you're just saying it's the same print, you know?

452
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:22.200
So you know who's going to buy these fun fucking underwear?

453
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.830
The kinds of people that have four kids and all name them by the first

454
00:26:25.831 --> 00:26:28.290
continent. These are my kids,

455

that me and he's done clubs led for if you're matching underwear,

473
00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.220
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the gayest of gay couple.

474
00:27:37.221 --> 00:27:39.530
I don't even know that you guys would even do that.

475
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.690
Would you even be that festive?

476
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.490
Are Gay people festive or is that just a stereotype that Hollywood is spoon

477
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:52.010
feeding to America and that's what needs to stop dollar shave club.

478
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:57.010
Everybody Dollar Shave Club always gives you a close snoop shave and you can't

479
00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:58.580
beat the convenience of the price.

480
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.090
You don't have to choose between settling for a cheap bag is shitty.

481
00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:06.140
Disposable razors are paying out the fucking nose for a raise it with the laser

482
00:28:06.141 --> 00:28:08.270
pointer and 17 blades. It's awful.

483
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.020
Then dollar shave club broke onto the scene with the smarter choice.

484
00:28:12.021 --> 00:28:13.910
Before Dollar Shave Club, there was no middle ground.

485
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.970
It was either shave a with your fucking girlfriends,

486
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.610
things she did her legs with, cut up your fucking face.

487
00:28:19.611 --> 00:28:23.810
So he spent a zillion dollars. Um, now you get those free ones at the gym,

488
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:28.010
which felt like shaving with a piece of glass there or pay a fortune for the

489
00:28:28.011 --> 00:28:29.420
latest. Okay, I'm just skipping around.

490
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.310
The copy of Dollar Shave Club is the best of both worlds.

491
00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:35.150
You get the premium shape quality at the disposable shave price, right?

492
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.970
It's like buying a Cadillac for five bucks.

493
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.580
If you haven't tried dollar shave club yet, you're missing out.

494
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.640
It's an amazing shave and affordable price. If you haven't figured that out yet,

495
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:45.440
what the 20 paragraphs of fucking copy,

496
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.250
there's no smarter choice on the market right now.

497
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.970
They're giving away a one month trial of any of their razors for only a dollar

498

with free shipping. And after that, it's just a few bucks a month. See that?

499
00:28:55.731 --> 00:28:57.770
Like a drug dealer. If they gave you a little taste of the crack,

500
00:28:57.771 --> 00:29:01.580
then you're hooked. Then you're stealing VCRs. There's no longterm commitments,

501

504
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:16.820
I'm seeing double, so I'm going to take a fucking break here. All right. Um,

505
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.350
okay. What do I want to talk about here? Oh, you know, I was watching the, uh,

506
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.180
speaking of Cadillacs, Elvis Presley,

507
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.280
um, I was watching the Meekum autumn autumn autos.

508
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.840
Wait, I'm trying to open this fucking blind. Jesus Christ.

509
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.190
Come on for fuck sakes. How hard does this have to be day ago? Shit.

510
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:44.050
A little light on the, um, I was watch one of those Mika, um,

511
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.510
automobile auctions and uh, I got to tell you, I'm fucking over the muscle cars.

512
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.870
I love muscle cars like any other red blood America in it,

513
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.930
and it red blood and Bug and American. I like those fucking cars,

514
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:02.980
but every fucking wants the same thing. We got some mopar power coming up.

515
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:06.880
Of course she dope. Oh, really? Does it have a Hemi?

516
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.380
Is that a Shelby? It's the same. And what it basically is,

517
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.410
is that it's the same fucking like 20 muscle cars.

518
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.110
What are you going to have? What are you going to have?

519
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.530
You know what you're going to have. You're going to have a Shelby Mustang,

520
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.270
you're going to have the tried powered fucking corvette, right?

521
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:33.460
You're going to have the fucking, you're gonna have a GTO. Ah,

522
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:35.410
you're going to have a fucking a,

523
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.190
all that Mopar fucking Hemi shit that I never got into. I was never a Chrysler,

524
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:42.260
dodge guy, Plymouth guy. And I liked the Barracuda. I,

525
00:30:42.261 --> 00:30:44.590
they're going to have a fucking a challenger.

526
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.900
They going to have a charger or they're gonna have a super B.

527
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.480
They're going to have the fucking,

528
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:52.600
whatever that z 28 was that they only made fucking 10 of them.

529
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.411
They're going to have one of those.

530
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:57.880
It's the same fucking cars over and over again. And meanwhile,

531
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.180
here's my question, why the fuck are all the trucks?

532
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.640
Do you know where the fuck are all the trucks?

533
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.720
Occasionally a truck will come across trucks, a coolest shit.

534
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.620
And where's all those great old man gangster cars? You know,

535
00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.410
like the fucking, my favorite one of all time,

536
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.590
the 1967 Cadillac.

537
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.510
Eldorado that fucking car it just go fuck yourself.

538
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.010
I love that fucking car. That's the kind of car, you know what I mean?

539
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.440
That you drive when you read the post divorce or you were smart enough never to

540
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:38.570
get married. Okay.

541
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.530
And you're successful and you're just fucking driving around and you got,

542
00:31:42.531 --> 00:31:45.110
you got, you got, you got stable a bitches and you know,

543
00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:48.410
they don't give a fuck about you. You don't give a fuck about them. Yeah.

544
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.670
They pay girlfriends. That's the fucking car you have. You know,

545
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.470
and this is the thing. And rather than secretly being lonely and empty inside,

546
00:31:57.471 --> 00:31:59.690
you're actually fulfilled because you own that car.

547
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.820
You are the closest thing to the most interesting man in the world. You know,

548
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.200
that stay thirsty. My friends, you ever seen a woman in his life? You see women

549
00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.820
whim men in his fucking life. You know what I mean?

550
00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.700
You never see him at a fucking dance recital with his fucking rug rats.

551
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.460
Um, anyways, I fucking loved that car.

552
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:28.310
I the most gangster fucking car. And then I also liked the 65, uh,

553
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.580
uh, Jesus Christ with the clamshell fucking opened,

554
00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:35.760
the headlights said Buick Riviera. Okay. And, um,

555
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.900
at some point that might be my next,

556
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.010
I drive the Jag into the ground. By the way, I sold my Prius today,

557
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.960
add that fucker for nine years, man. [inaudible] um, that's great.

558
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.600
I never did that before. I never sold it to just a person.

559
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.570
I always traded them in. And this time I actually sold it to a person.

560
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.780
Got The title, did the whole thing, felt like Richard Rawlings, you know,

561
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.730
what does he say when he physio get chefs? Right.

562
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.910
Except it was a Prius and I didn't build it. Other than that, I was just like,

563
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:09.230
I'm speaking of which the debut of gas monkey garage is tonight.

564
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:14.260
And rumor has it that the bearded wonder Aaron is leaving the fucking show,

565
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:21.110
which is, uh, you know, that's like Eddie van Halen,

566
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.460
Leven van Halen or David Lee Roth leaving. I mean, it's, it's, it's, I am,

567
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:26.510
you know, there's a lot of,

568
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:31.310
I'm interested to see what they do with this one. Hi, how are you going to,

569
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:36.740
uh, how are you going to make up for that guy? Jesus Christ. Um,

570
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.900
but I'll be tuning in. I'll be tuning in cause that's,

571
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:41.660
that's all the shows out there. That's the best one out there.

572
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:45.440
And there's so many shows that rip that fucking show off and try to capture that

573
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.980
formula. That's the best one out there. And I love the shit that they built.

574
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.730
Speaking of trucks last season, they were saying, you know what?

575
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:55.460
We're all truck guys. We're all truck guys and I'm yelling at the TV.

576
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.200
Well then fucking make some more trucks.

577
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.540
I remember that they made that one for Casey.

578
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.740
They can count on one hand they made the one for Casey. They made that, uh,

579
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.360
they made the Chevy.

580
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.710
Especially if you get those ones that had the two tone taint, two tone taint.

581
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.120
Jesus Christ. Two tone, two tone paint.

582
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.450
I don't know if I can finish this idea to tone tape. You know what that is?

583
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:23.710
That's your taint is the normal,

584
00:34:23.711 --> 00:34:27.370
your normal flesh color and somebody tries to kick you in the balls from behind

585
00:34:27.371 --> 00:34:30.040
and they miss and you get a black and blue mark on part of your tape.

586
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.630
Then what you have is a two tone. Tane. Alright, two tone pate.

587
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.200
Um, they, and they did last year. What did they do?

588
00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:43.180
They did a like a 1948 or 49 Chevrolet.

589
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.170
Uh, and they just went all out what the fucking thing. And uh,

590
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.060
it was, it was absolutely fucking, it was, it was, it was just amazing.

591
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.740
It's amazing what they do in that show. And I wish I had this skills. Um,

592
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.110
who knows? Someday maybe someday I'll fucking,

593
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.100
<v 7>okay.</v>

594
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.100
<v 1>I have the time to find a fucking 67 a Cadillac.</v>

595
00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:10.620
Eldorado dragged that fuck around in somebody's backyard and have somebody like

596
00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:13.860
that build a thing for me. I'm going to those guys too. I would drive it.

597
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:17.400
I saw one on a, I hate people to get those fucking cars and don't drive them.

598
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.720
I got one for you if you want to look this up right now. All right.

599
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:27.110
Look up 1965 Cadillac Eldorado $45,000.

600
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:29.550
This fucking guy,

601
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.690
he's got the best looking one I think I've ever seen has like the,

602
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:38.520
somebody did a whole body off restoration on it as like fucking 33 miles.

603
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.030
He got it when it had like seven miles on it and then now he's selling it with

604
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:43.800
33, and it's just like, why would you,

605
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.620
I would drive that fucking thing to 200,000 miles.

606
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.370
Unbelievable fucking car. Um,

607
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.530
but uh, the only part I will warn you when you watch that video,

608
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:59.610
when he starts caressing the leather inside the car,

609
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:03.090
it gets a little creepy. I had to fast forward to it. He was like, look at that.

610
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:07.380
That's fine. Italian leather. Oh yeah.

611
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.170
He didn't get that bad, but it got pretty bad.

612
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.930
But this fucking guy has got a bunch of them. Uh, uh,

613
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.760
Super Sport motors.com. Um,

614
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.290
at least he did as of I guess two years ago, two and a half years ago,

615
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:25.380
whenever you put this fucking video. But if I was going to buy one,

616
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:27.870
I would buy one off of this guy. Holy fucking shit.

617
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.790
I said he's got some beautiful cars, beautiful Cadillacs. Um, anyways,

618
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.090
let's plow ahead here. I think maybe it's time to, um,

619
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.740
maybe it's time to do a little like, oh, Trump gets sworn in this week.

620
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.310
You know, he gets fucking sworn in and, uh,

621
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.630
I would feel so much better about that guy. You know, it's,

622
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.540
it's not the racist people that he's putting in there, you know?

623
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.400
It's unsettling. Is that is, I mean, everybody's fucking racist, you know? Well,

624
00:36:56.401 --> 00:37:00.090
that's not true. There's different degrees of it, but everybody has it.

625
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.460
Even people who are victims of it, they have it.

626
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.700
You look at another group of people, you, everybody's done that.

627
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:08.880
You look at a group of people, you think something like, oh, it's like this.

628
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:11.070
And then you go up there. Oh, it's actually like that. Wow.

629
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:14.130
Why did I think that? And it all was in your fucking head. You know?

630
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.480
I gotta do a bit about this.

631
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:18.780
I was driving down the street the other day by dude with a right driving down

632
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:22.560
the street, and I see this group of young kids, they school just let out. Right?

633
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:23.730
This is not a good sign right here.

634
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.050
I'm driving by a school right when the school got out and I'm caressing my

635
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:33.030
leather. Now I'm driving down the street and these kids are all outside like a,

636
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.670
it's right around the corner from where I'm playing drums. Here's my alibi.

637
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:38.730
I swear to God was playing drums around the corner and um,

638
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.760
it's one of those stores that sells like a, you know,

639
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:44.730
all the fucking snacks and shit that you eat afterwards and you get all fucking

640
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:45.061
wired.

641
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:49.500
So I'm driving by there and usually I get fucking annoyed because the kids are

642
00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:50.940
fucking walking across the street.

643
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:52.890
They're not looking both ways and all that shit. And then I,

644
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:56.940
it takes me forever to make a fucking left or right hand turn or this day they

645
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.950
were all up on the sidewalk and I saw this movement.

646
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:03.951
I kind of glanced over and none of the kids were white and I saw this action.

647
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.790
I thought I was watching somebody getting the shit kicked out of them,

648
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.110
potentially getting, uh, beaten into a gang.

649
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.810
That's what my brain told me I was watching when I looked closer,

650
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.850
there was like seven kids standing around,

651
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.900
one kid looking at a fucking smartphone.

652
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.810
And then some other kids just sorta fucking, you know,

653
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.440
doing whatever running around in the background. And I was thinking,

654
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:28.350
why the fuck did I just think that, you know,

655
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.450
so before you fucking call all these assholes, all these races, assholes,

656
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:37.210
you know, you gotta get that shit out of your head. I was thinking,

657
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.840
why the fuck did I think that part of that is from the shit that I see on TV,

658
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.970
right? I think your brain just goes it. Once it gets stuffed down,

659
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.920
like how to make cereal, it just gets it down. Like, okay, just grab this,

660
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:53.620
fucking put this in here and then you've got fucking cereal. You know,

661
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:58.300
it connects to one, I want vision to this, this, this.

662
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.220
It's like a motive like survival, which works. But in that instant,

663
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:04.480
that didn't work, did it?

664
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:09.130
I went from that to a couple of fucking ice cube videos, whatever,

665
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.970
gangster rap videos or in my head, Shit that I saw in the news. Right?

666
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.460
They can't say there was fear. There was no fear.

667
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.100
I was just driving down the street and I looked and that's what I thought,

668
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.040
you know? But I kind of do that all the time. You know,

669
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:23.860
I read a Kid's book to my unborn daughter last night, right?

670
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.180
It's supposed to make them smarter. Right? And I was reading this kid's book,

671
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.970
and halfway through the book I realized I didn't,

672
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.530
I had no fucking idea what it was about. So maybe I'm just a moron.

673
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.210
I have no idea. But seeing, I want a flawed fucking person. I am a,

674
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:45.190
I can't judge, uh, I can only judge people so fucking harshly, right? Honestly,

675
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.860
I mean, I can trash your fucking Meryl Streep. I can go off in a Donald Trump,

676
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:50.500
but at the end of the day, I'm a fucking lunatic, right?

677
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.520
I read a kid's book and I couldn't figure out what it was about.

678
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.350
It was about this fucking caterpillar. All right? And they were like on day one,

679
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.180
at eight an apple on day two and eight,

680
00:39:58.181 --> 00:40:01.990
two pears on day three at eight fucking three plumps. Right?

681
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.620
So right there, I'm like, all right, this is like reverse Christmas story.

682
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.250
Rather than go in like seven swans and swimming six skeezer lane.

683
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.330
It fucking starts with the fucking tree, the partridge in the pear tree.

684
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:18.331
Now it's moving up and it seems to me like it's about eating healthy and food

685
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.950
and, and counting. And then it gets up to like 12 or something.

686
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:28.500
And the thing just completely abandoned its fruit diet instead,

687
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:33.540
it had a fucking couple slices of pizza and ice cream and all this shit and in a

688
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:38.860
big stomachache. So then I was like, all right, this is about childhood obesity.

689
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.110
And um,

690
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.820
I actually lied in that and never dawned on me that it was about counting in.

691
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.630
Neo was like, I finished the book,

692
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.880
the thing turned into a butterfly and I said, I said the end.

693
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.760
And I looked at me and I said, I have no idea what that fucking book was about.

694
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.500
She laughs, she goes, it's about counting. I go,

695
00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.360
it's not about not eating junk food because it ate all that fruit and everything

696
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:03.940
was fine. And then it, all that other shit.

697
00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:06.670
And then it got sick and she was like crying laughing at me.

698
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.120
I don't know what that has to do with Trump,

699
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:12.880
but I really wish that idiot would get off of fucking Twitter.

700
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.460
But he's a fucking mess. He said about China, it's time to take the gloves off.

701
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:23.680
He, he, he's doing that George Bush thing where you talk about other countries,

702
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:27.670
like you're trying to psych somebody out before a bar fight and nothing gets

703
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:31.510
people more excited. Get that, gets more ons excited.

704
00:41:31.511 --> 00:41:35.450
Like that's tough. Tart, right. If fucking idiots.

705
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.580
He's like trash in SNL cause they're doing sketches about them. It's just like,

706
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.590
I don't, I don't, I don't, he cannot be running his Twitter account.

707
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.160
There's no way he's this fucking sensitive, um,

708
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.680
or has the time to do this. Shouldn't he be addressing it?

709
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:59.681
My worst fear is that he's going to become president and just deregulate

710
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:05.870
everything so he can build a golf course or wherever the fuck he wants to. Like,

711
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:09.160
that's really, that's his idea of making it great again. I,

712
00:42:09.161 --> 00:42:12.500
I hope I'm fucking wrong. I have no idea. Um,

713
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.700
having said all of that, still as much as he's a nightmare,

714
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.650
unbelievably unbelievable joy watching Hillary Lewis. Oh, I love seeing, yeah,

715
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.180
pack you bags. Okay. Pack you bags there. Fucking,

716
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.920
yeah. Saying all right, let's, let's, let's continue on. Alright, let's, uh,

717
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:36.050
them off the fucking rails here. All right. 42 minutes. Can we, uh,

718
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.900
can we read these lists to advertise and they'll do your questions for the week?

719
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.390
Um, all right. Helix, Helix. Hey, by the way, why don't you guys send those in?

720
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.801
Send in your,

721
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:49.220
I looked at this thought it was this way and then it was another way,

722
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.340
but nobody heard me say it. So everybody thinks I'm a great guy.

723
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.900
And that goes for non whities too.

724
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:56.450
Cause I know you're looking at us or some other group of people,

725
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.630
Koreans or some shit or whatever yet. I know you're thinking something.

726
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:04.610
All right. Hallux. Helix. All right. You're unique. And I actually,

727
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.010
you know, as much as I'm, I'm not really joking around about this shit,

728
00:43:07.011 --> 00:43:09.860
but I think that people have to be able to say that they have those fucking

729
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:14.150
thoughts. I mean, this fucking, uh,

730
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.810
progressive left thing where you have to act like you're just walking around

731
00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:22.130
going, I don't see color. I don't care if you're black, white,

732
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:26.240
green or purple. And it's all of those, all of that fucking sing songs,

733
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.620
Horse Shit. Um, even those people, even those people,

734
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.200
like you get them in the wrong situation and the fear comes up,

735
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:36.350
they're going to think something fucked up. They're gonna. Um, alright.

736
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.900
So if you have any of those stories I want to hear,

737
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.020
I want to hear them and then I'll try to, I'll,

738
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.270
I'll try to guess why you think that way. Okay.

739
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:47.450
So I'm guessing with mine it's, uh,

740
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.240
the news and all the gangster rap videos that I used to watch and I'm,

741
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.880
I'm old. So that was back when you could actually have a gun in the video.

742
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.691
And then also, I've,

743
00:43:56.691 --> 00:44:00.980
I think I've watched too many of those life on the inside prison things,

744
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:02.961
you know what I mean?

745
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:05.390
All of those things where you just look at it and go and like,

746
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:08.420
I would last 15 seconds in there.

747
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.330
I've watched all those ones about gangs.

748
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.100
I've watched the ones about motorcycle gangs. I,

749
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.330
it's probably my, uh, my intake of, of, of television and youtube videos.

750
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:25.250
I watched videos of people's sucker punching people. Um, bully fails.

751
00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:29.720
I watch a lot of violence. Yeah, that's it.

752
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:34.360
Maybe that's what it is. Alright. Hell, helix a, you're unique. You know,

797
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.070
Dear Billy Brady balls,

798
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:09.100
my NFL team I rooted for over 20 years is moving to La parenthesis.

799
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:13.400
Chargers. What teams should I root for? Patriots are out of the question.

800
00:47:13.401 --> 00:47:18.350
Thanks and fuck the spinals family. First of all, my condolences.

801
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.900
I remember, um,

802
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:26.810
Jesus almost 25 years ago when Robert Kraft first bought the team and,

803
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.030
uh, he was threatened at some point, maybe was in the, in the year 2000,

804
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:34.090
somewhere around then. He was fucking threatening to, uh,

805
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.410
move the team to Hartford if he didn't get his own stadium and shit. And um,

806
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.330
that really is one of the biggest, you know,

807
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:46.920
fuck overs by all of these sports leagues that they,

808
00:47:46.921 --> 00:47:50.470
they get the cities that we have to pay for their fucking stadium.

809
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.333
<v 8>Um,</v>

810
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.190
<v 1>that's a time when you need a union.</v>

811
00:47:55.191 --> 00:47:58.550
If you could just have a somehow have a union of all sports fans, it'd be like,

812
00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:02.660
no, you fucking pay for it. He fucking pay for a new stadium. You can't.

813
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.360
You know what I mean? I go to the ice cream store.

814
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:08.000
I have to buy a new fucking store when they want a new store. They pay for it.

815
00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:09.410
But the money they made off of ice cream,

816
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.510
like how much money do you have to make?

817
00:48:11.511 --> 00:48:13.310
Do you know when I was in fucking Indianapolis,

818
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:17.720
those poor bastards that live out there. I don't know if this is still the case,

819
00:48:17.721 --> 00:48:18.710
but when I went out there,

820
00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.880
when they were putting that Lucas oil field deal together,

821
00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:24.440
when they were already paying for that,

822
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.760
they still had not paid off the RCA dome or the Hoosier Dome,

823
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:28.850
whatever the fuck they called it.

824
00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:33.470
They was still paying for that other one and this fucking can't make them buy

825
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:34.304
another one.

826
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.753
<v 8>Um,</v>

827
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.990
<v 1>having said that, I, I guess I can't get mad at the spinalis family.</v>

828
00:48:39.991 --> 00:48:44.991
If everybody else is getting a new stadium and he wasn't able to blackmail San

829
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:48.870
Diego, you know what good for you, San Diego. Fuck him.

830
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.990
You want a new stadium once you pack your bags up and get the fuck outta here.

831
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.990
But you guys also kind of fucked up the way Cleveland did.

832
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.440
You can't buy one team of stadium and then tell the other guys to go fuck

833
00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:00.570
themselves. That's like in Cleveland when they,

834
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.840
the Jake got built and then a,

835
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.430
whatever his fucking name was the fuck was that guy's name.

836
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.610
Everyone in Cleveland screaming at right now. Um,

837
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.900
who sounded exactly like a

838
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.320
George C. Scott? Exact same voice.

839
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.753
<v 8>Um,</v>

840
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.980
<v 1>yeah, he wanted to stay at him. They were like, yeah, fuck you.</v>

841
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.980
You can stay in that absolute fucking shit hole. And he and he left. See you.

842
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.920
It's not personal. She has business. Um,

843
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.460
why did I keep thinking good? Dell? I'm a patriots fan.

844
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:39.110
That's all they think when they think of a fucking asshole.

845
00:49:39.111 --> 00:49:43.070
I just think Roger Goodell. Um, yeah, that sucks man.

846
00:49:43.071 --> 00:49:45.830
So who should you vote for? You know what I do, I would say fuck the NFL.

847
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.830
If the Patriots ever left, I would just say fuck the NFL.

848
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.280
I'd be done with it and I would just pick a college team, um,

849
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:57.570
called football is to shit. Um, you know,

850
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.300
even though the athletes, college sports are great,

851
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:02.130
but the athletes get fucked over that they don't get paid.

852
00:50:02.131 --> 00:50:05.660
The fact that they sell at $100,000 stadium and then fucking idiots. Oh.

853
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.950
And it's always non athletic people who say this school,

854
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:11.040
they get a free education. I'll do they like,

855
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:15.030
they have time to fucking go to class. You major in, in football,

856
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.430
there's too much money at stake in, in all these,

857
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.940
in all the nerds that don't like the jocks at the college level.

858
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.520
It's like if it wasn't for that football program,

859
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.640
you'd be going to science class in a fucking tent. Um,

860
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.490
100,000 people are not going to show up to what you look through a microscope.

861
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:32.840
Don't ever forget that. All right?

862
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:36.110
So why don't you fucking put on your lab coat and go figure out how to make a

863
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:38.390
better football cleats? Oh, Jesus. Bill,

864
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.300
it was no reason to go that hard was there.

865
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:47.330
Can't we have respect for all of the arts? Uh, Meryl Streep doesn't,

866
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.710
she doesn't respect mixed martial arts. Hey Meryl,

867
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:56.110
why don't you tell us what the arts are? [inaudible] Jesus Christ.

868
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.490
Because there's not a symphony behind it. You never listened to it?

869
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:02.140
Watch NFL film. That's art. The music they put

870
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:05.410
<v 9>behind it. Why aren't [inaudible] wearing that? Wearing it, wearing it.</v>

871
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.933
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

872
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:14.900
<v 9>why that? Why not? Why not buy it? All right. Movie foods, videos.</v>

873
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:21.080
<v 1>MMM. Hey, the ability egg whites, uh, saw this guys videos on youtube.</v>

874
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:25.340
He makes food from different famous movies and Oh,

875
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.500
that's pretty cool. And this one,

876
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:31.370
he makes the big Kahuna Burger from pulp fiction, which is pretty basic,

877
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:34.160
but in others he does some cool ship shit from chef,

878
00:51:34.161 --> 00:51:35.960
one of my favorite movies of the last few years.

879
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.200
And at Acha the cartoon,

880
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.680
I highly recommend checking a few of them out.

881
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:45.890
He makes a couple of sandwiches that would give your grill top some great use.

882
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.730
Ah, too. That's awesome. Thank you. Look at that. No question.

883
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.290
Just great information. I guess I never tell you guys you can also do that.

884
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:56.600
That's fucking cool as hell. I will definitely check that out.

885
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.140
I have been a cooking up a fucking storm.

886
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.610
Um, you know, cause we can't really go anywhere.

887
00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:08.330
Every once in a while I'll take me out to the movies, which this weekend,

888
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:12.440
this past week I saw moonlight and I saw, uh,

889
00:52:12.441 --> 00:52:15.770
hidden figures and I really like both for different beat, hidden figures,

890
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:20.120
big Hollywood movie, you know, totally did the job was great.

891
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.660
Uh, and then I saw moonlight, which was also great.

892
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.750
And my favorite part of that fucking movie, No, I'm not ruin it.

893
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.900
No spoiler alert other unless you're into cars was,

894
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:37.040
which was annoying was there's this one part where this showing the main

895
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:39.110
character and then not showing his fucking car,

896
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:41.300
but you can tell it's a nice car.

897
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:45.620
I wanted to see the car and then they finally showed it. That was a,

898
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.580
I believe it was an 83 to 87 Oldsmobile cutlass.

899
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.030
And those were those great two doors that they had in the fucking eighties.

900
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:55.880
It was, you know, the, the Oldsmobile cutlass,

901
00:52:55.910 --> 00:53:00.140
the fucking Chevy Monte Carlo in the Buick Regal.

902
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.050
Those fucking cars are the shit.

903
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:05.990
And I know a lot of those southern guys redo them and they put the big tires on

904
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:09.410
them. I don't like the big tires on them, but that's another one. Um,

905
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.300
that's sort of the pot. Poor man's fucking Eldorado. But I loved those in, uh,

906
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.610
some of the funniest

907
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.500
guys I knew when I was growing up, had those fucking cars.

908
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:26.501
Just anybody who had a car like was a fucking was,

909
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:30.540
it was a good shit as they say in Massachusetts, you know,

910
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:34.110
and slash a little bit shady, probably dealing a little bit of weed.

911
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.600
Maybe you had a fight last night. Those are all those guys.

912
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.440
They go into a bar and within 10 minutes they eyeball and somebody and then they

913
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.870
got to take the chain off cause they're going to get, do a fight.

914
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:43.770
Remember that in the 80s,

915
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.140
don't take your fucking chain off with dog and tonight.

916
00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:48.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

917
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.640
<v 1>I think the change coming back, I think it's making a comeback. Um,</v>

918
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.270
anyways, really enjoyed both of those movies. Uh, moonlight. I really fucking,

919
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.590
that was a classic just independent movie where it was like a,

920
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.250
it didn't fucking lead you around to the by the nose. Like,

921
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.690
and here's the next one and here's the next point.

922
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.690
You then is the next plot point. Um, really good movie. Alright.

923
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:18.700
Uh, Putin, Russian hacking. All right.

924
00:54:18.701 --> 00:54:21.690
This guy's writing about Russian hacking and he start look, is that we started,

925
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:24.110
<v 2>okay.</v>

926
00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:25.850
<v 1>This guy started his fucking,</v>

927
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.590
he just started his fucking a his email to me with, look,

928
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:34.700
he's already wagging his finger at me. Jesus Christ. Dude, relax.

929
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.260
He says, look,

930
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.460
international politics between two countries with enough news to destroy the

931
00:54:40.461 --> 00:54:44.810
earth 10 times over is no laughing matter. Oh,

932
00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:46.330
am I not supposed to joke about it?

933
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.330
How come you aren't all over this orange clown?

934
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.150
<v 11>Okay,</v>

935
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.000
<v 1>all right. I don't want to stand with this. Do you want jokes about it? Sure.</v>

936
00:54:55.001 --> 00:54:56.530
Clinton was no prize.

937
00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:03.070
But you're willing to give Putin and an out now gangster a pass.

938
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.990
Well, I don't remember him running for president of the United States.

939
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.853
What are you talking about?

940
00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.290
What kind of world is going to be there for your new child? Oh,

941
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:17.640
shut the fuck up. Yeah. Gee,

942
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.310
I fucking hate when people will in your world is going to be there for your kid.

943
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.630
This same world that was there when I was a kid, progressively getting worse.

944
00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.730
Mike, what? What is your fucking solution? There's no solution to this shit.

945
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.440
You got 7 billion people.

946
00:55:33.441 --> 00:55:36.260
I'll run in and fucking 200 million different directions.

947
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:41.720
It's a shit show. All right. The second we weren't one tribe. It, it was over.

948
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.440
It's over second. There was two tribes.

949
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:49.580
It was fucking over whenever we started out. Right.

950
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.430
Let's just say they, I, I don't, I don't subscribe that there was a fucking,

951
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.540
and Adam and eve,

952
00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.160
I think there was a pond and there was a bunch of us that came out as something

953
00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.390
quarter that Neil degrasse Tyson. It was the fucking trees.

954
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.960
Other people say it was the fucking ocean. Whatever the fuck it was.

955
00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:09.760
There was a bunch of,

956
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.940
but you can't have a man and a woman bagging and then their kids fucking without

957
00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:16.610
having major problems. All right,

958
00:56:16.611 --> 00:56:18.150
well maybe that's why cavemen look like they should.

959
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:21.643
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

960
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.323
<v 1>I have. No,</v>

961
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.000
but whenever we all weren't sort of cohabitating together,

962
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:31.150
but you know what happened is then as we came along, there was no language.

963
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:35.320
It was just, oh no, that shit. Of course it was going to be fucking arguments.

964
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:39.640
Everybody grunting and groaning, you know, I have no idea.

965
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.240
Like we were fucked. This thing was fucked from day one. Okay.

966
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:48.690
And I've gone down the rabbit hole of trying to fucking give a shit and trying

967
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:50.350
to, you know,

968
00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:55.160
I don't get people to listen to my opinion,

969
00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.580
which probably has 0.1% of 1% of the information that I need to actually make an

970
00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:04.040
even remotely informed opinion. You know what I mean?

971
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.040
Look at all those guys on TV who do it for a fucking living from,

972
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:11.330
from Bill Maher to bill O'Reilly. Okay. Even those guys,

973
00:57:11.331 --> 00:57:15.860
as much as they pay attention are severely handicapped by the fact that they

974
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.440
cannot look at tox top secret documents

975
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.260
to kind of connect the dots. All you can do is watch the fucking news,

976
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:29.800
read newspapers and try to figure out which ones seems to be sort of making

977
00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:33.950
sense with what the fuck you're thinking. That's the best you can do, sir.

978
00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:37.220
So I don't know what you want for me, but I'll continue reading this. Um,

979
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.420
this isn't like telling jokes to a few middle millennials in a strip mall.

980
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:46.430
It's not funny that Trump and his swamp full of white racist,

981
00:57:46.431 --> 00:57:51.390
rich men are robbing us blind. Uh,

982
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.080
I agree with that.

983
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:58.480
But you realize that Hillary Clinton in 2008, after the banks went under,

984
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.890
uh, went and gave them a speech and said, don't worry, I got you guys.

985
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.460
Those aren't those the same rich, racist white people.

986
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.250
You know. Isn't that the same upper 1%, you know,

987
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.270
that you're talking about here? Uh, just saying they are, you know,

988
00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:18.380
by the way that the upper 1%, no matter who wins, they win. You understand that,

989
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:23.240
right? The job pays 500 grand a year. It takes 100 million to get. Okay.

990
00:58:23.241 --> 00:58:25.790
And then they owe these cons favors that got them in office.

991
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:29.480
They push it through, they deregulate stuff, they look the other way,

992
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.180
they granted government contracts, all of that shit.

993
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.150
And then once they're done being president, you'll watch with Obama,

994
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.330
he's going to make a fuck load of money going around. Air Quote,

995
00:58:38.331 --> 00:58:40.280
giving speeches, 200,

996
00:58:40.281 --> 00:58:43.370
300 grand a night to the exact same fucking people that put them in office.

997
00:58:43.371 --> 00:58:47.630
That's just them washing their bribe money. People with blue ties,

998
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:50.420
red ties, red panties, blue panties.

999
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:53.990
They all fucking do it except for Jimmy Carter. As far as I can tell,

1000
00:58:53.991 --> 00:58:57.050
he stopped being president and started going around building houses for poor

1001
00:58:57.051 --> 00:58:57.530
people.

1002
00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:01.840
Everybody else sits around waiting for their fucking library to be built. Oh,

1003
00:59:01.841 --> 00:59:04.560
my soapbox. Give me a golden globe. All right.

1004
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.480
Just saying they are both bad is really dropping the ball. No, it isn't.

1005
00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:13.820
You have your head in the fucking sand. That's what it is.

1006
00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:19.120
You just have your head in the fucking sand. Um,

1007
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.600
I'm from New Jersey and no,

1008
00:59:20.601 --> 00:59:25.601
several contractors who were shorted by Trump and couldn't afford to sue.

1009
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:26.811
Right.

1010
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:29.840
And I worked in Atlantic city and he had a couple of casinos go under and they

1011
00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:33.110
got paid dimes on the dollar. I know how that works. He's a real asshole.

1012
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:36.440
That doesn't give a shit about the little guy. He's got the track record. Okay.

1013
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:40.700
Okay. And you're saying Hillary Clinton gives a shit about the little guy,

1014
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:47.070
Hillary Clinton, who only swings by the little guy whenever she needs votes.

1015
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:51.150
It spends the rest of the time on fucking Martha's vineyard in her zillion

1016
00:59:51.151 --> 00:59:54.930
dollar fucking house that she can somehow afford when her husband is only made

1017
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.080
fucking at the most 500 grand a year.

1018
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.030
She got paid as a senator. What does that make? 175 grand a year?

1019
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.850
They're making less money than some of the fucking top comedians in the fucking

1020
01:00:08.851 --> 01:00:11.970
world. Yet there were $200 billion. How do you do that?

1021
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:16.080
How do you do that legally, sir, tell me.

1022
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:21.020
Tell me how you do that. Cause you fucking crooked.

1023
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.970
Alright, so there you go. And here's the thing about Russia spying on us.

1024
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.360
Fucking relax. We're doing it to them too.

1025
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.230
Jesus Christ. They've shot up planes out of the sky.

1026
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.420
A spine on a we spy on each other. Apps a fucking Lilly [inaudible].

1027
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1028
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.580
<v 1>You know, that's, that's what we do. Every fucking thing that they're doing,</v>

1029
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.180
we're doing. They fucking with elections. We fuck with the elections.

1030
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:48.890
They fucking with people in power,

1031
01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:51.590
putting people in power that shouldn't be in power. We do that.

1032
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:55.820
They invade countries. We invade countries. They think they're right.

1033
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:57.530
We think we're right. At the end of the day,

1034
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.300
there's you and me sitting in fucking Russia, regular fucking people.

1035
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:03.650
All right? That's it.

1036
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.370
It's just the people up top that gets you all fucking stirred up. You know,

1037
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.150
I'm telling you, they get y'all fucking steak gotta get ya.

1038
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.460
[inaudible] I don't listen to any of it. I don't.

1039
01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:21.620
I just sit and I drink scotch and I drink myself into a stupor and I stare at

1040
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:25.400
the wall, you know, and I try to figure out why.

1041
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:29.270
I looked at three non white kids looking at an iPhone and stuff that someone was

1042
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.090
getting beaten into a gang. When I solve that first,

1043
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.230
then I'm going to move on to trying to solve the world problems. When I fall,

1044
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.760
when I solve the problems in the fucking globe, that is my giant fucking head.

1045
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:42.590
I'll move onto that. And You sir,

1046
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.830
if you're really looking for somebody to solve the world problems,

1047
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:50.120
you should probably look beyond a comedian doing a podcast where he says count

1048
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:54.230
every other word and also says how uninformed he is. Okay.

1049
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.070
So you know that you'd go agree to disagree. But you know,

1050
01:01:58.071 --> 01:02:03.071
if you want Meryl Streep and fucking a fucking Billy freckled hands to solve the

1051
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:06.830
world's problems, I think you were in trouble. Anybody can give the lip service.

1052
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.170
It'd be like, I think that's absolutely deplorable of Blah a blah.

1053
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.810
I didn't vote for the fucking guy. Stop wagging your finger at me. All right.

1054
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:18.080
All right. Plants in the house. Hey, the Billy ficus.

1055
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:19.561
Uh,

1056
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:22.530
I want you to know how I want to know how you feel about having plants in the

1057
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:27.030
house. Uh, growing up we always had plants and CACTI in our house.

1058
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.810
I think they bring a lot of life and color to a room and it's fun to water and

1059
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:31.644
take care of them.

1060
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:35.280
I know some people who would never have any plants saying that they bring dirt

1061
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:38.310
and bugs in the house. I tell them that it's because they don't take care of,

1062
01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:39.144
maintain them.

1063
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.240
You could say the same thing about a dog saying they shouldn't bring fleas into

1064
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:45.600
the house, but obviously that student neglecting and taking care of the dog.

1065
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.640
So do you have any plants in your home? Do you have any and you're home now? Oh,

1066
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:51.900
do you like having plants in your home?

1067
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.260
Do you have any home plants in your home now? Um,

1068
01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:00.000
ps is a total NFL bandwagon fan. I'm calling Green Bay to win it all.

1069
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:05.650
Uh, all right. Um, no I don't like plants in the house.

1070
01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.210
Um,

1071
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:11.530
I had a plant in my house one time a long time ago when I was a complete loner

1072
01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:15.580
and I, my apartment looked like I was in the witness protection program.

1073
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.360
I was seeing this woman and she got me a plant and immediately I was just like,

1074
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.310
Whoa, way, this relationship is moving too fast.

1075
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.670
And what she was trying to do was to get me to open up.

1076
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.040
And I remember she got me this plant and uh,

1077
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:35.770
then I had to fucking water it and uh, I kinda liked it,

1078
01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:39.160
but then I'd go on the road and I would come back and it would be near death,

1079
01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.410
just like, you know, hang it down, you know, staring at his fucking toes.

1080
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.100
And then I would nurse it back to fucking health and I would have ended up

1081
01:03:48.101 --> 01:03:53.101
having anxiety and then one day it finally died and I felt this just ridiculous

1082
01:03:54.191 --> 01:03:56.530
failure. Um,

1083
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:57.920
<v 11>yeah.</v>

1084
01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.730
<v 1>And it was a metaphor for the whole fact. You're on the road so much,</v>

1085
01:04:00.731 --> 01:04:04.240
you can't sustain relationships. You can't even keep a plant alive.

1086
01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:06.250
How are you going to keep a relationship or a kill labs?

1087
01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.570
It was a horrible fucking experience. So, um,

1088
01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.340
I don't mind have it in my house if they are like growing like Bazell or fucking

1089
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.000
rosemary or some shit somebody can eat, you know,

1090
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.440
I'm selfish when it comes to plants.

1091
01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:18.820
Like we've got a bunch of plants around the house.

1092
01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.260
I don't give a fuck about them. I'm like, yeah,

1093
01:04:20.261 --> 01:04:24.190
why don't we dig these up and put in some fucking avocado trees, some oranges,

1094
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.730
you know, something that we can eat slash throw it Zombie someday.

1095
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.653
What do you say?

1096
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:34.870
Plus having trees that grow fruit in your yard is a great way to figure out

1097
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.730
who's your friend and who isn't your friend.

1098
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.850
Especially during the apocalypse when people come over your fence and try to

1099
01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:41.684
steal your food,

1100
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:45.680
they'll go to the food like moths to a light and then you can be on your roof

1101
01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.310
and you can pick them off with your fucking,

1102
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.700
with whatever fucking weapon you have. Right? I'd go with the bow and arrow.

1103
01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.910
It's nice and quiet. Right to the neck

1104
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.910
was the one that was the water. I mean the blood gushing out of their fucking,

1105
01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.870
what the fuck? Whatever you call it. The fucking artery there. All right.

1106
01:05:05.871 --> 01:05:07.940
Plants in the house already read that one. Here's the last one.

1107
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.390
Hey Billy Bitch tits. Jesus.

1108
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.170
I'm a lady and I listen to your podcast religiously.

1109
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.210
I'm 29 years old and I've had since I moved out of my parents' house when I was

1110
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:21.750
18 I have a history of anxiety and depression.

1111
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:25.090
I found that in addition to taking medicine,

1112
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.150
living with people really keeps me in check. Uh,

1113
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:31.450
in two weeks I'm going to be moving into my own apartment and living by myself

1114
01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:35.260
with my dog. Oh, it's fucking awesome. That's the best.

1115
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.850
I love living alone by the dog too. That would've been tremendous. Of course,

1116
01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.160
it would have died like the fucking plant. Uh, right now I live with two guys.

1117
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:44.260
The three of us are super close,

1118
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:47.380
but we've lived together for three years and it's time for us to move out of the

1119
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:49.090
frat house and into our own places.

1120
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:52.510
I'm nervous about living by myself because I'm scared that I'm going to isolate

1121
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:55.810
myself and fall back into a cycle of depression again. I live in Indy,

1122
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:59.800
so the weather is shit right now, which doesn't help in the spring and summer.

1123
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:02.290
I play intramural sports, football and volleyball.

1124
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.280
I'm very much a guy's girl and I don't have very many girlfriends.

1125
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:08.380
I don't ever have a ladies night.

1126
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.160
I'd rather sit at a bar with a beer and watch football or college basketball.

1127
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:17.290
I hate dating. I am straight though. The gay people hate dating.

1128
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:18.070
I don't know.

1129
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:22.840
I would love to get your advice for a lady like me moving in her own apartment

1130
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:23.980
for the very first time.

1131
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.630
What would you suggest I do to stay social and not sit at home alone?

1132
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:33.490
Watching the Indiana Hoosiers and downing cores light a PS.

1133
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.950
Tell me I said hi and best of luck to you and me on the new year. New Baby.

1134
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:40.630
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, oh boy. You're asking a fucking loner.

1135
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.910
I love when I finally didn't have to have roommates and I lived alone.

1136
01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.050
I fucking loved it. I loved it. I talked to myself,

1137
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:53.400
I talked to the TV. I had a great fucking time. Um,

1138
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.420
and I guess I was,

1139
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:59.980
I had a level of depression there that I wasn't really aware of. Um,

1140
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:04.300
well, don't you get enough sort of interaction with the springtime?

1141
01:07:04.301 --> 01:07:07.240
You play intramural sports, football, volleyball. Okay. So it's the wintertime.

1142
01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.090
Um, I don't know. You want to go sledding?

1143
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:12.040
I'm trying to think what the fuck he can do.

1144
01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.400
Is there a adult league snowball fight thing you can get involved in?

1145
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.860
There's gotta be something that you could do if you're into sports.

1146
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:20.770
Why don't you just join a fantasy league with some of your friends?

1147
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.303
<v 8>Um,</v>

1148
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.260
<v 1>but I, I think what you are is,</v>

1149
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:28.810
I think you're a sweetheart and you're a relationship person.

1150
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.830
You're just afraid to do it. So, uh,

1151
01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:37.330
that's why you like having roommates. You don't like being alone.

1152
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.420
I'm totally guessing here, by the way. I don't fucking know you, but I, I think,

1153
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:44.470
uh, I think it's time to give Dayton a try. You know,

1154
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.280
I would do that. Maybe you're afraid of doing that. I would.

1155
01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.290
I think this seems like you need to face a fear and look at this living alone as

1156
01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:57.760
an opportunity thing and that this is the next logical step to find in the

1157
01:07:57.761 --> 01:08:00.910
person you want to be with in life, if that's what you're looking for.

1158
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.220
So I would, um, embrace living alone and I'll fucking awesome that is.

1159
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:11.320
And uh, decorate your apartment. Don't do what I did, you know,

1160
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.770
have some color in their hair and all that type of shit. Something upbeat.

1161
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:18.523
Um,

1162
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:19.603
<v 4>okay.</v>

1163
01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:22.690
<v 1>And, uh, I would become social.</v>

1164
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.230
I would have people over to your place if, I don't know if you cook,

1165
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.760
this is zillion things you could do. You just have to make the effort. Um,

1166
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:33.470
I don't know why you don't have many girlfriends,

1167
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:35.570
but it sounds like you do have some girlfriends,

1168
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:37.280
so you only need a couple of friends.

1169
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:41.360
I would open up to your friends rather than some psycho on a podcast.

1170
01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:44.420
Not saying this was a bad move, but it's a nice step. I would open up to them,

1171
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:45.950
just say, listen, I'm prone to depression.

1172
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:49.250
So I'm worried that when I live alone that I'm going to become depressed.

1173
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.590
You know, if you'd like to swing by and watch a game with me, blah, blah, blah,

1174
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:55.670
blah, blah, I would do that.

1175
01:08:55.671 --> 01:08:59.480
I would be open and honest and maybe go talk to somebody about your depression.

1176
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:02.480
Um, so you don't go down that fucking rabbit hole,

1177
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:05.210
but it's great that you know that you're depressed and that you need to do

1178
01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:08.090
something about it so that you're way ahead of the game as opposed to where I

1179
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:11.570
was, where I didn't know I was depressed and I fucking a

1180
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:13.050
<v 4>wow.</v>

1181
01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:17.040
<v 1>I don't know. It made a lot of stupid fucking moves for a long time. All right.</v>

1182
01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:22.040
That's the podcast for this week. Uh, thank you so much for listening and, uh,

1183
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:25.590
I'll post that video of that Cadillac. Eldorado it's fucking beautiful.

1184
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.410
All right. Go fuck yourselves and I'll talk to you on Thursday.
