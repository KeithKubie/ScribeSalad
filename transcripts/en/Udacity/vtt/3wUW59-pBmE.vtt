00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.860
In this lesson we'll be talking about network measurement, or how to see what

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.230
traffic is being sent on the network.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.563
There are two types of network measurement. One

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:14.140
is passive measurement. In passive measurement we

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.020
collect packets, flow statistics, and so forth of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.600
traffic that is already being sent on

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.915
the network. So, this might include packet traces,

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:28.560
flow statistics, or application level logs.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.080
In active measurement, we inject additional traffic

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.700
into the network to measure various characteristics

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.720
of the network. So we've seen some

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.140
examples of active measurement already, such

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.790
as in the previous lessons, where we

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.010
actively sent traffic on the network to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.980
measure speeds of downloads. Other common active

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.380
measurement tools include those such as ping, and traceroute. Ping

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.202
is often used to measure the delay to a particular server.

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.640
And traceroute is often used to measure the network level,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080
or the IP level path between two hosts on the network.
