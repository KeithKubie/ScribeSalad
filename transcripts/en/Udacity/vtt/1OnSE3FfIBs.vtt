00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.570
The G1510A guanine to adenine mutation, which

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.689
causes a glutamate to lysine change in

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.540
amino acid, which drastically reduces the activity

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.320
of the ALDH2 enzyme, catalyzing this second

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.390
step. Because the ALDH2 enzyme is less

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.350
active, it becomes saturated much sooner than

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.870
normal, and there's a build up of

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.400
acetaldehyde. And the exhibition of symptoms of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
alcohol flush reaction. Based on the nature of the phenotype caused by

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
this mutation, do you think that it would be dominant or recessive?
