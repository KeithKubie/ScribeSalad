Wonderlic people they're a commercial

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490
Wonderlic people they're a commercial
 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.700
Wonderlic people they're a commercial
company that makes general cognitive

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
company that makes general cognitive
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.919
company that makes general cognitive
ability tests and it's often used by

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
ability tests and it's often used by
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.660
ability tests and it's often used by
corporations even though it's actually

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
corporations even though it's actually
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.450
corporations even though it's actually
illegal it's actually illegal to use IQ

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
illegal it's actually illegal to use IQ
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.560
illegal it's actually illegal to use IQ
tests but the Wonderlic doesn't promote

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
tests but the Wonderlic doesn't promote
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359
tests but the Wonderlic doesn't promote
themselves as testing IQ I think they

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
themselves as testing IQ I think they
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.099
themselves as testing IQ I think they
think it's general cognitive ability

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
think it's general cognitive ability
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.710
think it's general cognitive ability
which is the same thing but whatever the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
which is the same thing but whatever the
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.259
which is the same thing but whatever the
SAT is the GREs the LSAT all of those

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
SAT is the GREs the LSAT all of those
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.439
SAT is the GREs the LSAT all of those
are IQ tests so now they're more

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
are IQ tests so now they're more
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.269
are IQ tests so now they're more
crystallized than fluid we'll get to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
crystallized than fluid we'll get to
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.740
crystallized than fluid we'll get to
that in a minute but crystallized

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
that in a minute but crystallized
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299
that in a minute but crystallized
knowledge is what you accrue across time

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
knowledge is what you accrue across time
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520
knowledge is what you accrue across time
so you could say that fluid intelligence

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
so you could say that fluid intelligence
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.130
so you could say that fluid intelligence
is what programs your brain it fills it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
is what programs your brain it fills it
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600
is what programs your brain it fills it
with facts let's say it filled it with

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
with facts let's say it filled it with
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790
with facts let's say it filled it with
knowledge and then but you can get an

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
knowledge and then but you can get an
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.110
knowledge and then but you can get an
estimate of your intelligence by

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
estimate of your intelligence by
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.209
estimate of your intelligence by
sampling your domain of factual

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
sampling your domain of factual
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279
sampling your domain of factual
knowledge and the reason for that is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
knowledge and the reason for that is
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350
knowledge and the reason for that is
that well obviously the better the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
that well obviously the better the
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600
that well obviously the better the
programmer the better the content and so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
programmer the better the content and so
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790
programmer the better the content and so
what that also means is that you can you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
what that also means is that you can you
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950
what that also means is that you can you
could if you were did prefrontal cortex

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
could if you were did prefrontal cortex
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.130
could if you were did prefrontal cortex
was damaged later in life your fluid IQ

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
was damaged later in life your fluid IQ
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779
was damaged later in life your fluid IQ
could plummet but your crystallized IQ

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
could plummet but your crystallized IQ
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939
could plummet but your crystallized IQ
remain more or less intact so even

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
remain more or less intact so even
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.910
remain more or less intact so even
though they're not different one

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

produces the other and then once the
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.440
produces the other and then once the
producer has produced then the producer

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
producer has produced then the producer
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910
producer has produced then the producer
can disappear and you still got the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
can disappear and you still got the
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.850
can disappear and you still got the
encoded knowledge so I'd love that at

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
encoded knowledge so I'd love that at
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460
encoded knowledge so I'd love that at
least that's how it looks to me so okay

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
least that's how it looks to me so okay
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380
least that's how it looks to me so okay
so how smart do you have to be to be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
so how smart do you have to be to be
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.140
so how smart do you have to be to be
different things in life well if you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
different things in life well if you
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609
were haven't I give a 116 to 130 which
is 85th percentile and above so it's one

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
is 85th percentile and above so it's one
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.609
is 85th percentile and above so it's one

not the high end for IQ by the way you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
not the high end for IQ by the way you
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780
not the high end for IQ by the way you
know that it can go up well I can go up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
know that it can go up well I can go up

indefinitely although there's fewer and
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.920
indefinitely although there's fewer and
fewer people as it goes up so if you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
fewer people as it goes up so if you
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.929
fewer people as it goes up so if you
want to be the best at what you're doing

160 in some situations and maybe that's
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.370
160 in some situations and maybe that's
making you one person in 10,000

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389
and that's wrong so they're both wrong
 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.779
and that's wrong so they're both wrong
and they're seriously wrong and the fact

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789
and they're seriously wrong and the fact
 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.279
and they're seriously wrong and the fact
that neither side of the political

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289
that neither side of the political
 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.920

look at this problem means that we're

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729
look at this problem means that we're
 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.610
look at this problem means that we're
going to increasingly have a structural

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620
going to increasingly have a structural
 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.379
going to increasingly have a structural
problem in our societies because we're

you know lawyers are disappearing like
mad and the reason for that is you can

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770
mad and the reason for that is you can
 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.679
mad and the reason for that is you can
look it up online increasingly you can

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:36.689
look it up online increasingly you can
 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:38.659

so like the working class people are

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:41.129
so like the working class people are
 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:42.559
so like the working class people are
being wiped out pretty nicely over the

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:42.569
being wiped out pretty nicely over the
 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:45.049
being wiped out pretty nicely over the
last 30 years by by automation and

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:45.059
last 30 years by by automation and
 

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.269
last 30 years by by automation and
various other things it's the low end of

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:47.279
various other things it's the low end of
 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.860
various other things it's the low end of
the white collar class that's coming up

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:48.870
the white collar class that's coming up
 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.809
the white collar class that's coming up
next so I'm not saying that lower

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819

lawyers are in the low end of the white
color class so there's still going to be

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:57.149
color class so there's still going to be
 

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:58.790
color class so there's still going to be
plenty of positions for people who are

in ten minutes and never make a mistake
again and it's like tens of hours with

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.070
again and it's like tens of hours with
 

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.690
again and it's like tens of hours with
bare minimum mastery of the tasks so

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700
bare minimum mastery of the tasks so
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.400
bare minimum mastery of the tasks so
that's ugly situation no doubt about it
