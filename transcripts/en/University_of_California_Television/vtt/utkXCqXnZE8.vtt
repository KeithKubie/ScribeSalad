00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
(lively Music)

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.110
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.740
of International Studies.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.490
Our guest today is Laura D'Andrea Tyson,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.620
who is the class of 1939.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.330
Professor of Economics and
Business at UC Berkeley.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.930
In the first Clinton administration,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.340
she served as National
Economic Council chair

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.300
and as chairperson of the
Council of Economic Advisors.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.710
Before going to Washington Professor Tyson

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.280
served as director of the
Institute of International Studies

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.690
and was a founding director
of the Berkeley Roundtable

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.320
on the International Economy.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.340
Her publications include
Who's Bashing Whom,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.343
Trade Conflict in High
Technology Industries.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.860
Laura, welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.023
- Thank you very much.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.110
- How did your growing up years

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.100
prepare you for the road
toward public service.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.820
I got to ask you that.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.990
- My growing up here years?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.823
- Yes.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.340
- Well, I think the main
thing for me was somewhere

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.700
I suppose between high school and college

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.870
or certainly in college.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.010
I really was thinking about public policy.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.320
So those were the kinds of
issues that interested me

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.300
and it never interested
me to run for office.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.260
I wanna emphasize, that's not what I mean.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.630
I didn't ever even run
for a school office.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.560
But it did interest me to
try to figure out a way

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.400
to address some national
issues like poverty

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.650
or international trade or whatever.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.050
And that was true from pretty early on.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.050
- And I gather, you were
good at math basically

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.350
that was one of the skills,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.183
yeah.
- I was.

00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:09.270
Yes I was good at math.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.120
But at a certain point I wanted
to find a way to use math

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.030
to link it to these public policy concerns

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.410
rather than math for its own sake.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.620
- In the accounts of your
service in Washington,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.707
I'm gonna flatter you,
now you're described as,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.517
"Standing your ground and
policy debates, a great educator

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:31.837
"or politicians and the public
and a person who doesn't

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:33.727
"take things personally."

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.600
Without making you blush
and if you will accept

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.310
those compliments, how
are those skills honed?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.430
Basically what do you think?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.530
- Well, you know I had an ideal job

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.510
for an academic in Washington.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.910
My job really was to give economic advice.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.340
I didn't run any programs,
and I wasn't after any office.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.550
So the only thing I had
to offer was my advice

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.000
and I took that very seriously.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.440
I thought that when I went into a room,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.140
if I didn't say what I thought
or what my profession thought

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.930
about an issue, that I wasn't doing my job

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.023
even if what I said was not politically,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.480
easy for the listeners to accept.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180
- So this gave you a focus?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.060
- It gave me a definition, a
job definition and a focus.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.527
And I said to myself many times,

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:34.610
"If I don't give this advice
then I'm not doing my job."

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.727
I also said, "If I'm not
credible, if I go out

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.337
"and speak publicly but I speak in a way

00:03:40.337 --> 00:03:43.647
"which is not believable then
I will be of much less value

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:44.770
"to the administration."

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.650
So that allowed me to hold
my ground in terms of saying

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.823
what I thought rather than
what someone told me to say.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.740
- And why did you go into economics?

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.900
- Well, I could always get
back to the math question.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.420
I was looking for a way to
take my interest in mathematics

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.040
and my interest in sort of
analytical ways of thinking

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.390
about the world and apply
them in a public policy arena.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.400
And when I took an economics class

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.140
in sophomore year of college,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.950
I realized almost instantly that

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.100
this was the right connection.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.590
It's a very analytical way of
thinking, logic, scientific.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.310
You can use a fair amount
of math in it if you want

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.330
but it was all about the kinds of issues

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.690
that in my sort of private life,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.793
I worried a lot about or read a lot about.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.540
- And you went to MIT?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.500
- Yes I did.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.360
- Were there a lot of women
going into economics at MIT

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.810
when you were there or were
they just starting to be more?

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.910
- There were many, there
were many fewer than today.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.940
I think in the class of about nearly 30,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.840
there were four women who started,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.700
one who dropped out very quickly.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.534
So for three of us finished
and actually the three of us

00:04:57.534 --> 00:05:01.163
are full-fledged practicing economists.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.070
What was different about MIT,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.130
I had gone to a woman's
college, Smith College

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.450
and of course there was no such
thing as a male discipline.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.150
All disciplines were by
definition female disciplines.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.270
When I got to MIT, I
was old enough I guess

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.530
that it didn't bother me
too much that my class

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.423
was primarily all of a sudden men.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.160
The issue really was that
MIT was a much more abstract

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.110
and theoretical approach to economics

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.300
than Smith College had been.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.160
So I had to make a kind of transition

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.490
to a different kind of economics.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.590
Now many graduates, many
students in economics

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.980
have to make that transition.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.890
Undergraduate, the way you teach
undergraduates in economics

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.090
and the way you teach graduate
school is quite different.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.660
- And who did you study under at MIT?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.560
- Well, I studied under a
very, a great group of people,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.340
a professor named Evsey
Domar who actually was expert

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.040
on the Soviet Union, at the time called

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.760
the Soviet Union of course.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.680
I was very interested in
comparative economics,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.340
how other societies handle
the same economic problems

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.110
as the United States.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.560
He became a great mentor
and supporter of mine.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.903
I worked with a young faculty member,

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:17.730
very new to the field named Duncan Foley

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.260
who is still in the
field and was excellent,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.900
in terms of again his wife
was getting a PhD at Harvard

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.250
and he was very supportive
of women in PhD programs.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.500
And then some of the
big names in the field,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.773
in addition I worked with
Bob Solow and Les Thurow.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.720
- And when did you get
into political economy?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.220
Which I guess even in your early work

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.440
is something you--
- I think I was always

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.470
in political economy.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.650
I always thought when I
went to graduate school

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.980
that I was going to
study economics to apply

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.600
to policy political problems.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.790
In fact when I went to
graduate school in economics,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.480
I thought very seriously
about going to public policy

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.520
instead, almost did, almost went

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.800
to get a public policy degree instead.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.530
And when I was at graduate
school, my intention really

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.730
was to work for an organization
like the World Bank

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.000
or the International Monetary Fund.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.230
So my goal was always to use
economics as a discipline

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.320
to address certain policy challenges.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.230
- One of the skills that
you developed somewhere here

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.980
and I wanna ask you about that,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.280
is a capacity to communicate clearly

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.840
about what are often very
dense and complicated issues

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.740
especially writing about them.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.820
We'll talk about some of
your recent Op-Ed pieces.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.740
But where did you learn that?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.090
How was that skill honed?

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.022
- Well I do believe that you
can learn things by practice.

00:07:48.022 --> 00:07:53.022
And I first learned how to
be clear about economics

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.280
through teaching.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.970
Now I think one thing
that helped me frankly

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.250
was that economics was not
an easy discipline for me.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.070
It was a challenging discipline.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:08.070
It was something that I had
to think about seriously

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.070
and convince myself that
I could follow the logic.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.060
So because of that, because in some sense

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.000
it wasn't intuitive for me,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.620
I have been I guess quite likely

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.360
when I sit down with someone
to do it step by step

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.020
because that's how I understand it.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.960
And I hone those skills
by just doing classes,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.920
class after class.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.763
You know I started teaching in 1973,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.300
and I got better.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.770
Now as far as writing is
concerned, that also is something

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.390
which comes with practice.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.330
I don't think I'm a sort of,
it's not easy for me to write.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.310
Some people can sit down

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.840
and just sort of polish something off.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.020
I tend to write so that the
first version is very close

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.220
to the last version.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.250
And so I agonize over,
particularly over introductions,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.323
first paragraphs.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.060
But again I worked for a while,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.930
I served on the board of
editors of the Los Angeles Times

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.190
and therefore I was writing
about every six weeks

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.380
and I just got better.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.070
I also frankly learned some
pointers from my husband

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.230
who is a professional writer.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.960
And when I started doing
Op-Ed pieces for the LA Times,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.630
he was very helpful to me,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.590
in terms of thinking about structure

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.590
and grabbing introductory
sentences, things like that.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.550
- Do you also have models
in great economists

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.233
who also were great writers?

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.540
- Well, I think there have
been some very gifted writers

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.180
among my profession.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.840
They tend to be rare,
and they're very gifted.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.550
I would not compare myself to them.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.270
If you take John Maynard
Keynes and you go back

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.360
and read some of his work,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.260
I just quoted something
of his in an Op-Ed piece

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.640
I'm working on about the
Asian financial crisis.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.210
And it's a beautiful quote.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.210
And John Kenneth Galbraith
is a modern version

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.640
in the sense of being someone
who really has the ability

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.710
to write literature, who's
also writing economics.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.823
I aspire two I think clarity.

00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:05.680
(laughs)

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.570
- Right.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.470
Okay, was it hard
starting out in economics

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.470
once you have your degree
because you were a woman?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.040
Was there any discrimination, latent

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.513
or not latent that you encountered?

00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:27.060
- Well, I actually think in my own life

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.260
because of timing that I was helped

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.700
by being a woman on balance.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.260
It's different, it is
different but clearly for me

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.850
I came into the graduate program
and entered the job market

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.720
for economists at a time when
there was increasing attention

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.330
being paid to the issue of getting women

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.500
into the profession.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.377
So I think that clearly my first job,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.080
when I, even going back to MIT,
when I was admitted to MIT,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.460
I was the first student who
had ever been admitted MIT

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.410
from Smith College.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.070
I think MIT thought they were
basically taking a chance.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.130
They were gonna see if a very good student

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.990
from Smith College a
summa cum laude student

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.250
from Smith College could
make it in that program.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.660
And they, so I feel in
several points in my life

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.610
being a woman has been helpful to me

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.757
in terms of attracting
someone's attention,

00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:25.530
"Okay we could take a chance."

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.270
Now with that of course
you then have to make

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.190
the most of the chance.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.680
You have to show people,
yes, you can do it.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.680
And so that really is,
I feel quite comfortable

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.310
with the view even with President Clinton.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.790
That when I met him, I was
of interest to him in part

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.440
because he'd really wanted
to have a diverse cabinet

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.710
but frankly I ended working well for him

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.880
not because I was a woman
but because of my abilities

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.230
to deal with economic issues.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.350
Are there downsides to being a woman?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.920
You know it's just different,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.430
I mean I would say just as an example,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.220
we used to have White House
meetings at 7:30 in the morning.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.620
And the way Leon Panetta ran the meetings,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.620
they tended to oftentimes be
a kind of people jumping in.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.150
In general, women are
less adept or less willing

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.070
to just jump into conversations.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.530
I think they're more likely to do better

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.140
in structured conversations.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.440
So that's an example of a negative.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.350
I think that it's still the case today

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.150
that if you sort of look at the press

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.200
and look at how many times women

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.250
are quoted versus men, things like that.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.270
That there is a tendency still
to perceive power and wisdom

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.410
more with men than women.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.890
But on balance, I think it's
been a positive in my life.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.400
- So but in a way you're saying
that even an administration

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.420
like the Clinton administration
which was very committed

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.210
to filling roles with
women that there still

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.010
are structural problems,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.200
and once they're cemented,
then you're judged

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.585
on your merit basically,
is that a fair, yes?

00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:11.893
- Well, it's that I would
say structural as well as

00:13:11.893 --> 00:13:13.647
they're almost behavioral issues

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:14.930
- Behavioral, okay yeah.
- I mean

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.220
men and women I do
believe behave differently

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.810
in some respects.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.620
And there are these interesting books by

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:26.382
- Tenha.

00:13:26.382 --> 00:13:29.230
- Yes, right on sort of how women and men

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.090
handle conversation differently

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.980
and handle words differently and meeting.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.050
She actually has some very
interesting discussions

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.620
of meetings which I
think captured very much

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.660
the kind of difference
that I mentioned before.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.660
- Substantively when you started out,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.950
you really were working
on the Yugoslavia economy

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.190
and issues related to the changes

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.210
in Eastern European economy

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.310
In planned economies
- In planned economies.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.530
- But by the time you went to Washington

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.890
you were really working on
issues of competitiveness,

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.830
Industrial Policy, comparative
but also very much focused

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.610
on the United States.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.700
Tell us a little about that
- How did that happen?

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.330
- Transition, yeah.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.290
Were you still committed to
the same subjects in a way

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.373
but you wound up just moving
to a different subject?

00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:17.540
- Well, I was always interested
in international issues.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.060
So much of the work I
did on Eastern Europe

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.950
was about its trade,
about foreign investment,

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.650
about its relationships with

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.210
the International Monetary Fund,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.540
about how it responded to its
international debt crisis.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.890
So there was always an
international component.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.390
The second thing is that I was interested

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.100
in sort of big national comparisons

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.220
like how do countries compare on savings

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.910
and investment rates or
how they handle inflation

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.360
or how they try to
generate an economic system

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.920
which supports low levels of unemployment.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.420
So you can ask these kinds
of questions in any setting.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.810
You can ask them in a planned economy,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.590
how do they do that, and you can ask it

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.020
in a in England or France.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.080
So I started to teach more
broadly on comparative.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.400
These broad comparative issues

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.390
and I started to move out of just talking

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.170
about Soviet Union in Central Europe

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.960
to talking about Western
Europe and then to Asia.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.450
And I started doing some joint teaching

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.030
with colleague of mine
that you know John Zysman

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.410
who I had known in graduate school

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.630
He and I had been at MIT.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.910
He was in political
science, I was in economics.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.650
We started to team teach or
teach one another's classes.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.600
He was very interested in Western Europe

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.090
and that got me interested
and thinking about

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.010
these kinds of competitive comparisons

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.230
among advanced industrial countries.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.620
And frankly back when
I made this transition

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.493
which was really in the early 1980s.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.560
It was still almost a decade
before anything really started

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.980
to happen in Central Europe

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.540
and I was getting a little bored.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.760
I mean I understood the problems,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.740
I think people didn't
understand the problems

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.710
and basically they're in terms
of solving economic problems,

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.930
there was a just a
tremendous political barrier

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.340
to making any forward steps.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.240
So it was also lack of interest
in what I have been doing.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.160
- How did you wind up in Washington?

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.420
- Well, that really involves I think

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.040
the phenomenon of networks
in the United States

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.480
or in any society.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.300
First of all, I think that
my choice of graduate school

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.400
was very important to
everything that happened

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.520
to me thereafter.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.460
MIT is a wonderful,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.290
it has an outstanding reputation
in the field of economics.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.910
Its students are very well
placed at the best institutions

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.200
around the country.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.730
So I first had a job at Princeton,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.180
then I had a job at Berkeley.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.540
I started to develop my reputation

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.950
for being both an effective teacher

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.500
and for asking interesting questions.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.140
That led to my being invited
at a certain point to teach

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.090
for a year at MIT and
then to teach for a year

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.870
at the Harvard Business School.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.160
And at the Harvard Business
School, I got to know Bob Bryce

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.090
who became Secretary of Labor,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.470
was a very close friend of the Clintons

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.870
and it was really that
network which led me

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.970
to being introduced to the president

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.080
when he was a candidate.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.170
And from there on, I mean,
it really took on the issue

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.840
of what kind of cabinet did he want,

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.740
what kind of economic advice did he want,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.390
who did he feel comfortable with.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.210
- How would you
characterize the differences

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.210
between the realm of
politics and public service,

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.890
and the realm of academic life?

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.297
I mean here you were a
professor at Berkeley

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:47.740
and all that conjures up and
then for the next four years,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.263
you're in the middle at
the very top in Washington.

00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:54.800
What was the difference here?

00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:58.320
- Well, my husband claims and
I guess I would agree with him

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.710
that my ability to get
through in Washington,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.160
my ability to do well in
Washington was not predict,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.490
was not really predictable.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.630
I mean I really didn't have
any experience or history

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.690
which would have suggested I
would go into this environment

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.150
of sort of political figures

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:23.150
and convince them that I
had reason to be in the room

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.183
or convince them that I had
reason to be at the table.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.150
I think that, again I would
go back to the special nature

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.150
of my assignments there.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.800
I felt that what I did in the university

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.120
which was to explain economics,
to explain trade-offs,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.400
to try to, I never try in my teaching

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.670
to tell people the right thing to do.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.440
I try to help people develop the logic

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.840
to make that decision on their own.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.040
So a lot of what I try
to do in the classroom

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.380
or what I tried to do increasingly

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.826
I did some consulting
before I went to Washington.

00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:05.220
And when I tried to do with
business leaders was to explain

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.110
the economic trade-offs and help them

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.340
think through a decision.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.760
And I just did the same
thing in Washington.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.760
And the I guess the other
thing that was true is that

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.980
I did believe

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.610
and somehow this may be
about who I am as a person.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.140
I certainly believed in what we were doing

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.520
and because I believed
in what we were doing,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.570
I was very energetic
and able to defend it,

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.730
to explain it, to try to convince people

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.180
that we were doing the right thing.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.890
- Now, in the profiles I read of you,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.340
one of the things that stood out

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.240
from your early years was
cheerleading and numbers.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.800
- Cheerleading in numbers.
- And what you just said

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.700
may say that you developed

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.070
some skills back there.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.540
And I mean both in a positive way.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.310
- Right, I understand.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.233
Well, on the cheerleading
thing, I will only say one thing

00:19:57.233 --> 00:20:01.310
that I will never forget,
it's a very interesting fact.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.170
When I was just finished
with graduate school,

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.850
the National Science
Foundation had a conference

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.140
and they invited women who had gotten PhDs

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.070
in "Scientific" fields

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.550
from the previous five to seven years

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.300
to come to Washington and
talk about their experience.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.040
What made them get a PhD in a scientific

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.180
therefore a male-dominated field.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.770
And these women did not
have that much in common

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.870
but I want to tell you that the majority,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.220
the vast majority of them
had been cheerleaders.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.440
Now what does that tell you?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.240
I think it tells you that
when these women had grown up,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.420
it was still prior to
competitive sports for women.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.810
There were no teams for
women, there was none.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.150
So what women did who sort
of wanted to be competitive,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.530
wanted to be sort of out
there and sort of involved

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.150
with the school and
sort of part of the team

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.607
was cheerleading

00:20:55.607 --> 00:20:56.470
(Laura laughs)

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.330
So it may say something
about my competitive nature,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.440
it may say something
about my outgoing nature,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.460
it may say something about my ability

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.500
to associate with a team.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.223
I was considered a team
player in Washington.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.283
And the numbers well I don't know you know

00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:14.700
that's just something that
I don't quite understand.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.090
I always enjoyed math but not
so much that I was willing

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.760
to basically commit my entire life to it.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.730
- But we've just disapproved
your husband in a way.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.403
There were things in your
background that you know,

00:21:27.643 --> 00:21:28.583
that's right.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.800
In Washington, you earned a reputation

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.660
as a communicator and an analyst.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.720
And one of the things you were
quoted as saying in a profile

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.897
that I read is that, "What you
do best is present the facts

00:21:42.897 --> 00:21:45.710
"and odds with public perception."

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.600
That you felt very
comfortable in that role.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.720
Let's talk about your
reactions and your experiences

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.850
in confronting the irrational
symbolic side of politics

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.970
where people really don't
want to look at the evidence,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.820
they don't want to look at the facts.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.950
- Well, I think that I had different roles

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:11.990
in the administration.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.310
I did a lot of representing
the administration

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.670
with national media.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.000
And the print media and
the television media.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.470
And there I felt that
as I mentioned before,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.940
the key thing was
credibility and therefore

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.940
that if I presented the facts
and tried to present them

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.120
in a clear and unbiased way

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.920
and tried to defend my
presentation when upon,

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.930
that that's what people wanted to hear.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.423
They didn't want to have
me posturing or basically,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.280
and you know, at one point
I went to a conference

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.300
as an administration official in Aspen

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.840
and it was a big conference,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.290
primarily of very high
ranking Republicans.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.670
And the speaker before me was Senator Dole

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.003
and I was the only Clinton
administration official

00:23:09.003 --> 00:23:12.070
who was there and it was
not a supportive audience,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.830
it was quite a hostile audience.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.560
But I actually won over
a lot of the audience,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.580
not that I convinced them
to change their positions

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.530
but they believed that I was honestly

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.337
trying to explain the
situation, how I understood it,

00:23:26.337 --> 00:23:28.460
why we were doing what we were doing.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.280
And frankly, the other
thing you need to do

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.360
as a professional economist
is recognize all the time

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.280
the limitations on our
knowledge, nothing is perfect.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.113
So you say,

00:23:38.113 --> 00:23:42.927
"Well we think this kind of tax increase."

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.187
that's always been the big
issue with Republicans,

00:23:46.187 --> 00:23:48.807
"While it was not our goal to come in

00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:51.257
"and raise taxes on the
top one and a half percent

00:23:51.257 --> 00:23:53.217
"of the American population,

00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:55.767
"we felt that given all of the economic

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:58.007
"and political constraints
that we confronted,

00:23:58.007 --> 00:24:02.237
"the only way to get this
deficit reduction path in place

00:24:02.237 --> 00:24:04.910
"was to accept this, it was a trade-off."

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.500
Were there cost to that?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.930
Sure, there were political costs

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.580
and there were even some economic costs.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.220
And if you say that to people,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.220
so you've given them a
sort of full representation

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.690
of the situation, they're
more likely to believe you.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.890
Now inside the halls of the administration

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.150
that approach also worked very well.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.290
Just going in and basically
taking the arguments

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.760
and the facts and trying
to present trade-offs.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.970
Where it worked less well
and perhaps not well at all

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.130
was in testimony before Congress.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.430
Because the testimony before
Congress really is much more

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.980
about posturing and
criticizing or defending

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.560
than it is about explication
or understanding.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.120
- What idea did you take to Washington?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.820
I know that right before you went,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.803
you had written this book
on Who's Bashing Whom.

00:24:57.943 --> 00:25:01.110
Do you think that what
you did in Washington

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.970
on those issues was consistent

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.780
with what you had written

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.580
or did your ideas about
the way things were

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.380
changed when you were in Washington?

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:16.630
- Well, I think by and
large there was consistency.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.170
I do think that you learn

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.779
when you're in that situation.

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:25.500
What's the limits of, what is feasible

00:25:26.928 --> 00:25:28.840
and what is not feasible?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.130
And the feasibility
limitations can actually be

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.823
from political constraints.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.830
So let me sort of suggest
where it's consistent

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.170
and then some of the constraints.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.220
Where it's consistent is if for people

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.650
there was a lot of criticism
of that book by people

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.730
who never read it.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.000
And they claimed that I was protectionist,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.090
that I was a sort of heavy
enthusiast of industrial policy.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.510
Basically what the book says

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.670
is most of the U.S.
economic competitive loss

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.030
which occurred between the mid 1980s

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.340
and the early 1990s was self induced.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.530
That the main things we should
worry about were getting

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.380
our macroeconomic house in
order, continuing to spend

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.710
on research and development,

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.070
and working to bring down trade
barriers around the world.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.220
Not build them up here
but bring them down.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.930
That where we had serious
bilateral conflicts

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.710
particularly with Japan
and with the Europeans,

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:30.070
we needed to not assume
that we would be better off

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.270
if they broke the rules or
didn't play by the rules.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.550
We needed to recognize
that it was in our interest

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.540
to use our negotiating
policy and occasionally,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.630
rarely but occasionally, the threat

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.640
or actual use of the sanction to get them

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.230
to change their behavior.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.330
I think we behaved in
Washington very consistently

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.450
with all of those policy views.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.360
Now where would I say limitations existed?

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.580
I mean just on the example
of trade policy issues,

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.170
we did develop a sectorally oriented

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.730
trade approach with Japan.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.830
Now I would say that
there was a lot of debate

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.680
about what sectors should be

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.470
on our sectorally oriented approach.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.050
Some sectors I think fit my notion

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.650
of what should be on
there and some didn't.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.970
And why did ones get on that
didn't fit my sort of notion

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.350
of high technology and
research and development

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.120
and forward-looking?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.830
Well, because there are political reasons

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.193
why things get on a list
as well as economic.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.730
So I say that the feasibility is straight

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.350
maybe that just means
that some of the decisions

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.500
are made on economic logic

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.890
and some of them are
made on political logic.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.720
- As you navigated this this transition

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.780
and you watched ideas that you
had in the Academy applied,

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.320
what surprised you most
about political life?

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.580
Anything in particular
about the way ideas work

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.030
their way through the system?

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.100
- Well, I can get,

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.620
I guess my, the most revealing example,

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.540
I have a couple examples,
there, back in 1993

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.730
when we were talking about
how much deficit reduction

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.470
to introduce into the
President's budget proposal.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.210
There was a big debate
about whether we should,

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.640
whether it mattered to the economy.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.940
If we had a $500 billion
target or $480 billion target.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.160
And the reason this became a hot topic

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.500
was because in order to get
to the $500 billion topic

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.350
we had to do some really,
really undesirable things.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.103
Like make the tax rate
increase retroactive.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.880
Now I argued that

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.117
we have a six trillion dollar economy,

00:28:53.117 --> 00:28:57.143
$20 billion over five years
is nothing, it's minuscule.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.350
And that argument was basically,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.190
it was overruled by the notion that

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.580
the only way we could make
this politically saleable,

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.840
this was not just the
administration's position,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.380
it was the Democrats in Congress.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.120
The only way we could get
the Democrats in Congress

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.740
to support us was make
it a certain figure.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.943
A figure itself which had no
particular economic logic.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.910
So that was that, I learned
a lot from that experience

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.620
because I would bring in all this evidence

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.220
and people will say well, and
I think that another example

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.307
which I'll just then go to 1996.

00:29:29.307 --> 00:29:31.310
There's sort of these things which,

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.250
in 1996 we had proposed.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.140
Someone in the Treasury had proposed

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.890
that we eliminate capital gains on housing

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.860
as a Tax Simplification measure.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.550
Because Americans who buy houses

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.440
and do make improvements

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.750
when they sell the house,
it used to be the case

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.540
where you had to show
all your improvements,

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.880
keep all those records.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.780
So you could show what your
actual capital gains is.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.600
We were looking for Tax
Simplification ideas.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.940
Well, over time over the course of 1996,

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.570
this idea moved from a
Tax Simplification idea

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.580
to a tax break.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.710
Isn't really a tax break,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.220
most people actually
never paid capital gains

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.170
on their house, most people
didn't even give the paperwork.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.810
But it became a tax break

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.190
and the Republicans also
proposed a tax break.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.150
So here's a tax proposal

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.290
which had very small significance

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.570
in terms of simplification.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.900
It has no merit in
terms of economic effect

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.320
and it became something that
is now part of the tax code.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.570
And the most interesting thing about that,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.470
is this to my knowledge,
there was never any,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:47.050
this was not because there
was a groundswell of support

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.940
for such a position.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.040
This actually came from the top-down

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.460
rather than from the bottom-up,
very interesting phenomenon.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.830
- So what was the most
important economic issue

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.090
that the Clinton administration
confronted when you came in?

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.620
The deficit?

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.453
- I think so.

00:31:01.453 --> 00:31:04.420
I think it was, I would
put it differently,

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.010
it was how to get the U.S. economy

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:13.200
on a path which would take away this,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.420
what the Congress called a
structural deficit problem.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.410
The issue was that of course
as a result of the savings

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.880
and loan crisis and the war with Iraq,

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.030
the deficit had gotten
much bigger than anyone

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.930
had predicted.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.940
So it was $290 billion,
that was one concern.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.970
But the real concern was that

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.860
even if you prove the
economy with growth path

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.560
as a positive growth path,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.910
the deficit predictions were
getting larger not smaller

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.030
which is not a sustainable position.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.400
And it had been a position
which the US had been in

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.140
from the early 1980s.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.830
I remember sitting in the
Institute of International Studies

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.480
in the conference room and Ronald Reagan

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.060
was elected president
with a bunch of economists

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.270
and political scientists from Berkeley.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.970
And we talked about the
consequence of his election

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.410
was going to be big tax cuts,

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.410
big increases in military
spending and a huge deficit.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:05.260
And that is what happened,

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:10.260
and it really was only in the
1990s more than a decade later

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.130
that the U.S. took action really

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.680
with President Clinton's leadership

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.610
to bring that problem under control.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.020
So yes, it was the single largest problem.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.990
- And are you surprised
by how remarkably positive

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.650
what you did was?
- Ooh sure.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.550
I mean in the sense that I
think we did the right thing

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:34.250
but I think all of us were surprised

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.890
and continued to be surprised

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.870
at how well the economy has done.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.150
I mean there's a lot
of things going on here

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.580
that we don't entirely understand.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.790
I mean why is the inflation
rate so much lower

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.810
or why can the economy
have an unemployment rate

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:52.420
that's averaging below 5% and
not have cost pressure coming

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.963
from the labor market side.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.090
Why does productivity growth
look like it's increasing?

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.250
The thing that we, our
logic was very simple

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:07.020
and it was that if you reduce
the deficit in a credible way

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.580
you will support more investment,

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.060
you'll create a climate
more conducive to investment

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.440
and that's good for the
economy in the long run.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.470
But we were very careful
to tell the president

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.030
that there might not be
any dramatic benefits

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.530
in the short run.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.640
And then there happened

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.150
and then things went much
better than expected.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:30.080
- Were you surprised
by the the constraints

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.360
on the administration,
and for example dealing

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.370
with the International bond market

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.230
or was this something
that through your study

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.133
and work was not surprising to you?

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:42.500
Or were you that constrained by the time?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.333
It's an assumption.

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:48.333
- Well, I understood it
differently which is that basically

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.250
and I think you can see the
power of global markets today,

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.903
financial markets today in Asia.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.660
We have a world in which there
are these tremendous flows

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.650
of capital that move across borders.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:04.210
They respond to their interpretation

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.720
of what nations are doing.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.720
The U.S. freely from about
the mid-1980s till about 1994

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.030
was considered by the rest
of the global community

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.590
to be behaving in a
very irresponsible way.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.360
Why should the largest, why
should the richest nation

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.640
in the world become the largest
debtor nation in the world?

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.280
Why were we not saving and
lending to the rest of the world

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.160
rather than borrowing from
the rest of the world.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.630
That kind of perception

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.050
can become very powerful source of action.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:35.920
And I think we believed in

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.940
that number one, the US
government was probably

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.900
at that point paying a premium

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.670
in terms of its borrowing
costs because of expectations

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.840
that its borrowing needs were
gonna get greater over time.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.310
So we believed we could bring
long-term interest rates down,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.980
get that premium out of there.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.700
We frankly we were also
concerned that if we didn't do

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.350
at some point, no one could predict when,

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:04.240
there might be a real move
against U.S. Treasury bonds

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.337
and a real decline in the dollar

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.010
and a real spike up an interest rate.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.290
A kind of U.S. version
of a financial crisis

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:15.890
which we were, which was
out there as a possibility.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.730
- So in a way it was related

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.960
to the symbolic dimension on something.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.110
That was not unimportant in this?

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.560
- Look markets, I think
again since we're sitting

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.780
in the middle of a
financial crisis in Asia,

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.860
one of the things that you,

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.110
that these kinds of situations
demonstrates so clearly

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.640
is that so much of this
is about confidence.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.750
And so much of the confidence
is based on perception

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.090
rather than actual knowledge.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.940
So people who invested heavily in Asia

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.970
up through the third quarter
of 1997, was the same systems.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.300
Whenever, you think of the systems,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.430
I happen to think they're very strong,

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.870
good economic fundamentals
but now you read about them,

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.610
it sounds like how could anybody

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.920
have been foolish enough
to put their money there?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.660
Well, the perception in through
the third quarter of 1997,

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.080
was these were a great
places to put their money

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.070
and then investors lost confidence

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.390
and everybody headed for the door.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:18.390
You have got to be careful
to do the right thing

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.390
and to describe what you're doing

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.260
because you could lose that confidence,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.410
and once you lose it, it's
very hard to get back.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.810
- Before we talk about the Asia situation

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:29.643
which I'd like to do,

00:36:29.643 --> 00:36:32.650
I would like to ask you about two fronts

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.290
that as a Liberal
Democratic administration

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.060
or moderate Democratic administration.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.140
The Clinton administration did not succeed

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.427
or was not able to control.

00:36:43.427 --> 00:36:47.903
And that is health care
reform and income inequality.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.570
Resolving those issues.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.610
I don't know if the two are related

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.430
but there are some general
thoughts here about

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:00.000
the limits of reform

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.840
and addressing issues
that an administration

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.010
like this confronted.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.110
- Well, I think they're different.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.170
The reasons for the inability to address

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.200
these issues are different.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.100
So in health I think we
did have, since health care

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.660
is about 14% of the American economy,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.350
there are vast economic
interests that are wedded

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:30.287
to the current configuration
of the health care system.

00:37:30.287 --> 00:37:33.350
And we can see that now
in the sort of pressures

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.770
that are playing out over managed care.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.610
That doctors are threatening to unionize

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.530
and manage care providers
are under attack now for,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.330
are they preventing necessary procedures?

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.040
So the point is there
are huge vested interests

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.410
in this part of the economy.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.790
If you decide to take
it on sort of completely

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.180
as one fell swoop,

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:03.110
you are going to handle Medicare,
Medicaid, the uninsured,

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.390
cost containment and the federal
government's budget deficit

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.560
all at once.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.850
You are going to have to
have a very elaborate plan

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.490
and you are going to mobilize

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.180
a very large number of opponents.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.700
So we did both.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.130
We had a very elaborate plan

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.623
that was very hard to explain to anyone.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.440
And one of the things you certainly learn,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.890
it goes back to our
discussion about perception

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.440
is the importance and power
of message in political life.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.650
It's not just do you have a good policy,

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.350
it is can you explain the policy

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.440
in a very short period of time.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.230
In essentially a soundbite period of time.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.083
We did not have such a policy.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.710
The second point is we did mobilize

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.280
every possible constituency
group against us.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.160
We thought we were going to have

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.960
the leaders of large American corporations

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.520
because they were suffering
from high health care costs.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.037
But then they looked at
the proposal and said,

00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:01.977
"We may end up here or having to give up

00:39:01.977 --> 00:39:03.777
"our own efforts to cut costs

00:39:03.777 --> 00:39:05.637
"and the government
maybe is less successful.

00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:07.330
"So we're not going to support this."

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.740
We thought we were gonna get

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.370
the absolute outstanding support
of the Medicare population

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.140
because we were gonna give them
prescription drug coverage.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.470
But the Medicare population while

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.950
they decided to be
supportive were actually

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.560
kind of concerned because
we were gonna cut Medicare

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.660
and then kind of put the
money back in a different way.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.120
And I could go on and on,
the insurers, the doctors,

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.480
the hospitals.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.500
- All arrayed against you.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.133
What about income inequality?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.490
- So although you say-
- Yes sure, yes sure.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:39.850
- I think we, in a way, we
approached it the wrong way.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:43.300
Because I think a lesson
here and it's also a lesson

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.620
from the Republican revolution of 1994.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.150
Then playing out in 1995,
is if you overreach,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.580
if you try to do too much at once,

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.070
then you may end up
accomplishing very little.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.160
That's the way, our system
is one of checks and balances

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.040
and marginal steps.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.280
And except in crisis situations

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.100
and the health care
situation is now a crisis

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.900
in the United States,
it's a serious problem.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.570
I don't think our system
is really organized

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.990
to make big steps.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.590
Since that time of course as
you know, the administration

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.830
has achieved some successes on
health care in smaller steps.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:25.640
Greater coverage of children,
insurance market reform

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.600
to help with issues of
excluding restrictions

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.194
which make it difficult for
people to get health care.

00:40:32.194 --> 00:40:34.360
The administration brought down,

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.240
increase the tax deductibility
of health care spending

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.610
for the self-employed.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.030
So there are a number of
things which have helped.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.876
Now of course we have this proposal

00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:45.810
to extend Medicare down in age

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.250
to cover people who are not yet retired

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.520
but can't get health
insurance in other way.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.840
And we did protect the
Medicaid as a guarantee.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.440
So there really were some
accomplishments in health.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.990
But they're marginal,
that is the way we omit.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.910
One should not marginal in
their entirety but incremental.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.810
I mean that's the word is incremental.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.246
Income inequality is a
much different issue,

00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:14.180
the reason it's hard to deal with

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.180
is that no one entirely
understands its causes.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.640
And the causes we do understand

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.940
are very hard to do anything about

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.430
at least in the short run.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.070
So the theories about why
income inequality has increased

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.540
in the United States range from trade

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.900
and immigration pressures
which have probably played

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.693
some role though not nearly as
large a role as people think.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.543
What does that mean?

00:41:46.543 --> 00:41:48.740
It means that people at particularly

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.250
with just a high school education or less

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.550
have been competing with
unskilled workers around the world

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.630
and with unskilled workers

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.070
who have moved to the United States.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.100
So it's put downward
pressure on their income.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.950
A second factor, is that is
a much more powerful factor,

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:10.950
it seems is the changing
demands of technology.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.620
So having a high school
education which used to be a path

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:19.110
to a good middle-income life is simply

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.510
that path is closed off, you can't do it.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.390
Because that would have been familiar

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.180
through manufacturing jobs,

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.570
manufacturing productivity
has increased dramatically

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.150
but the number of people who are there

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.810
for in manufacturing jobs
has not grown rapidly.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.957
People are moving into
self-service sector jobs

00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:38.440
and there, there's a bifurcation.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.379
You can have a good service sector job

00:42:40.379 --> 00:42:42.380
if you're computer literate

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.910
or you're a software engineer

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.163
or anything to do with computers frankly.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.240
If you're not it's much harder,

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.240
then you're gonna get
into retail services,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.730
you're gonna get into household services

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.850
where the wages are simply not attractive

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.300
relative to high wage jobs.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.000
So I think you have these
changes in technology,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.610
changes in global competition
which are huge forces.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.140
They're operating
everywhere around the world

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.010
and there's not that much

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.010
that a national policy environment can do.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.820
I think we actually
did a number of things.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.820
We increased, we cut
taxes for the bottom 20%

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.460
through an expansion of what's called

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.120
the Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.100
We managed to get Congress
to pass after they said

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.160
they would never do it,
a significant increase

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.630
in the minimum wage.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:44.400
We have devoted, or there
is much more devoted now

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.740
to spending on education,

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.600
educational opportunity really focused at,

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.320
I would say after high school.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.050
In a way the focus has been on now,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.370
now it's going to preschool,

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.050
sort of certain critical moments

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:01.820
in the educational life of
an individual that matter

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.520
to their long-run ability
to get the skills needed

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.530
for modern technology.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.260
- And the administration also
increased the minimum wage

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.180
which relates to the the
weakening power of the unions

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.200
which you've identified.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.750
- The weakening power of
the unions as a real issue

00:44:18.896 --> 00:44:22.840
I don't think that there's,
again, the reasons for that

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.630
I have a lot to do with sort of the change

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.150
in the composition of the workforce.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.390
Because manufacturing sector
was much more unionized

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.710
than the service sectors is.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.130
Now the current, the relatively
new AFL-CIO leadership

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.250
is trying to do more unionization
among service workers.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:43.250
And frankly I think
stronger unions on balance

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.490
would help with address this
problem of income inequality.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.220
On the other hand I think that

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.360
the American Union movement
is really in the wrong place

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.920
on issues of international trade.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.380
So I mean I both want
them to be successful

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.130
because I think that they
have been a powerful force

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.510
for compressing inequality over time.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.540
But I think that, I hope they become

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.370
a little more forward-looking
on trade issues.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.600
- Tell us about what you
think is President Clinton's

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.010
most outstanding leadership quality?

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.520
Or is there something
about the way that he led

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.520
that you were heartened by
and were surprised about?

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.363
Is there something about
leadership you learned from him?

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.243
- Well,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.020
I would say I've, a couple of things,

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.550
or points which have been
made I think are true, he.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:41.080
There are certain times and
I think the budget of 1993,

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.320
the health care effort in 1994,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.050
the effort to help Mexico

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.890
through difficult financial
circumstances in 1995

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:54.300
and his whole commitment
to trade liberalization

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.340
despite the opposition
of his Democratic base,

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.550
are all clear indications of both

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.360
a vision,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.950
knowledge of what he wanted
to accomplish and character

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.730
that is a willingness to
endure serious political risk

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.563
and to do things that were unpopular.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.130
The second point, I would
say though not though

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.060
in addition is that

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.630
he is a very gifted political figure.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.700
And what that means is that he understands

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.660
the necessity of compromise.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.310
And he finally would
rather get something done

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:41.873
than stand for something
that cannot be done.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.620
You can commit yourself to something

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.360
that you would like to
do and talk about it

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.643
but and he does that.

00:46:51.643 --> 00:46:53.950
It's very good, I think
because of his ability

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:56.660
to speak clearly and in a
very down-to-earth fashion.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.810
I think he can really communicate
with the American people

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.890
which is another part of his skill.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.520
But I think he also
understands that you don't

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.080
just say, well so I can't have everything

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.200
I'll take nothing.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.680
He tried that in a sense
that was health care

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.170
that was the closest we came.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.500
But in most other issues I
think was willing to compromise.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.360
And some people interpreted that

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.463
to be a kind of lack of,

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.720
a lack of vision.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.348
I honestly don't think so.

00:47:26.348 --> 00:47:29.340
I think there's a vision
and a political ability

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.763
that work together.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.740
- As we do this interview where

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.090
as we were mentioning earlier overtaken

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.210
by the turn of events in Asia.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.980
And I'm curious for your thoughts about

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.160
what the dominoes apparently falling

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.140
in that region,

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.920
Thailand, Indonesia,
Korea, which were perceived

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.050
as being so strong and in some ways

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:58.090
as a kind of a threat to
the United States and so on.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:02.420
What these, the sharp turn in events

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.560
tells us about globalization
in the management

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.490
of the international economy?

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.740
Drawing on your experience
because that's partly

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.683
what y'all dealt with
as you just described.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.100
- Well, you know in the,
I think we dealt with this

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.570
in a much smaller I turned out easier

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:24.470
to contain fashion in Mexico.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:29.120
And when we, it is a kind of
I think very defining moment

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.210
in terms of leadership for the president.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.460
Because there was very
little support in the press

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.930
and very little support in the Congress

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.650
and very little support in the public

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.573
for any sort of bailout of Mexico.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.110
What the president understood

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.070
and it was really almost instinctive,

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.150
he didn't need to be convinced,

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:53.440
was that U.S. interests

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.140
whether they were economic interests

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.760
or military interests
or Democratic interests

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.630
were at risk

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:05.133
from a destabilized Mexico
financial situation.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:09.790
And that it was in the
interest of the United States

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.070
to use its capabilities for leadership

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.793
and its resources to stabilize that.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.420
And I think that's the
same that's true now.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.430
It's not that Japan has been
and I believe at some point

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.100
will be again a serious
competitor for the United Sates.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.470
It is in fact still a serious
competitor for United States

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.603
if you look in particular industries.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.023
South Korea was becoming
a serious competitor.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:40.610
And I think that the
recognition of leadership

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:45.610
is that you want to have these
parts of the world be stable

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.820
and you want them to be prosperous.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.670
Yeah, they may pose a competitive threat

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.260
but you're on balance much better off,

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.110
having a healthy trading partners

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.763
than you are having
debilitated trading partners.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.010
You're much better off if you can spend

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.080
a couple billion dollars to stabilize,

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.710
to prevent a debt default in South Korea

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:09.090
than if South Korea
defaults and you end up

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:13.230
having to pick up the bill
for work that South Korea

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.210
was gonna do with North
Korea on a nuclear reactor.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.520
So you have to I think realize

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.020
and I think the president
instinctively realizes this

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.820
that in the global system that we now live

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.800
you can't distinguish very clearly

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.687
between our military security,
our national security

00:50:31.687 --> 00:50:32.980
and our Economic Security.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.143
They're all part of the same system.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:40.440
The second thing, I think he understands

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.550
and I think that Alan
Greenspan understands this.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.240
And that we understood any message

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.580
from the economic team.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.440
Is a globalization like almost
all other economic forces

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.900
has its pluses and it's minuses.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:59.550
So the same technologies and
the same financial innovations

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:03.460
that could pull billions
of dollars of capital

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.460
into South Korea or into
Thailand in a couple years

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:13.570
could allow that capital to
migrate in a couple of days.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.930
And the volatility of capital markets

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:22.930
and the magnitude of their
swings have both been increased

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.270
by the ability of the
system to move money around.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.600
On the other hand, on the
good side just think about

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.500
all the investment
opportunity that would never

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.240
have been funded in these countries

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.760
that are good investment opportunities

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.510
if the money hadn't been available.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.640
Or think about all of
the Americans who might

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.070
have wanted to invest in these
economies that would not have

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:43.500
had the opportunity to do so.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.890
So if the world is one of imperfection,

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:49.340
you have to take the good with the bad.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.050
And then you always work
to make the good better

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:52.940
and control the bad.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.505
- Is that your philosophy
of government actually?

00:51:54.505 --> 00:51:56.350
(laugh)

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.200
- My philosophy of government is that

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.090
you know some people went to Washington

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.020
and I think their experience in Washington

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.240
probably left them frustrated
because they had hoped

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:13.230
to get to closer to their
ideal of whatever it is

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.030
they wanted to accomplish.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:18.960
My own sense was I went with

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.090
some doubt that much could be accomplished

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.500
and I felt that relative
to the constraints

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.360
we actually did on
balance the right thing.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.100
So I left feeling probably
at least is positive

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.600
if not more positive
than when I first went

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.590
into the administration.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.900
And I have friends who I
would say that's not true.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.913
They are more frustrated, they
wanted it to be more perfect.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.730
Maybe that is the power of economics,

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.800
economics is a dismal science.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.080
We don't believe things are perfect.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.000
We don't believe there are free lunches,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.890
we believe there are trade-offs
and costs and sacrifices.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.690
And I think that I'm gonna do

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:02.130
my entire introductory
economics class this spring,

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:03.080
all about that.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.880
Because that is the most important insight

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.450
into policymaking, can't have it all.

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:13.140
- One final question, how
would you advise students

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.480
to prepare for the future and
for a role in public service

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.793
if they envision it.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.063
- Well, I think there are,

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.000
first of all I think they need to prepare

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.360
and I think the students
I will see understand this

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:37.150
by a broad education

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.910
which gives them a real feel
for the rest of the world.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:44.330
Because it is the case they
were so deeply embedded now

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.380
with the rest of the world.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.875
That in order to understand the prospects

00:53:47.875 --> 00:53:49.800
for the U.S. economy in 1998,

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.370
you do have to understand
what's happened in Asia.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:55.980
And I think that one of
the goals I would have

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:58.040
for having an undergraduate
education at Berkeley

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.260
is at the end of that process

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.110
whether you took economics or not,

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.810
you should know enough to
be able to make those links.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.260
So I think that is a very critical part

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.980
of living in the global economy.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.250
I think it's also critically
important for people

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.080
to become technologically literate.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.490
Now I have to say that for me

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.240
this is a kind of generational issue.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.130
I'm less technologically
literate than younger people

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.410
but I'm trying to catch up.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.570
But I think that younger people recognize

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.660
more clearly you've gotta
understand this technology.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.530
You've gotta understand
what it can do for you

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.720
and how you can use it as a research tool.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.330
- And what skill most
enables you to survive

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.483
in the public sector?

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.433
- Ah dear what's,

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:51.940
- I honestly think the ability to say

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.490
what you really think

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:59.170
but but to be willing to listen

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.620
to what someone else thinks.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.470
It is if you are an ideologue,

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:05.210
if you are absolutely
committed to your position

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.760
then I think unless you're a politician

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.410
that is going to be a very
difficult place for you to be.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.690
If you are a policy
person, I think you wanna,

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.830
you have to be sure that
no matter who the person

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:18.990
you're talking to is you
will say what you think.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.830
But I think also you have to realize

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:22.410
that you need to listen back.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.640
And also another thing is you
have to be willing to accept

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.610
the fact that you will not always prevail

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.490
no matter how intelligent
you think you are,

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.370
how powerful your arguments
are, you will lose.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.887
And you have to say, "I fought the fight,

00:55:34.887 --> 00:55:37.597
"I did gave my advice
and I was overruled."

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.800
- Laura thank you very
much for this very engaging

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.750
and insightful conversation on your career

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.250
and your service in the
Clinton administration.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.083
- Thank you Harry.

00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:51.920
- Thank you and thank you
very much for joining us

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.673
for this Conversation with History.
