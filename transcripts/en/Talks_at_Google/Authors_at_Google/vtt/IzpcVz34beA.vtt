00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.770
IRENE BUTTER: Well,
I'm very honored

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.920
and glad that you invited me
to come and speak here today.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.180
And I am a Jewish child that
grew up during the Holocaust

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.660
in Nazi-occupied Europe.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.630
And I'm going to talk
to you about my journey.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.170
My journey was not voluntary.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.600
It was by command.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.910
And basically, I will
talk about the first 15

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.810
years of my life, when
I arrived in America,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.400
and then there'll be a little
bit of it since that time.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.490
So the first thing
I want to do is

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.280
show you a map of my journey.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.880
And I hope you can see this.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.800
And I'm going over
this very fast.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.830
I was born in Berlin, Germany.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.420
And I was three years old
when Hitler came to power

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
and the persecution
of Jews began.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.720
My grandfather owned
a bank in Berlin.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.900
My father was his partner.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.400
And about two years after
Hitler came to power,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.510
the bank was taken away
because Jews were not

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.110
allowed to own banks, just
like they weren't allowed

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.990
to do or be many other things.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.860
And so my father was unemployed.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.400
And he decided to go to
Amsterdam to try to find work.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.070
And then to move
the family there,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.910
because he hoped that
that would help us

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.970
escape the execution of Jews
that began very rapidly.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.040
So when I was seven years old,
my family moved to Amsterdam.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.600
And then, what we
hoped was not going

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.100
to happen-- the Nazis invaded
Holland, which as you can see,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.510
is an adjoining
country to Germany.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.920
And the Nazis followed.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.120
And they occupied Holland.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.170
They invaded.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.780
And then after a
few days of battle,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.570
Holland became an
occupied country.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.290
And the persecution
of Jews escalated.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.930
So eventually, it
didn't take very long,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.140
my family was deported to the
first concentration camp, which

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.570
is the third point on the map.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.260
And that was Westerbork.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.380
Westerbork was a German
concentration camp in Holland.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.050
It was a transit camp.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.730
And most Jews, Dutch Jews or
Jews who lived in Holland,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.380
were transported to death
camps in Eastern Europe.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.440
So we were first
transported there.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.490
And then after about eight
months in Westerbork,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.150
we were transported to
another concentration camp

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.880
in Germany called Bergen-Belsen.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.010
Well, from there we were in
Bergen-Belsen almost one year,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.140
barely surviving.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.750
And then we were included
in a prisoner exchange

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.730
from Bergen-Belsen.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.030
And we were elated
that that happened.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.320
But the second night on the
train from Bergen-Belsen

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.520
to Switzerland, my father died.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.240
We were so close to freedom,
but he did not make it.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.080
What happened then was that
we arrived in Switzerland.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.600
And from there, I was
transported to a refugee camp

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.820
in Algiers in North Africa.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.630
It took another year before I
came to America from Africa,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.250
from North Africa,
from this camp.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.920
And then the rest of the
story you will hear later.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.710
So I am now proceeding.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.660
So the persecution of the
Jews was a horrible regime.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.380
Six million Jews were
murdered during the Holocaust,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.010
and six million other people
were murdered, as well.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.400
And they included gypsies,
Jehovah Witnesses, homosexuals,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.830
and dissidents, and all
kinds of other people.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.800
But the Jews were
the main target.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.730
And because the Jews were the
main target, they were labeled.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.150
They were called
all kinds of names,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.070
like criminals, murderers,
cockroaches, monkeys, pigs--

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.520
all of these vermin,
all of these names

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.750
were applied to the Jews.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.510
I'm going to show you quickly
some pictures of my family

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.070
to see what they looked like.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
This is a wedding
picture of my parents.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And this is my
brother and myself.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.290
He was two years
older than I was.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.600
And this is a picture
of my dad with myself.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.070
I adored him.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.320
And here are my grandparents.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.060
I had an idyllic childhood.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.890
It was a very happy family--

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.150
loving parents,
loving grandparents.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.710
I lived with my grandparents the
first seven years of my life.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.010
And I don't have a
single negative memory

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.220
of my childhood.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.430
Then we left Germany
because of the persecution.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.820
And my father found a job with
the American Express company

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.260
in Amsterdam.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.020
And this is the
house where we lived.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.400
And next to it, there's a
picture of Anne Frank's house.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.370
She and I lived in
the same neighborhood.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.790
You can see the architecture
is the same, and both of us

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.660
lived on the third
floor of the building.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.140
In Holland, we lived
much more modestly,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.710
because the Nazis did
not allow my family

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.740
to take all the
assets with them.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.480
But we had a good life, and
the Dutch were very hospitable.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.700
We were never made fun of
because we were refugees.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.060
My brother and I went
to school right away,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.210
learned the Dutch language.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.740
And the first two years
were rather peaceful

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.430
until the invasion and
the Nazis took over.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.690
Here's a school picture.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.680
That's a typical school
picture, about third grade.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.485
And you can see
that Anne and I, we

00:06:57.485 --> 00:06:59.210
didn't go to the
same school, but it's

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.880
the same kind of
picture with a portrait

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.280
in the back and a notebook
and a pen in the hand.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.850
This is a passport picture.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.580
And I'm showing
it because there's

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.620
something peculiar about it.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.040
The Nazis decided
that the left ear

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.340
had to be exposed in
a passport picture.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.100
And I, to this day,
have not found out

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.340
what's so special
about the left ear

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.210
so that the picture had to
be like this in the passport.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.410
Many restrictions were
imposed on the Jews

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.380
after the occupation
by the Nazis.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.300
And this is just one sign that
shows a park, a public park,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.420
was forbidden for Jews.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.710
Many other restrictions applied.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.580
For example, we couldn't
go to movie houses.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.410
We couldn't go to theaters.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.700
We couldn't go to parks.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.400
As you can see, not
to swimming pools--

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.880
many public places
were forbidden.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.725
In addition to that,
we had curfews.

00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:07.670
We had to be home at
8 o'clock every night.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.710
We Jews could not go to food
stores until after 3 o'clock

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.220
in the afternoon.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.830
And it was wartime.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.510
There were many scarcities.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.080
So often there wasn't any
food left after 3 o'clock

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.630
in the afternoon.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.740
Then we had to wear the Star
of David on our clothing

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.590
all the time.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.920
So everybody could
see you were a Jew.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.159
There was no difficulty
distinguishing.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.890
And then came the deportation.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:44.120
And this shows a picture of
the method used by the Nazis

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.550
to deport Jews from their homes.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.740
What they would do is
they would block off

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.690
an entire neighborhood.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.180
And with their
loudspeakers, they

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.630
would chase everybody
into their houses.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.810
Nobody was allowed
on the street.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.270
And then they would go from
house to house and from

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.940
door to door and look for Jews.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.170
And if they found Jews, they
gave you 10 minutes to pack,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.440
and then you had to leave.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.670
And here on the picture you
can see all these people

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.100
with their bundles, their
suitcases, baby carriages.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.170
Young or old were just
marched out of their homes

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.880
to a big square.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.600
And there we waited until
they came with trucks.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.320
They loaded us on trucks and
took us to the railway station.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.000
And at the railway
station, there

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.530
was this long, long train.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.620
But it wasn't a passenger train.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.250
It was this kind of a
train, a cattle car train,

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.850
that they transported
Jews to the camps.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.460
And so they loaded, like, 50,
60, 70 people into one wagon.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.230
And then they closed it.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.910
There was no water.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.080
There was no toilet.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.550
There was no food.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.810
And there was no air.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.920
Because when they closed
the doors, no windows.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.000
And it was very
uncomfortable, very crowded.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.070
Some people didn't even
find a place to sit down.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.940
They had to sit on
somebody else's lap.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.050
And then you'd be locked up.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.060
Many people, as they were
transported to Eastern Europe

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.860
to a death camp, spent days
in a cattle car like this.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.970
In our case, we were in
this car about eight hours.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.310
And then we arrived
in Camp Westerbork.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.960
And this is what it looked like.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.480
You see the barracks
on the left side.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.950
And on the right side, you see
the kind of beds we slept in.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.510
They were bunk beds,
steel framed, three tiers.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.380
And all they had was a
straw mattress, no blankets,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.930
no pillows, nothing like that.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.950
And this was Camp Westerbork.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.300
120,000 Jews were
deported from Westerbork

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.790
to other concentration camps.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:12.330
Life there was not
pleasant, of course.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.620
Adults had to go to
work, all kinds of work.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.730
I was only 12 years old.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.130
So I didn't go to work.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.190
My brother had a
job as a messenger.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.510
He had a bicycle.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.130
And he would take messages
from one place to another.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.980
For kids like me, it
was absolute boredom.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.520
There was nothing to do.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.110
There was no school, no
playground, no library,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.540
no books, no toys, no nothing.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.580
It was complete boredom.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.290
The most traumatic memory
I have of this camp

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.460
is that every week a
train came, a cattle car

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.930
train, on Saturday afternoon.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.220
The camp was divided
by a railroad track.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.380
So wherever you
went in the camp,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.110
you had to cross
the railroad track.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.770
And this train, this cattle car
train, pulled in on Saturday

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.940
afternoon.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.210
And it would sit there
the rest of Saturday,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.700
all day Sunday,
and all day Monday.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.880
And then Monday night,
all the barrack leaders

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.350
would turn on the
lights and they

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.950
would read off a list
of names of the people

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.540
who had to go on the train.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.370
And they always went
to a death camp.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.640
So you lived in continuous fear.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.040
Because on Tuesday morning,
the train had to leave.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.710
First you woke up and you
listened whether your name

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.160
was on the list.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.420
And if you were lucky that
it wasn't on the list, then

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.780
usually what we would do is
we would go to other barracks

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.480
where we had friends
or family, and we

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.800
would see who had to leave
on that train that night,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.590
and spend the rest of
the night together.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.520
And then the morning would come,
and we'd have to say goodbye.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.420
And we pretty much knew
that it was not likely

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.390
that we would ever
see each other again.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.040
And then the train left.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.580
But next Saturday, it
would show up again.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.120
So this was a cycle,
a weekly cycle.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.730
The train would come, and this
ominous train would sit there,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.830
and then it would leave.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.710
And then a week later,
it was right back.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.550
And so that was the
most difficult part

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.940
of living in Westerbork.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.710
Now, before we were
arrested, my father

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.680
met a friend who had
just received passports

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.240
from Ecuador.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.820
And people thought
that maybe, if you

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.960
had a passport for a foreign
country, an Allied country,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.300
then maybe you
could escape death.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.080
And so my father wrote
away for these passports.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.400
And one day in Westerbork,
we received a package.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.600
And we opened the package.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.380
And it contained four
Ecuadorian passports.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.590
And that was, in
a way, a miracle.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.080
Because my father had sent
away for the passports.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.760
They did not arrive
before we were deported.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.610
And all of a sudden
this package appeared.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.810
And we never got any mail
forwarded to us to the camp.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.820
So in a sense, it was a miracle.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.730
And it changed our status
in Westerbork immediately.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.230
Because we were no
longer just Jews.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.560
We were now exchange Jews.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.860
And that meant that--

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.070
it related to the fact that
the Germans, the Nazis,

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.630
had a foreign policy.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.540
And this policy was called
the exchange policy, [GERMAN]..

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.410
And that the Jews that
had these passports

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.380
were not going to be
sent to any death camp.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.170
We were no longer
at risk of being

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.960
sent to Auschwitz on
one of those trains that

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.390
showed up every Saturday.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.510
And so a few months
later, we were

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.910
sent to Bergen-Belsen,
the next camp.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.340
And we were told when we left
Westerbork that Bergen-Belsen

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.410
would be a better camp.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.380
And besides, we would
not be there very long,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.870
because we would be exchanged.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.860
We would be part of a
prisoner exchange whereby

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.900
the Germans would exchange us,
either for German prisoners

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.470
of war, or for
German citizens who

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.510
were living in Allied
countries and they

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.040
couldn't come back to Germany.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.520
Because during wartime
the borders closed,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.080
and you can't travel.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.830
You can't move.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.200
And so we came to Bergen-Belsen.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.990
And you see here the picture
on top has the barracks.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.460
They were not very different
from barracks in Westerbork.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.200
But then that lower picture,
it shows barbed wire.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.910
And there are people behind it.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.210
And they're wearing rags,
they're very skinny,

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.360
and they have these fearful
expressions on their faces.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.465
And it looked ominous.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.980
It showed us that this was
not going to be a better

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.950
camp than Westerbork was.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.035
Now, Bergen-Belsen
was really a horrible,

00:16:32.035 --> 00:16:35.820
a brutal, a cruel camp.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.840
The adults had to do slave
labor from early morning

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.420
till night, six and
a half days a week.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.220
And if there was punishment
for one reason or another, then

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.620
maybe they had to work that last
half day of the week, as well.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.400
We had to stand on a big
square to be counted.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.450
There was roll call at
least one time a day,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.700
but sometimes
several times a day.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.490
Standing in the
cold or in the heat

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.109
or in the rain, standing in
place, in columns of five,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.369
you couldn't sit.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.390
You couldn't jump.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.990
You couldn't talk to anybody.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.420
It was a form of
torture to be counted

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.180
on this square every single day.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.730
The food rations were minimal.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:29.040
We received a piece of bread
about three inches wide.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.460
And at night, there was a
soup, and most of the time,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.230
it consisted of turnips
being boiled in water.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.520
It was not a food ration
that people could survive on.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.670
People became malnourished.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.400
And there were diseases.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.190
The hygienic conditions
were terrible.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.890
There was only cold
water, no soap.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.230
The bathrooms were filthy.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.080
And all of us had lice.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.640
And lice transmit diseases.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.500
So there were epidemics.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.720
There was cholera.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.700
There was typhus.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:11.730
There was polio, pneumonia,
dysentery, all these diseases

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.700
that spread rampantly.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.170
And people were
sick all the time.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.770
And people were dying.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.170
In addition to that,
there was torture.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.340
People were beaten up brutally.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.820
And the death rate
was extremely high.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.120
So we were waiting for exchange.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.760
But this exchange, this prisoner
exchange just didn't come.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.480
There is an aerial
picture on the left,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.240
which is the roll call
square where we were counted.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.170
You can't see it very well.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.390
But that's where we were rounded
up every day, at least once.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.010
And now on the
lower picture, you

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.320
see the kind of
beds we slept in.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.350
And as the camp became
more and more crowded,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.850
two people had to share a bed.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.340
It was a narrow bed.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.780
And of course, with the
lice and the disease,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.860
diseases spread even more
quickly, being so congested.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.180
So life was pretty intolerable.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.360
Now, one day, there
was an announcement

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.190
that people who had a passport,
a South American or a Central

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:29.580
American passport, had to line
up and be screened by a doctor

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.030
for leaving the camp.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:38.040
And it was really a miracle
that my family was included,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.150
because my mother had taken ill.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.050
And she'd been bedridden
for several months.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.000
I was taking care of her.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.850
And my father, that day when
we had to report to the doctor,

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.470
came back from labor.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:58.500
And he seemed very sick, and
he was partly not conscious.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.950
And we found out later that
he had been very badly beaten

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.120
that day.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.850
But anyway, finally-- first my
brother and I went to report.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.130
We tried to get my
mother to walk there.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.690
But she collapsed.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.330
We had to take her
back to the barrack.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.030
And then, in the
end, my father went.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.730
And so when I went
with my father,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.860
the doctor looked at him, and
he said, are you John Hasenberg?

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.420
And then he said, are you sick?

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.560
And my father said, no, which
was a ridiculous question.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.290
And then he looked
at me, and he said,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.510
your children have
already been here.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.890
He checked off my mother's
name, looking at me.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.000
And he said, tomorrow, you
will be leaving the camp

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.310
for the prisoner exchange.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.000
And we will never
know whether he

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.060
was being kind to
include our family,

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.340
or whether I and my mother
looked the same here.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.800
I was a 14-year-old child.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.620
And my mother in her 40s.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:11.970
But anyway, we made it to the
train leaving Bergen-Belsen,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.130
leaving that hell that day.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.020
And of course, we were elated.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.050
We got warm food.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.000
The train was heated.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.510
It wasn't a cattle car train.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.080
It was a passenger train.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.210
And here's a picture
a student drew.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.540
It was a Red Cross train.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.320
And when we saw the Red Cross,
we thought, well, maybe there's

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.630
hope here.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.600
So the train started moving.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:44.000
And the second night on the
train, my father passed away.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.560
And he had done everything
possible to save his family.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.620
But he just-- and we
were so close to freedom.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.730
But he could not make it.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.290
And so my mother,
my brother, and I

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.550
had no choice but to
continue the journey.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.430
His remains were taken off the
train in a small southern town

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.810
in Germany.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.320
And we went, we continued.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.530
And two days later, we
arrived in Switzerland.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:20.580
My mother was dying, and my
brother had another illness.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.490
And so they were
taken off the train

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.640
and hospitalized immediately.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.850
I was not allowed to stay there.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.610
I wasn't sick enough
to be hospitalized.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:37.340
And the Swiss were totally
averse to keeping any more

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.540
refugees.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.940
So I was sent on, with a
group of 100 or so people,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:50.510
to a camp in North Africa,
in Algiers, a refugee camp.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.160
The war was over.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.590
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.550
The war had been ended.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:00.140
And we were what was
called displaced persons.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.760
We were displaced from
our home in Germany.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.000
We were displaced from Holland.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.690
And that's what people were
called after the Holocaust,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.250
displaced persons.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.690
And most of them were housed
in displaced persons camps.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.480
Now, this is the
camp in North Africa.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.530
You see the barracks
we lived in.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.270
And it's the only
two pictures I have--

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.120
the one with a group
of young people

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.680
that we hang out together.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.620
Now, in North Africa, certainly
life was considerably better

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.570
than Bergen-Belsen.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.410
But here I was, 14
years old, my father

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.840
had just died a few days ago.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.120
And I was separated from
my mother and brother.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.350
And we were separated,
not just different cities

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.430
or different countries, we were
on two different continents.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.540
For several months,
the war had not ended.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.090
I didn't have any
contact with my family.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.680
I didn't know if
they were surviving.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.220
And after a while, I got
a telegram telling me

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.530
that they were recovering.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:17.540
Now, nothing was done to
reunite me with my family.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.990
I wasn't allowed to go back to
Switzerland to be with them.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.540
And they never came
to North Africa.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.240
We finally were
reunited in America.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.010
It took one year before I was
able to come to the United

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.880
States.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.450
And it took my mother and
brother six more months.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.500
And so we were separated
for one and a half years.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.880
And so when I hear
what is happening

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.690
at the border of this country
these days, where children

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.900
are being taken away
from their families,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.400
my heart really weeps.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.520
Because I have never
forgotten the trauma

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.410
of that period of being alone.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.000
Now, when I came
to America, we had

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.370
to wait a long time
for transportation.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.710
The war was over.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.650
And so the way in which
we came to America

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.480
was on a Liberty Ship.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.620
Now, Liberty Ships were built
during the war in 24 hours,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:25.130
mostly to transport cargo to
support the troops in Europe.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.890
And it was a very rough ocean.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.500
It was three weeks in December.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.760
And so I was on this ship
with a few other people,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.790
because they weren't
built for passengers.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.710
And one day, an American
doctor who was part of the crew

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.230
told this story about
the Liberty Ships.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.750
He said sometimes
they break in half.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.470
And so I became very scared.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.700
And he said the part of the ship
that will make it to America

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.080
is the part that has the engine.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.440
And so I kept looking
for the engine,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.650
because I wanted to be
sure that I would arrive.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.720
Later on, people told
me it was a joke.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.700
But here you see a picture of
a Liberty Ship breaking in half

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100
in the middle of the ocean.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.860
Anyway, we arrived.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.640
I lived with cousins
of my mother.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.760
Went to school immediately,
because I hadn't had

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.980
any schooling for three years--

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.080
even more than three years.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.010
And this is the graduation
picture from high school.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.210
Then I went to a tuition-free
college in New York City.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.080
Can you imagine a
tuition-free college today?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.120
And I worked in the summer.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.650
And here I'm at a summer
resort in upstate New York,

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.620
being a waitress.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.520
So that's how it was
able to earn money

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.410
during the summertime.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.690
And after graduating
from college,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:59.850
I went to Duke University
and got a PhD in economics,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:07.370
met my husband, and so we both
got our PhDs at Duke University

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.250
before we came to the
University of Michigan,

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.070
where we spent more than 35
years on the faculty, both

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.000
of us.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.860
Here are my kids.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.680
They're in their 50s now.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.450
On the left side are
my two granddaughters,

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.700
they're my daughter's daughters.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.050
And then on the right
is my son's boy.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.170
He's the youngest
one of the crew.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:41.210
And five months ago, I
became a great-grandmother.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.900
And so the baby has to be
added to the PowerPoint.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.335
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.890
And so here I'm
teaching economics

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.050
at the University of Michigan.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.610
This is a picture
during the 1970s.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.400
It's graduation day.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.100
You see all the guys in
front are wearing suits

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.200
and white shirts and ties.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.930
And then behind
them is the faculty.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.140
And they're wearing suits
and white shirts and ties.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.440
And that's how people dressed
for graduation in those days.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.870
And then over on the
right, that's me.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.700
And so if you saw the
same picture today,

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.790
there would be at least 50% of
the students would be women,

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:33.200
and probably close to 50% of
the faculty would also be women.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.640
So sometimes things
change for the better.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.130
And so my brother
has two children.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:42.910
And I have two.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.400
And one day, at
a family reunion,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.730
our kids demanded
that we take them

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:53.390
back on a journey to the
sites of family history.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.400
So we went to Berlin, to
Amsterdam, to Westerbork.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.260
And this is Bergen-Belsen.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.430
We were visiting there.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.830
And that's just-- the camp
existed from '40 to '45,

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.440
and then became a
displaced persons camp.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.020
And this is a sign at the entry.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.900
And here you see a mass grave.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.070
Because when the Allies came
to liberate Bergen-Belsen,

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.397
they found so many dead bodies.

00:29:20.397 --> 00:29:21.980
They didn't know
what to do with them.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.650
And they had to bury
them in mass graves.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.150
Here is a sign for Anne Frank,
Anne Frank and her sister,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.730
Margot, that was put up later.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.920
And we visited my father's
grave at a Jewish cemetery

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.740
in southern Germany.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.680
And so my peace work--

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:51.160
I helped found the Wallenberg
Medal and Lecture Series.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.070
Raoul Wallenberg was a Swede.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.680
He was a student at the
University of Michigan

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.110
from '31 to '35.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.430
And he saved tens of
thousands of Jews in Budapest.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.360
And so this is a way of
honoring him every year.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.320
If you ever want to hear
a wonderful lecture,

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.430
then look for the Wallenberg
lectures every fall.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.380
And it's a humanitarian.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.730
Here's the Dalai Lama.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.730
He's one of the
Wallenberg medalists.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.430
And here are a bunch of others.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.410
And now we're up to the
27th Wallenberg Lecture.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.230
And this is a
group I co-founded,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:38.050
consisting of six Palestinian
and six Jewish women.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.650
And our motto is
"refusing to be enemies."

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.840
We have existed for,
I think, 16 years.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.580
We meet every other week
in our homes to do dialogue

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.790
on complicated issues.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.120
And when we are
invited, we give talks

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.630
about refusing to be
enemies and how much we

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:08.950
can learn from each other if
we are open to meet people

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.760
from other cultures, other
religions, other nations

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.530
and do dialogue, which is a
form of communication that

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:24.350
is very liberating
and very educational.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.840
We learn a lot from each other.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.650
And this is my book.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.240
It's my memoir.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.130
I published it last year.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.960
And it has the first
15 years of my life

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.750
with a lot more detail of the
story that I've just told you.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.280
So I will stop here.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.270
I have a few books, if
anybody didn't get one before.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.960
And I look forward to
a lot of questions.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.385
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.400
I was just curious.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.230
You had mentioned
that, at the camp,

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.020
they had called out for folks
with South American passports.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.160
And I saw in your slide that
you had an Ecuadorian passport.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.320
And I wondered how
you came across--

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.310
how you came to obtain a
South American passport.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.330
IRENE BUTTER: My father wrote to
a man in Sweden, in Stockholm.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:32.340
And he managed to get them from
a consul, an Ecuadorian consul.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.000
All over Europe, there were
consulates from those countries

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.820
that issued passports
because they

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.700
knew of this exchange policy.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.130
So many, many people
had passports.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.910
But very few ever got exchanged.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.610
And the passport--
this is interesting--

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.000
was issued under the
following two conditions.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.380
One was that we
would never apply

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.350
for a visa to come to Ecuador.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.640
And that after the war, we
had to turn in the passport.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for sharing your story.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.775
I just wondered what
happened to your mother,

00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:12.340
if you were ever
reunited with her.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.090
IRENE BUTTER: Yes.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.900
My mother and my brother
came to America six months

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.360
after I arrived here.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.680
And she was very traumatized
for most of her life,

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.320
but she adapted.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.580
It was difficult here.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.800
She had never worked before.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.730
She found herself the
mother of two teenage kids,

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.500
a single parent.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:45.870
She had to do minimum wage
labor to support our family.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.030
But she had a
relatively good life.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.930
And she lived till age 86.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.540
AUDIENCE: How was it for you
navigating your Jewish heritage

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.510
after leaving the concentration
camps and making it to America?

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.440
Did you find yourself steering
away from your history,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.040
or did you embrace it even more
after all you went through?

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.050
IRENE BUTTER: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.560
I certainly did not
turn away from it.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.130
We had family in America.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:18.310
And the early years
after the war,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.600
there were other survivors
in New York, kids

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.290
that I became friends
with in Algiers.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.670
And so most of our
social life was really

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.280
with other survivors.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.150
But I never abandoned
my Jewish heritage.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.889
But I didn't limit
myself to that, either.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.469
AUDIENCE: How have you managed
not to be angry all the time

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.360
about what's happened
to you in your life?

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.110
How do you deal with
that, psychologically?

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.050
IRENE BUTTER: That's
a good question, too.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:57.690
Well, you know,
anger eats you up.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.700
Anger is very destructive.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.740
It doesn't really help anybody.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.230
I mean, I wasn't near the Nazis.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:08.310
Probably if I had met them
shortly after the war,

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.050
I would have been angry.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.010
But I was lucky to come
to America, far removed

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.630
from everything.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:22.020
And I think it's
important to forgive.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.640
Because for one,
forgiveness is healing.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.320
And I think you can do
more about all the evil

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.900
and the destruction
that took place

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.290
if you work on forgiveness.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:42.300
Now, I have my three
conditions for forgiveness.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.160
I think people who
participated in mass murder,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.620
they have to admit what
they did, first of all.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.110
They have to show remorse.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:59.860
And preferably they show
that they have done something

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:07.430
to go beyond that, something to
make the world a better place.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.640
I wouldn't forgive
people who don't admit

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.350
or who defend what they did
as having been the right thing

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.440
to do.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.780
AUDIENCE: What was it
like to go back to Germany

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.605
with your family and go kind
of back to your [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:23.605 --> 00:36:27.150
but also back to
a place that was

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.890
a really-- probably the most
traumatic time in your past?

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.640
IRENE BUTTER: Thank
you for that question.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.180
First when our children
asked us, we were shocked.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.560
We never thought we would go
back to any of those places.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:48.440
But then we thought we
should, since they wanted it.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.630
And it's complicated.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.790
It was, on the one
hand, very painful,

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.060
especially to go back
to Bergen-Belsen.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.690
But on the other hand, it was
such an amazing experience

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.910
for us to share.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:05.120
And when we came
to Bergen-Belsen,

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.160
the feeling of
taking your children

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.610
to the place where you
were supposed to be killed

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.520
was really a
liberating experience.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.810
So I think in the
end, even though there

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:24.130
were many painful moments,
we were all glad we did it.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.110
And the sharing with our
children was just amazing.

00:37:30.828 --> 00:37:31.620
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.970
Thank you again for your story.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.830
My question was,
was there a moment

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.010
after you came to America
where you realized

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.070
that you had this story to
share and how you kind of got

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.590
the voice to share
your experiences

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.198
outside your family?

00:37:46.198 --> 00:37:48.490
IRENE BUTTER: Well, that's
a really important question.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:53.890
When I arrived in New
York and my relatives

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.740
took-- they picked me up
at Grand Central Station.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.300
We went on the
subway to the Bronx,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.570
where they lived, and
got to their apartment.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.650
And they said this.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.400
They said, now you're
here in America, finally.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.800
You have to start a new life.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.790
You have to forget about the
past and never speak about it.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:18.220
And this is a message that many
survivors received when they

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.290
first came to this country--

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.700
never talk about it.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.750
If we mentioned it at all, we
would be silenced immediately.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.490
And so this led to four
decades of silence,

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.340
where even my mother,
my brother, and I rarely

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.170
talked about it, and
certainly not in any depth.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.260
And then in the '80s,
things started happening.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:47.590
Elie Wiesel, who was the leading
spokesperson for the victims

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.730
and survivors of the Holocaust,
I heard him speak once.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.270
And this is what he said.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:58.660
He said, if you were at the
camps, if you smelled the air

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.510
and heard the
silence of the dead,

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:07.630
it is your duty to be a
witness, to provide testimony,

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.670
to tell the story.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.850
And that made a deep
impression on me.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:18.280
And then in the late '80s, there
was an Anne Frank exhibition.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.990
It traveled all
over the country.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.030
It ended up in Detroit.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:27.040
And I was invited
to speak on a panel.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.210
And I was trying to
decide what would I say.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:36.780
And I just became aware that
this was all about Anne Frank.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.960
Anne Frank wasn't here
to tell her story.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.620
Her voice was silenced forever.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.820
And I was given
the gift of life.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.270
So it is my duty to
tell the stories.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.590
And then I started
talking in schools.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:40:00.580
And I've been talking
more than 35 years now.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.610
And I haven't shut up.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.740
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about your time in school

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.210
as probably one of the
only females in your class?

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.540
And maybe what you went
through, and was it positive?

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.890
Was it negative?

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:20.190
Did people receive
you well as a female?

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.660
IRENE BUTTER: Well, I went to
graduate school in the '50s.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.900
And people treated me very well.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.480
I wasn't aware of any
form of discrimination.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.460
But you know, it was the '50s.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.270
And we weren't as aware
of discrimination.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.200
So one day, we had
a group like you,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.970
maybe, a group of students
who had a little money.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:47.460
We could invite economists to
come and speak to us, you know?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.640
And I was always making
the hors d'oeuvres.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.570
And one of my professors
one day said, maybe

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.330
this should be your career.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.470
And I didn't consider it as
being a discriminatory comment.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.960
But maybe it was.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.690
Maybe he was giving
me a message I didn't

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.910
belong in economics, right?

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:15.530
But in general, I did not
experience discrimination,

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.580
not here--

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.000
well, here at the
University, it's interesting.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.520
When we came in the '60s, there
was a nepotism law on campus.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.820
And that meant that husband and
wife could not receive tenure

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.220
if we were in the same college.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.410
And my husband
was in psychology,

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.790
and I was in economics.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.450
And that's in the same college
in literature, science,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.470
and arts.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.100
So I would not have
been able to get tenure.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.230
And that's how I transferred
to public health.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.300
But that law is long gone.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you
again for speaking.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.340
As a mother of a
seven-year-old myself,

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.290
it really touched me when you
were talking about being seven

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.600
and starting this journey.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.160
And what I struggle
with every day

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.840
is seeing sometimes the anger
and intolerance that we even

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.660
see in our own country today.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.550
What advice do you
have to parents

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.310
to be able to help our
children deal with this

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.250
and help our children make
the world a better place,

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:24.227
despite what they may be
seeing and experiencing?

00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:26.310
IRENE BUTTER: Well, it's
interesting you ask this.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:31.840
Because these things are
not taught in school,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.800
which is very unfortunate.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.680
And I think parents can
be models for their kids.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.420
And you know, my theme
is, never a bystander.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.990
When you see bullying,
when you see injustice,

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.630
you see mistreatment,
you can't turn your back.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.820
You need to do something.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.950
You need to interrupt
or intervene.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:57.880
And I think if parents model
that, then children will learn.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.450
But they're not going to get
it in school, most likely.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:05.140
And this morning,
there was a program

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.400
on "1A," Joshua Johnson,
about whether schools

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.980
teach about the environment, the
destruction of the environment.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.630
And very few schools
teach that subject.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.490
And you know, that's
another example,

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.670
things that are so
crucial to learn

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.030
are not included
in the curriculum.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:34.140
So whatever you can do about
the school that your kids go to,

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.590
and whatever you can do
to model the right thing.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:43.470
I think "do an act of kindness"
should be the motto every day.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.730
If you do it every day, it could
be just a tiny little thing,

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.050
then it becomes a habit.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.920
And then you can move on to
other kinds of behaviors.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.220
But I think it's very
frightening what's

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.150
happening now, all the
hatred and all the bigotry

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:06.300
and discrimination we see and
deportation of certain groups.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.850
We need to be change-makers.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.620
We need to be active.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.610
And one kind of behavior that's
definitely very important

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.170
is voting.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.040
Young people don't have
a good voting record.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.940
And they need to
become more involved.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.440
I mean, voting is one of the
privileges in a democracy.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.880
You can make a difference.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.730
Every person can
make a difference.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:34.460
And just to become more
aware of what's going on

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:40.282
and what we can do is
definitely a high priority.

00:44:40.282 --> 00:44:41.740
AUDIENCE: I would
love to know what

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.860
inspired you to form the
group of Jewish and Arab women

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.640
to have open dialogue
with each other.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.110
IRENE BUTTER:
Well, first of all,

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:57.620
my daughter, when she
graduated from high school,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.070
she left home and
went to Israel,

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:03.280
she said to find
her Jewish identity.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.700
And she married a Palestinian.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:12.310
So I became familiar
with another culture,

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.960
with Palestinians.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.410
And whenever I
went over there, I

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:23.780
saw the divide between Jewish
and Palestinian people.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.310
And it concerned me because
I have two granddaughters who

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.590
have a double identity.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:35.290
And I wanted to work for a world
where they would be recognized

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.080
as equals by both peoples.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.760
So things got worse and
worse in the Middle East.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.810
And at one point, I had some
friends, Jewish friends,

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.010
who had kids there.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.570
And then started the intifadas
and all the uprisings.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:56.390
And we were concerned about
our families over there.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:03.400
So that's how we
started doing this.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.110
Six of the 12 women are still
there from the original group.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:11.570
And others have moved
away, and things happened.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.560
But we try to work for peace.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.940
But there isn't much we can
do at this point except model

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.990
our friendships and our
connections and give talks.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:30.410
And we go to churches and
schools and university classes.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:34.310
And everybody can do
this with any two groups.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.610
And once you try, you
find out how satisfying

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:42.320
it is to cross the divide
and learn from each other

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.890
and be open to
cultural differences.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.110
And when you do
that, you find out

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:53.240
that the differences are
far smaller than what we all

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.130
have in common.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.763
So I definitely recommend it.

00:46:58.763 --> 00:47:00.180
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious what got you

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.150
through some of the most
difficult times in your life,

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.680
back in the camps?

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.230
Do you attribute
that to your faith?

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.790
Was it love of your family?

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:12.060
Was it the promise of
freedom at some point?

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.030
What got you through
those periods of hell?

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.690
IRENE BUTTER: Well, in a way,
it's a non-answerable question.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:25.390
But I really wanted to live.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:28.580
And I think you have
to have a purpose when

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.730
you're living under those
circumstances, where each--

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:35.450
the next day is always
worse than the previous day.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:40.950
And I saw my parents' health
deteriorating so rapidly.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:44.430
So I was taking care of them
and that had to keep me going.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:49.400
I had to be there to do
whatever I could for them.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.510
And I also had a dream.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:54.890
Well, I had several dreams.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:58.250
One was to be a dog
under the dinner

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.600
table in the home
of a wealthy family.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.010
That was one dream.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.810
And my other dream was that
when I was a little girl,

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.120
I read books about Heidi.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.670
I don't know if people
still read Heidi books.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:13.640
And Heidi was an
orphan and she went

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.330
to live with her grandfather in
Switzerland in the mountains.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.400
And she did a lot of skiing.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.820
And I wanted to survive so
I could go to Switzerland

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.455
and learn how to ski.

00:48:24.455 --> 00:48:25.490
I never did.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.930
But it kept me going.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:32.750
SPEAKER 1: With that, we are
going to complete this session.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.200
Irene, a huge, huge
thank you on behalf

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.620
of Google Ann Arbor for coming
and sharing your story here

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.370
today with us.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:41.000
IRENE BUTTER: Thank you.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.042
Thank you all for coming.

00:48:42.042 --> 00:48:44.950
[APPLAUSE]
