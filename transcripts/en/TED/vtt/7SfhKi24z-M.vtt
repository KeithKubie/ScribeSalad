00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.360
I want to share with you

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.040
a moment in my life

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.800
when the hurt and wounds of racism

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.320
were both deadly and paralyzing for me.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.200
And I think what I've learned

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.400
can be a source of healing for all of us.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.160
When I was 17 years old,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.720
I was a college student
at Tuskegee University,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.416
and I was a worker
in the Southern freedom movement,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.080
which we call the Civil Rights Movement.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.360
During this time,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.976
I met another young 26-year-old,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.016
white seminary and college student

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.400
named Jonathan Daniels,
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.400
He and I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.120
were both part of a generation
of idealistic young people,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.096
whose life has been ignited

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.576
by the freedom fire

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.576
that ordinary black people
were spreading around the nation

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480
and throughout the South.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.960
We had come to Lowndes County

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.240
to work in the movement.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.456
And it was a nonviolent movement

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.200
to redeem the souls of America.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.416
We believe that everyone,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.976
both black and white,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.840
people in the South,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.360
could find a redemptive pathway

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.696
out of the stranglehold of racism

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.400
that had gripped them
for more than 400 years.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.720
And on a hot, summer day in August,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.736
Jonathan and I joined a demonstration

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.496
of local young black people,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.080
who were protesting the exploitation

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.856
[of] black sharecroppers

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.040
by rich land holders
who cheated them out of their money.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.120
We decided to demonstrate alongside them.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.240
And on the morning that we showed up
for the demonstration,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.296
we were met with a mob
of howling white men

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.440
with baseball bats, shotguns

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.920
and any weapon that you could imagine.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.320
And they were threatening to kill us.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.600
And the sheriff,
seeing the danger that we faced,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.776
arrested us and put us on a garbage truck

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800
and took us to the local jail,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.456
where we were put in cells

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.600
with the most inhumane
conditions you can imagine.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.720
And we were threatened by the jailers

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.120
with drinking water
that came from toilets.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.080
We were finally released on the sixth day,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.096
without any knowledge,
without any forewarning.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.896
Just out of the clear blue sky,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360
we were made to leave.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.536
And we knew that this
was a dangerous sign,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.936
because Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney
had also been forced to leave jail

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.480
and were murdered because no one knew
what had happened to them.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.760
And so, despite our fervent resistance,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.376
the sheriff made us leave the jail,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160
and of course, nobody was waiting for us.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.720
It was hot,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.816
one of those Southern days

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.560
where you could
literally feel the pavement --

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.000
the vapor seeping out of the pavement.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.200
And the group of about 14 of us

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.440
selected Jonathan Daniels,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.536
Father Morrisroe, who had recently
come to the county,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.416
Joyce Bailey, a local 17-year-old girl

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.520
and I to go and get the drinks.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.240
When we got to the door,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.696
a white man was standing
in the doorway with a shotgun,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.200
and he said, "Bitch,
I'll blow your brains out!"

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.736
And before I could even react,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.616
before I could even process
what was going on,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.760
Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.720
and I fell back, thinking that I was dead.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.616
And in that instant, when I looked up,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.440
Jonathan Daniels
was standing in the line of fire,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.480
and he took the blast,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.720
and he saved my life.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.720
I was so traumatized

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.800
and paralyzed by that event,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.840
where Tom Coleman deliberately,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.240
with malicious intent,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.416
killed my beloved friend and colleague,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.360
Jonathan Myrick Daniels.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.600
On that day,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.680
which was one of the most
important days in my life,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200
I saw both love and hate

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.936
coming from two very different white men

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.000
that represented the best
and the worst of white America.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.576
So deep was my hurt

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.336
at seeing Tom Coleman
murder Jonathan before my eyes,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.256
that I became a silent person,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.040
and I did not speak

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.200
for six months.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.056
I finally learned to touch that hurt in me

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.576
as I became older

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.976
and began to talk about
the Southern freedom movement,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.816
and began to connect my stories

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.576
with the stories of my other colleagues
and freedom fighters,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.216
who, like me, had faced
deadly trauma of racism,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.496
and who had lost friends along the way,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.320
and who themselves
have been beaten and thrown in jail.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.600
It is 50 years later.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.560
Many people were beaten
and thrown in jail.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.880
Others were murdered
like Jonathan Daniels.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.816
And yet, we are still, as a nation,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.800
mired down

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.920
in the quicksand of racism.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.136
And everywhere I go around the nation,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.039
I see and hear the hurt.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.655
And I ask people everywhere,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.200
"Tell me, where does it hurt?"

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.096
Do you see and feel the hurt

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.840
that I see and feel?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.200
I feel and see the hurt
in black and brown people

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.480
who every day feel
the vicious volley of racism

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.280
and every day have their
civil and human rights stripped away.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.216
And the people who do this
use stereotypes and myths

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.360
to justify doing it.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.440
Everywhere I go,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.680
I see and hear women

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.736
who speak out against --

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.040
who speak out against
men who invade our bodies.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.496
These same men who then turn around --

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.016
the same men who promote racism

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.840
and then turn around and steal our labor
and pay us unequal wages.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.376
I hear and feel the hurt of white men

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.480
at the betrayal by
the same powerful white men

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.680
who tell them that their skin color

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.176
is their ticket to a good life and power,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.016
only to discover,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.496
as the circle of whiteness narrows,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.696
that their tickets have expired

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.440
and no longer carry first-class status.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.640
Now that we've touched the hurt,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.416
we must ask ourselves,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.080
"Where does it hurt

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.080
and what is the source of the hurt?"

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.616
I propose that we must look

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.000
deeply into the culture of whiteness.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.736
That is a river that drowns out
all of our identities

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.280
and drowns us in false uniformity
to protect the status quo.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.896
Notice, everybody,
I said culture of whiteness,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.976
and not white people.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.976
Because in my estimation,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.120
the problem is not white people.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.560
Instead, it is the culture of whiteness.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.696
And by culture of whiteness,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.696
I mean a systemic and organized
set of beliefs,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:48.200
values, canonized knowledge
and even religion,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.376
to maintain a hierarchical,
over-and-against power structure

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.000
based on skin color,
against people of color.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.440
It is a culture

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.520
where white people are seen
as necessary and friendly insiders,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.680
while people of color,
especially black people,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.360
are seen as dangerous

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.576
and threatening outsiders,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.856
who pose a clear and present danger

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.080
to the safety and the efficacy

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.920
of the culture of whiteness.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.176
Listen to me and see if you can imagine

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.536
the culture of whiteness
as a dehumanizing process

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.016
that melts away

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.976
all of our multiple
and interlocking identities,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.816
such as race, class,
gender and sexualities,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.040
so that ...

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.640
so that unity is maintained for power.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.040
I believe, because I know

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.496
and believe that the culture of whiteness

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.560
is a social construct.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.496
Each of us, from birth to death,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.816
are socialized in this culture.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.856
And it marks people of color also.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.416
And it makes people of color,
like white people,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.680
vote against our interests.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.536
Some of you might ask --

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.816
and my students always tell me
I give hard assignments --

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.680
some of you might ask, and rightfully so,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.376
"How do we fix this?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.640
It seems so all-powerful
and overwhelming."

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.096
I believe that we must fix it,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.576
because we cannot humanize our future

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.336
if we continue to be complicit

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.720
with the culture of whiteness.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.096
Each of us must connect
with our authentic selves,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.376
with our authentic ethnic selves.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.520
And we must connect
with the other aspects of our identities.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.376
And we must move out of the constructs

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.016
of whiteness, brownness and blackness

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.160
to become who we are at our fullest.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.456
How do we do this?

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.976
I believe that we do this
through our collective narratives.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.160
And our collective narratives
must contain our individual stories,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.456
the arts,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.680
spiritual reflections,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.000
literature,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.376
and yes, even drumming.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.000
(Laughter)

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.376
It must be a collective telling,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.816
because individual stories
just create a paradigm

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.760
where we are pitting one story
against another story.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.920
These different models
that I have talked about tonight

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.616
I think are essential
to providing us a pathway

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.696
out of the quagmire of racism.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.656
And I want to talk about
another very important model.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.320
And that is redemption.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.656
I believe that movements
for racial justice

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.536
must be redemptive rather than punitive.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.416
And yes, I believe

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.640
that we must provide the possibility
of redemption for everyone.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.936
And we must be willing,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.376
despite some of the vitriolic language

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.416
that might come from
those very people who oppress us,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.976
I think that we must listen to them

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.920
and try to figure out where do they hurt.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.016
We must do this, I believe,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.936
because our redemption
is tied into their redemption,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.456
And we will not be free

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.120
until we've all been redeemed
from unredemptive anger.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.400
The challenge is not easy.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:22.776
And in a technological society,
it grows even more complicated,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.496
because often we use technologies

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.240
to perpetuate the very values of racism
that we indulge in every day.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.839
We use technology to bully,

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:39.359
to perpetuate hate speech

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.160
and to degrade each other's humanities.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.656
And so I believe that
if we're going to humanize the future,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.936
we must design ways to use technology

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.416
not to degrade us, but to elevate us

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.816
so that we can live
into the fullest of our capacities.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.576
And I believe that technology

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.856
must provide us larger vistas

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.536
so that we might engage with each other

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.760
and move beyond the segregated spaces
that we live in, every day of our lives.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.360
I believe

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.200
that we can achieve this
if we set our minds

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.280
and hopes on the prize.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.120
The question before us tonight

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.240
is very serious.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.240
It is: "Do you want to be healed?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.800
Do you want to be healed?"

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.616
Do you want to become whole
and live into all of your identities?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.216
Or do you want to continue
to cannibalize your multiple identities

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.720
and privilege one identity over the other?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.800
Do you want to join a long line

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.720
of generations of people

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.456
who believed in the promise of America

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.920
and had the faith to upbuild democracy?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.416
Do you want to live
into the fullest of your potential?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.016
I certainly do.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.760
And I believe you do, too.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.056
Let me just say, quite seriously,

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.720
I believe in you.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.760
And despite everything,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.560
I still believe in America.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.296
I hope that this offering
that I've given to you tonight,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.856
that I've shared with you tonight,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.656
will provide redemptive pathways

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.256
so that you might claim
the fullest of your identity

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.096
and become a major participant

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.536
in humanizing not only
the future for yourselves,

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.840
but also for our democracy.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.776
Thank you.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.000
(Applause)
