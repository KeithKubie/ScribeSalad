00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:13.290
Setting Fire to Glass - Chlorine Trifluoride

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.180
First discovered back in the 1930s, chlorine
trifluoride is a rather curious chemical that

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.900
easily reacts, sometimes explosively, with
just about every known substance on Earth.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.410
Just to get the ball rolling, here’s a few
of the more unusual things chlorine trifluoride

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.410
is known to set fire to on contact: glass,
sand, asbestos, rust, concrete, people, pyrex,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.809
cloth, and the dreams of children…

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.590
Obviously the first question to answer here
is how chlorine trifluoride is somehow able

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.909
to cause asbestos, a substance that is known
for being almost completely fire retardant,

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:49.909
to catch on fire.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.420
Well, that’s because chlorine trifluoride
is a more powerful oxidizing agent by mass

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.020
than oxygen itself.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.440
Meaning it’s capable of rapidly oxidizing
things that would normally be considered practically

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.750
“impossible” to set aflame, like asbestos.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.810
Chlorine trifluoride is such an effective
oxidizer that it can even potentially set

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.409
fire to things that have seemingly already
been burned up, like ash or spent charcoal.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.200
The substance is so highly reactive that famously
unreactive elements like platinum, osmium

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.229
and iridium will begin to corrode when they
come into contact with it.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.719
Notably tough elements like titanium and tungsten
are also regarded as being wholly unsuitable

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.259
to storing the chemical because they set on
fire as soon as they come into contact with

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.259
it.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.179
The only known way to store chlorine trifluoride
“safely”, which we use in the loosest

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.640
possible sense, is to put it inside of a sealed
containers made of steel, iron, nickel or

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.590
copper which are able to contain the chemical
safely if they’re first treated with flourine

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
gas.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.220
This is because doing so will coat the metal
in a thin fluoride layer, with which the chemical

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.289
won’t react.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.920
However, if this layer is compromised in anyway,
or the metal isn’t completely dry, chlorine

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.110
trifluoride will begin to react violently
and cause the vessel to explode.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.510
A few of the other things known to not react
with chlorine trifluoride include nitrogen,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.060
the inert gases and polychlorotrifluoroethylene.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.870
Rather fortunately, chlorine trifluoride doesn’t
react with air unless it happens to contain

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.790
a larger than average amount of water vapor.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.360
Speaking of which, when chlorine trifluoride
comes into contact with water, it will react

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.030
explosively with it and as a fun byproduct
creates large amounts of dangerous gasses

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.280
such as hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric
acid.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.909
Hydrofluric acid in particular is incredibly
dangerous and along with being able to melt

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.310
things like glass and concrete, can permanently
damage your lungs and eyes.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.939
As if that wasn’t worrying enough, if you’re
ever unlucky enough to get hydrofluric acid

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.060
on your skin, it doesn’t actually hurt until
a few hours later.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.550
After it has absorbed a bit, it starts destroying
your nerves and bones and can ultimately cause

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.240
cardiac arrest when it gets into your blood
stream.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.030
In fact, in 1994 a lab technician in Australia
accidentally spilled hydrofluric acid on his

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.700
lap and despite immediately executing safety
procedures including hosing off, immersing

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.750
himself in a swimming pool, and later extensive
medical care (including needing to have one

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.590
of his legs amputated), within two weeks of
the accident, he was dead.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.079
Unsurprisingly, the Nazis were really interested
in the military applications of chlorine trifluoride.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.879
After all, it’s a substance that reacts
explosively with water (humans are largely

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.560
bags of water), and for those that don’t
come in contact with it directly, there’s

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.489
the byproduct of the deadly gasses.

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.019
Further, there is really little one can do
to put out the fires it causes directly other

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.750
than to let them burn off.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.280
If you throw water on the source of the problem,
it will get worse.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.640
The reaction here also doesn’t require atmospheric
oxygen to burn, so trying to use that method

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.150
of fire suppression won’t work either.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.450
Though chlorine trifluoride was thankfully
never used during combat, the Nazis did succeed

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.150
in creating several tons of the stuff in a
secret facility known as the Falkenhagen Bunker

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.420
before it was captured by the Russians in
1944.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.510
The Nazis working in the Falkenhagen Bunker
referred to chlorine trifluoride simply as

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.540
“Substance N” or “N-Stoff” and were
planning to store it inside specially designed

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.850
shells which could be used in battle.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.340
According to reports released by the Soviets
following WW2, Nazi trials involving substance

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.340
N were promising.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.440
But, of course, the weapon was incredibly
dangerous for those carrying it around too,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.240
not just those they launch it at.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.500
As an example of the kind of devastation chlorine
trifluoride can have, you only need to consider

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.580
what happened when almost a ton of this stuff
was accidentally spilled inside of a warehouse

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.950
in the 1950s.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.660
According to eyewitness reports, the chemical
burned straight through a foot of concrete

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.930
and three feet of gravel while simultaneously
releasing a deadly cloud of gas containing

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.210
a cocktail of “chlorine trifluoride, hydrogen
fluoride, chlorine and hydrogen chloride”

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.880
that corroded every surface it came into contact
with.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.120
After reading this you’re probably curious
about what possible purpose this chemical

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.060
could serve that doesn’t involve trying
to recreate a scene from a Michael Bay movie.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.990
Well, due to the fact that chlorine trifluoride
is such a great oxidizer, there have been

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.841
several attempts to use it as a low-cost,
lightweight rocket fuel, starting with the

00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:34.303
Nazis who tried to use it to propel torpedoes.

00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:37.770
Of course, it’s so difficult to store safely
that it’s generally considered not to be

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.970
worth the risk for this usage.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.880
After all, while you’d need to use less
fuel thanks to its extreme oxidizing capabilities,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.590
if you had a rocket accident, you’d potentially
be spewing tons of this stuff all over the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.370
place with no real effective way to deal with
the situation.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.780
For instance, after studying and experimenting
with this chemical for rocket use, rocket

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.850
scientist Dr. John D. Clark famously said
about the best way to deal with potential

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.830
chlorine trifluoride rocket accidents- “I
have always recommended a good pair of running

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.830
shoes.”

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.550
There are a couple other useful applications
though.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.030
For instance, it’s great for plasmaless
cleaning of certain surfaces used in semiconductor

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.440
manufacturing and it also works well at cleaning
uranium residue off of the walls of nuclear

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:37.710
power plants and removing built up oxides.
