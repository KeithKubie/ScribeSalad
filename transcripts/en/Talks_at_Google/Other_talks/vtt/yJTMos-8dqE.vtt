00:00:01.707 --> 00:00:02.290
NICOLE: Hello.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.059
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.330
I am very delighted today
to introduce to you someone

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.370
whose work I greatly admire.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.540
She is a very warm and
genuine person, and one

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.180
who speaks from the heart with
great authenticity, depth,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.280
and candidness-- Ruth Ross,
the author of, "Coming

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.450
Alive, the Journey to Reengage
Your Life and Career."

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.010
My name is Nicole
[? Print, ?] and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.210
I am a member of Google's
People Operations Team.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.830
I myself am deeply fascinated
by the topic of engagement.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.040
And when Ruth's book was brought
to the attention of our Google

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.482
Talks group, I was thrilled
to have the opportunity

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:40.815
to invite Ruth to speak here,
and was even more thrilled

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:43.210
when she accepted.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.800
So Ruth has a history of 30
years as a human resources

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.290
executive at several world
renowned brands such as Wells

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
Fargo, American Express,
and Charles Schwab.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.220
And today, she will tell us a
bit about her own experience

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.647
with disengagement throughout
her talking through her book.

00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:08.480
RUTH K. ROSS: Great.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.740
NICOLE: So if you please join
me in welcoming Ruth Ross.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.031
RUTH K. ROSS: Great, thank you.

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:13.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.990
Thank You.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690
NICOLE: Having admitted to
being disengaged at one point

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.670
yourself, can you give us a
little bit of your back story

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490
in terms of your
experience and why

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.790
you decided to write this book?

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.581
RUTH K. ROSS: Sure.

00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:27.320
First of all, thank
you so much for coming.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.090
I know there are many choices
you have to do with your time,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.070
especially at lunch.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
And so I'm very honored
that you're here.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.820
And so let me just
start off by giving you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.290
a little bit of a
quick background.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.330
As Nicole said, I was a
human resources executive

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.890
for 30 years.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.530
So that means I started
when I was a teenager.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.590
And we're all just going
to believe that premise,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.120
and go from there.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.560
And so I worked the
first half of my career

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.470
in New York City for
some incredible companies

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.040
and spent time down
on Wall Street.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.340
And in 1996, was recruited
by Charles Schwab

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.360
to come to San Francisco.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.584
Best decision I ever made.

00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:05.500
First of all, come on.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.090
Let's be real.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.560
Living in the Bay Area, but
worked for a phenomenal company

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.780
at a time when they were
growing substantially.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.710
And then spent the last
10 years of my career

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.280
as an executive VP of
HR for Wells Fargo Bank

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.330
during some of the
most turbulent times

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.050
that one could ever imagine
in the workplace, right?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.300
2008, the world's
coming to an end

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.760
from a financial perspective.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.355
And I was actually
working for the CFO

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:35.640
of the company at the time.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.280
And not long after, Wells
Fargo did a major acquisition,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.976
doubled in size overnight.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.350
And you can just
imagine the kind

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.150
of craziness and the
amount of work that ensued.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.290
And somewhere along the way, I
want to say kind of late 2010,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.080
I had what I referred to as my,
"face in the mirror," moment.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.580
So like we all do, we get up in
the morning and take a shower,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.130
get dressed.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.280
And I was looking in the
mirror, combing my hair,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.270
putting on my makeup.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.260
Thankfully, my husband was
already out of the house.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.710
And I literally stopped,
looked in the mirror,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.580
and I just screamed
out loud-- and I'll

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.540
make it clean because
we're on video,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.690
but-- when are you
ever going to admit

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.320
that you are
completely dead inside?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.820
Just screamed it.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.130
Kind of stood there and said,
my passion for what I did

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.680
was gone.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.240
I had always prided myself
that I was very passionate.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.150
I believed in what I did.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.340
But I was dead inside.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.870
And there are just
so many reasons.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.330
And we'll talk more about
that as we get into this.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.520
But that was my epiphany, my
"face in the mirror" moment.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.300
And I knew, in that split
second that I screamed,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.640
that I had to do something
about it to change my life.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.530
Fast forward, kind
of created a plan.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.740
Circumstances arose
such that I was

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.760
able, about nine
months later, to be

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.110
able to walk away and
start my new life.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.920
And my new life
was all about doing

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.760
what I was passionate
about and what gave me joy.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.630
And part of that
was helping others.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.380
And I won't make anyone
raise their hands,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.630
because I would never
embarrass people this way.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.010
But if you just
think to yourself,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.120
my guess is, every one of us
has either been through this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.030
personally, know
someone close to us--

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.310
a friend, a colleague,
a relative--

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.850
who's gone through some
bout with disengagement.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.280
Or maybe you manage
someone who's disengaged,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.830
because I bet
everyone of us has.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.200
It's that pervasive out there.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.970
70% of the US workforce
has identified

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.240
themselves as disengaged.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.170
That means only 30% are truly
engaged in what they do.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.590
And my guess is they're all
sitting right here in Google

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.230
and not anywhere else.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.860
And in the world, only
13% of people are engaged.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.030
So it's a pretty big issue.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.640
And I started talking to people
about what I went through.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.990
And everybody had a story.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.140
And the next thing you know,
I did something really crazy.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.695
I decided to write a book.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:32.320
And I'm sitting here today.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.960
NICOLE: Why did you decide to
call the book, "Coming Alive,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.205
The Journey to Reengage
Your Life and Career?"

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:38.746
RUTH K. ROSS: So
the reason I decided

00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:41.380
to call the book what I did
is that a couple of things

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.360
happened for me along the way.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.310
The first is that,
when we go to school

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.480
and we decide upon our career,
we embark on our first job,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.360
nobody hands you a
roadmap-- are there

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.240
still roadmaps out there--
or a GPS device, right?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.970
Nobody hands that to you.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.910
It's, go forth.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.070
Go work.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.120
And you don't think
about a career

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.040
that you're passionate
about, it's about a job.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.940
And really what it
is, it's a journey.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.090
And over the course
of your working life,

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.940
you may start out at
one place, but you're

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.575
going to go through a lot
of detours along the way.

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.325
And that's what
engagement's really about.

00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:25.500
It's that journey to
start an engagement

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.140
to get to where you want to be.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.390
You may detour
into disengagement,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.150
and hopefully end up
back at reengagement.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.230
The second reason I
called it what I did

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.880
is because I started to
realize that this isn't just

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.450
about a work issue.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.430
You can't compartmentalize
your life.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.720
What happens at work
affects you at home.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.400
And what happens at home
impacts you at work.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.610
If you're dealing with
some issues at home--

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.220
whether it's maybe with
children, or financial issues,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.690
or relationship issues-- and
you're stressed out about that,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.570
trust me, when you get dressed
in the morning, that stress

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.370
gets dressed with you
and comes into work.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.070
If you're dealing with an
issue in the workplace--

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.650
let's say you are
being bullied at work.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.380
I've been through that.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.130
I don't just leave
that at the door

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.690
when I leave the
office at night.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.700
Those feelings
come home with you.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.520
And so that's why I decided
to really look at this as

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.360
about being reengaged
and coming alive in both

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.025
your work and your life.

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:46.150
NICOLE: Throughout your
book, and as you mentioned,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.191
you highlight that
disengagement affects everyone

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:51.045
from college students
to executives.

00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:53.420
And your book is written in
a very practical and personal

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.781
manner, rather than
as an academic study.

00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.780
Was this your intent to
write the book that way?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.420
And if so, why did you choose
to write in that style?

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.170
RUTH K. ROSS:
Absolutely my intent.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.100
It was not accidental.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.850
You know, engagement is
a topic that, believe me,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.320
there are thousands of books
out there on this topic.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.030
Everyone is talking about it.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.700
And there's some incredible
works that are out there.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.360
And there's a lot of
people who have written

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.810
from a very academic and
theoretical perspective.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.270
And that's great.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.270
And I admire many of them.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.450
That's not me.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:38.320
I'm really of the plain talking,
from the heart, keep it simple

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.150
and tell stories, because
this really is personal.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.645
And I wanted something that
is really easy to read,

00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.770
that you can pick up at
any time and get through it

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.170
in one sitting.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.060
It's only 126 pages.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.660
And I think the best
compliment that I've

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.550
heard from people who have read
the book is when I hear people

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.110
say things to me like, it was
the first time since college

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.030
that I took out a highlighter.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.690
And I dog-eared some pages.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.480
And I just keep
going back to it.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.720
I can't have a better
compliment than that.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.510
So truly, that's
exactly what I wanted.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.040
NICOLE: Now, in
your book, you say

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.160
that engagement can occur
at an exquisite level

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.850
between your heart,
and soul, and career.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.510
What's the connection
for you between your work

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.102
on reengagement and your heart?

00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:30.810
RUTH K. ROSS: There
is such a connection.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.000
You know, we all think about
the heart and how-- you know,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.940
I'm looking around this
room, and a lot of you

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.130
are trying to eat
really healthy today.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.720
Not all of you,
but a lot of you.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.600
And it's all about exercising.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.370
We were talking
earlier about running.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.580
And there's so much that
people do to really work

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.440
on being heart healthy,
when, truth be told,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.810
you also have to work on
it from a work perspective.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.410
When you love what
you do and you're

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.840
passionate about what you
do, it impacts your heart

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.876
in a really great way.

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:08.250
And you know, one
of the things I

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.650
think about, when we hear
the word, engagement--

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.980
and if you're not
someone like Nicole

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.860
and I who live about this
stuff and we study it--

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.800
but to most people, engagement
is when you commit yourself

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.220
in a deeply committed
partnership with the person you

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.060
love.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.220
It's when one person usually
gets down on one knee

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.400
and asks someone to marry
them or be in a partnership.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.070
But truth be told,
you can also really

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.770
commit in a deep way to
the mission and vision

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.400
and values of a
company, as well.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.270
And when I think about this,
and I think about some examples,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:51.900
when people just say, I do
a job, as versus a career,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.590
think about the doctor
who doesn't just

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.880
say they practice
medicine, but rather they

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.800
tell you they save lives.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.410
Or a personal injury attorney
who doesn't just practice law,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.270
but they actually stand
up for others who can't.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.360
Or maybe it's the
owner of a mom and pop

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.730
pharmacy who stays an hour
after closing because he heard

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.320
that a little boy in the
neighborhood was sick

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.020
and needed medicine.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.410
Or it's the chef who owns
an Italian restaurant

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.720
and gets up at the crack of
dawn to make pasta from scratch,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.950
because that's how
his grandmother did it

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.190
in the old country.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.210
That's not about just
going to a job, that's

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.440
being passionate about
the work that you do.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.550
And I'll share a quick,
little story with you

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.080
that really brings
it home for me

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.410
around the question that
Nicole just asked me.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.940
So my mother-in-law
is 89 years old.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.090
And she's had Alzheimer's
for a number of years now.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.840
And she's doing fantastic.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.960
She's really,
really doing great.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.700
And my husband is very
diligent about calling her

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.680
on a frequent basis.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.850
And when you have a
conversation with someone

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:12.520
who has Alzheimer's, some day,
it can be a great conversation.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.945
And some days, you struggle.

00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:15.540
Right?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.050
It's difficult.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.390
Well, on this particular
day, she was doing fantastic.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.770
And she was asking about me.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.020
And my husband, whose name
is Sandy, said to her, Mom,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.310
do you remember?

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.611
I told you Ruth
was writing a book.

00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.110
Well, I'm really excited to
tell you, she's now finished it.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.750
And it's with the publisher.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.230
And so she asked my
husband, what's it about?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.740
And he said, with
some trepidation,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.040
he said, it's about
employee engagement.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.820
And the reason he hesitated
was, his mother has not

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:56.082
been in the workplace in
probably over 50, 55 years.

00:12:56.082 --> 00:12:58.540
How is she going to understand
what employee engagement is?

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.710
So he takes a deep
breath, and he

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.390
gets ready to tell her what
employee engagement is all

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.520
about.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.780
And she stops him mid-sentence
and said, oh, honey, I

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.790
know what that's about.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.500
That's when you
have employees who

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.890
are hands-on and have
their hearts open.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.044
Can't say it better than that.

00:13:20.044 --> 00:13:22.410
NICOLE: Very cool.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.570
So at Google, we strive to
create a magical culture

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.050
and magical experiences
for our employees.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.980
What are the must-haves
a company needs in order

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.182
to achieve high engagement?

00:13:33.182 --> 00:13:34.890
RUTH K. ROSS: Yeah,
it's a great question

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.930
because, when I did ask around a
little bit about Google, what's

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.830
the one word you'd use
to describe culture,

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.440
and I did hear quite
a bit about magic.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.820
And for me, there is a magic
when you hit high engagement.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.400
And there are really
five must-haves

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.820
that employees want
from their employers.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.230
And the first is meaning.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.060
People want to work for a
company that has meaning.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.770
You can't get much
better than this company.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.890
The things that
you do and create

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.680
here change people's lives.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.350
That's meaning.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.440
You know, another company
I love to highlight

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.090
is Tom's Shoes, down
in Southern California.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:28.020
For every pair of shoes you buy,
Tom donates a pair of shoes.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.840
For every bag of coffee
you buy, they donate water

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.550
to people in need.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.390
That is incredible meaning.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.130
The next must-have is alignment.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.330
And alignment is
all about, every day

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.200
when you come into
work, you want

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.790
to know exactly where
the company is going.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.950
What's the mission?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.140
What's the purpose?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.580
What are you doing?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.240
Why are you here?

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.960
It's about being transparent.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.940
So alignment is really important
no matter where you work.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.270
The third must-have is growth.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.860
So back when I was
working in the workplace,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.930
we actually had things like
career ladders, you know?

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.880
You start at one
level, and then you

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.790
move to the next level
and the next title.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.350
Thankfully, that is long gone.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.800
And now, it's all about growth.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.220
It's about learning new things,
working on different projects.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.610
There are so many
programs here at Google

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.160
where you can transition
from one project to another,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.240
or bungee in and do
something, and then go back

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.770
to what you were doing.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.760
That's all about creating
an artist pallet of skills,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.900
as versus, how am I
getting to the next level

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.520
and the next level?

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.810
The fourth must-have is input.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.750
Every one of you
in this room today

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.730
and all of your colleagues
are here at Google

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.050
because you know
that people want

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.270
to hear what you have to say.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.430
And they ask you for
your opinion-- I hope--

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.820
and you give input
to what's going on.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.680
There's nothing worse than
working in an environment where

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.840
that feels stifled,
and you don't

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.650
feel like you have a voice.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.780
And the final-- and by now,
hopefully, you've figured out

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.330
I'm probably going to spell
magic-- so the fifth is, C,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.530
is context.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:35.180
And context is all about
the simple question of why.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.310
When you ask a kid
to do something,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.290
the first thing they
say to you is, why?

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.980
That doesn't change when
you get into the workplace.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.890
People want to understand
the why behind the what.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.120
And if you do nothing
else to create magic,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.040
it's about that context.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.980
Don't just make decisions
and tell people, but really

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.780
explain what's
behind the decision.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.630
Because I promise you,
if leaders do that,

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.860
people will follow them.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.887
And that will create magic.

00:17:03.887 --> 00:17:05.970
NICOLE: Throughout the
book, a lot of your stories

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.210
are representative of people
in very different stages

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.210
throughout their careers.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.220
How would you address
the misconception

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.619
that disengagement only occurs
after someone's been in a role

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.690
for a really long time and
have been somewhat jaded?

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.302
RUTH K. ROSS: There's definitely
a misconception about that.

00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:24.260
People think the longer
you've been in the job,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.500
the more that this happens.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.580
Truth be told, disengagement
doesn't discriminate.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.400
It doesn't matter if
you are first year out,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.200
if you're 30 years
into a career.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.560
It doesn't matter if you're
a secretary, or you're a CEO.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.500
It doesn't matter what part
of the country or the world

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.250
you live in.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.090
It can happen to
anyone at any time.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.670
I'm even seeing this
on college campuses

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.320
where people are
saying to me, wow,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.810
I need to take a step back,
because I'm in a major

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.900
that, maybe, this isn't
really what I want to do.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.220
So this happens to
people at all levels.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.954
And I'll tell you a quick,
funny story to illustrate this.

00:18:04.954 --> 00:18:06.370
About a year, year
and a half ago,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.210
I had a client I work with
out in Salt Lake City.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.220
And so I travel from the
Bay Area to Salt Lake a lot.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.290
And when you fly out, it's
these little two and two

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.320
across planes, so kind of
those intimate sardine cans.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.270
And I'm sitting on the aisle.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.910
And I met my neighbor, who
was in the window seat, when

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.080
he went to put his bag in
the overhead compartment,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.430
and his computer fell
and hit me in the head.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.690
Not a way I'd recommend
of meeting your seat mate.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.290
And of course, he
was very apologetic.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.520
And we started to
chat when he sat down.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.370
And we were talking
about what he does.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.670
And he creates videos in
the advertising space.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.010
And he asked me what I did.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.380
And I explained that
I was writing a book

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.380
about reengaging in
life and disengagement.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.980
And he turned to me and he
said, here's my contact info.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.250
I'm going through that now.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.895
You should interview
me for the book.

00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:04.800
So I said, great.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.540
Took his card.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.310
And he went back to do his work.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:12.270
And I went to read, probably,
some embarrassing magazine

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.430
like "US" or "People."

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.450
And about two minutes later, I
get a tap on my right shoulder

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.220
from the woman across the aisle.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.160
And by the way, this guy
was probably in his 30s,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.360
I would say.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.360
I get a tap from this woman.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.275
And she whispers to me, I
didn't mean to listen in,

00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:36.000
but I'd love to
talk to you as well.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.320
I've gone through that.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.140
And as a matter of fact, I'm
now relocating to the Bay Area

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.860
to take a new job
with my company

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.800
to hopefully get reengaged.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.990
And I said, who do you work for?

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.560
She goes, shh.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.600
And she points to her lapel
where there's a little pin.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.286
And it was the pin from the
airline that we were flying on.

00:19:57.286 --> 00:19:58.200
I said, OK.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.510
Shh.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.070
So I take her information.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.940
And about 20 minutes
later, we land.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:09.700
And I'd say that she was
probably in her 40s, early 40s.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.840
And on these small planes, you
have to gate check your bag.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.290
So I'm waiting at the jet way to
get my bag to go to my meeting,

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.320
and a woman comes up,
stands next to me.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.840
And probably a woman
in her early 60s.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.590
And she turns to me and
says, I was eavesdropping.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.360
I was sitting in the
aisle behind you,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.180
and I'd love to
talk to you as well.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.815
It turned out, she lived a block
away from me in San Francisco.

00:20:34.815 --> 00:20:37.440
There you have it,
three generations.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.320
NICOLE: How and when does
disengagement happen?

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.830
And what are some of
the underlying causes

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.180
that lead to disengagement?

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.370
RUTH K. ROSS: So disengagement
can happen in a moment

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.320
where you least expect it.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.080
And you can slide
in and out of this.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.690
And the best analogy
I can give is

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.360
that many of us, when
we were children,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.700
had a seesaw in a playground
or in our backyard

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.200
that we played on.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.820
And if you think about
a seesaw, the intent

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.120
is to be level and remain level.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.430
But any little motion
can cause one person

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.340
to soar high, and another
one to crash your butt

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.780
right on the floor.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.140
And a seesaw's in
constant motion.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.260
And that's what happens with
engagement and disengagement.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.540
You kind of float from
one thing to another.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.490
It's not usually one
particular event,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.270
but I call it a
series of paper cuts.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.830
My boss yelled at me in front
of some colleagues today-- paper

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.130
cut.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.100
My project got rejected
by someone-- paper cut.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.230
They just announced the third
reorganization in a year,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.100
and this one's dumber than
the previous two-- paper cut.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.730
Right?

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.800
So each one in itself,
you just deal with,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.920
just like a paper cut.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.262
Oh, it's annoying.

00:21:57.262 --> 00:21:57.970
And you complain.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.080
And then you go
about your business.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.950
But when one starts to
happen on top of another,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.000
on top of another, it
starts to cut deeper,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.240
and you start to bleed.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.579
And that's kind of what happens.

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:14.120
And so I mentioned
earlier that there

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.920
are lots of people
who have written books

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.140
around engagement.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.290
And the one thing we have
in common is that many of us

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.960
agree on some of the
underlying causes that

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.430
tend to bring this
feeling about.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.350
The first is the job's
not what was promised.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.070
Right?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.060
How many of us have been
sold something really great

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.070
about a job?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.580
And then we get there,
and we get involved in it,

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.050
and we're sort of like, what?

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.280
And you begin to feel like the
square peg in the round hole.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.430
That's one way.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.930
Another is this
feeling of being stuck.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.370
Maybe you've been in
the job for a long time.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.270
You're not moving
to the next level,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.040
or learning the new skill,
or maybe your compensation's

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.660
been frozen because you're
at the max of that level.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.630
That's feeling stuck.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.560
A third way is lack of
appreciation or recognition.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.962
How simple is it just to say,
thank you for a job well done?

00:23:14.962 --> 00:23:16.670
And I know you've got
lots of initiatives

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.610
here to appreciate
and recognize people.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.430
But sometimes, just a simple
thank you from a manager

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.590
can go a long way.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.770
The fourth underlying
cause is a bad manager.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.990
And these are usually people
who have every great intention

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.290
in the world, but they
don't know how to manage.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.800
And think about a
company like this,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.400
where you have a lot
of amazing people

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.790
that are individual
contributors.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.500
And you might be the best
technology person in the world,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.890
or the best marketing
person, or whatever.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.620
But somebody taps you on the
shoulder and goes, hey, Nicole.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.970
Congratulations,
you're now a manager.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.330
First thing I say is, now what?

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.430
That doesn't mean that you get
up all of a sudden the next day

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.800
and go, oh, I know
how to manage.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.630
I know how to coach and
write performance reviews

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.900
and do all of that stuff.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.390
And so that's the bad
manager, well-intentioned,

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.840
but needs some help.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.080
And the fifth is one
that's most troubling,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.120
because it's epidemic right now.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.514
And that's bullying or a
toxic work environment.

00:24:25.514 --> 00:24:27.430
And again, I won't
embarrass anyone by saying,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.805
have you ever
worked for a bully?

00:24:28.805 --> 00:24:32.160
But trust me, many of us have.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.980
Those bullies are everywhere
in the corporate environment.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.870
And that kind of toxicity
is one the leading causes

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.110
of disengagement.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.260
NICOLE: Through these
causes, are there

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.800
symptoms that someone would
show when they're disengaged?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.460
And how can we be better at
recognizing and diagnosing

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.195
those symptoms?

00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:53.320
RUTH K. ROSS: So I think
what happens with symptoms

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.160
is that, first, you
want to think about

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.691
what does a great, engaged,
magical culture look like?

00:24:58.691 --> 00:24:59.190
Right?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.340
And we can look around
Google and see a lot of that.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.850
But not every
company is as lucky.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.980
But the holy grail
is companies where

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.150
you see people who are really
creative, and innovative,

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.970
and willing to take risks.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.960
And they're energetic
about what they do.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.850
And they're committed.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.990
And you feel that vibrancy.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:23.770
What happens with disengagement
is it shows up in two ways.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.870
It shows up individually, and
it shows up organizationally.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.810
So let's talk
individually first.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.350
From an individual
perspective, what

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.830
you start to see in
people, maybe you

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.410
start to notice some mood
swings that, maybe, you

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.270
hadn't seen before.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.470
All of a sudden, people start
coming in a little later,

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.780
maybe leaving a little earlier.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.470
Maybe they're absent
a little bit more.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.620
In meetings, they
isolate themselves.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.070
You know, kind of like
they sit back with the arms

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.800
folded, don't contribute like
they used to, maybe slipping

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.766
on deadlines.

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:01.910
They give poor customer service.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.170
And you can see this
kind of lethargy, right?

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.360
The energy just really
kind of slows down.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.740
And then organizationally--
organizations

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.200
that have low
engagement overall tend

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.260
not to be creative
and innovative.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.040
They're not comfortable
with change.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.750
They don't have great customer
service and relationships.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.390
And depending on
the industry, they

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.110
might have increased
safety issues,

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.250
because people aren't
really paying attention.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.400
So it can manifest
itself in different ways.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.140
NICOLE: In the book, you
refer to the treatment

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.720
to this as your
alive treatment plan.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.445
What is your secret to
effective reengagement?

00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:45.600
RUTH K. ROSS: So thank
you, for asking that.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.500
So on the screen,
when we had it up,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.230
where you saw "alive" in
the title of the book,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.750
I did that for a reason.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.610
As I've talked about
some of this stuff,

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.990
there's underlying causes,
and there's symptoms,

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.180
and you can diagnose it, it
sounds kind of medical, right?

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.660
People in poor health.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.860
And so I really wanted
to come up with something

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.940
to get people back
to good health.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.200
And I call that, "alive."

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.330
And here's really
the key to this.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.630
It's just a conversation
like we're having today.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.200
It's about connecting.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.500
I think people have
lost the art of how

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.690
to connect with each other.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.277
I had a boss that never
had one-on-one meetings.

00:27:27.277 --> 00:27:28.860
And everything was
done through email.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.950
There was no connecting.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.830
And so it really has its
roots in, what I call,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.050
a "stay conversation."

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.410
It's holistic medicine.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.050
You can do it at any time.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.640
It's not about performance.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.780
So what I advocate is a
five-step where I say,

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.700
a manager and employee
should have a conversation

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.050
about twice a year where this
is not about performance.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.290
Go out and have a cup of coffee,
or come to 1 of 23 cafeterias

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.510
here.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.100
Just sit down.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.016
Get out of the office.

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:04.040
Just have a conversation
and connect.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.920
And so the A in
alive is about ask.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.380
And the ask is just having
a conversation about,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.610
how are things going?

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.000
What's really working for you?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.300
What's not?

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.200
What obstacles are in your way?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.610
What stops you from being
excited about getting up

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.110
in the morning and
coming into work?

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.060
Or conversely, what makes
you want to jump out of bed

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.860
and come to work?

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.980
And the next step is, listen.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.150
And the listen is about
listen to what people say,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.560
but also what they don't say.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.610
The body language is
equally as important.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.390
So if I'm having a conversation
with Nicole, who's my manager.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.520
And she's asking me something.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.350
And I'm sitting there,
and I'm not really

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.550
looking at you in the eye, and
I'm looking down at the ground.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.000
She might want to think,
there's something going on here.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.120
There's something
that's a pain point.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.380
But conversely, if I'm
talking about something,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.060
like a new initiative,
and I'm excited,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.930
and my eyes light up like
bulbs on a Christmas tree,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.800
you want to note that
as well, because that

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.040
might be something to work on.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.620
The next step is,
I, for identify.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.220
And that's really when it's
about the manager saying,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.540
I'm going to think about
this the next 24 hours.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.780
What did I hear from Ruth?

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.680
What did I see?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.120
And now, I want to come
up with one to two, maybe

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.450
three reaction steps.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.340
I want to react to
what I heard and saw

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.640
to come up with some ideas
to reengage that person.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.270
And then the V is
validation where

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.970
the manager and the
person get back together

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.310
within the same week
for a short meeting

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.600
just to say, hey,
great meeting with you.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.360
Heard what you had to say.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.080
Great conversation.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.652
I have some ideas I
want to run by you.

00:29:50.652 --> 00:29:52.390
You looked really
excited when you

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:57.680
talked about bringing in this
author to come speak at Google.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.990
I'd love you to take charge
of that and invite them in.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.350
Or I'd love you to
work on this project.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:07.600
Or I could tell that how many
steps it takes in the sales

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.420
process to close
a sale is painful.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.780
I think we can work on
ways to skinny that down.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.400
Right?

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.420
That's validating
the conversation.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.320
And E is simply
executing on the plan.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.220
It's that simple.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.940
And it really works.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.540
And it doesn't
cost you anything.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.940
And especially here, because
the coffee's free, right?

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.890
So there's no cost.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.442
Why not do it?

00:30:31.442 --> 00:30:33.400
NICOLE: If you identify
that you are disengaged

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.360
and you decide to
stay, what is your call

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.790
to action for people
with regard to this book?

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.360
And what can they do if
they are in this spot

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.496
or see someone else?

00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:45.370
RUTH K. ROSS: I think
what's really important

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:51.080
to understand is this
is not rocket science.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.670
I will leave the rocket
science to you guys.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.920
This is not at all.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.510
This is so incredibly simplistic
that, sometimes, even I

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.090
shake my head and say,
is it really this simple?

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.032
And the answer is, yes.

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:08.490
And so there's a
couple of things--

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.660
and I talked in the question
before about a manager having

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.110
a conversation.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.870
If your manager's not offering
to have that conversation,

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.210
ask for it.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.080
Invite them.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.090
Right?

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.270
And the whole point of
this is you have a choice.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.375
Anyone has a choice.

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:28.750
If you have friends who are
going through this that maybe

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.262
work for a company that's
not as magical as Google,

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:36.240
tell them to find their voice.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.950
Because really, there's only
three things that happen.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.640
When I had my moment-- if they
have their "face in the mirror"

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.940
moment, and they reflect,
and they say, I'm disengaged,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.400
they can choose to
just say, I own it.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.570
That's what's happening.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.040
And I need to be here.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.480
And I'm going to be here
until something changes,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.930
until maybe I get
to a place where

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.138
I can do something different.

00:32:02.138 --> 00:32:04.320
But I own that choice.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.596
Or you could choose to go
to your manager and say,

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:11.450
I'd love to tweak some things.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.650
Think about the things
you guys have here

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.480
where you can go
do some other work.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.930
You can do explorations.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.090
You can do bungee.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:26.200
You can spend up to 20%, I
think it is of your time,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.740
working on other projects.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.220
That's the single best cure
for disengagement around.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.032
I wish other companies would
learn from what you guys do,

00:32:37.032 --> 00:32:38.490
because that's
incredibly powerful.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.470
What that's saying
is, we don't want

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.680
to lose the employees
who are here.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.750
We value them.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.960
You are the
competitive advantage.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.530
Why wouldn't you have
that kind of conversation

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.210
and be free to have that?

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:57.480
Or frankly, the third choice
is you can just choose to say,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.150
you know what?

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.190
I'm going to go
do something else.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.050
I'm going to walk away.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.370
And it may not happen overnight.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:13.360
And it's about creating
lifelines, and creating a plan,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.250
and think about what you do.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.010
And one of the things I
tell people, particularly

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.540
people that are earlier
on in their career,

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.240
and I would say to
every one of you,

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.140
everyone tells you to
save for retirement.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:34.570
And you absolutely, 1,000%, need
to be saving for retirement.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:39.030
But you also need to save
for a walk-away fund,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.350
so that you have the
ability to not feel stuck,

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.880
if that's how you feel, but
that you have the ability

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:51.560
to do something else and to
be able to say, you know what?

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.640
Not right for me now.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.030
I'm going to walk away.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.700
And the thing that
I tell people is,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.880
you always want to
walk towards something,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.810
instead of running
away from something

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.270
that's maybe not as good.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:13.040
Because the power's all
within you to find your voice.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.130
And to bring this
all back full circle,

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.070
that's what happened to me.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.409
I had those feelings
that it wasn't right.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.389
And truthfully, I
felt invisible, even

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.320
in a very visible role.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.840
And I had to create a lifeline
so that I could take control

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.830
and say, I'm never going to
let that happen to me again.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.710
I need to go do something
I'm passionate about.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.460
And that's when the best
work comes in, no matter

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.710
whether it's here, or another
company, or in my case,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.670
in my own home office.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.960
So at that, just
looking at the time,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.660
why don't we stop there and
see if there are questions?

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.160
NICOLE: Yes.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.660
Yes.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.540
Definitely, like to open
it up any questions.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.039
RUTH K. ROSS: The
question is about,

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:05.060
with technology being what it
is and everybody just totally

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.780
connected and wired, is that
really having an impact?

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.480
And I would say, absolutely.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.340
And it's always going
to be what it is,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.680
but it takes us
away from connecting

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.000
and having conversations.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.890
And truth be told, when I
talked about alive, if you have

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.130
that conversation
even once, maybe

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:31.410
twice a year with the person
you work for, it doesn't matter

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:35.200
that those other times you
might be working remotely

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.730
or connected in with
technology, because now you

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.060
have the basis of
that conversation that

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.710
can help shape things.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.900
So I'm not saying you have
to put it aside all the time,

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.640
but somehow you've got to mix
it in with that connecting.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.830
When I had a boss who only spoke
with me through technology,

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.710
why would I be
connected and engaged

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.810
and passionate about what
I was doing, when I never

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.650
had that face-to-face
interaction?

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.300
So you've got to just
find that balance.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.150
And it's just a
small balance, but it

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.229
can make all the
difference in the world.

00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:08.770
NICOLE: Yeah.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:09.520
RUTH K. ROSS: So
the question is,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.540
I had this moment
when I was yelling

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.720
at myself in the mirror,
and then I wrote a book.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.130
And so what happened in between?

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.220
And it was a couple
year process.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.150
So really, for me,
I knew something

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.690
wasn't right for a long time.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.569
But you get so focused on the
work, and we were so busy,

00:36:27.569 --> 00:36:29.110
and there was so
much going on that I

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.910
think I just tampered it down.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.450
And so that day was,
finally, the paper cuts

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:41.230
had now bled so much that I just
said, oh, my god, something's

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.240
not right here.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.540
And one of the
first things I did

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.350
was to really confide in
a couple of people close

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.520
to me to say, I feel this way.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.970
And I think I have to
do something different.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.480
One of the first
things I did, no joke,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.730
as I thought about
my plan, was I went

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:07.910
and met with my banker to look
at my finances, to really,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.480
truly understand where
I was in my life.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.010
And with retirement
and financially,

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.630
could I think about doing
something different?

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.870
So I became very planful, very
thoughtful and very planful.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.250
And I took a piece of paper out.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.570
Plain white sheet of
paper-- forget technology,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:26.890
you could do it on your iPhone.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.380
But literally, I went
back to the basics.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.370
And I drew a line
down the page, and I

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:36.440
said, make it or break it.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.780
What do I need to have?

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.220
And what can I not
live with anymore?

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.430
And I knew I couldn't live
with a bully boss anymore.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.400
I knew I couldn't live
with feeling invisible.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.130
But I knew I wasn't ready to
just walk away and do nothing.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.630
But I also knew that I could
walk away and get another HR

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.130
job.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.960
I had a great background.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.070
I had a great reputation.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.780
I could have gotten another job.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:07.700
But when I looked at that piece
of paper, no boss, no more.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.250
I knew my make it or break it.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.100
So I just started thinking about
it and started being planful.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.800
And I knew it wasn't
going to happen overnight,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.950
but I just started working
on getting right in my head

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.850
and talking to people
and having conversations.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:27.640
And ultimately, some things
happened with reorganizations

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.320
and others where it was the
right time to walk away.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.350
So then, fast forward.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.040
OK, I'm now at home.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.300
I've made the decision,
I'm not going back

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.530
to a company environment.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.890
I have elderly
parent issues that I

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.200
was dealing with back East.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.130
I was volunteering for great
nonprofit organizations.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.560
I was doing all of that.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.180
But I couldn't get
away from the fact

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.840
that there was a story
to tell inside of me.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:02.520
And so I just kept saying,
OK, OK, what's next?

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.360
So I'd say, from the time I
left, it was about two years

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.500
before I sat down
to write the book.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.300
So it doesn't just
happen overnight.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.370
But I will tell you that
every day of those two years,

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.270
and the time that's
happened since, I get up

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.900
out of bed every day
loving my life right now

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.142
and being passionate
about what I do.

00:39:26.142 --> 00:39:28.900
And I think that was the
real difference for me.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.581
So I just had to be planful and
thoughtful and make it happen.

00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:34.080
Sure.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.910
So the question is that,
in the research that he's

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.950
done on this topic,
a lot of times,

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.230
you see things like
employee satisfaction.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.390
I thought you were also going to
bring up "happy," because that

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.640
also comes up in this, right?

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.730
Oh, that's about being happy.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.630
Truth be told, they're
all different things.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.970
So employee engagement is really
about that connected loyalty

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:02.484
to what you do, and believing
in that, and the mission

00:40:02.484 --> 00:40:04.150
and the purpose and
the meaning that you

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.460
find in a company like this.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.085
That doesn't always mean
that you're happy every day.

00:40:09.085 --> 00:40:10.110
Right?

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.760
And truth be told, some
people who are really

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.600
engaged in what they
do may not be happy,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.080
because they see things that are
broken that they want to fix.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.130
And companies used to
measure employee satisfaction

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.610
before they morphed
into engagement surveys.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.832
And employee satisfaction is
this big overarching thing

00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:33.730
that you're never quite
sure, what does that mean?

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:39.570
So I think, over time, you
can be engaged in what you do,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.680
but not be satisfied,
because you

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.880
want to change the status quo.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.240
And you want to be an innovator.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.000
And you want to be a
disruptor who said,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.190
I'm going to change the world.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.720
So I may not be
satisfied yet, because I

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.890
want to get us to here.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.070
So that's why I see
them as different.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.310
Well, they're all important.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.100
I just see them as different.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.930
And engagement,
for me, is really

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:06.940
about the holy
grail of saying, I'm

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:12.540
just really committed to
what we're trying to do here.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.817
And I think that's what
you want to reach for,

00:41:14.817 --> 00:41:15.650
if that makes sense.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:16.525
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:41:16.525 --> 00:41:17.430
RUTH K. ROSS: Right?

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.090
So not always about happy.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.780
Great question.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.571
Thank you, so much.

00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:22.220
Yes?

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.010
So the question
is about bullying.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:29.810
So in today's society, the
stories that make the news

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.250
are the kids that are being
bullied on the playground,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.680
or the guy at Rutgers
University, Tyler Clementi,

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.600
years ago, who killed himself
when his roommate spied on him.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.250
Or maybe you remember
the story about Karen,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:46.590
the school bus driver, who
got bullied by the kids.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.440
And people around the
world were so incensed,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.000
they ended up
contributing over $800,000

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.790
to a women they
didn't even know.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.640
Those are the stories that
are all over the media.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.820
Or the kids in Florida,
12 and 14 years old,

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.050
that caused someone
to commit suicide.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.050
Truth be told, the
largest percentage

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.630
of bullying in the world
today is in the workplace.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.700
And I have a favorite slide.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.320
Obviously, I'm not
using slides here.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.270
But I pull it up, and it
says, bully, B-U-L-L-Y.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.850
And it stands for
big, ugly, lonely,

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.385
losers yearning for attention.

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:22.510
Because there are a lot of
police in the workplace,

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.950
and they take shape of things
like the intimidater, who

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.130
thinks that by being the
loudest voice in the room,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:34.850
if they yell the loudest, it'll
make them the most important.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.570
Or the snake-in-the-grass,
who may just put you down

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:41.240
at the same time they're
taking credit for what you do.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.840
Or the sexist bully, who may
say to someone-- usually a man

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.160
to a woman-- something that's
so derogatory to put them

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.260
in their place.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:57.190
That stuff is out there
in a really big way.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.600
I stopped counting
at four, but I've

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.540
had at least four bully
bosses in my career.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.490
And it's demoralizing,
because it

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.070
zaps you of your
self-confidence.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.640
And you just kind of
go, wait a minute.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.390
What is this?

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.700
And you tend to think
you're a victim.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.158
And that's the
worst possible thing

00:43:13.158 --> 00:43:16.410
you could do because, truth
be told, you may be a target.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.410
But trust me, you
are not a victim.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.330
It's their problem, not yours.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.620
Right?

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.870
But that's happening.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:27.280
And organizations today
are really inept when

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.600
it comes to shutting
down bullies.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.410
They don't know how to do it.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.310
They don't know how to do it.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.779
And I'll say this in a
really embarrassing way,

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:38.320
because I know I have people in
HR here that are in the room.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.770
And I was one of
them for a long time.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.520
Some of my worst
bullies were people

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.346
that managed HR functions.

00:43:45.346 --> 00:43:46.720
And I'd say, but
they're the ones

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.950
who are supposed to
be changing the world.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.370
So that's what's happening
in companies today,

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.320
that's so pervasive.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.170
So it is absolutely one
of the biggest causes

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.130
of why people get
disengaged and shut down.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.920
The question really is
about-- yes, managers

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.495
are supposed to lead and do
things right, but some of them

00:44:06.495 --> 00:44:09.120
just don't know how to do that,
and aren't comfortable in that.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.202
And there's a lot
of conflict around.

00:44:11.202 --> 00:44:12.910
And so I'm going to
answer that in a way,

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.170
because there's some things
that I didn't get a chance

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.650
to talk about that I want
to bring out in this.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:23.580
And the first one is,
every one of us is a CEO.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.500
And I don't mean a
chief executive officer

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.180
because, frankly, who the
heck wants all that pressure?

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.320
But a CEO stands for
Chief Engagement Officer.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.150
And we can all wear
those titles proudly

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.020
because, truth be told,
you can't just wait around

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.530
for somebody to create an
engaged environment for you,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.690
or a satisfied environment,
with the previous question.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.060
Every one of you have to own it.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.640
As employees, you
need to own that

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.730
and own your own engagement.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:54.640
And part of this really is
having a voice and speaking up,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.727
but doing it in such a way
that it's not confrontational.

00:44:58.727 --> 00:45:00.310
And there are many
ways of doing that.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.150
And I sort of call
it an "I message,"

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.145
where it's a more quiet,
kind of reflective

00:45:05.145 --> 00:45:10.520
of, I'd like to let you know
how I'm feeling about something,

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.140
and really trying to have that
conversation and take the lead,

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.410
because here's the
really sad part.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:21.620
When you think about engagement
and disengagement out there,

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.030
a large percentage of people
who are disengaged today

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.950
are managers.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.460
They're managers.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.590
And so if you think
about it, a dead battery

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.050
can't charge another.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.830
If you're not engaged, how are
you going to engage your team?

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.780
And it's about trying to get
that and have that happen.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.950
And I've literally seen teams
that have said, you know what?

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.690
We're going to be
a self-managed team

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.290
and engage ourselves and do
those things because we own it.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.890
We're CEOs.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.470
And so it's just trying
all those different things.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.170
And at the end of
the day, what's

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.190
so awesome about a company
like this is that, if it's not

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:02.520
working where you are, you have
unbelievable opportunities here
