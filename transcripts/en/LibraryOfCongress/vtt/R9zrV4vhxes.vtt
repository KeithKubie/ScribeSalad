Kluge Prize Ceremony

00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:40.451
&gt;&gt; Dignified, bold, 
compassionate.  Dedicated.  

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:42.452
Rounded, open, engaged.
&gt;&gt;  Elegant.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
Visionary, strong, thoughtful 
and diplomatic.

00:08:50.845 --> 00:08:52.079
The Kluge Prize awards 
accessible scholarship and 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.124
strong public leadership.

00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.001
And Drew Gilpin Faust embodies 
all the 

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:02.539
traits we were seeking as a 
prize recipient.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.540
DREW GILPIN FAUST: I see myself 
fundamentally as a historian.

00:09:08.878 --> 00:09:10.722
I grew up in Shenandoah Valley 
crk Virginia, when time was 

00:09:10.723 --> 00:09:12.723
changing, but 

00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:16.168
when history was very present in
the 

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.363
1950s and 60s we lived in the 
midst of civil war battlefields,

00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:23.610
but the emerging time of Civil 
Rights Movement, brown v.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.870
Board, the effort to close 
schools in 

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.170
jirnlings through mass -- in 
Virginia through mass 

00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:36.196
resistance, all of that when I 
was a small child.  The 

00:09:36.197 --> 00:09:37.420
questions for past and present 
intersected for me vividly as 

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:39.421
the 

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:43.691
American traditions of 
governance and race and justice 

00:09:43.692 --> 00:09:46.138
and equality all played out 
before my eyes, but also were 

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:48.139
part 

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.193
of what I was hearing about the 
places in which I lived and 

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:53.194
their history.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:02.518
SPEAKER: I think a great choice 
for the Kluge Prize for 

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.844
Achievement in the Study of 
Humanity.  She's a humanist and 

00:10:01.845 --> 00:10:06.686
historian.  Life has been a 
study of who we are and how we 

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:08.687
deal with crises, but then 

00:10:09.928 --> 00:10:11.793
her life also has been an 
exemplary leader through the 

00:10:11.794 --> 00:10:15.267
turbulent times that we all live
in.  So she not only has 

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:17.268
researched and 

00:10:18.525 --> 00:10:21.382
studied this as a scholar for 
all of us, she also exemplified 

00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:23.383
leadership and 

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:27.908
humanity, and I think it's a 
wonderful choice.

00:10:29.537 --> 00:10:31.780
SPEAKER: Drew Faust is a 
historian.  It's not just 

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:34.199
science and technology, as 
important as they are, it's the 

00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:38.432
values that are infused into 
those technologies.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.597
And that's where her background 
helped to ensure that we were 

00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:45.265
constantly lifting our gaze to 
the constellation of 

00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:48.343
possibilities.
SPEAKER: She has been a 

00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:50.344
historian of the 

00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:54.493
American south, of American 
women, and of the American civil

00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:56.494
war and the 

00:10:58.373 --> 00:11:00.601
intellectual history of the 
South in particular, as 

00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:02.602
distinguished and as 

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:06.696
important as anyone in the past 
40 years.

00:11:08.996 --> 00:11:10.828
Her work will always stand as 
some of the most important 

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:13.693
contributions to civil war 
history, the history of the 

00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:19.372
South and the history of 
American women.

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.698
SPEAKER: You have made a real 
difference throughout your 

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:24.126
entire professional career, and 
I know that you will 

00:11:28.352 --> 00:11:30.988
continue to do so as you put it,
to help us build a more 

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.989
enlightened world.

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:38.149
So congratulations and best 
wishes on your future endeavors.

00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:43.119
Drew, I want to congratulate you
on your service as a historian 

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.120
and as an integrator in higher 
education.

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.227
Thanks to you, both the general 
public and our leaders have a 

00:11:49.228 --> 00:11:54.525
greater understanding of our 
shared history, and the 

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:56.526
experiences that have shaped our
nation.

00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:14.097
SPEAKER: Dr. Hayden, members of 
Congress, members of the 

00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:15.923
diplomatic corps and members of 
the library's James Madison 

00:12:15.924 --> 00:12:18.607
council, scholars and 
distinguished guests, I am 

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.500
John has kill, director of the 
Kluge center on behalf of the 

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.992
Library of Congress, it is my 
pleasure to welcome you to the 

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:29.841
7th conferral of the John W. 
Kluge Prize for the study of 

00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:32.280
humanity.
Incidentally, this event is 

00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:36.757
being recorded for placement on 
the library's website and it is 

00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:39.230
being livestreamed, so I also 
welcome our viewers from around 

00:12:39.463 --> 00:12:41.463
the world.

00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:46.801
The John W. Kluge Prize for 
achievement in the study of 

00:12:46.802 --> 00:12:48.802
humanity is unique among 
international awards.

00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:53.744
The prize covers fields, 
virtually all the humanities and

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:56.634
social sciences and other areas.
It honors scholars who over a 

00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:01.736
sustained period have distilled 
wisdom from the cumulative 

00:13:01.737 --> 00:13:05.044
record of human experience and 
have had a major impact on 

00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:08.722
public life.
The selection progress is 

00:13:08.723 --> 00:13:11.596
Democratic and broad.  The 
library solicits nominations 

00:13:11.597 --> 00:13:15.509
from a wide range of national 
and international individuals 

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.604
and institutions and uses a 
rigorous selection process 

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.892
involving curators, specialists 
and a distinguished panel of 

00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:27.141
outside scholars and, of course,
the Librarian of Congress.

00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:32.896
We are deeply grateful to the 
late John W. Kluge for his 

00:13:32.897 --> 00:13:34.523
generosity in creating the 
endowment that funds this prize,

00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:39.237
as well as the wide-ranging 
research of the many visiting 

00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:41.296
scholars that the Kluge center 
here within the Thomas Jefferson

00:13:41.297 --> 00:13:43.297
Building.

00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:46.767
Now, here in this institutional 
symbol 

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.451
of the importance of knowledge 
to our democracy, we especially 

00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:53.741
want to thank the Congress of 
the United States for creating 

00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:55.975
and sustaining the library for 
over two centuries, beginning 

00:13:55.976 --> 00:14:01.541
with Thomas Jefferson's amazing 
collection, which has grown to 

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:05.229
over 160 million items.  The 
U.S. Congress has been the 

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.478
greatest single patron of the 
library in the history of the 

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:10.941
world.  We thank the 
distinguished members who are in

00:14:10.942 --> 00:14:12.942
the audience and with us 
tonight.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.417
And now I have the honor to 
introduce to 

00:14:19.327 --> 00:14:21.327
you the 14th Librarian of 
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:26.163
[Applause]
CARLA HAYDEN: Thank you.

00:14:29.428 --> 00:14:32.271
I am so honored and pleased to

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:35.544
guests tonight and thank you so 
much for being here with us on 

00:14:35.545 --> 00:14:38.396
this very special evening.  John
has already told you a little 

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.447
about the history of the Kluge 
Prize, 

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.572
but before we go any further, 
I'd like to recognize one very 

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:48.573
special person in our audience.

00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:56.178
My pred sees ser, the 13th 
Librarian of Congress, Dr. James

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.661
buildington.
[Applause]

00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:20.957
CARLA HAYDEN: Dr. Billington had
the vision to create this prize,

00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958
as well as the Kluge center, 

00:15:25.677 --> 00:15:27.494
and he worked alongside the late
John W. Kluge to turn this dream

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:32.669
into reality.  We thank you for 
your vision and for your many 

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.699
years of service and leadership 
to our nation.

00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:40.752
It is now my great pleasure and 

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.859
privilege to confer the 7th 
Kluge Prize 

00:15:46.743 --> 00:15:48.743
for achievement in the study of 
humanity.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:54.279
Drew Gilpin Faust stands among 
the most distinguished 

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.280
historians of our generation.

00:15:57.532 --> 00:16:00.182
Throughout her career she has 
demonstrated clear vision and 

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.212
intellectual courage, spending 
countless 

00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:07.289
hours in the archives and among 
primary resources, some right 

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.290
here at the 

00:16:10.557 --> 00:16:12.791
Library of Congress, uncovering 
the vital research and threads 

00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:14.792
of our country's social history.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.329
Her work has added to our 
understanding of the civil war, 

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.191
the history of the South, and 
the history of women in the 

00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:23.192
United States.

00:16:25.683 --> 00:16:27.683
My granting us a greater 
understanding 

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.737
of our heritage and some of the 
decisive 

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:34.511
ideas and conflicts that shaped 
it, her work continues to 

00:16:34.512 --> 00:16:36.971
provide context to the many 
challenges we face in public 

00:16:36.972 --> 00:16:38.972
life today.

00:16:42.071 --> 00:16:44.350
In addition to her skilled craft
as a historian and educator, she

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.351
has been a leader in the public 
sphere.

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:52.489
In 2007, following her very 
successful 

00:16:53.552 --> 00:16:56.419
tenure as dean of the Radcliffe 
institute, she took office as 

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.420
Harvard's 28th president.

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:02.149
And for over a decade at the 
helm of one of the world's most 

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:07.384
distinguished centers of higher 
research and learning, she 

00:17:07.385 --> 00:17:09.385
guided the institution through a

00:17:12.296 --> 00:17:13.728
time of national financial 
crisis and during her leadership

00:17:13.729 --> 00:17:17.986
she expanded financial aid for 
undergraduates, working to make 

00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:20.692
the Harvard community more 
diverse and accessible, and she 

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:25.176
ably promoted the university's 
mission in the arts, sciences 

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.177
and humanities.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.080
She also led in the creation of 
innovative learning and 

00:17:34.147 --> 00:17:36.191
interdisciplinary programs and 
strengthened the university's 

00:17:36.398 --> 00:17:40.511
international impact.
Dr. Drew Gilpin Faust, will you 

00:17:40.512 --> 00:17:45.248
please come forward to receive 
the Kluge Prize for achievement 

00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:48.292
in the study of humanity?
Please join me in welcoming Dr. 

00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:50.293
Faust.

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:54.109
[Applause]

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:11.605
CARLA HAYDEN: And now we will 
hear from our laureate.

00:18:19.249 --> 00:18:23.918
DREW GILPIN FAUST: Thank you to 
all of you for being here.  I 

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.759
know how many things there are 
to do in this city and that you 

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.760
would choose to be here tonight 
means the world to me.

00:18:30.665 --> 00:18:33.110
And I wanted to especially thank
Carla Hayden for awarding me 

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:37.863
this prize and for taking on the
Library of Congress.  It's just 

00:18:37.864 --> 00:18:39.717
about to be her second 
anniversary as librarian, 

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:43.772
September 14th.  So I think we 
should have a round of applause 

00:18:43.773 --> 00:18:45.773
and congratulations to her.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.420
[Applause]

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.236
DREW GILPIN FAUST: Dr.

00:18:59.136 --> 00:18:59.948
Billingt on, secretary Chow, so 
many distinguished friends in 

00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:01.949
this room.

00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:05.864
I am so grateful for this award.
It's hard for me to find the 

00:19:05.865 --> 00:19:07.865
words to 

00:19:09.127 --> 00:19:11.127
convey that, and also to convey 
how 

00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:14.211
humble I feel to be in the 
pantheon of its recipients.

00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:18.952
I'm delighted to be awarded this
recognition by the Library of 

00:19:18.953 --> 00:19:22.817
Congress, an institution that 
has meant so much to me 

00:19:22.818 --> 00:19:24.818
throughout my scholarly career.

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:30.153
From the papers of 19th century 
South Carolina congressman and 

00:19:30.154 --> 00:19:35.681
senator James Henry Hammond, a 
key figure in my first two 

00:19:35.682 --> 00:19:37.682
books, to the diaries and 
letters of 

00:19:39.767 --> 00:19:41.620
Clara Barton and the searing 
Matthew Brady photographs so 

00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:44.254
central to my last.
The library's collections have 

00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:46.931
been essential to my 
explorations of the 

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:52.059
history of the American South 
and the nation's experience of 

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.060
civil war.

00:19:56.201 --> 00:19:58.201
That this award comes from the 
Library 

00:19:59.663 --> 00:20:01.663
of Congress is a signal honor.

00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:05.565
That it is awarded for 
Achievement in 

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:08.259
the Study of Humanity is a 
recognition I could scarcely 

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
have dreamed of.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:15.637
It affirms what I have seen as a
vocation, a calling, a life 

00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:17.638
purpose.

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:21.751
Both in my own dedication to 
such 

00:20:23.647 --> 00:20:25.647
study, but also in my efforts on
behalf 

00:20:26.932 --> 00:20:28.932
of the institution's, especially

00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:32.607
universities, that have enabled 
and encouraged this pursuit.

00:20:34.696 --> 00:20:35.498
The path I have chosen into the 
study of humanity has been 

00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:37.499
history.

00:20:39.355 --> 00:20:41.355
From my earliest years, which I 
guess 

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.842
I discussed already a little bit
on the video, growing up in 

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.843
Virginia, 

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.137
Shenandoah Valley in the 1950s 
and '60s, I felt the presence of

00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:52.138
the past all around me.

00:20:57.684 --> 00:20:59.684
I lived on a farm on the Leeiac 
son 

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.033
High -- Lee Jackson highway 
where confederates and Yankees 

00:21:03.034 --> 00:21:06.725
had skirmished and played civil 
war with my brothers in the 

00:21:06.726 --> 00:21:08.726
woods near our house.

00:21:11.044 --> 00:21:13.044
But I also knew, even as a young
child, 

00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:17.363
that my owner ra was a historic 
time in its own right.

00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:21.655
One of controversy and challenge
to 

00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:25.438
the entrenched order of 
segregation that had replaced 

00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:27.439
slavery after the civil war.

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:33.047
History seemed to surround me, 
even as a new history was being 

00:21:33.048 --> 00:21:35.048
created before my eyes.

00:21:39.982 --> 00:21:42.627
The path of slavery, war and 
racial injustice so present in 

00:21:42.628 --> 00:21:44.628
my childhood 

00:21:46.497 --> 00:21:48.497
would later become the focus of 
my scholarly work.

00:21:51.012 --> 00:21:53.012
But the questions I would ask of
the 

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.896
19th century had implications 
for my own world as well.

00:21:58.346 --> 00:22:00.346
I sought through research and 
writing to 

00:22:03.472 --> 00:22:05.472
understand how human beings had 
come to 

00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:08.928
create the slave society of the 
Old 

00:22:10.802 --> 00:22:12.802
South, and how slavery's 
oppressions had 

00:22:13.844 --> 00:22:16.489
become, for millions of white 
southerners, not just an 

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.490
accepted way of 

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:22.788
life but what they justified as 
a positive good and what 

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:24.789
ultimately, in 

00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:28.847
the hundreds of thousands, they 
died to defend.

00:22:31.186 --> 00:22:33.186
A century later I had grown up 
amongst 

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:37.431
adults who supported 
segregation, a system that had 

00:22:37.432 --> 00:22:40.167
seemed to me, even as a young 
child, at odds with the 

00:22:40.168 --> 00:22:42.168
Democratic 

00:22:43.617 --> 00:22:45.617
and Christian values those same 
adults taught me to esspouse.

00:22:49.396 --> 00:22:51.396
If I could understand the 
southern 

00:22:53.684 --> 00:22:54.915
past, perhaps I could better 
understand the southern present.

00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:56.916
My Ph.D.

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:00.953
dissertation and my first book 
were about the pro-slavery 

00:23:00.954 --> 00:23:02.954
argument.

00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:07.403
You might say I wanted to 
understand inhumanty.

00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:11.341
How men and women throughout 
history 

00:23:13.012 --> 00:23:15.012
have persuaded themselves to 
defend 

00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:19.933
ideas, practices, societies, 
governments, that we of a 

00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:21.934
different era see as 
indefensible.

00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:27.911
I wanted to know how humans can 
become blind to evil.

00:23:31.387 --> 00:23:33.387
Perhaps if we could understand 
their 

00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:37.288
processes of denial and 
rationalization, 

00:23:38.521 --> 00:23:40.521
we might gain insight into our 
own failures of vision.

00:23:43.436 --> 00:23:45.436
Those shortcomings of our own 
time.

00:23:49.558 --> 00:23:50.587
History, in other words, can 
expand our awareness of 

00:23:50.588 --> 00:23:52.588
ourselves.

00:23:54.857 --> 00:23:56.857
It releases us from the confines
of our own individual lives.

00:24:00.763 --> 00:24:03.604
It offers us other ways of 
seeing that cast our assumptions

00:24:03.605 --> 00:24:05.605
into relief.

00:24:08.075 --> 00:24:10.075
It reminds us of choices people 
have 

00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:13.579
made or not made, and thus it 
eliminates realms of 

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.580
possibility.

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:21.178
It shows us that things have 
been otherwise, and it reminds 

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:24.041
us that things can be different 
once again.

00:24:30.026 --> 00:24:32.026
By documenting contingency and 
agency, 

00:24:34.702 --> 00:24:36.702
history undermines any 
acceptance of 

00:24:38.383 --> 00:24:40.383
crippling inevitablety, and 
contingency means opportunity.

00:24:42.678 --> 00:24:45.526
It means we can change things, 
and that what we do matters.

00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:51.197
To my mind, this is history's 
most important lesson.

00:24:53.882 --> 00:24:55.315
Although I at first focused my 
attention on the society and 

00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:57.316
culture of 

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.291
the Old South, the implications 
of the questions I was exploring

00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:03.292
in my writing 

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.470
and teaching led me inexorabley 
toward the civil war.  It seemed

00:25:10.471 --> 00:25:12.471
I had been steeped in that war 
since my earliest days.

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:19.457
As I began my deeper scholarly 
explorations into its history, I

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:21.458
soon 

00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:24.938
came to understand Ernest 
Hemingway's observations to F. 

00:25:24.939 --> 00:25:26.939
Scott Fitzgerald.

00:25:32.262 --> 00:25:34.262
"War," he said, "is the best 
subject.

00:25:35.945 --> 00:25:38.116
"  For me it proved irresistible
to study humanity when under 

00:25:38.117 --> 00:25:40.117
maximum 

00:25:41.391 --> 00:25:42.817
pressure, when decisions and 
choices are literally matters of

00:25:42.818 --> 00:25:44.818
life and death.

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:49.512
When the possibility for the 
best of 

00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:53.169
humanity, courage, sacrifice, 
and the 

00:25:55.892 --> 00:25:56.499
worst of humanity, cruelly, 
cruelty, brutality, when they 

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500
collide.

00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:03.024
And I found myself drawn to 
explore with my students other 

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:05.025
wars as well.

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:10.001
Vietnam, the two world wars, 
what was different?  And what 

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:12.449
unchanging about the human 
response to combat about 

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.450
conflagration?

00:26:16.785 --> 00:26:18.785
What was the product of time and
circumstance?

00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.181
And what was the result of an 
essential enduring humanity?

00:26:27.567 --> 00:26:29.567
How did the inhumanty of war 
compel its 

00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.495
participants to reaffirm and 
reassert 

00:26:34.987 --> 00:26:37.828
what humanity truly meant?  And 
how did war extend beyond the 

00:26:40.268 --> 00:26:41.277
battlefield to engulf the lives 
of civilians, of women and of 

00:26:41.278 --> 00:26:43.278
children?

00:26:45.802 --> 00:26:47.851
What, as we might put it, was 
the human face of war?

00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:54.175
It was in war's foregrounding of
death 

00:26:55.434 --> 00:26:57.434
that I encountered an 
unparalleled line 

00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:01.554
of sight into the human 
condition, and the subject for 

00:27:01.555 --> 00:27:03.555
my most recent book.

00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:10.092
Mortality is a defining feature 
of 

00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:13.361
humanity, and our recognition 
and 

00:27:14.826 --> 00:27:16.862
anticipation of our inevitable 
end is a key element 

00:27:16.863 --> 00:27:18.863
differentiating us from animals.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.847
All of life and all of 
philosophy once observed is 

00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:28.848
about learning to die.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.822
Yet we do so in different ways, 
in different eras and different 

00:27:32.823 --> 00:27:34.823
places.

00:27:37.507 --> 00:27:40.147
Facing the unprecedented 
slaughter of civil war, more 

00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:44.441
than 2% of the population died 
in the course of the war, the 

00:27:44.442 --> 00:27:46.442
equivalent of about 7 million 
people today.

00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:50.780
Americans confronted death in a 
manner both old and new.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.146
The widely shared Christian 
ideology of the good death 

00:27:57.147 --> 00:27:59.147
provided lessons in how 

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.210
to die that shaped the response 
to 

00:28:05.096 --> 00:28:07.096
unimaginable and unfathomable 
industrialized slaughter.

00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:13.257
The insistence of our forebears 
on adapting the rituals and 

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:16.104
practices that preserve their 
humanity, even in the 

00:28:20.643 --> 00:28:22.260
face of catastrophe, seemed to 
me an affirmation of the power 

00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.261
and resilience of the human 
spirit.

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:30.411
Even in almost impossible 
circumstances, 

00:28:32.295 --> 00:28:34.536
soldiers and civilians alike 
struggle to bury, name and honor

00:28:34.537 --> 00:28:38.475
the dead in ways that affirm the
value of each human life.

00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:43.788
The National Cemetery System 
that emerged from the war 

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.032
represents the expression of 
this impulse on a national 

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.033
level.

00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:53.377
For me, the research and writing
for 

00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:57.490
this book served as an excursion
into the past with powerful 

00:28:57.491 --> 00:28:59.959
resonance for a future that 
awaits us all.

00:29:03.014 --> 00:29:05.014
I have been deeply moved and 
gratified 

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:08.276
to learn that readers ranging 
from 

00:29:10.553 --> 00:29:12.174
hospice workers to clergy to 
active and veteran military have

00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:14.632
found this book has spoken to 
them and to their experience.

00:29:15.842 --> 00:29:18.317
That is just a brief glimpse 
into what 

00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:23.985
the study of humanity and 
inhumanty has 

00:29:25.457 --> 00:29:28.288
meant for me, and the kinds of 
questions that collections like 

00:29:28.289 --> 00:29:30.289
the ones here at the Library of 
Congress have enabled me to ask.

00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:36.666
Other institutions have, of 
course, also 

00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:40.189
supported this work.  Which 
would never have been 

00:29:41.266 --> 00:29:44.131
accomplished without the rich 
intellectual environment of 

00:29:44.132 --> 00:29:46.193
teaching and research nurtured 
by American higher education.

00:29:50.938 --> 00:29:53.594
Universities have served as the 
locus for humanistic inquiry 

00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:55.595
from the time of their founding 
in the 11th century.

00:30:01.953 --> 00:30:03.377
Society has assigned primarily 
responsibility for this 

00:30:03.378 --> 00:30:05.378
stewardship to them.

00:30:06.718 --> 00:30:09.418
It has been the unique role of 
the university, both to serve 

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:11.700
the immediate and urgent 
present, and at the same time 

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:17.781
to look beyond it, to pose 
larger questions of meaning.

00:30:21.326 --> 00:30:23.326
Not just to propel us towards 
our 

00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:27.373
goals but to ask what those 
goals should 

00:30:31.673 --> 00:30:32.905
be, to understand who we are, 
where we came from and where we 

00:30:32.906 --> 00:30:34.906
are going and why.

00:30:38.665 --> 00:30:40.892
Yet we find ourselves in a time 
when the value and legitimacy of

00:30:40.893 --> 00:30:43.534
these questions, and of the 
fields that embody them, are 

00:30:46.593 --> 00:30:48.593
being criticized, weakened, 
marginalized.

00:30:51.505 --> 00:30:53.505
Increasingly education is seen 
as instrumental.

00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:58.192
We expect it to provide a direct
path to a specific job.

00:31:02.582 --> 00:31:04.582
We fail to ask how it will 
produce a 

00:31:05.823 --> 00:31:07.474
thoughtful citizen or a person 
who can imagine beyond the 

00:31:07.475 --> 00:31:09.475
moment in which we 

00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:12.532
find ourselves to see and build 
the changing world ahead.

00:31:17.082 --> 00:31:19.082
Or how a leader can begin to 
address 

00:31:20.363 --> 00:31:23.082
the profound impact of our 
extraordinary technological 

00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:25.331
advances on our culture, our 
society, and our very 

00:31:25.332 --> 00:31:28.178
understanding of what it is to 
be human.

00:31:31.813 --> 00:31:33.813
We see the results of this 
neglect all around us.

00:31:37.728 --> 00:31:39.728
We have invented the marvels of 
social 

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.250
media, but not figured out the 
ethics of the profound 

00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:44.251
challenges it poses.

00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.167
We have made torrents of 
information 

00:31:51.823 --> 00:31:54.691
available to almost everyone, 
but not equipped them with the 

00:31:54.692 --> 00:32:00.236
skills of analysis and habits of
discernment to separate truth 

00:32:00.237 --> 00:32:02.237
from falsehood, or 

00:32:03.727 --> 00:32:04.340
perhaps most alarmingly, to 
believe that this distinction 

00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:06.341
matters.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.700
We are a society enthralled by 
the notion of innovation.

00:32:16.417 --> 00:32:18.417
But how can we imagine a new 
future 

00:32:19.653 --> 00:32:21.696
without grasping how things were
once different and can be 

00:32:21.697 --> 00:32:23.697
different again?

00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:29.644
We are witnessing sharp declines
in the fields designed to ask 

00:32:29.645 --> 00:32:31.645
such questions and nurture such 
skills.

00:32:34.726 --> 00:32:36.981
I speak, of course, of the 
humanities, and what are known 

00:32:36.982 --> 00:32:38.982
as the qualitative, 

00:32:40.442 --> 00:32:42.442
not mathematical, social 
sciences.

00:32:44.354 --> 00:32:46.354
Languages, literatures, history,

00:32:47.627 --> 00:32:49.451
philosophy, religion, 
anthropology, parts of 

00:32:49.452 --> 00:32:52.098
sociology, and political science
are at the core of this 

00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:54.099
endeavor.

00:32:57.701 --> 00:32:59.327
And their departments, majors, 
jobs and enrollments are 

00:32:59.328 --> 00:33:01.328
plummeting.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.380
At Penn State, for example, the 
five 

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.402
years from 2010 to 2015 saw a 
40% decline in humanities 

00:33:09.403 --> 00:33:11.403
majors.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.300
At the University of Illinois at

00:33:19.048 --> 00:33:21.048
Champaign urbana, there were 414
majors in 2005 and 155 in 2015.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.870
Nationwide numbers of history 
majors are 

00:33:31.964 --> 00:33:34.820
down 45% since 2007.  Since 
1990s English majors have 

00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:37.222
declined by half.

00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:43.242
The University of Wisconsin at 
Stevens Point announced it would

00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:46.121
abolish 13 departments, French, 
German, Spanish, philosophy and 

00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:48.171
political science.

00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:54.229
One state governor listed the 
specific 

00:33:56.976 --> 00:33:58.976
fields to be favored with state 
support 

00:34:00.477 --> 00:34:02.477
explicitly tying educational 
resources to job outcomes.

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:06.759
He said, "I want to spend our 
dollars 

00:34:08.015 --> 00:34:09.448
giving people sciences, 
technology, engineering, math 

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:11.449
degrees, so that when 

00:34:13.332 --> 00:34:15.797
they get out of school, they can
get a job."  He observed his 

00:34:15.798 --> 00:34:17.798
state did not need any more 
anthropologists.

00:34:21.952 --> 00:34:24.412
In fact, humanists do get jobs, 
and over a lifetime earn only 

00:34:24.413 --> 00:34:26.667
slightly less than their peers 
in the social and natural 

00:34:26.668 --> 00:34:30.574
sciences.
Jobs are, of course, important.

00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:37.363
But they are not enough to serve
as the exclusive purpose of 

00:34:37.364 --> 00:34:39.364
higher education.

00:34:42.931 --> 00:34:45.364
When we define the role of 
learning solely to drive 

00:34:45.365 --> 00:34:47.365
economic development, we 

00:34:48.664 --> 00:34:50.664
risk losing sight of the broader
and 

00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:54.149
deeper questions of the kinds of
inquiry 

00:34:56.229 --> 00:34:58.229
that enable the critical insight
that 

00:35:00.563 --> 00:35:03.221
build the humane perspective 
that foster the restless 

00:35:03.222 --> 00:35:05.222
skepticism and unbounded 

00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:08.684
curiosity from which our 
profoundest understandings so 

00:35:08.685 --> 00:35:10.685
emerge.

00:35:13.434 --> 00:35:16.068
We shouldn't for get Einstein's 
words... "Not everything that 

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:18.069
counts can be 

00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:22.511
counted and not everything that 
can be counted counts."

00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:26.620
It seems to me telling that one 
set of higher education 

00:35:26.621 --> 00:35:28.621
institutions has not shared in 
this recent decline in the 

00:35:29.471 --> 00:35:32.354
importance of the humanities.  
These are our military 

00:35:32.355 --> 00:35:34.355
academies.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.430
Take the example of West Point, 
from 

00:35:40.354 --> 00:35:42.196
its origins as an engineering 
school, the United States 

00:35:42.197 --> 00:35:44.197
Military Academy has 

00:35:45.259 --> 00:35:47.299
evolved over two centuries to be
a very special sort of liberal 

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.300
arts college.

00:35:50.975 --> 00:35:52.975
One that recognizes that many of
the 

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.450
most significant lessons it can 
impart 

00:35:57.709 --> 00:35:59.709
for leadership must emerge from 
the study of humanity.

00:36:01.623 --> 00:36:03.623
The academy describes it this 
way:  

00:36:04.906 --> 00:36:07.772
"the expansion of a person's 
capacity to know one's self and 

00:36:07.773 --> 00:36:10.034
view the world through multiple 
lenses."

00:36:13.097 --> 00:36:15.984
The distinguished academy 
graduate general George Patton, 

00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:18.673
whose papers are here at the 
Library of Congress insisted 

00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:24.174
that a successful soldier must 
know history.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.910
To win battles, he observed, you
do not beat weapons.  You beat 

00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:35.030
the soul of man.
Alexander the great slept with 

00:36:35.031 --> 00:36:37.031
two things under his pillow.

00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:43.662
A dagger and a copy of Homer's 
Illiad.  To understand the human

00:36:43.663 --> 00:36:45.704
soul.  No small aspiration.

00:36:49.972 --> 00:36:52.005
But one that has propelled my 
work for decades and the work of

00:36:52.006 --> 00:36:54.869
the humanities for millennia.

00:36:57.996 --> 00:37:00.297
In identifying what is 
distinctively human, we 

00:37:00.298 --> 00:37:02.298
necessarily commit ourselves 

00:37:03.786 --> 00:37:06.241
to its preservation and 
enhancement, to the appreciation

00:37:06.242 --> 00:37:08.927
of what unites us rather than 
the distraction of what divides 

00:37:08.928 --> 00:37:10.928
us.

00:37:12.379 --> 00:37:14.453
To the advancement of the humane
in a world that often seems bent

00:37:14.454 --> 00:37:16.454
on destroying it.

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:20.592
We must support universities in 
their dedication to these 

00:37:20.593 --> 00:37:22.593
efforts.

00:37:25.488 --> 00:37:28.326
And we must adopt a discourse 
that honors rather than 

00:37:28.327 --> 00:37:30.327
disparaging these fields of 
inquiry.

00:37:33.283 --> 00:37:35.283
But to make this possible and 

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.988
sustainable within universities,
we must also build broader 

00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:40.989
understanding of the 

00:37:42.264 --> 00:37:42.859
importance of the study of 
humanity outside and beyond 

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.860
them.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.165
And so let me return to where I 
began, to where we find 

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:51.166
ourselves tonight.

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.306
In serving as the Library of 
Congress, 

00:37:58.391 --> 00:37:59.036
this institution must also serve
all the people that Congress 

00:37:59.037 --> 00:38:01.037
represents.

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:06.825
Not just scholars but the 
curious citizens of an entire 

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.826
nation.

00:38:10.892 --> 00:38:12.892
All of us are in this room 
because we 

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.840
are in some way connected to 
that work, 

00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:20.751
because we are somehow invested 
in that endeavor.

00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:24.717
The extraordinary advances of 
science 

00:38:25.796 --> 00:38:27.796
and technology that lie before 
us must 

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:31.933
be shaped by human and humane 
purposes 

00:38:34.044 --> 00:38:35.258
if those values and perhaps even
humankind are not to be 

00:38:35.259 --> 00:38:37.259
destroyed.

00:38:39.743 --> 00:38:41.788
Let me invoke the historian's 
sense of contingency that I 

00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:43.789
earlier described.

00:38:46.917 --> 00:38:49.159
It is up to us to define the 
nature and quality of human 

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.160
possibility.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.100
The contents of this library can
help 

00:38:58.385 --> 00:38:59.811
inspire us to inspire others to 
understand what those 

00:38:59.812 --> 00:39:01.842
possibilities might be.

00:39:06.363 --> 00:39:07.592
Let me make this point by 
closing with a treasure from the

00:39:07.593 --> 00:39:09.593
library.

00:39:12.931 --> 00:39:14.931
I spoke earlier of the face of 
war.

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.126
The Library of Congress 
possesses a remarkable 

00:39:19.127 --> 00:39:21.127
collection of I understand 

00:39:22.263 --> 00:39:24.263
now more than 3500 civil war 
pieces that 

00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:29.176
has been assembled and donated 
by Tom lind qis, who is here in 

00:39:29.177 --> 00:39:31.177
the audience, and his three 
young sons.

00:39:34.118 --> 00:39:36.118
Inspired by newspaper 
photographs of U.S.

00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:40.419
servicemen and women killed in 
Iraq and 

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.197
Afghanistan, the Lindquist 
regard their collection as a 

00:39:46.442 --> 00:39:48.442
memorial to the soldiers of the 
civil war.

00:39:50.108 --> 00:39:52.108
This gives you a general 
portrait, but 

00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:56.593
here is one of the amber types 
from the collection.

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:00.699
It's been tentatively identified
as Sergeant Samuel Smith.

00:40:03.218 --> 00:40:05.218
His wife Molly and daughters, 
Mary and Maggie.

00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:09.760
The image was found in Cecil 
County, Maryland, so it's likely

00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:11.761
this soldier 

00:40:13.458 --> 00:40:15.458
was in one of seven regiments of
United 

00:40:16.525 --> 00:40:18.525
States Colored Troops raised  in
that state.

00:40:21.313 --> 00:40:24.192
Like all of the portraits in 
this collection, it speaks 

00:40:24.193 --> 00:40:26.232
eloquently to us across the 
century and a half that 

00:40:26.233 --> 00:40:28.233
separates us.

00:40:30.955 --> 00:40:32.955
For this soldier and his family,
the 

00:40:36.509 --> 00:40:38.509
message is one of pride, an 
affirmation 

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.180
of the new freedom's warhead 
enabled him to claim.

00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:45.264
Slavery would have denied him 
the right 

00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:49.241
to legally marry or to protect 
his wife and children from sale.

00:40:52.913 --> 00:40:54.913
This portrait is of a free man.

00:40:56.817 --> 00:40:58.817
It proclaims a new day for black

00:40:59.914 --> 00:41:02.177
families, a new respectability 
of fine clothing, and of 

00:41:02.178 --> 00:41:04.178
daughters in matching coats and 
bonnets.

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.924
And it portrays a soldier, an 
African American who under 

00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:13.925
slavery would have been 
prohibited 

00:41:16.024 --> 00:41:18.473
from bearing arms, and who, 
until 1863 could not have 

00:41:18.474 --> 00:41:20.474
enlisted in the Army.

00:41:23.392 --> 00:41:25.392
Now he is joined what would be 
nearly 

00:41:28.278 --> 00:41:30.278
200,000 other black Americans to
fight 

00:41:31.357 --> 00:41:33.182
for freedom, to risk enslavement
if captured, and to establish a 

00:41:33.183 --> 00:41:35.183
claim to 

00:41:37.676 --> 00:41:39.330
full citizenship and humanity as
the republic's old defenders.

00:41:43.202 --> 00:41:45.202
In this photograph, Sergeant 
Smith, or 

00:41:46.834 --> 00:41:49.294
whoever this might be, makes a 
statement about a new order of 

00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:51.295
things.

00:41:55.253 --> 00:41:56.467
It is his own Declaration of 
Independence, his personal 

00:41:56.468 --> 00:41:58.468
affirmation 

00:42:01.588 --> 00:42:03.588
that all men, that he has been 
created 

00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:06.845
equal, that he is fighting for a
new birth of freedom.

00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:12.633
But these 3500 portraits and 
thousands 

00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:17.143
more like them are intended to 
send us another message as well.

00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:21.633
One that speaks directly to the 

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.540
meaning of the study of humanity
across time and space.

00:42:29.641 --> 00:42:31.894
These soldiers staring into the 
photographer's lens are 

00:42:31.895 --> 00:42:33.895
self-consciously reaching 
through history.

00:42:36.812 --> 00:42:38.635
They have documented their faces
and uniforms partly because they

00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:40.704
know they may be killed in the 
battles ahead.

00:42:45.013 --> 00:42:47.013
But they also know they are 
making history in this war.

00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:52.721
And they want to capture that 
for us.

00:42:53.415 --> 00:42:55.415
Attention must be paid, they are
saying.

00:42:58.117 --> 00:43:00.117
Don't forget who we were and 
what we did.

00:43:04.043 --> 00:43:06.739
Let us give you the means to see
us, to understand us, long after

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.185
we are gone.

00:43:13.497 --> 00:43:16.154
Our present is delivered to us 
at a price paid by those who 

00:43:16.155 --> 00:43:18.155
came before.

00:43:20.053 --> 00:43:22.053
History helps us remember our 

00:43:24.532 --> 00:43:27.168
accountability to them, as well 
as our obligations to more than 

00:43:27.169 --> 00:43:29.169
just ourselves 

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.620
and more than just our own time.

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:35.693
It is a way of knowing and 
valuing that has never mattered 

00:43:35.694 --> 00:43:37.982
more.
Thank you very much.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.390
[Applause]

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.928
SPEAKER: Thank you for those 
aspiring words, Dr. Faust, and 

00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:23.571
all of us at the library look 
forward to working with you in 

00:44:23.572 --> 00:44:26.829
the future.  I know I can speak 
for all of us on that.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.140
And I now invite everybody to 
make your 

00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:35.391
way upstairs for dinner, and 
thank you again.

00:44:37.836 --> 00:44:39.836
[Applause]
