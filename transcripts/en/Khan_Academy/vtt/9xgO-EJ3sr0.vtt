00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:01.983
- [Voiceover] What we're
gonna cover in this video

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:04.329
is the intermediate value theorem.

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:07.547
Which, despite some of this
mathy language you'll see

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.996
is one of the more intuitive theorems

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:12.479
possibly the most
intuitive theorem you will

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.598
come across in a lot of your

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:16.415
mathematical career.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.541
So first I'll just read it out

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.968
and then I'll interpret it and hopefully

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:22.546
we'll all appreciate
that it's pretty obvious.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:24.449
I'm not going to prove it here.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.127
But, I think the conceptual
underpinning here is

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.879
it should be straightforward.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:32.311
So the theorem tells us
that suppose F is a function

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.715
continuous at every point of the interval

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:38.697
the closed interval, so
we're including A and B.

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:41.128
So it's continuous at every
point of the interval A, B.

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.633
Let me just draw a couple of examples

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.531
of what F could look like just

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:47.601
based on these first lines.

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.588
Suppose F is a function
continuous at every point

00:00:50.588 --> 00:00:52.970
of the interval A, B.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.283
So let me draw some axes here.

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:57.950
So that's my Y axis.

00:01:00.014 --> 00:01:01.847
And this is my X axis.

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:05.850
So, one situation

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.933
if this is A.

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:10.356
And this is B.

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.201
F is continuous at every
point of the interval

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:15.102
of the closed interval A and B.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:17.302
So that means it's got
to be for sure defined

00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:18.734
at every point.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.116
As well, as to be continuous you have

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:22.734
to defined at every point.

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:26.810
And the limit of the function
that is recorded at that point

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.645
should be equal to the value
of the function of that point.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:33.263
And so the function is
definitely going to be defined

00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:34.910
at F of A.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.281
So it's definitely going to have an F of A

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:37.375
right over here.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:38.964
That's right over here

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:39.797
is F of A.

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.938
Maybe F of B is higher.

00:01:42.938 --> 00:01:45.838
Although we can look at different cases.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:48.171
So that would be our F of B.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.239
And they tell us it is
a continuous function.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.849
It is a continuous function.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.439
So if you're trying to
imagine continuous functions

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.942
one way to think about it is

00:01:57.942 --> 00:01:59.854
if we're continuous over an interval

00:01:59.854 --> 00:02:01.344
we take the value of the function at

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:02.627
one point of the interval.

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:04.809
And, if it's continuous
we need to be able to

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:07.410
get to the other, the
value of the function

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.060
at the other point of the interval

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.986
without picking up our pencil.

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.828
So, I can do all sorts of things

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:15.727
and it still has to be a function.

00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:18.960
So, I can't do something like that.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.324
But,

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.117
as long as I don't pick up my pencil

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:23.860
this is a continuous function.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.028
So, there you go.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:27.627
If the somehow the graph

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.612
I had to pick up my pencil.

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.291
If I had to do something like this

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.511
oops, I got to pick up my
pencil do something like that,

00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.067
well that's not continuous anymore.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.896
If I had to do something like this

00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:38.354
and oops, pick up my pencil

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:39.744
not continuous anymore.

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:41.525
If I had to do something like

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:42.540
wooo.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.826
Whoa, okay, pick up my
pencil, go down here,

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.310
not continuous anymore.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.609
So, this is what a continuous function

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.497
that a function that is continuous

00:02:50.497 --> 00:02:52.320
over the closed interval A, B looks like.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.621
I can draw some other examples, in fact,

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:55.014
let me do that.

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:56.797
So let me draw

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:57.630
one.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.733
Maybe where F of B is less than

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.120
F of A.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.246
So it's my Y axis.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:04.413
And this is my

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.483
X axis.

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.047
And once again, A and B don't both

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:10.164
have to be positive,

00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:11.292
they can both be negative.

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:14.313
One could be, A could be negative.

00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:16.711
B could be positive.

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:19.132
And maybe in this situation.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.744
And F of A and F of B

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:22.630
it could also be a positive or negative.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.066
But let's take a situation where this is

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:25.899
F of A.

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:28.485
So that, right over there,

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:29.318
is F of A.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.766
This right over here

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:32.599
is F of B.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:34.769
F of B.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.112
And once again we're saying F is a

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:38.666
continuous function.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.385
So I should be able to go from F of A

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:41.455
to F of B

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.000
F of B draw a function

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.956
without having to pick up my pencil.

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.558
So it could do something like this.

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:49.537
Actually I want to make it go vertical.

00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:51.172
It could go like this

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:52.620
and then go down.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.556
And then

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:54.819
do something

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.821
like that.

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.374
So these are both cases

00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:58.757
and I could draw an
infinite number of cases

00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:01.252
where F is a function
continuous at every point

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:02.865
of the interval.

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.822
The closed interval, from A to B.

00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:07.472
Now, given that

00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:09.913
there's two ways to state the conclusion

00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:11.767
for the intermediate value theorem.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.450
You'll see it written in one of these ways

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.970
or something close to one of these ways.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.784
And that's why I included both of these.

00:04:16.784 --> 00:04:18.554
So one way to say it is, well

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.521
if this first statement is true

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.953
then F will take on every value

00:04:22.953 --> 00:04:25.690
between F of A and F of B

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.052
over the interval.

00:04:27.052 --> 00:04:28.921
And you see in both of these cases

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.985
every interval, sorry, every

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:33.481
every value between F of A

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.985
and F of B.

00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:36.665
So every value here

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:39.398
is being taken on at some point.

00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:41.521
You can pick some value.

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:44.149
You can pick some value,
an arbitrary value

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.649
L, right over here.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:46.482
Oh look.

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:48.089
L happened right over there.

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.172
If you pick L

00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:52.066
well, L happened right over there.

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.584
And actually it also happened there

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.568
and it also happened there.

00:04:55.568 --> 00:04:57.648
And this second bullet point describes

00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:00.472
the intermediate value
theorem more that way.

00:05:00.472 --> 00:05:03.341
For any L between the values of F and A

00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.174
and F of B

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:06.677
there are exists a number C

00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:08.888
in the closed interval from A to B

00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:11.192
for which F of C equals L.

00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:12.818
So there exists at least one C.

00:05:12.818 --> 00:05:14.233
So in this case

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.321
that would be our C.

00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:17.870
Over here, there's potential

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.879
there's multiple candidates for C.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.143
That could be a candidate for C.

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:23.832
That could be a C.

00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:26.422
So we could say there exists at least

00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:27.436
one number.

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:28.269
At least

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.439
one number, I'll throw that in there,

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.126
at least one number C

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:36.558
in the interval for which this is true.

00:05:36.558 --> 00:05:38.737
And, something that might amuse you

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.418
for a few minutes is

00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:42.352
try to draw a function where this first

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:43.808
statement is true.

00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:46.069
But somehow the second statement is

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:46.902
not true.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.249
So, you say, okay, well let's say

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.105
let's assume that there's an L

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:53.167
where there isn't a C in the interval.

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.538
Let me try and do that.

00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:55.965
And I'll draw it big so that

00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:59.035
we can really see how obvious

00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:00.438
that we have to take on

00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.288
all of the values between F and A

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.063
and F of B is.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:05.006
So,

00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:07.903
let me draw a big axis this time.

00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:10.390
So that's my Y axis.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.752
And,

00:06:11.752 --> 00:06:13.252
that is my X axis.

00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:16.654
And I'll just do the case where

00:06:16.654 --> 00:06:18.582
just for simplicity, that is A

00:06:18.582 --> 00:06:19.749
and that is B.

00:06:21.088 --> 00:06:22.171
And let's say

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:24.952
that this is F of A.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:26.791
So that is

00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:29.350
F of A.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.527
And let's say that this

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:31.360
is F of B.

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:34.399
Little dotted line.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.232
All right.

00:06:35.232 --> 00:06:36.065
F of B.

00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:38.892
And we assume that we

00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:40.958
we have a continuous function here.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.395
So the graph, I could draw it from

00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:44.361
F of A to F of B from this point

00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.956
to this point

00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:47.506
without picking up my pencil.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:49.286
From this coordinate A comma F of A

00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:51.059
to this coordinate B comma F of B

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:53.201
without picking up my pencil.

00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:54.926
Well, let's assume

00:06:54.926 --> 00:06:57.439
that there is some L
that we don't take on.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.958
Let's say there's some
value L right over here.

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:00.791
And,

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:04.838
and we never take on this value.

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:07.345
This continuous function
never takes on this value

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:10.420
as we go from X equaling A to X equal B.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.902
Let's see if I can draw that.

00:07:11.902 --> 00:07:13.537
Let's see if I can get

00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:14.840
from here

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.287
to here

00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:19.641
without ever essentially
crossing this dotted line.

00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:21.037
Well let's see, I could, wooo,

00:07:21.037 --> 00:07:23.283
maybe I would a little bit.

00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:24.903
But gee, how am I gonna get there?

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.716
Well, without picking up my pencil.

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:28.273
Well,

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:30.566
well, I really need to
cross that line,all right.

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:31.399
Well, there you go.

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.551
I found, we took on the value L

00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:35.424
and it happened at C

00:07:35.424 --> 00:07:38.109
which is in that closed interval.

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:40.871
So once again, I'm not
giving you a proof here.

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:43.085
But hopefully you have a good intuition

00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:45.124
that the intermediate value theorem

00:07:45.124 --> 00:07:46.447
is kind of common sense.

00:07:46.447 --> 00:07:48.690
The key is you're dealing
with a continuous function.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.920
If you make its graph

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.332
if you were to draw it between

00:07:51.332 --> 00:07:53.034
the coordinates A comma F of A

00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:54.762
and B comma F of B

00:07:54.762 --> 00:07:56.988
and you don't pick up your pencil,

00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:58.874
which would be true of
a continuous function.

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:00.312
Well, it's going to take on every value

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:02.479
between F of A and F of B.
