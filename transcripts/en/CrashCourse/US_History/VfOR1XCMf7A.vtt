00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.480
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US History, and today we're gonna learn about one of the best eras ever:

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.440
the 1920s.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.780
The 20s gave us jazz, movies, radio, making out in cars, illegal liquor,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.560
and the 20s also gave us prosperity--although not for everybody--

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.040
and gangsters, and a consumer culture based on credit,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.200
and lots of prejudice against immigrants,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.660
and eventually the worst economic crisis the US has ever seen.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.620
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, but what about Gatsby?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.700
Yeah, me from the past, it's true that Gastby turned out all right in the end,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.400
but what preyed on Gatsby,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.780
what foul dust trailed in the wake of his dreams,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.960
did temporarily close out my interest in the aborted sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.520
*theme music*

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.480
So there's a stereotypical view of the 1920s as "The Roaring 20s,"

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.500
a decade of exciting change and new cultural touchstones,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.720
as well as increased personal freedom and dancing.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.020
And it really was a time of increased wealth--

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.080
for some people.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.120
The quote of the decade has to go to our famously taciturn president from Massachusetts,
Calvin Coolidge, who said,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.980
Jay-Z would later update this
for the 21st century noting,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.680
But anyway, during the 1920s, the
government helped business grow like gangbusters,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.060
largely by not regulating it much at all.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.100
This is known as
“laissez-faire” capitalism.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.680
Or “laissez-faire” capitalism if you’re good at speaking French.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.280
The Republican Party
dominated politics in the 1920s,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.460
with all the presidents elected in the decade being

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.320
staunch conservative
Republicans.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.600
The federal government hewed to the policies favored by business lobbyists,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.700
including lower taxes on
personal income and business profits,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.300
and efforts to weaken the power of unions.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.040
Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and
Hoover stocked the boards of the Federal Reserve

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.760
and the Federal Trade Commission with men

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.640
who shared their
pro-business views,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
shifting the country away from the economic regulation that had been favored by Progressives.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.680
And that was very good for the American economy,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.040
at least in the short run.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.830
The 1920s were also marked by

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.020
quite a bit of government corruption,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.580
most of which can be pinned to the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.420
administration of Warren G. Harding. Now,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.369
Harding himself wasn't terribly corrupt,

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.350
but he picked terrible friends. They

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.520
included Attorney General Harry

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.229
Daugherty who accepted money to not

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.209
prosecute criminals, and Interior

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.370
Secretary Albert fall, who took half a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.170
million dollars from private business in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.150
exchange for leases to government oil

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.070
reserves at Teapot Dome. Fall later

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.900
became the first cabinet member ever to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.580
be convicted of a felony, but on the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.489
other hand, business, man! Productivity rose

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.350
dramatically largely because older

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.060
industry's adopted Henry Ford's assembly

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.100
line techniques and newer industries

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.590
like aviation, chemicals, and electronics

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.600
grew up to provide Americans with new

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.150
products and new jobs. During the 1920s

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.850
annual production of cars tripled to 4.8

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.709
million, and automobile companies were

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.600
gradually consolidated into the big

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.060
three that we know today: Ford, Chrysler,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.239
and Harley-Davidson. What? General Motors.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.209
By 1929 half of all American families

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.430
owned a car and thus began the American

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.440
love affair with the automobile, which is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.900
also

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.220
where love affairs were often

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.470
consummated, which is why in the 1920s

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.239
cars came to be known as Scootaloo

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.549
pooping chariots. What's that? They were

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.049
called brothels on wheels? And the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.640
economy also grew because American

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.260
corporations were extending their reach

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.450
overseas, and American foreign investment

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.890
was greater than that of any other

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.019
country. The dollar replaced the pound as

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.609
the most important currency for trade

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.409
and by the end of the decade America was

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.150
producing eighty-five percent of the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.189
world's cars and forty percent of its

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.530
overall manufactured goods. Stan can I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.320
get a Libertage?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.140
And companies turned out

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.140
all kinds of labor-saving devices like

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.760
vacuum cleaners, toasters, refrigerators,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.470
and not having to spend all day washing

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.480
your clothes, or turning over your own

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.430
toast like some kind of common or meant

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.260
that Americans had more time for leisure.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.420
And this was provided by radios and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.329
baseball games boxing matches vacations

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.909
dance crazes. I mean before Gangnam style

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.920
there was the windy and the Charleston

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.450
but probably the most significant

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.220
leisure product was movies and I'm not

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.689
just saying that because I'm staring

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.549
into a camera. The American film industry

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.349
moved out to Hollywood before World War

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.569
one because land was cheap and plentiful

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.280
all that sunshine meant that you could

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.530
shoot outside all year round and it was

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.769
close to everything: desert, mountains,

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.099
ocean, plastic surgeons. And by 1925 the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.870
American film industry had eclipsed all

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.190
of its competitors and become the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.709
greatest in the world, especially if you

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.840
count by volume and not quality, and more

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.979
and more people had money to go see

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.229
those movies thanks to consumer debt. The

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.210
widespread use of credit and lay away

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.560
buying plans meant that it was

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.810
acceptable to go into debt to maintain

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.520
what came to be seen as the American

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.889
standard of living and this was a huge

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.810
change in attitude. These days we don't

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.280
even think of credit cards as debt,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.409
really. But they are. And that was a

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.330
relatively new idea as was another

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.340
feature of American life in the 20s that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.380
is still with us: celebrity. Opera singer

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.419
Enrico Caruso has often been called the

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.250
first modern celebrity but now he's a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.590
lot less famous than Charlie Chaplin or

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.810
Rudolph Valentino or Babe Ruth but

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.159
probably the biggest celebrity of the

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.260
decade was Charles Lindbergh whose claim

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.060
to fame was flying across the Atlantic

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.449
Ocean by himself without stopping

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:03.889
although he did use an airplane which

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.300
makes it slightly less impressive. Now

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.979
Lindbergh wasn't a truly contemporary

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.599
celebrity in the sense of being famous

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.790
for being famous, but he was

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.220
a business more than a businessman. High

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.170
culture also flourished. This was the age

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.210
of the lost generation of American

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.980
writers, many of whom lived and worked in

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.930
Europe but America had its own version

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.820
of Paris in New York. The decade of the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.130
1920s saw continued migration of African

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.990
American people from the South to cities

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.670
in the nNorth, and Harlem became the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.770
capital of Black America. And speaking of

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.450
migration, let us now migrated to the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.000
chair for the Mystery Document.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.840
The rules here

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.400
are simple: I guess the author of

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.960
the mystery document, I'm either right or

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.440
I get shocked with the shock pen.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.680
Alright let's see we got here.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.840
“If we must die would it not be like hogs hunted and

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.480
penned in an inglorious spot, while round

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.450
us bark the mad and hungry dogs, making

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.240
their market are a curse a lot... Like men

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.030
we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.600
pressed to the wall, dying but fight back.”

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.640
Stan thank you for the poetry I

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.900
appreciate that it's not some obscure

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.920
document from 18th century blah blah blah

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.420
It's Claude McKay Harlem Renaissance

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.560
poet, the poem is called “If We Must Die.”

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.720
Ah, it's the only thing in the world I'm

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.730
actually good at. Now I know this from the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.500
imagery alone, especially the line about

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.180
“mad and hungry dogs” that would

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.190
figuratively and literally make up the

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.900
mobs at the lynchings, but the giveaway

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.180
here is the ultimate sentiment that we

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.220
will fight back. This was part of the

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.900
spirit of the Harlem Renaissance which

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.420
rejected stereotypes and prejudice and

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.580
sought to celebrate African-American

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.260
experience. Meanwhile, things for changing

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.090
for women as well, as they found new ways

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.400
to express autonomy. Flappers kept their

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.590
hair and skirts short, smoked and drank

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.240
illegally in public, and availed

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.890
themselves of birth control. And

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.150
marketers encouraged them to buy

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.800
products like cigarettes christened

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.900
torches of freedom by Edward Bernays.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.820
Liberation had its limits though; most

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.710
women were still expected to marry, have

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.540
children, and find their freedom at home

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.670
through the use of washing machines, but

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.710
the picture of prosperity is as usual

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.420
more complicated than it at first

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.760
appears. The fact that so many Americans

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.650
were going into debt in order to pursue

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.210
the American dream meant that if the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.940
economy faltered, and it did, there was

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.710
going to be lots of trouble. Let's go to

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.720
the Thought Bubble. Prosperity in the 1920s

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.400
wasn't equally distributed through the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.680
population. Real industrial wages rose by

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.169
a quarter between 1922 and 1929 but

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.270
corporate profits rose at twice that

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.560
rate. By 1929,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.970
one percent of the nation's banks

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.500
controlled fifty percent of the nation's

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.419
financial resources and the wealthiest

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.520
five percent of Americans share of

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.470
national income exceeded that of the

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.900
bottom sixty percent. An estimated forty

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.760
percent of Americans lived in poverty.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.530
Now many Americans celebrated big

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.000
business, and Wall Street was often seen

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.760
as heroic possibly because  by 1920 about

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.580
1.5 million Americans owned some kind of

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.440
stock, but big business also meant that

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.780
smaller businesses disappeared. During

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.730
the 1920s the number of manufacturing

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.250
workers declined by 5%, the first time

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.780
this class of workers had seen its

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.970
numbers drop, but not the last. Now some

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.470
of these jobs were made up for by new

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.020
jobs in retail finance and education, but

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.150
as early as the 1920s New England was

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.830
beginning to see unemployment in

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.200
deindustrialization as textile companies

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.910
moved their operations to the south

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.440
where labor was cheaper and

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.970
working-class people still made up the

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.620
majority of Americans and they often

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.450
couldn't afford these newfangled devices,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.580
like in 1930, seventy-five percent

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.440
of american homes didn't have a

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.510
washing machine, and only forty percent

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.370
of them had a radio. Farmers were even

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.900
worse off many had prospered during

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.430
World War One when the government

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.410
subsidized farm prices in order to keep

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.450
farms producing for the war effort, but

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.890
when the subsidies ended, production

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.870
didn't subside, largely due to

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.550
mechanization and increased use of

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.530
fertilizer. Farmers incomes dropped

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.599
steadily and many saw banks foreclose

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.280
upon their property. For the first time

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.410
in American history the number of farms

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.170
declined during the 1920s. For farmers

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.100
the Great Depression began early.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.860
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So in general the federal

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.630
government did little to nothing to help

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.940
farmers or workers. The Supreme Court was

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.440
the only segment of the government that

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.870
kept any progressive ideas alive as they

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.910
began to craft a system of ideas that we

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.710
call the jurisprudence of civil

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.210
liberties. Now the court still voted to

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.040
uphold convictions of left-wing critics

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.839
of the government but gradually began to

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.670
embrace the idea that people had the

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.040
right to express dissonant views in what

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.810
Oliver Wendell Holmes called the

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.060
“Marketplace of ideas.” In Near vs. Minnesota,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.530
the Supreme Court struck down

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.230
censorship of newspapers and by 1927

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.060
Justice Brandeis was writing that

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.100
“Freedom to think as you will and to

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.440
speak as you think are indispensable to

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.660
the discovery and spread of political truth.”

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.520
But despite increased free speech

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.010
and torches of liberty and flappers and

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.230
the Harlem Renaissance the 1920s was in

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.580
many ways a reactionary

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.230
period in American history. For instance

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.880
the decade saw the resurgence of the

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.180
Ku Klux Klan in a new and improved form and

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.050
by improved I mean much more terrible.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.880
Spurred on by the hyper patriotism that

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.620
was fostered during World War One, the

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.780
Klan denounced immigrants and Jews and

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.580
Catholics as less than one hundred

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.770
percent American, and by the mid 20s the

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.290
Klan claimed more than 3 million members

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.910
and it was the largest private

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.010
organization right here in my home state

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.810
of Indiana. And with more immigrants

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.520
coming from Southern and Eastern Europe

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.480
who were often Catholic and Jewish,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.180
White Protestants became more and more

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.160
concerned about losing their dominant

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.940
position in the social order.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.200
Spoiler alert: it turns out okay for you, White Protestants

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.430
The first immigration

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.440
restriction bill was passed in 1921,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.970
limiting the number of immigrants from

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.540
Europe to 357,000. In 1924, a new

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.340
immigration law dropped that number to

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.980
150,000 and established quotas based on

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.390
national origin. The numbers of

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.010
immigrants allowed from Southern and

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.900
Eastern Europe were drastically reduced

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.700
and Asians except for Filipinos were

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.650
totally forbidden. The quota for

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.290
Filipinos was set at 50 per year

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.850
although they were still allowed to

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.830
emigrate to Hawaii because their labor

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.000
was needed there. There were no

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.590
restrictions, however, on immigration from

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.790
the Western Hemisphere because

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.740
California's large-scale farms were

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.600
dependent upon seasonal laborers from

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.220
Mexico. These immigration restrictions

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.170
were also influenced by fear of radical

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.540
anarchists and pseudo scientific ideas

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.460
about race; whites were seen as

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.680
scientifically superior to people of

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.930
color and as President Coolidge himself

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.700
declared when he signed the 1924

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.600
immigration law, “America must be kept American”

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.880
Tell me Calvin Coolidge about

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.110
how American you are. Are you Cherokee, or

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.900
Cree, or Lakota? The 1920s also saw

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.370
increased tension between science

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.810
education in the United States and

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.640
religious beliefs. The best known example

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.590
is of course the trial of John Scopes in

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.990
Tennessee in 1925. Scopes was tried for

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.120
breaking the law against teaching

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.650
evolution which he had been encouraged

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.660
to do by the ACLU as a test case for

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.850
freedom of speech. Scopes was prosecuted

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.560
by William Jennings Bryan whom you will

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.240
remember as having recently resigned as

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.860
Secretary of State and who had become a

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.600
leader of the Fundamentalist Movement.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.460
And Scopes was defended by Clarence

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.560
Darrow, that famous defense attorney who

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.330
contemporary defense attorneys always

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.940
point to to argue that defense attorneys

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.590
aren't all scum. Scopes and Darrow

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.460
actually lost the trial but the case

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.320
drew national attention and ultimately led to

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.360
evolution being taught in more American

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.160
schools. The Scopes trial is often seen

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.960
as a victory for free thinking and

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.240
science and modernism, and I suppose it

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.430
was, but for me it's more a symbol of the

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.530
contradictions of the 1920s. This is the

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.150
decade that gave us mass consumer

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.130
culture and celebrity worship, which are

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.410
important and very complicated legacies.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.940
And it also saw the birth of modern

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.800
conceptions of civil liberties. It was a

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.450
period when tolerance became an

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.430
important value, but at the same time it

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.470
saw a rise in lynchings. Immigrants were

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.270
necessary for the economic boom of the

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.490
1920s, but at the same time their numbers

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.170
were restricted, as they were seen as a

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.300
threat to traditional American value, and

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.800
that raises a question that we're still

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.870
struggling with today: What are those

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.820
values? I don't mean that rhetorically

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.320
let me know in comments.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.960
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.460

graphics team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.760
I nailed that.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.920
Every week there's a new caption

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.520

own in comments or ask questions about

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.760
today's video that will be answered by

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.980
our team of historians.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.120
Thank you for watching Crash Course,
