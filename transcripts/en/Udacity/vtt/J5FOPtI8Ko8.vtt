00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.810
To summarize, the advantage of callbacks is that the component can

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.880
provide a structured regime of calling within which the client executes.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.230
The regime can orchestrate the order of operations in a way that the client

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.050
would have to do by itself using the tradi, using a traditional approach.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.120
For example, the regime might provide an event loop.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.870
The cost of using callbacks is that the component state is exposed to

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.940
the client at a time when it might not be internally consistent.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.400
That is, using callbacks makes it more difficult for

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.180
components to guarantee their integrity.
