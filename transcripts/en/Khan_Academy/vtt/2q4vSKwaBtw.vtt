00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Sal: --the consistent theme
we're discovering in

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.540
chemistry, that everything
is about random

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.870
bumps between molecules.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.590
And when they bump randomly
into each other, a lot of

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.690
different things can happen in
terms of knocking different

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.890
parts of the molecules off of
each other and bonding to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.150
different things.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.180
This includes pure water, which
for the most part, one

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.380
would think is a pretty
stable substance.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.390
And it really is.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.670
But it turns out-- let's
say if we start

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.700
with 2 water molecules.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.000
And when I put a 2 here, and any
of these is going to turn

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300
into an equilibrium equation.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.229
It could represent 2 molecules,
it could represent

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.400
2 moles of molecules.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.880
What matters is just the ratios
in these equations.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.210
And I think you know that.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.850
But let me just draw
2 for an example.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.350
So let's say I have
the oxygen end.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.370
Let's have another
oxygen here.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
They both are attached
to some hydrogens.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.700
They're sharing electrons with
some hydrogens here.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.900
And we know that oxygen is a lot
more electronegative than

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.430
hydrogen, so it hogs all of the
electrons and what that

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.620
creates is a partial positive
charge at the hydrogen side of

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.570
the water molecule.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.670
They're almost naked protons
being attached

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.720
to the water molecules.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.230
This is positive here.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.390
And then the oxygen sides have
a partial negative charge

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.080
because they're hogging
all the electrons.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.130
And this bond between the
negative side of the oxygen

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.650
molecules and the positive
side of another oxygen

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.950
molecule-- this is called a
hydrogen bond-- this is what

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.220
keeps water together and what
keeps it definitely in it's

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.370
liquid or solid states.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.470
And in solid states, these bonds
become-- they only stay

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.210
together in some lattice
structure.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.835
And in a liquid state, they
can kind of break

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:35.760
and form new ones.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.890
But they keep them close to each
other, rubbing against

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.790
each other.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.610
Now it turns out if you just
have exactly the right set of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.930
circumstances-- this isn't the
exact some circumstances, but

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.700
I think you can imagine.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.190
If this moved just exactly close
enough, it had enough

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.310
kinetic energy to move right
past this one, there's some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.800
probability-- and I'll draw an
equilibrium reaction here,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.702
because that is what we
are dealing with.

00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:03.430
The equilibrium reaction.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.910
There's some probability that
this hydrogen right here gets

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.770
stuck to this guy.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.259
He gets so close, and maybe this
guy bounces in some other

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
weird way that we get left
with-- let me draw the same 2

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.500
characters, the 2 oxygens.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.020
Actually let, me draw
the second guy.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.780
Let's say that he just he just
somehow passed the other guy.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.440
So he had some movement.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.630
Let's say he moved in
that direction.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.010
This is obviously is not
scientific, but it gives you a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.950
narrative around what
could happen.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070
This guy's hydrogen protons.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.690
And this was attracted
to this oxygen side.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.110
And if just under the right
circumstances-- Remember.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.680
Everything here is
probabalistic.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.440
There's always a probability of
almost anything happening.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.650
This guy can get attached to
the negative side of this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.210
water molecule, the
water side.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.930
And then this guy is only left
with one hydrogen right here.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.860
And then this molecule as a
whole, this is OH, hydroxide.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.080
And it has a minus
charge, right?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.320
Because water was a
neutral molecule.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.310
You had just as many protons
and electrons.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.610
Now we have 1 less proton
than electrons.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.520
So in this case, just the
hydrogen nucleus itself--

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.680
which is just a proton because
we learned that hydrogen

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.360
doesn't have any neutrons
in it's normal form.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.910
This is essentially a proton
when we draw a hydrogen.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.020
It gets bumped off or scraped
off and ends up on this water

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.010
molecule, so this guy lost
a proton, has the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.760
same number of electrons.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.580
So he now has a negative
charge.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.480
This guy has the same number of
electrons, but now he's got

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.310
an extra proton.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.550
So he has a positive charge.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.440
So this is H3O with
a positive charge.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.660
And this little version right
here where we gave a water

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.930
molecule and it somehow gains
an extra hydrogen proton or

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.980
hydrogen atom.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.230
This is called hydronium.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.000
And this process where water
can kind of spontaneously--

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.730
and I'm not saying that water--
you know, a whole

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.030
glass of water, this
is going to happen.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.630
It's actually happening
to a very

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.210
small number of molecules.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.340
That if you view this is an
equilibrium reaction-- when

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.360
you have 2 waters, the reaction
is much more weighted

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.829
in the leftward direction.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.060
But this can happen, and that's
what the whole point of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.990
this is to think about.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.010
But this process is called
autoionization.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.410
Because you just have water by
itself, and just buy some

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.110
random circumstances of some
molecules bumping into each

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.970
other just right, some
subset of the water

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.330
will ionize like this.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.810
Where one part will lose
a proton and the other

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.290
part will gain one.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.540
So this is autoionization.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.600
And of course this is an
equilibrium reaction, so now

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.430
these guys might go
bump into 2 other

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.670
things and become water.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.630
Maybe they'll bump into
each other again and

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.310
they'll become water.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.470
So goes back and forth.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.000
So there's some equilibrium
concentration of this.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.510
Let me write it as a proper
equilibrium reaction.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.930
So you could have 2, maybe
moles of water molecules.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.215
They are in equilibrium
with H3O positive.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.770
And all these are in an
aqueous solution.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.730
And that's a bit of a redundancy
because aqueous

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.190
solution means that you're
dissolved in water.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.030
So of course water is
dissolved in water.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.730
But then H3O dissolved
in water.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.150
So all around here, you
have water molecules.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.955
This isn't isolation.

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:32.190
You have gazillions of water
molecules all around.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.900
Plus OH minus aqueous.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.300
Now.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.130
Sometimes you'll see that exact

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.250
reaction written as this.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.450
And it's important if you
realize it's the same thing.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.090
H2O in equilibrium with just
1 hydrogen ion popping off.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.670
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.460
Let me write that down.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.350
Everything is being dissolved
and water.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.270
Plus OH minus in an aqueous
solution And this equation

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.030
right here-- and what
I wrote at the top.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.160
And let me cut and paste
this so you can see

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.210
them at the same time.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.120
Copy.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Go down here.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.070
And paste this.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.240
These are essentially
equivalent, although the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.530
second equation right
here describes

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.050
what exactly happens.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.020
So the first equation is
creating a picture.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.080
You have one water molecule
and there's some small

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.180
probability that one of its
hydrogens just pop off.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.800
And you're just left with a
hydrogen and a hydroxide,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.040
which is just an oxygen and
a hydrogen atom together.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.250
But the reality is that these
hydrogen protons don't exist

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.720
in water on their own.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.030
Whenever they are in water, in
an aqueous solution, they

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.320
essentially get a ride with
another water molecule.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.460
And that's what happens here
with the hydronium ion.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.650
But the whole reason why I'm
going into this whole

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.040
discussion about the
autoionization of water is

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.850
because people really care about
the concentration of--

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.880
depending on how I view it--
hydrogen atoms, hydrogen

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.950
protons in a solution, or you
could say hydronium protons in

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.320
a solution.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.840
The concentration of
these 2 things are

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.160
going to be the same.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.420
Right?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.360
Because all of these really are
riding on another water

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.920
molecule and becoming
hydronium.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.600
How do you measure this-- or a
better question is what is the

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.190
equilibrium of this reaction?

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.980
So it turns out that in just
regular water, the

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.050
concentration-- and I'll maybe
I'll switch to this one.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.250
The concentration of-- this
is in regular water

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.250
at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.800
Let me write that down.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.910
25 degrees Celsius, which is
roughly room temperature.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.950
With pure water.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.940
The concentration
of pure water.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.460
In pure water, the concentration
of hydrogen

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.260
ions, and you could also say
that that's the concentration

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.650
of hydronium ions, or cations,
because they're positive.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:14.490
It equals 10 to the minus
seventh molar.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.810
Right?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:25.110
So for every 1 liter of water,
you have 10 to the minus 7

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.920
moles of hydronium ions.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.840
Which is still a pretty good
number because it's 10 to the

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.059
minus 7 moles, so it's
10 to the minus 7

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.549
times Avogadro's number.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.940
So let me just do that.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:42.650
So it's 10 to the minus 7 moles
per liter of water,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.440
which is the same thing as 10 to
the minus 7 times-- a mole

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.030
is just a number.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.810
6.022 times 10 to the 23.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.140
So you do the math here.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.370
You still end up with what?

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.790
60 times 10 to the 16th
power molecule.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.910
So you still have a large
number of molecules.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.190
It's just a small fraction of
the total number molecules are

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.430
actually these hydrogen or
these hydronium ions.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.610
And it turns out that your
concentration of hydroxides is

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:17.100
also-- so your concentration
of hydroxides is also 10 to

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.880
the minus seventh molars.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.790
So if we know that, we can now
actually figure out the

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.790
equilibrium constant for this
autoionization of water.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.175
We can figure out the
equilibrium constant.

00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:31.270
So let's do that.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.070
And we'll do it with
the first one.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.390
So let's say you have--
I'll switch colors.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.210
H2O in an aqueous solution.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.060
It's in equilibrium
with hydrogen ions

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.300
in an aqueous solution.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.950
But we know in reality
they've gotten rides

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.580
with other water ions.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.710
With the other water molecules,
not ions.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.560
They turn them into
hydronium ions.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.930
Plus hydroxide molecule.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.620
The equilibrium for this
reaction, the equilibrium

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.510
constant, we'll call it for
the K sub w for water.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:14.650
It equals the concentration of
the products of hydrogen ions

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.640
times a concentration of
the hydroxide ions.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.060
Now, in a normal situation,
we would divide it by the

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.820
concentration of
the reactants.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.440
But in this case, and we learned
this before, the

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.540
reactants are what
the solvent is.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.540
We are in water.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.270
So you we won't include this.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.400
And if you want the intuition
behind that, remember this

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.550
whole thing comes out from the
probability of-- this is the

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.360
probably of the backwards
reaction happening as related

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.140
to the concentrations
of these two things

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.590
multiplied by each other.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.140
And the probably the forward
reaction happening is related

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.580
to the probability of finding
two of the product-- of the

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.920
reacting molecules
in one space.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.090
And you're always going
to find these

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.360
molecules in some place.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.760
It's just going to be a constant
probability that some

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.300
water spontaneously turns
into these two products.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.610
So whenever you have a reaction
like this equilibrium

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.870
reaction, and the one side is
essentially just a solution,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.300
you just don't include it.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.190
So the equilibrium-- or you
could just think of

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.980
it as a 1 down here.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.070
So the equilibrium constant of
this autoionization water is

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.580
right there.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.170
And I just gave you what the
numbers were at room

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.830
temperature.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.990
So the equilibrium constant is
equal to-- the concentration

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:33.150
of hydrogen is 10 to the minus
7 times a concentration of

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.080
hydroxide is also 10
to the minus 7.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.840
So it equals 10 to the
minus 14th power.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.335
Now.

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:45.280
And that's a good thing
to memorize.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.100
The equilibrium constant of the
autoionization of water.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.380
And just so you know, this is
all going to lead into acids.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.770
Because essentially people care
a whole bunch about what

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.330
this concentration
ends up being.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.180
And we're going to
touch on that a

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.180
little bit in this video.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.650
Now it turns out that people
chemistry, for whatever

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.190
reason, they don't like talking
in these terms. They

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.720
don't like saying 10 to
the minus 14th power.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.630
So what they do is they take
the negative log of things.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.100
Negative log base 10.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.470
And if logs are intimidating to
you, review the videos on

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.080
logarithms.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.830
So what they do is they take the
minus log of both sides.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.780
And when someone just writes log
without a number, you can

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.780
assume it's base 10.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.630
But they take the minus log of
the equilibrium constant.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.510
The minus log base 10 of 10 to
the minus 14 is equal to--

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.570
well 10 to what powers is
10 to the minus 14?

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.690
Well, it's minus fourteen,
right?

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.290
And then you have that
minus in front.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:49.650
You have this minus, and the
log part is just minus 14.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.200
And so the minus log of the
equilibrium constant of water

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.560
is equal to 14.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.480
And this idea right here
is called a pKw.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.880
pK.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.910
Let me put the p in a different
color just so you

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.760
see where it's-- pKw.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.100
But all p means, whenever you
see it in chemistry, it just

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.130
means minus log base 10.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.690
Minus log base 10.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.630
And there's some debate as to
what p stands for, I try to

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.430
think of it as power, although
it's a minus log, it's a

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.500
exponent-- but whatever.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.640
It means you're taking the
minus log of something.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.310
And what it does is, it's just a
way kind of a way to get out

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.840
of the exponent world-- although
I think it's nicer to

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.150
stay in the exponent world
because you really know what

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.980
you're talking about--
into some nice

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.490
clean number like 14.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.900
So when someone says that's
the pKw is 14, all they're

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.420
saying is that the equilibrium
constant, which is just this

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.540
part right here, is 10
to the minus 14.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.180
Now, the same convention
is used on the hydrogen

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.660
concentration.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.130
The next few videos are all
going to revolve around the

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.710
hydrogen concentration in
water, essentially.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.540
We'll talk a little bit about
what happens when you're

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.810
outside of water.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.540
Now the hydrogen concentration
of water at room temperature,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.580
I've told you, has been
determined to be 10 to the

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.540
minus 7 molars.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.940
People aren't happy just with
that, so what they want to do

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.300
is do the same thing.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.670
They want to take the minus
log of both sides.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.440
So they say that pH--
and you've probably

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.490
heard the word pH.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.510
It's a lot of cosmetics.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.390
pH balance.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.500
Now you know what it means.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.530
They're really just saying that
we have the right number

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.560
of hydrogen ions in our lotion
or our perfume or whatever

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.760
we're trying to sell you.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:42.930
So the pH is equal to the minus
log of the hydrogen ion

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.505
concentration, which is equal
to the minus log, remember,

00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:51.740
it's just a base 10 if I don't
specify otherwise, of 10 to

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.410
the minus 7, which is equal to--
well, 10 to what power is

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.400
10 to the minus 7?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.580
This is equal to minus 7.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.450
Then we have the minus
outside, so then

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.720
this becomes 7.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.100
Now.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.105
You can do that same exercise
for the pOH.

00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:11.910
pOH.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.900
The concentration of
hydroxide ions.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.990
What's the negative log of the
hydroxide concentration.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.260
The hydroxide concentration,
we saw, was the same

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.570
concentration as the water
concentration.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.540
Oh, I didn't write it there.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.260
Where did I write it?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.470
Right there.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.770
10 of the minus seventh
molars.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.870
So water has the same
number of hydroxides

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.930
and hydrogen ions.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.260
And that's because this water
is just associating into the

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.400
two of them.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.000
But of course this is equal
to minus 7, right?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.980
Log-based.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.510
This number right here
is 10 to the minus 7.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.100
So it equals 7.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.640
So the pH and the pOH of water
is both equal to 7.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.390
Now.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.540
In the next few videos, we're
going to start covering the

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.470
notion of acids and bases.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.280
And it turns out that an acid
is just something that

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.220
increases the hydrogen
concentration.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.010
Well, that's one version
of acids.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.750
We'll talk about other
broader definitions.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.005
But it's called the
arrhenius acid.

00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:10.150
Which we'll talk about
in the next video.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.630
But if something is making the
hydrogen concentration go up,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.530
if we put something in water
that makes it go up, what's

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.180
that going to do the pH?

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.220
Well, if this number right here
goes up, then the log of

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.500
that number is going to go up.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.680
But then the minus log
of that number--

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.330
So let's say for example
10 to the minus 7.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:32.920
That's all good.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.690
But let's say we take it
from 10 to the minus 7.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.180
So 10 to minus 7, that's
kind of neutral

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.750
water, doing nothing.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.590
We have a pH.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.450
The pH is 7.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.380
We just figured out
this calculation.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.510
That's where the hydrogen
concentration is equal to 10

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.520
to minus 7.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.350
Now let's say we were to do
something to the water where

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.710
the hydrogen concentration
were to increase.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.440
So we add hydrogen.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.570
We add concentration
of hydrogen.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.270
So let's say 10 to
the minus 3.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.770
This is obviously a much
higher concentration of

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.349
hydrogen than that.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.440
So the hydrogen concentration
is now 10 to the minus 3.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.200
What's our new pH?

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.369
So the new pH is going to be
equal to the minus log base 10

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.690
of 10 to the minus 3.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.569
That's equal to that
minus there.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.660
10 to the minus 3 power is equal
to 10 to the minus 3.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.775
So it's minus 3.

00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:28.210
So this becomes plus.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:33.100
So now our pH is equal to 3.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.430
So the big take-away from this
is we care about the hydrogen

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.240
concentration.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.980
When something increases the
hydrogen concentration, that

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.630
is considered an acid.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.720
And when you increase the
hydrogen concentration, when

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.420
you put an acid into an aqueous
solution, you are

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.980
lowering the pH.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.890
So the lower the pH, the more
acidic you have, or the higher

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.830
concentration of hydrogen
protons you have. And we'll

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.630
talk in the next video about the
opposite of that, which is

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.260
which is basic things.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.060
And bases increase the
concentration of hydroxide.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.680
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
