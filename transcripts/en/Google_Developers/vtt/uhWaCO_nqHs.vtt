00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:11.363
Welcome to Google
Developers Hackademy.

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:14.396
This is the fourth and last part
of the Android SDK

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:15.924
introduction course

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:19.429
given by Enrique Diaz,
from GDG Androidtitlan Mexico.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.528
If this is your first contact
with the course,

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:24.693
I invite you to watch it
in order and do the exercises.

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:34.066
Hello. Welcome to lesson 4:

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.264
"My first app for Android."

00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:38.396
My name is Enrique Diaz.
Remember

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:40.165
that the previous lesson
we learned

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.066
about building blocks
on Android SDK.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.330
The goal in this lesson
is to use

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.759
the knowledge acquired
throughout the course

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.726
to be able to develop
my first real application.

00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:56.033
In this final example
of my first app

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.264
I won't be doing
any live coding,

00:00:58.264 --> 00:01:01.330
we're just going to go through
which are the important

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.264
code portions
and we'll then execute it.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:10.363
Let's enter the package
mx.androidtitlan.miprimerapp

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.231
and into the class
MainActivity.java.

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:17.627
In this class we have
two variables:

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:19.528
variable "NO"

00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.660
variable "YES."

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:24.660
This will allow us

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.231
to send which fragment
will be shown

00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.891
programmatically.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.627
As we can see here,

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:36.231
the two most important
methods in this activity

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:40.561
are "wasIncredible"
and "wasMeh."

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:45.990
Both are for initializing
an activity

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:51.099
and we will also add
the "putExtra" method

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:55.099
to define if the course
was cool or not.

00:01:55.957 --> 00:01:58.297
So, in wasIncredible

00:01:58.627 --> 00:02:02.099
we are using startActivity,

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.495
the method we previously saw,

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:08.396
but we're now adding
the intent to it

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:10.924
as an anonym variable.

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:15.759
We pass it mainActivity.this,
and then, resultActivity.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.396
Besides, we give it a putExtra

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:21.297
and we pass it
a "Yes" or a "No."

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:27.825
Now, by entering
activity_main.xml,

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:31.231
we can see the is
one TextView

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:33.627
and two buttons:

00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:36.363
the button with the text
"Incredible" in it,

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:38.957
and the button with "Meh."

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:43.033
This first button
that has "button1" as ID,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:46.924
contains an onClick property

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:50.165
which is passing
"wasIncredible,"

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.924
one of the methods
of MainActivity.

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:54.891
And same thing with button2.

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:58.990
In the onCreate method
of ResultActivity

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.033
we can see we're defining
setContentView

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:05.033
with a layout.

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.231
Besides, we're creating
a variable called

00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.627
"WAS_COOL,"

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:14.165
and what it does is call
the getIntent.getIntExtra method

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:18.066
with a key, which is WAS_COOL,
and we pass it a zero

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:20.429
because that's what
we want to define by default.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.396
What we're trying to do here

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:25.132
is saving this control variable

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.363
we're taking from the intent.

00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:31.726
This way we can save it
and do the validation.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.594
Below that, we create
a FragmentManager

00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:40.330
which is this object
that allows us to be in control

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:43.330
of what we add
and what we delete

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.066
within an activity
in relation with the fragments.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.627
Then we create another fragment

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.264
and we say:
"findFragmentById"

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.132
and we pass it a container,

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.924
which is part of the layout.

00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:00.759
Below we're defining
that the fragment be null,

00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:04.825
because that way we can create
a fragment transaction

00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.957
and we do it as follows:

00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:10.693
fm.beginTransaction.

00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:16.594
Now, if the control variable
is "YES",

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:22.561
you create a new
WAS_COOL fragment

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.891
through FragmentTransaction.add

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.363
and you'll pass
two parameters to it:

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:30.924
the container

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.990
and what's the fragment
you're going to create.

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:39.033
Otherwise, if variable
equals "NO,"

00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:43.561
then you use
FragmentTransaction.add,

00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.858
again, you pass
the container to it,

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:50.396
but you will create
WasLameFragment.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:55.495
Finally, you will use
FragmentTransaction

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.396
to "commit" your results.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:03.198
Now we'll see the definition
for WasCoolFragment.

00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:06.033
Within the onCreate method,

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:08.231
all we're doing here,

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:10.297
as in previous exercises,

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:13.231
is return inflater.inflate

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.726
by passing three parameters:

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:17.825
the layout we want to inflate,

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:22.099
which in this case is
R.layout.fragment_success,

00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:26.099
container and then
the false Boolean,

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.264
so it doesn't fix it
as soon as it is "instanced."

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.198
And the definition
for WasLameFragment

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.858
is exactly the same,

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.594
the only difference is
the returning value

00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:41.759
for onCreateView is defining
fragment_lame.

00:05:43.264 --> 00:05:48.330
Now, let's check the contents
of fragment_lame.xml

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.165
and we can see it's
a RelativeLayout

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:53.693
with an image.

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:57.099
If we go
to the graphical interface,

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.066
we can see it's a kitten.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.858
Let's check
fragment_success.xml

00:06:03.858 --> 00:06:07.363
and we can see the code
is exactly the same,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.231
we just define a different image

00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:14.891
for the imageView of this .xml.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.561
Don't forget to define,
in MiPrimerApp Manifest,

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.396
the declaration for activity,

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:26.858
MainActivity
and for ResultActivity,

00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:29.429
just like we see it onscreen.

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:34.495
We'll now launch
the application...

00:06:36.264 --> 00:06:38.165
and let's see what happens.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.561
Our application shows

00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:43.726
a text and two buttons.

00:06:43.726 --> 00:06:46.264
The first one is "Incredible,"

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.891
which answers the question
"How was the course?"

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.231
And the button below,
which is "Meh!"

00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:54.198
"I didn't like it."

00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:56.099
If you tap on "Incredible,"

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.330
what it does is call
the activity Result,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.264
with the fragment inserted
inside with the image

00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:03.990
of "success boy."

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.693
Otherwise,

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:09.033
the same activity will show up
but with the fragment

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:10.891
of the "grumpy cat."

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.858
RECAPITULATION

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.132
In this lesson we implemented
3 very important classes

00:07:18.132 --> 00:07:20.363
within Android SDK framework

00:07:20.363 --> 00:07:22.858
and we developed
a two-button app

00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.330
that reacts
upon user interaction.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.396
We've reached the end
of the lesson and of the course.

00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:31.330
My name is Enrique Diaz.
Keep on programming!
