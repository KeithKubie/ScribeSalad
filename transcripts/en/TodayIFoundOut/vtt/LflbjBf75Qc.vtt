Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.670
In the video today, we're looking at what
makes pop rocks pop.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.420
Much like other hard sugar candies, Pop Rocks
are made primarily of sugar, corn syrup, water,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.070
and artificial flavoring.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.630
What causes the candy to pop when it comes
in contact with the moisture and heat in your

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.910
mouth is not due to any ingredient.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.830
Rather, it is due to the way the candy is
made.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.199
In a nutshell, the ingredients are first combined,
stirred and heated up, bringing the mixture

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.199
to boil.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.540
They continue to boil it until the moisture
level descends suitably so that a thick syrupy

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.650
substance remains.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.290
In normal hard sugar candies, this substance
is then put in molds and allowed to cool and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.290
harden.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.610
However, with pop rocks, they expose the hot
mix to carbon dioxide at about 600 pounds

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.510
per square inch . This causes very small bubbles
of carbon dioxide to form within the mixture.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.440
The substance is then cooled and subsequently
hardens.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.100
Once the hard candy is formed, the pressure
is released.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.030
This causes the candy to shatter, leaving
small nuggets of hard candy, which are the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.030
Pop Rocks.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.760
Many of these nuggets still contain pockets
of carbon dioxide kept at relatively high

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760
pressure.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
When the candy hits the saliva in your mouth,
it quickly dissolves the thin barriers containing

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890
the pressurized carbon dioxide, resulting
in the bubbles bursting, often with sufficient

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.330
force to cause the candy to jump in your mouth.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.330
BONUS FACT

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.860
Pop Rocks were invented by Chemist William
A. Mitchell, who worked for General Foods.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.580
He also invented Tang, Cool Whip, quick-setting
Jell-O, a tapioca substitute, and powdered

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.780
egg whites, among other things.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.950
In total, he received over 70 patents in his
lifetime.

Also, coming up Simon and I are thinking of
doing a bit of a Q&amp;A video, so if you have

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.310
any questions for us, please leave them in
