00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
This episode is supported by Skillshare.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.980
Do you ever wonder how you stack up to others?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.240
For example, in North America, if you are a male

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.340
who is taller than 5'9 or women taller than 5'3

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.380
then you're above average.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.260
And if you weigh less than 88.3 kg and 74.7 kg

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.440
then you're below average.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.160
Worldwide, however, humans actually weigh 62 kg on average.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280
If you read less than 12 books a year,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.800
you're below average.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.720
But avid readers like likely inflate this number

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.680
with 4 books per year being the most common number reported.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880
And if you can read faster than 300 words per minute,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.120
you're above average.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.940
Type more than 40 words per minute

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540
and you're also faster than the majority.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.675
If you finish a bachelor's degree or higher,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.080
you're above average.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.340
But if you don't finish high school

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.880
and you're from industrialized nation,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.900
you're far below average with only about 10% not finishing.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.000
If you're a man who can benchpress more than 135 lbs,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220
you're stronger than many.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.960
And if you're a woman who can run a mile

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.600
in less than 7 to 10 minutes,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.980
you're faster than the others.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.880
If that tires you out and you sleep more than 6.8 hrs,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.580
you're getting more than majority.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.060
And if to wake up you're drinking less than 3 cups of coffee per day,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.380
you're below average.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.900
Still thirsty? Most people drink 3 to 4 cups of water a day.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.220
Too much fluid make you pee?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.660
If you're urinating less than 6 times a day, you're below average.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.240
And if you have more than one bowel movement today,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.765
you're probably above average based on surveys.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.140
But these are not necessarily reasons for concern.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.960
The average person farts around 14 times a day

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.860
which is around 500 to 1500 ml

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.815
Have a family?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.320
If you end up having more than two kids in your lifetime in most Europe and North America,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.540
you're above average.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
But if you have less than 6 children in Niger,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.740
you're below average.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.260
And if you're watching more than 5 hours and 4 mins of TV each day,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.560
that's more than most.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.040
That's the same amount of time the average spends on their mobile service.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.780
But if you're a teen and spending less than 9 hours on media,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.855
you're actually under the average.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.980
The average person also simply touches their phone over 2000 times a day.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.680
Think you're smarter than the average person or better at driving?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.440
How about having better health, memory or being a better friend than the average person.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
Turns out the vast majority of people also think they're better than average

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.020
in a phenomenon called Illusory Superiority.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.260
It's a cognitive bias where people overestimate their own abilities and qualities

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.455
with one study revealing

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:19.555
87% of students at a university surveyed

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.180
rated their academic performance above the median.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.660
Interestingly, people with lower IQs tend to overestimate their IQ,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.200
while who actually have above-average IQs tend to underestimate them.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.060
Men are also more likely to overestimate their IQ by 5 points,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.800
while women underestimate theirs.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.520
Perhaps most shocking is that in cognitive test,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.180
even the lowest scoring groups predict they're above average

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.000
showing a strong illusion.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.940
And researchers believe it because those worst at the test

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.440
are also worse at understanding the skills required to do it well.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.120
This paper actually won a Nobel Prize in 2000.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.995
In the words of Charles Bukowski,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.320
"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence".

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.200
