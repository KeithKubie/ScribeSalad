00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 in this capsule we will see the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 different types of inference that we're going 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.160
 want to do with Bezier networks 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.200
 dynamic 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 we saw an example of visual networks 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 previously dynamic for the code of a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 security guard who wants a ferrer 6 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.510
 2 most not from observations 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.189
 of his director who arrives or not with 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 an umbrella 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 in fact it is this structure of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 absorb a dynamic we will not see it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.150
 badly often to better explore with 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 more details I would point out that 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.450
 when we look at the dependencies that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 are modeled also it's still 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.530
 still seems reasonable despite 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 several assumptions of independence 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.050
 we did, for example 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.879
 actually seeing that the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 did the director bring his 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.440
 umbrella or not go basically 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.410
 depends on if from there more for the day 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.140
 even the fact that it rain before that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.570
 not change much about the fact that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 I want to bring my umbrella 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.149
 really 6th clowns have today 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 I see my umbrella 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.460
 so the fact that only one arrow of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.880
 reality towards a goal missed it a lot of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.119
 meaning 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.250
 and then now that the weather in a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.900
 day you're mostly dependent on the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.549
 day the method the day before 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.869
 again from a point of view that at 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.520
 halls it does not make sense 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.950
 we might have wanted to add 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.450
 other dependencies so have a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 chain 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 marco come second-rate honored 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.840
 departure of the ski as witness of 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.070
 also to try to detect 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 maybe trends a little bit 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 even more complex there it is a rather 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.610
 good approximation say that the weather 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.810
 a day of departures actually only 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.909
 of the weather the previous day 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.470
 so now we will see bath with 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.720
 a Bezier network that feels March to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.640
 what kind of questions what kind of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 populist reasoning one could be 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.280
 able to do to try 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 to finally infer the certain 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.240
 some distributions in relation to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 may hidden variables 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 extensis then first type of inference 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.619
 which will be often done is what we 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.399
 call filtering in English filtering 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.530
 the goal is to calculate what we 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.050
 call tops belief in English 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.260
 believe stay the state belief is right 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.049
 the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.000
 posterior distribution of the variable 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.439
 hide the most recent 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.769
 that is, magic not that we have 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:26.579
 observed my observation variable for 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.230
 the state one up to the moment t but 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.780
 now I will be interested in what 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 is the posterior disruption of the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 hidden variables x at the same time you are 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 so he has the time of the moment of the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.799
 last observation I made 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.269
 we will also know what is it 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.250
 now our belief about 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.040
 the hidden state in the code of our 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.230
 problem of the caretaker who wants to know 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.260
 if the rain or not, it corresponds to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.810
 know what is the probability that he 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.819
 there was rain today being 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.040
 given that I observed my director has 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.639
 led his umbrella or not from the first 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.319
 day till today in a 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.959
 application maybe a little bit more 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.519
 interesting in the case of the robot that gets 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.659
 moves into a building that wants to know 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.299
 where are they in a 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.349
 card when would that be to know that 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.549
 know members to know what is it 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:22.470
 his belief about on the position of the 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.750
 rebound currently in the map being 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.900
 given all the information that has 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.329
 cumulated with his censors since since 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.859
 that they are in the in the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.359
 building have been producing that 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.419
 could want to do to different people 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.590
 would be to make the prediction so in 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.690
 this case we would like to know what is 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.199
 the posterior distribution of a state 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.900
 future of which farther than the time tai 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.959
 chi and the last time where last 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.040
 moments when we had observations 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.290
 in this case we should know 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.260
 what the distribution of material 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.209
 aratory x more like or case is going to be 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.040
 greatest arrival we have not be 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.659
 positive and give back all the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.190
 observations I accumulated time 1 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.940
 until you try it for example 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.859
 I am interested in knowing how to make a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.349
 prediction of the probability that they 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.060
 have rain in that jo 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.299
 would essentially correspond to 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.449
 do the calculation of this distribution 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.449
 conditional there 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.890
 the difference would be what is called the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.450
 smoothing of anglès movin one associates one 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.510
 would like to know the distribution still 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.450
 once a posteriori but on a state 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.270
 hide it's so in the 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.870
 observations of time one up to 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.140
 the moment t 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.020
 I could ask myself what is the 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.340
 distribution of trouble to hide at a 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.800
 kawka moment and actually enters i got 0.6 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.580
 but I would like to put 1 between 1 and 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.650
 so was not today but a stock 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.320
 and instant structures strictly tools 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.400
 that you are who can be so 1 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.840
 until finally witness so by 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.190
 example in the case of the guardian of 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.720
 security could be wondering what is it 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.880
 the probability that they had the 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.640
 rain there is because if that would be 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.100
 why is equal to witness a witness no 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.260
 it corresponds and yesterday compared to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:23.120
 today what moment t and finally 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.370
 maybe the different type what is 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.430
 the most used in practice is that 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.860
 the most plausible explanation 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.140
 in this case we want a ferrer the 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.480
 sequence of states hide so pu 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.090
 only one is more interested 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.220
 only one and hid one single moment 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.750
 but really the sequence of all 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.270
 ages the kachin states that will explain 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.370
 the best possible observations 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.560
 accumulates is so mathematically that 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.900
 means that we search among all 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.960
 the possible values ​​of the variables 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.480
 hidden extracts up excited we get 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.520
 retrieve their values ​​which has the 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.010
 highest policy given the 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.430
 observations I've accumulated from the moment 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.720
 1 until the moment t so the rest of 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.910
 the equation is simply 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.280
 the observation that I can take my 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.930
 conditional here I can rewrite it 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.490
 like joining her on aix and on / 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.249
 the marginal only on 1 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.809
 so that's 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.269
 definition of the conditional one 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:29.169
 know well and now because 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:31.029
 finish here does not depend on x and that 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.559
 I want to make a maximization at 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.469
 paris xe so not what this term there 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:38.529
 constant with respect to x actually 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:40.449
 find the maximum the value of the 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.089
 sequence x that maximizes that term 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.489
 it's the same thing that found me the 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.649
 theme that maximizes only the 

00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:49.839
 numerator so the join on x is this 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.489
 so mathematically often it's this 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.809
 problem there in africa we will try to 

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:56.110
 solve because he's a little bit 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:07:00.369
 simpler and so a little more 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.139
 concretely concrete in the code of 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:04.239
 guardian who are trying to infer the 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.339
 weather so in this case too it would be 

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:08.439
 to infer the weather over the entire sequence 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:12.249
 so for every day every 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.539
 last days since they 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:15.519
 accumulate the observation of his 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:18.429
 director who arrives or not with a 

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:21.459
 umbrella and in a more context 

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:24.069
 practice in machine translation if we 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.860
 gave us a sentence in French of 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.519
 data but that would be my observation 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.979
 them 

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:32.579
 I will try to infer what is it 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:36.279
 English translation that would be so 

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:40.079
 assigning an upstream value and 

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:42.309
 at the cash and 2 x 1 until then existed 

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.619
 found this production with the local 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:46.719
 benefited the highest a posteriori 

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:48.219
 given my sentence in French 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:50.889
 do automatic translation 

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:52.119
 finally be found one can the oven 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.429
 put in the form of a ference 

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.899
 most plausible explanation and in 

00:07:54.429 --> 00:07:57.909
 voice recognition we can do the 

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.799
 same thing, that is, we can 

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:02.469
 formulate the problem of finding the 

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:04.929
 sentence that were pronounced being 

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:07.089
 given a sound signal as being alone 

00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:09.099
 the problem of finding the phrase that the 

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:12.389
 more likely given the signal 

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:12.389
 sound that was captured
