00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:09.402
The story goes something like this:

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:15.562
a royal, rich or righteous individual,
who otherwise happens to be a lot like us,

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:20.418
makes a mistake that sends his life,
and the lives of those around him,

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:22.819
spiraling into ruin.

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.278
Sound familiar?

00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:27.677
This is the classic story pattern
for Greek tragedy.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.316
For thousands of years,

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:32.240
we've spun spellbinding tales
that fit this pattern,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.019
and modern storytellers around the world
continue to do so.

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.072
Three critical story components
influenced by Aristotle's "Poetics"

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:44.055
help us understand the allure.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:48.617
First, the tragic hero should be elevated
in rank and ability,

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:50.705
but also relatable.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.285
Perhaps he is a king, or extraordinary
in some other way.

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.815
But because you and I
are neither unusually good

00:00:56.815 --> 00:00:58.756
nor unusually bad,

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:00.719
neither is the hero.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.996
And he has one particular tragic flaw,
or hamartia,

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:09.814
something like ambition, tyranny,
stubbornness, or excess pride

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:13.343
that causes him 
to make a critical mistake.

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:17.717
And from that mistake comes 
disaster and downfall.

00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:20.000
As an example of these elements in action,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.803
let's look to Sophocles's "Oedipus Rex,"

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:25.194
about a man who doesn't know
he was adopted,

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:29.511
and is warned by an oracle
that he's destined to murder his father

00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.783
and marry his mother.

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:33.715
In trying to escape this fate,

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:37.155
he kills a man who won't get out 
of his way at a crossroad.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:40.905
He then cleverly answers the riddle
of the monstrous Sphynx,

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.320
freeing the Kingdom of Thebes
from a plague.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.841
He marries the widowed queen
and becomes king.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.317
But after he finds out that the murdered
man was his father,

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:54.042
and the queen he married is his mother,

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:59.149
Oedipus gouges out his eyes
and retreats into the wilderness.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.081
At the beginning of his story,

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.154
Oedipus is elevated in ability,
and he's elevated in rank.

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:08.528
He's neither unusually evil
nor saintly.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.968
He's relatable.

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:11.794
Notice the height of the fall.

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:15.241
Once a king, but now homeless and blind.

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.188
It's more tragic, after all, if a king
falls from a tall throne

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.152
than if a jester falls off his step stool.

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:26.251
Oedipus's tragic flaw is hubris,
or excessive pride,

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:30.822
and it causes him to attempt to avoid
the fate prophesied for him,

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.704
which is exactly what makes it happen.

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:36.113
He's a particularly unlucky soul

00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:39.462
because his mistake of killing his father
and marrying his mother

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:43.938
is done in complete ignorance.

00:02:43.938 --> 00:02:48.326
Of course, these narrative principles
transcend classic Greek tragedy.

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:50.120
In Shakespeare's canon,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.813
we see Hamlet's indecisiveness
lead to a series of bad decisions,

00:02:54.813 --> 00:02:56.642
or perhaps non-decisions,

00:02:56.642 --> 00:03:00.854
that culminate in the death of almost
every character in the play,

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:04.025
and Macbeth's ambition 
catapults him to the top

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:07.045
before sending him careening to his grave.

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:10.904
Even modern pop culture staples
like "Game of Thrones" and "The Dark Knight"

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:16.749
resonate with the tropes Aristotle
identified over 2000 years ago.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.626
So what's the point 
of all of this suffering?

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:22.492
According to Aristotle,
and many scholars since,

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:26.917
a good tragedy can evoke fear
and pity in the audience:

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:30.446
Fear of falling victim to the same
or similar catastrophe,

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:34.307
and pity for the height 
of the hero's downfall.

00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:37.449
Ideally, after watching 
these tragic events unfold,

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.534
we experience catharsis,

00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:43.329
a feeling of relief 
and emotional purification.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.671
Not everyone agrees why this happens.

00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.814
It may be that empathizing with the hero

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:53.606
allows us to experience and release
strong emotions that we keep bottled up,

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:57.523
or maybe it just lets us forget
about our own problems for a little while.

00:03:57.523 --> 00:04:01.054
But regardless of how you feel
when you watch poor Oedipus,

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:03.528
never has there been 
a more salient reminder

00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:05.740
that no matter how bad things get,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.985
at least you didn't kill your father
and marry your mother.
