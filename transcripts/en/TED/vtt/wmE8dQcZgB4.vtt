00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:17.041
For as long as I remember,
I've loved mathematics.

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.311
Actually, it's not 100 percent true.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.263
I've loved mathematics for all
but a two-week period

00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:25.445
in senior high school.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:26.783
(Laughter)

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:27.981
I was top of my class,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.787
and we were about to start
the Extension Maths course.

00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:34.073
I was really excited
about this brand new topic coming up,

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:35.247
complex numbers.

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:37.214
I like complex.

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:40.120
My teacher was priming us for the concepts

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.217
with some questions about square roots.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.074
Square of nine -- three;

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:46.114
square of 256 -- sixteen.

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:48.002
Too easy.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.448
Then she asked the trick question:

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:53.092
What about the square root
of negative one?

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.452
Of course, we were all over it --

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:56.627
"Come on, Miss!

00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:59.380
We all know you can't take
the square root of a negative."

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.856
"That's true in the real world," she said.

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:04.077
"But in the complex world,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.333
the square root of negative one
is the imaginary number i."

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:12.633
(Laughter)

00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:13.836
That day,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.863
my entire mathematical world
came crashing down on me.

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:18.235
(Laughter)

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.632
"Imaginary numbers?

00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:21.124
Seriously?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.475
But mathematics is a source of truth,

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.276
please don't go abstract on me.

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.679
I would have studied art

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:29.974
if I wanted to play
with imaginary numbers."

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:31.641
(Laughter)

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.494
"This is Extension Maths,
let's get back with our program!"

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:36.156
She didn't,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.958
and over the next couple of weeks,

00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:41.229
I reluctantly performed
meaningless calculations,

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:42.254
(Laughter)

00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:45.221
finding imaginary solutions
to quadratic equations.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:46.857
(Laughter)

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:48.897
But then something amazing happened.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:51.732
We began finding elegant solutions

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:55.661
to real-world problems
we previously had no answers to,

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.799
starting with the complex world
of imaginary numbers.

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:02.514
So some mathematician 500 years ago

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:06.641
decides to have some fun
and make up these imaginary numbers,

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:11.649
and because of that we can now
derive these amazing identities

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.457
with applications in the real world,

00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.703
in fields like electrical engineering.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.593
Wow!

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:21.258
I gained a whole new level
of appreciation for mathematics.

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:24.088
And after my brief mistrust,

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:27.512
I was now in love
with the subject more than ever.

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:32.959
Francis Su, the mathematician,
sums it up beautifully when he says,

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:37.053
"We study mathematics
for play, for beauty,

00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:38.339
for truth,

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:40.530
for justice and for love."

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:43.355
But if you ask a student today,

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.323
you'll probably hear a different story.

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.748
You might hear "difficult" and "boring."

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.780
And they might be right about difficult.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.367
But it's certainly not boring.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.560
In fact, I'd say being difficult to master

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:58.641
is part of what makes it beautiful.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.358
Because nothing worth doing is easy.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.196
So we need students to stick around
long enough through the difficult parts

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.071
to appreciate the beauty
when it all ties together.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.640
Much like I did for that brief
couple of weeks in high school.

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.293
Unfortunately, our school systems --

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.418
we move students through mathematics
in a lockstep process.

00:03:21.442 --> 00:03:23.085
So those who fall a little behind

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.772
find it near impossible to ever catch up
and appreciate that beauty.

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:29.363
But why is this a problem?

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:30.632
Why should we care?

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:32.855
Well today, more than ever,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.450
our world needs every citizen
to be skilled in mathematics.

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.514
With the advent of artificial
intelligence and automation,

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.515
many of the jobs we see today
will either not exist

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.910
or be transformed
to require less routine work

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:49.793
and more analysis
and application of expertise.

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:52.998
But we're not producing
the extra mathematics students

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:54.276
to fill these new roles.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.291
This graph shows the number of students

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:58.926
taking Standard Mathematics

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.204
and Advanced Mathematics

00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:03.815
over a period of 20 years in Australia.

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:09.252
It's clear that while we have demand
for mathematics skills rapidly increasing,

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:12.065
supply is in steady decline.

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.410
To put things in perspective,

00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:20.498
half of the students
completing high school today in Australia

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:23.196
are not prepared
to understand any argument

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.220
about rates of change in data.

00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:28.053
In this digital age

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:31.990
where fake news can influence
election results,

00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:34.482
this is very concerning.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.149
Let me give you a concrete example.

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:39.172
Let's take a closer look at that graph.

00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:42.712
Can everyone see what I've done there
to stress my point?

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:45.847
If you can't, let me show you now,

00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.751
with the vertical axis
starting at zero, where it should be.

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:50.926
There, you see it now, right?

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.838
It's the exact same data

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:56.523
but I've manipulated the representation
to influence you.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.149
And that's cool, that's my job up here.

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.174
(Laughter)

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:01.714
But in all seriousness,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:03.048
unless we do something

00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:06.696
to drastically improve
student engagement with mathematics,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.989
we'll not only have
a huge skills shortage crisis

00:05:10.013 --> 00:05:12.292
but a fickle population,

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:15.894
easily manipulated
by whoever can get the most air time.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.076
So what's the solution?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.860
There are a lot of things we have to do.

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:23.844
We need curriculum reform.

00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:27.448
We need our best and brightest
encouraged to become teachers.

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:30.315
We need to put an end to high-stakes tests

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.126
and instead follow a mastery-based
learning approach.

00:05:33.617 --> 00:05:36.230
But all these things take time.

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:39.140
And I'm impatient.

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:43.077
See, I've been thinking about this
for eight years now.

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:46.355
Ever since I left my job
as a derivative trader

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.825
to build a web application
to help students learn mathematics.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:54.052
Today, our app is used
by schools across the globe.

00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:55.998
And we're seeing big improvements

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.228
for students who use
the program regularly.

00:05:59.014 --> 00:06:00.649
But here's the thing --

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:05.418
we're only seeing it for students
who use the program regularly.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:08.216
And most of them don't.

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:13.180
So after years of developing
and refining the application,

00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:16.299
our biggest challenge
was not so much product related,

00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:18.959
our biggest challenge
was motivating students

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:22.640
to want to work
on their gaps in understanding.

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.870
You can imagine
in today's attention economy,

00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:29.053
we're competing against Facebook,
Snapchat and PlayStation

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:31.081
to try and get these students' time.

00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:33.704
So we went back to the drawing board

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:36.521
and started to think about
how we could make it worthwhile

00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:40.045
for students to spend
some of their "attention budget"

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.336
on their education.

00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:44.395
We tinkered with gamification elements

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.267
like points, badges and avatars,

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:50.133
and we'd see a temporary
spike in engagement

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:53.374
but things would go back to normal
as soon as the novelty wore off.

00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:56.387
Then one day, my cofounder, Alvin,

00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:59.029
came across a study of students in Chicago

00:06:59.053 --> 00:07:01.831
led by the behavioral
economist, Steven Levitt,

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:04.831
where they paid students
who improved on their test scores.

00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:09.569
He started telling me
about some of the things they tested for

00:07:09.593 --> 00:07:11.407
and the interesting findings they had.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.323
For instance, they found
that incentivizing students for inputs,

00:07:17.347 --> 00:07:18.625
like effort,

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:22.022
worked a lot better
than incentivizing for outputs,

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:23.196
like test scores.

00:07:24.188 --> 00:07:27.720
They found that for younger students,
you could win them over with a trophy

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:29.276
but for older students,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.879
you really needed cash.

00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:32.252
(Laughter)

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.990
And the amount of cash mattered --
10 dollars was good,

00:07:35.014 --> 00:07:36.747
20 dollars -- even better.

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:40.109
But perhaps most importantly,

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.688
they found that the rewards
had to be instant

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.743
rather than promised at a later date.

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:48.379
They went as far as to give
the students 20 dollars and say,

00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:50.410
"Touch it, feel it, smell it --"

00:07:50.434 --> 00:07:51.680
(Sniffing)

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:52.854
"It's all yours.

00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:55.664
But if you fail,
I'm going to take it back."

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.555
And that worked really well.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.603
I immediately got excited

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:03.862
about the possibilities
of implementing this in our program.

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:05.879
But once the excitement settled down,

00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:08.633
there were a few concerns
that crept in our minds.

00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:10.045
Firstly,

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:11.299
was this ethical?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:12.757
(Laughter)

00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.561
Secondly, how would we fund this thing?

00:08:15.585 --> 00:08:16.736
(Laughter)

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.934
And finally,

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.180
would the results be sustained
if the students were no longer paid?

00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:23.950
Now, let's look at the ethical part first.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:25.840
I'm a bit of a mathematical purist.

00:08:25.864 --> 00:08:29.600
So I'd be one of the first people to say
that we should study mathematics

00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:31.491
for the sake of mathematics.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:36.057
Remember -- for play, for beauty,
for truth, for justice and for love!

00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:37.940
Not for money!

00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:39.178
(Laughter)

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.307
As I struggled with this,
I came to see that,

00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:43.401
while it's a way I look
at mathematics now,

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:46.322
it's only because I studied it
long enough to appreciate it.

00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:50.649
It's very difficult to tell a student
struggling with mathematics today

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:53.719
to work hard for a payoff
in the distant future.

00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:56.677
And it's not so much bribery
that's at work here,

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.242
because I could bribe students

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:02.403
by telling them about my big bonuses
in my derivative trading days

00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:04.291
as a reward for doing well at maths.

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.259
But it doesn't pay off
for a very long time.

00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:09.224
So it's practically naught.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.148
Behavioral economists
call this hyperbolic discounting.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.863
And Levitt goes as far as to say

00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:18.958
that all motivating power vanishes

00:09:18.982 --> 00:09:21.156
when rewards are handed out with a delay.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.490
So, from a purely economic point of view:

00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:29.942
if we don't use immediate incentives,

00:09:29.966 --> 00:09:32.480
we are underinvesting in student outcomes.

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:36.315
I took heart from that,
and came to see that as a society,

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:38.879
we're actually quite used
to financial incentives.

00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:42.069
Whether it be by the government,
by employers or at home.

00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:45.365
For instance, many parents
would pay their children

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:48.190
an allowance or pocket money
for doing chores in the house.

00:09:48.557 --> 00:09:51.041
So it wasn't really
all that controversial.

00:09:51.954 --> 00:09:53.129
As I thought about that,

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:56.875
it started to answer that second question
of how we were going to fund this.

00:09:56.899 --> 00:10:00.394
Naturally, parents are the most invested
in their children's education.

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:04.601
So, let's charge them
a weekly subscription fee

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.323
to use our program,

00:10:06.347 --> 00:10:07.641
but --

00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:10.641
if the students complete
their weekly maths goal,

00:10:10.665 --> 00:10:15.542
we'll refund the subscription amount
directly into the child's bank account.

00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:19.688
We chose three exercises completed

00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:21.459
over a one week period

00:10:21.483 --> 00:10:23.016
for a 10 dollar reward.

00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:27.680
That way we're incentivizing effort
rather than performance

00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:29.490
over a short enough period

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:32.614
and with a substantial enough payout
for the students to care.

00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:37.290
Now, I remember when I first told
my wife about this new business model.

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:42.712
If she had any doubt left
that I've gone completely mad,

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:45.269
that pretty much confirmed it for her.

00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:47.212
She said to me, "Mo ...

00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:51.006
you realize that if everybody
does their homework, which you want,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.029
you're not going to make any revenue,
which you don't want.

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.513
Great business model."

00:10:55.537 --> 00:10:56.742
(Laughter)

00:10:56.766 --> 00:10:59.146
I say it's more like
an antibusiness model,

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.949
it's free if you use it,
but you pay if you don't.

00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:04.704
Now, I knew from experience

00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:07.260
that not everybody in the country
was going to jump on

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:09.164
and do their maths homework every week.

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:11.760
And if they did,
sure we'd go bust pretty quickly,

00:11:11.784 --> 00:11:15.496
but hey, we would have solved
the country's maths skills crisis.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.791
(Laughter)

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:20.299
As a company, we've always run
a double bottom line,

00:11:20.323 --> 00:11:22.363
looking to both make
a return for investors

00:11:22.387 --> 00:11:24.791
as well as improve student outcomes.

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:27.474
We know that our path
to long-term profitability

00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:29.641
is through improving student outcomes.

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.214
So our dual objectives
should never be at odds.

00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.352
So we're always looking

00:11:38.376 --> 00:11:39.788
to make our product decisions

00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:42.672
around helping students reach
their weekly maths goal,

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:45.529
effectively ensuring that they get paid

00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:46.703
and not us.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.575
Now you must be wondering:
How is this crazy business model going?

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:54.426
You'll be glad to know
we're still in business.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.029
We've been testing this now
for the last five months

00:11:57.053 --> 00:11:59.426
on just our personal
home users in Australia

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.117
before we think about
rolling it out to schools.

00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.942
And here are the early results.

00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:08.410
The green represents students
who are completing their weekly maths goal

00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:09.863
and the red those who aren't.

00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.497
You can see a lot more
completing their homework than not.

00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:15.934
In fact, as our user base has grown,

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.585
we found the percentage
to be pretty steady, at around 75 percent.

00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:23.069
So on average, we receive
our weekly subscription fee

00:12:23.093 --> 00:12:25.291
once every four weeks,

00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:28.323
and the other three weeks,
we're rewarding the students.

00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:32.070
Now of course we're leaving
some money on the table here,

00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:33.245
but guess what?

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:35.196
It turns out these students

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.484
are 70 percent more engaged
than students not on the reward program.

00:12:41.109 --> 00:12:42.259
Check.

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:46.236
From a business perspective,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.172
they are less likely to churn

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:50.180
and more likely to refer friends,

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:53.839
so we're hoping to trade off
a lower revenue per user

00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:56.530
for a bigger and more engaged user base.

00:12:56.895 --> 00:12:58.307
Check and check.

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:01.286
Now for that final question.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.159
Would they keep coming back
if they were no longer paid?

00:13:04.754 --> 00:13:08.277
Mathematics is so much more
than just a subject you study at school.

00:13:08.897 --> 00:13:10.364
It's a human endeavor.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.767
It's what helps us to understand
the world around us.

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:17.045
And the more you know,
the more you want to know.

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:20.657
So yes, we've triggered initial engagement

00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:22.054
with a financial reward.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.085
But in the long run,

00:13:24.109 --> 00:13:26.010
the money won't matter anymore.

00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:27.685
Because in the long run,

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:30.820
the wonder of mathematics
will be the incentive

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:32.463
and understanding it

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:33.753
will be the reward.

00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:35.517
Thank you.

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:40.333
(Applause)
