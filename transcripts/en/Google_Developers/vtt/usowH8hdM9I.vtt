TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello
I'm, Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.043
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:06.000
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.840
We recently announced the second
annual Google Play Indie Games

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.350
Contest in Europe, expanding
to more countries and bigger

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.430
prizes.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.100
The contest rewards your
passion, creativity,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.650
and innovation and
provides support

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.500
to help bring your
game to more people.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.780
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.670
below for more details on
prizes and how to enter.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.020
In the category of "Too
Cool Not To Mention"

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.400
is our recent open source
release for quantum computers.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.310
OpenFermion is the first
open source platform

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.530
for translating problems
in chemistry and materials

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.110
science into quantum
circuits that can be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.810
executed on existing platforms.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.780
A lot more detail can
be found on the post.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
To help further research into
human action recognition,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.560
we've released a new data set
that provides multiple action

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.100
labels for each person in
extended video sequences.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.340
The data set consists of URLs
for publicly available videos

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.180
from YouTube, annotated with
a set of 80 atomic actions,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.670
such as walk or shake hands.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.480
And these are
spatial-temporally localized,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.740
resulting in over 57,000
video segments, 96,000 labeled

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.410
humans performing actions, and a
total of 210,000 action labels.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.250
Examples, charts, and a
link to download the data

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.180
are on the post.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.460
Keeping sensitive and
regulated data private

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.000
can be a challenge.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600
The Data Loss Prevention
API can help you quickly

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.870
find and protect over 50
types of sensitive data,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.430
such as credit card numbers,
names, and national ID numbers.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.340
And there are several new
ways to protect sensitive data

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.900
with the DLP API including
redaction, masking,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.490
and tokenization.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.920
Check out the post
for all the details.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.650
The Google Cloud Platform
Cloud Launcher Marketplace

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.420
provides production-grade
solutions

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.720
that you can launch and
manage in just a few clicks.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.260
Click to deploy solutions
further lower operational costs

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.110
with open source products
that are maintained by Google.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680
We recently launched
21 new VM solutions

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.030
for some of the most popular
open source products,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.860
including node.js the
Ruby Stack and MySQL.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.290
Get started with the post.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.880
With the launch
of the iPhone 10,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.640
you need to plan for new
design considerations

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.240
as the rounded corners,
notch, and screen indicator

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.210
on the extended screen can
obscure content and lead

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.000
to poor ad experiences
for users when

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.100
ads are placed in these areas.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.170
Which is why we've
put together a guide

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.620
to help you adapt your ad
strategy for iPhone 10, which

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.010
you can get by visiting the
post linked in the description

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.140
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.740
Thanks for watching this week's
episode of the Developer Show.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.823
If you'd like to catch
some of our prior episodes,

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:55.295
they're right over here--

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:56.670
on the right side
of your screen.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.570
There.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.020
