00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.620
I want to do one more video
on total revenue and price

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.770
elasticity of demand.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.970
Just to make sure that you, the
relationship between the two

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.550
is an intuitive one.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.100
So let's draw an
arbitrary demand curve.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.970
So this is my price axis.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.550
That is my quantity
demanded axis.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.900
Quantity axis.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320
And let me just draw an
arbitrary demand curve

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.650
right over here.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.290
So let's say that
is my demand curve.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.930
And let's pick some
price and quantities

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.986
on this demand curve.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.610
So let's say that
the price is up here.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.310
Let's call that P1.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.960
And then, the quantity demanded.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.530
Let's call that Q1.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.440
And we already know
that the total revenue

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.860
is the area of this
rectangle right over here.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.160
This is the total revenue.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.800
It's just the price
times the quantity.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.980
If I'm selling 2 burgers an
hour and for $9 a burger,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.870
I'm going to make $18 per hour.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.500
That's going to be this
area right over here.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.280
Now, let's assume in
this part of the curve

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.360
that the price elasticity
of demand is greater than 1.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.765
So we are elastic.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:14.640
So let me write this.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.840
So the price, the elasticity
of demand-- actually,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.970
I should say the absolute value
of the elasticity of demand.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.870
It will be actually
be a negative number.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.480
But the absolute value of
the elasticity of demand

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:37.610
is greater than 1 which means
for a 1% drop in price you have

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:49.060
more, you have a greater
than 1% increase in quantity.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.330
And that comes straight
out of the expression

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.580
or our formula for
what elasticity is.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.100
Remember, elasticity
is our percent change

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.360
in quantity over
percent change in price.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.820
So if this, if the
absolute value of this

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.370
is greater than 1-- these
move in opposite directions.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.703
That's why it would be negative.

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:13.400
But if we say the absolute
value of this is greater than 1,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.610
that means that this
quantity is going

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.600
to be larger than this quantity.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.120
So if we have a
1% drop in price,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.180
the change in our quantity is
going to be greater than 1%.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.170
And so for point right over
here, if we lower this by 1%,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.520
we're going to increase
this by more than 1%.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.120
So any drop in our any
reduction in our height

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.739
will be more than made up for.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.030
And this is generally the case.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.990
Will be more than made up for
by an increase in our width.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.120
So total revenue will increase.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.720
So when price drops, so 1% drop
in price and a larger than 1%

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.380
increase in quantity means
that total revenue will go up.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.280
Now, if we go down here.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.160
If we go down to this
part of the curve.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.340
And let's say that this-- let's
call this-- let's call that P2.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.460
And let's call that quantity 2.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.790
And then, this area right over
here would be total revenue 2.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.020
Let's call that total
revenue 1 over there.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.097
Price times the quantity.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:21.430
Now, what's happening over here?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.240
We're going to assume that our
price elasticity of demand,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.960
the absolute value of it
over here, is less than 1.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.080
So the absolute value of our
price elasticity of demand

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.900
is less than 1 at this
point in the curve.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.990
And all that is a
fancy way of saying

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:46.605
that for a 1% drop in price,
we get less than a 1% drop.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.020
Sorry, less than a 1% increase.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.900
They move in
opposite directions.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.980
1% increase in quantity.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.310
So we're lowering the height.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.220
If we have a 1% drop,
we're lowering that by 1%.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.890
But we're not getting a
1% increase in our width.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.560
So the width isn't going
to be increasing that much.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.910
So in general, this
is going to result

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.170
in a lowering of this area.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.550
This area will get smaller.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.910
We're reducing our
height more than we

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.590
are expanding our width.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.790
So in this situation, total
revenue would go down.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.690
And remember, this is
an elastic situation.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.800
So when it is elastic, total
revenue tends to go up.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.450
And when it is
inelastic-- I want to say,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.490
when it's elastic
a drop in price

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.860
tends to make total
revenue go up.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.020
And when it is inelastic,
a drop in price

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.720
tends to make total
revenue go down.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.700
And then, you can imagine,
right when you're it

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.750
unit elasticity,
someplace around there,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.200
a 1% a drop in price
will result in exactly 1%

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.410
increase in quantity demanded.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.000
And so they will trade off.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.710
You won't get a noticeable
change in your revenue.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.525
And the reason why I say that
is that actually some, many econ

00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:23.150
textbooks will tell you that you
don't get a change in revenue.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.817
But if you actually will do a
detailed look at that math--

00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:26.900
let me write it over here.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.450
So the absolute value
of the price elasticity

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.760
of demand at that point is 1.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.580
Which tells us that
a 1% drop in price

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.910
will, or goes along with
a 1% increase in quantity.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.290
But if you look at the math.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.450
So if the old area.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.140
So let's call this price 3.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.670
And let's call this
quantity 3 right over here.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.944
And so total revenue
3-- let me do

00:05:54.944 --> 00:05:58.840
this in a new color-- which
is this area right over there,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.530
is going to be equal to
price 3 times the quantity 3.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.630
Now, if we increase price by,
or if we decrease price by 1%,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.510
then this will become
0.99 times our price.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.000
And if we increase
our quantity by 1%,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.820
then this will become
1.01 times our quantity.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.530
Now, let's think about what
this number right over here is.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.450
And this is why I'm
saying it's not exactly,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.220
the total revenues aren't
going to be exactly unchanged.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.010
If you multiply 0.99 times 1.01,
you don't you get exactly 1.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.150
You don't get exactly 1.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.290
Another way to think
about it, 0.99 times 0.01

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.800
is going to be 1%
less than 1.01.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.050
And 1% of 1.01 is
slightly larger than 1.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.540
Or another way to
think about it,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.150
this value is going to
be 1% larger than 0.99.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.790
And 1% larger than, 1%
of a 0.99 is less than 1.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.010
So it's not going to get a 1.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.060
And you can see it
with your calculator.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.820
0.99 times 1.01 gets
you to very close to 1.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:15.900
So this is going to be equal
to 0.9999 times P3 Q3, which

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:23.530
is equal to 0.9999
times total revenue 3.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.710
But it is-- total revenue 3.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.790
But it is roughly unchanged.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.170
So we can-- that's the
general rule of thumb.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.800
So when you are at
unit elasticity,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.570
then, a decrease in
price roughly says,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.727
no change, approximately
no change in total revenue.

00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:52.810
So I just wanted to make
sure that it makes sense.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.393
It really just comes
from these areas.

00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:56.875
If you're reducing
the height by a less

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.250
than you're
increasing the width,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.000
obviously, the area
is going to increase.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.110
Or most of the
cases, I should say.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.790
It depends on where you are.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.530
If you are, if
you're compensating,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.539
whatever you reduce the height,
you are compensating perfectly

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.330
with the increase in
width, then you're not

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.930
going to have a
change in revenue.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.826
And if you decrease
the height by more,

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.450
if you're taking more
area from the top

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.283
than you're adding on
the width, then you're

00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:24.900
going to have a total
decrease in total revenue.
