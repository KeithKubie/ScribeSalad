00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.640
 I was born in Chengdu 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
 She also graduated from Chengdu University. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.480
 Then I started working after graduation and founded Tap4Fun in 2008. 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.160
 Tap4Fun is a Chinese company in Chengdu, specializing in developing games for mobile devices. 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.440
 Our focus is on developing games for mobile devices only. 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.520
 The development of mobile games has become essential 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.200
 It is also the philosophy of establishing the company to maintain its business continuity and profits. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 The beginning of the company was very funny 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000
 Because there was no small office available at the time. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.040
 But this has led us to cooperate with each other inside and outside the office 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 The dedication of the team members was also very strong. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.000
 The company is headquartered in China but we do not design games for China. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 This is something that usually surprises people. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 Around 2013, we began to notice that Google Play was experiencing really rapid growth 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.560
 And that the Android app market is on the way to expanding enormously. 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.320
 So it was impossible to ignore that. 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 So we've studied the idea of ​​publishing one of our games on Google Play and observing its performance 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760
 Google Play revenue is 55% of our total gaming revenue 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.920
 While Google Play players account for 65% of all our game users. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 This is because users are instantly updating games within one hour 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.760
 From updating or uploading an app. 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.840
 Google has a good relationship with developers 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 Their support staff is very much in touch with us 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.760
 To ask if we need help. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840
 Then they share with us the stage of developing games and give us suggestions. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 In addition to this, they are very interested in each game as well as offering great solutions. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.680
 Our trial use in Google Play allows us to publish new releases 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.120
 By specifically targeting a particular segment of players 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.120
 So we not only create the release, we also care about the experience of our users 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.920
 By avoiding issuing a release to the public only after making sure that it is free of any problems. 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.040
 Google is striving for the success of all developers globally 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.840
 So they do much to encourage everyone to achieve this kind of success. 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 Another factor is the impact that Google is making around the world. 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800
 So for us, Google Play is the starting point for success. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 When we publish our game on Google Play, players from around the world are more likely to reach it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 Operating and enjoying it and this is really important to us. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 It is assumed that there is an important customer support system 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.560
 And that players who pay for the game will be supported by distinguished members 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.280
 We also care about solving the problems players face through Google's opinion system. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280
 In this way, the ratings for our players increased from 3.6 to 4.2 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.800
 Meanwhile, the number of messages with comments and those sent to customer service is decreasing 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680
 By players at a rate ranging from 15% to 20% in the following days. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 As far as I am concerned, I believe that the Statute must be appropriate 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.680
 From openness, availability and excellence to support any company or team 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.400
 He is thinking of producing high-quality games for the world market. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 Google Play represents this type of platform.
