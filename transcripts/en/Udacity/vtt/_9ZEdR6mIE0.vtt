Alright, so you've just finished learning how to specify tokens for languages

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
like HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
At this point, you might be thinking, boy, so those HTML and JavaScript designers

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
did not make pretty tokens.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I just want to mention an experience from my own life. It could be much worse.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I once had the opportunity to work on software that did, let's say, collaborative edits.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Say that a bunch of people wanted to make changes to a book like Pride and Prejudice

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
by Jane Austin.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Suppose that you really want to make it about pandas instead of people,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I really want to make Mr. Darcy nicer because he's a bit snappish in the book

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as it stands.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In theory, we should be able to apply both of these edits together as long as they

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
don't conflict and then someone could download that new version of the book

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and read it with happy pandas all around.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because I didn't know much about language design at the time,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I made all of these editing commands very long and very verbose,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
including 1 key word token that now lives in infamy for me--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
BUT<u>ONLY</u>IF<u>IT</u>CHANGES--all separated by underscores, 1 word, must be capital letters,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which meant oh, if there's nothing that would change in this scene,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for example, because it doesn't have Mr. Darcy in it,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
there's no way to make him happier,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then don't do anything so that people don't think they have to redownload the book

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or redownload that chapter.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Because I didn't have any experience with language design,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I made this super long token name, and now I'm stuck with it forever.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You, too, can find it on Google if you search.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So although it may seem now like HTML and JavaScript are totally arbitrary,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in fact, some effort has gone into making them concise and relatively easy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I just wanted to mention that it could be worse. I know from personal experience.
