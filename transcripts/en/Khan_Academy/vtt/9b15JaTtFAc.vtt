00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:03.042
- [Instructor] Let's say that
we have two pumpkin catapults,

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.658
so let me just draw the ground here.

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:08.450
And so the first pumpkin catapult,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.417
let me just draw it right
over here, that's its space.

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:13.438
And then this is the part

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:16.059
that actually catapult the pumpkin.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.942
So that's what it looks like.

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.942
It holds the pumpkin right over here.

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:24.758
That's the pumpkin that's
about to be shot away.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.467
And what it does is once it releases,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.392
I guess someone presses a
button or pulls a lever,

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.658
the pumpkin catapult is going to release,

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.009
and so this arm is going
to turn a certain amount

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.633
and then just stop
immediately right over there.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.083
And then that pumpkin, that
pumpkin is going to be released

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:47.150
with some type of initial velocity.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.775
So your pumpkin is just
gonna go like that.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.925
So this is our small pumpkin catapult.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:54.242
This is our small one.

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:57.533
But let's say we also have
a large pumpkin catapult.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.667
Let me draw that.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.208
So our large pumpkin
catapult right over here,

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:03.708
similar mechanism.

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:08.442
But let's say its arm
is four times as long.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:13.417
So, that looks about four
times as long right over there.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:15.584
So this is the larger one.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:19.458
The large pumpkin catapult.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.417
Let me make sure to draw the pumpkin

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.850
to remember what we are catapulting.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.017
And then it will go through
actually the exact same angle,

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:30.808
you go to the exact same angle,

00:01:30.808 --> 00:01:32.792
and then let go of its pumpkin.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.025
And this is gonna be a very useful video

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.266
because you will find yourself

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:39.463
making many pumpkin catapults
in your life. (laughs)

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:41.417
And then it will let it go,

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.983
and you will have some linear velocity.

00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:48.208
Now we know a few things
about these pumpkin catapults.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.425
Let's say the small pumpkin catapult,

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.583
the radius between the
center of the pumpkin,

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:56.283
the radius between the
center of the pumpkin

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.808
and the center of
rotation right over there,

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.500
let's say that this is r.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.533
While for the large one, this one is,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.308
this distance right over here, is four r.

00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:10.109
We also know the angular velocity

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.508
while this thing is moving.

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.975
So we know that the angular velocity here,

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.567
let's say the magnitude of
the angular velocity is omega.

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:19.925
It would actually be negative

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.283
if we were to write it as a vector

00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:23.217
'cause we're going in
the clockwise direction

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:25.250
because that's the convention.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.083
But this right over here

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.533
is the magnitude of the angular velocity

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.283
and just to make that tangible for you,

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:35.366
let's say that this is
two pi radians per second.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.050
And let's say this thing,
while it's in motion,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.975
it also has the same magnitude
of its angular velocity,

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.058
so this thing right over here is also.

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:47.250
The magnitude of angular velocity

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.892
is once again two pi radians per second.

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:55.583
So my question to you is
how would the velocity,

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:58.150
the magnitude of the
velocity of the pumpkin

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.342
being released from the small catapult,

00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:02.942
so v sub small.

00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:05.208
If I put a little arrow on top of it,

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.704
we'll be talking about velocity.

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:07.617
Since I didn't put an arrow,

00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:09.275
we're talking about just
the magnitude of velocity.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.500
You can think about this as the speed.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.583
How does this compare to v sub large?

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:19.833
We have the same angular velocity

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.433
but we have different radii.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:26.150
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.492
Well, the key thing to realize here,

00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.212
and we've seen this in multiple
videos, is the relationship

00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:34.042
between the magnitude of angular velocity

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:37.742
and the magnitude of
velocity, linear velocity.

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:41.909
The magnitude of angular
velocity times your radius

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.267
is going to give you the
magnitude of your linear velocity.

00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:50.892
So for the small right over here,

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:56.017
we could write this as v small

00:03:56.017 --> 00:03:58.450
is going to be equal to omega.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.467
These are the same omega,

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:01.167
that omega and that omega is the same.

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:03.108
In fact, we don't even
have to know what this is.

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:06.167
We could say v sub small is equal to omega

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.584
times our radius, which is r.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:16.033
And what's v sub large going to be?

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.450
Well, v sub large

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.117
is going to be equal to that same omega.

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:23.525
So I'm talking about this
particular omega right over here.

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:25.566
So it's that same omega

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:29.358
but now, our radius isn't r, it is four r,

00:04:29.358 --> 00:04:32.608
so we're talking about, so times four r

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:35.750
or if we were to rewrite this,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.750
this would be equal to
four times omega times r.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:45.383
Four times omega times r.

00:04:45.383 --> 00:04:48.433
And what is this right over here?

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.841
Omega times r, that is the
magnitude of the velocity

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.367
of our smaller catapult

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:58.108
or the pumpkin being released
from the smaller catapult.

00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:59.033
So just like that,

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.450
you see by having the
same angular velocity,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.192
but if you increase your arm
length by a factor of four,

00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:09.400
your velocity is going to
increase by a factor of four.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.725
And so you have the magnitude
of velocity of the pumpkin

00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:16.367
being released from the large catapult

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:20.367
is going to be equal to
four times the magnitude

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:24.958
of the velocity of the
pumpkin being released

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:28.250
from the smaller catapult.
