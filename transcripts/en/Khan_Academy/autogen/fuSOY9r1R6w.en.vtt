00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419
 
let's say I have a position vector

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429
let's say I have a position vector
 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.900
let's say I have a position vector
function that looks like this R of T is

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
function that looks like this R of T is
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.790
function that looks like this R of T is
equal to X of T times the unit vector I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
equal to X of T times the unit vector I
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.709
equal to X of T times the unit vector I
plus y of T times the unit vector J let

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
plus y of T times the unit vector J let
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.189
plus y of T times the unit vector J let
me actually graph this so let's say R of

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
me actually graph this so let's say R of
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540
me actually graph this so let's say R of
T so I'll draw it a little bit

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
T so I'll draw it a little bit
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.029
T so I'll draw it a little bit
straighter than that so that's my y-axis

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
straighter than that so that's my y-axis
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.370
straighter than that so that's my y-axis
that is my x-axis and let's say R of T

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
that is my x-axis and let's say R of T
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.500
that is my x-axis and let's say R of T
and this is for T is less than let me

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
and this is for T is less than let me
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.830
and this is for T is less than let me
write this so this is for T is between a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
write this so this is for T is between a
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.150
write this so this is for T is between a
and B so when T is equal to a where this

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
and B so when T is equal to a where this
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190
and B so when T is equal to a where this
vector right here so if you actually

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
vector right here so if you actually
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020
vector right here so if you actually
substitute T is equal to a here you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
substitute T is equal to a here you
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090
substitute T is equal to a here you
would get a vector a position vector

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
would get a vector a position vector
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500
would get a vector a position vector
that would point to that point over

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
that would point to that point over
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410
that would point to that point over
there and then as T increases it traces

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
there and then as T increases it traces
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450
there and then as T increases it traces
out a curve or the end points of our

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
out a curve or the end points of our
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220
out a curve or the end points of our
position vectors trace out a curve that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
position vectors trace out a curve that
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510
position vectors trace out a curve that
looks something like that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
looks something like that
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580
looks something like that
so when T is equal to B we get a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
so when T is equal to B we get a
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160
so when T is equal to B we get a
position vector that looks that points

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
position vector that looks that points
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.020
position vector that looks that points
to that point right there so this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
to that point right there so this
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.990
to that point right there so this
defines a path and the path is going in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
defines a path and the path is going in
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.100
defines a path and the path is going in
this upward direction just like that now

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
this upward direction just like that now
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.580
this upward direction just like that now
let's say that we have another another

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590
let's say that we have another another
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.090
let's say that we have another another
position vector function let me call it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
position vector function let me call it
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.670
position vector function let me call it
o R let me just call it I'll call it R I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
o R let me just call it I'll call it R I
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.359
o R let me just call it I'll call it R I
don't know our reverse our sub R R or

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
don't know our reverse our sub R R or
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219
don't know our reverse our sub R R or
sub R of T actually I'm just call it R

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
sub R of T actually I'm just call it R
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109
sub R of T actually I'm just call it R
of T to make it more confusing if I try

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
of T to make it more confusing if I try
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.130
of T to make it more confusing if I try
to differentiate but it's a different

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
to differentiate but it's a different
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.730
to differentiate but it's a different
one it's the green our R of T instead of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
one it's the green our R of T instead of
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069
one it's the green our R of T instead of
being X of T times I it's going to be X

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
being X of T times I it's going to be X
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.219
being X of T times I it's going to be X
of a plus B minus T times I and instead

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
of a plus B minus T times I and instead
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.580
of a plus B minus T times I and instead
of Y of T it's going to be Y of a plus B

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
of Y of T it's going to be Y of a plus B
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.510
of Y of T it's going to be Y of a plus B
minus T times I and we've seen this in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
minus T times I and we've seen this in
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.270
minus T times I and we've seen this in
the last two videos this the path

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
the last two videos this the path
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910
the last two videos this the path
defined by these position vector by this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
defined by these position vector by this
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530
defined by these position vector by this
position vector function is going to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
position vector function is going to
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.730
position vector function is going to
look more like this let me draw my axes

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
look more like this let me draw my axes
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.120
look more like this let me draw my axes
it's my y-axis that is my x-axis maybe I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
it's my y-axis that is my x-axis maybe I
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.649
it's my y-axis that is my x-axis maybe I
should label them Y and X Y and X this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
should label them Y and X Y and X this
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660
should label them Y and X Y and X this
path is going to look just like this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
path is going to look just like this
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.930
path is going to look just like this
instead of starting here and going there

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940
instead of starting here and going there
 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.760
instead of starting here and going there
when T is equal to 1 let me make it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
when T is equal to 1 let me make it
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000
when T is equal to 1 let me make it
clear this is also true for a is less

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
clear this is also true for a is less
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.770
clear this is also true for a is less
than or equal to T which is less than B

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
than or equal to T which is less than B
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.260
than or equal to T which is less than B
so T is going to go from A to B but here

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270
so T is going to go from A to B but here
 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.940
so T is going to go from A to B but here
when T is equal to a you substitute it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
when T is equal to a you substitute it
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920
when T is equal to a you substitute it
over here you're going to get this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
over here you're going to get this
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.270
over here you're going to get this
vector you're going to get you're going

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
vector you're going to get you're going
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.700
vector you're going to get you're going
to start over here you're going to start

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710
to start over here you're going to start
 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.650
to start over here you're going to start
over there and as you increment T as you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
over there and as you increment T as you
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.230
over there and as you increment T as you
make it larger and larger and larger

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240
make it larger and larger and larger
 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
make it larger and larger and larger
you're going to trace out that same path

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
you're going to trace out that same path
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490
you're going to trace out that same path
but in the opposite direction so it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
but in the opposite direction so it's
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.230
but in the opposite direction so it's
the same path in the opposite direction

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
the same path in the opposite direction
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.320
the same path in the opposite direction
and so when T is equal to B you put that

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
and so when T is equal to B you put that
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.580
and so when T is equal to B you put that
in here you're actually going to get X

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
in here you're actually going to get X
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740
in here you're actually going to get X
of a and Y of a they're right the B's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
of a and Y of a they're right the B's
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.420
of a and Y of a they're right the B's
cancel out and so you're going to point

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
cancel out and so you're going to point
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.010
cancel out and so you're going to point
right like that so these are the same

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020
right like that so these are the same
 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870
right like that so these are the same
you can imagine the shape of these paths

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
you can imagine the shape of these paths
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.040
you can imagine the shape of these paths
are the same but we're going in the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
are the same but we're going in the
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.880
are the same but we're going in the
exact in the exact opposite direction so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890
exact in the exact opposite direction so
 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.440
exact in the exact opposite direction so
we're going to do in this video is to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
we're going to do in this video is to
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.620
we're going to do in this video is to
see what happens how I guess you could

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
see what happens how I guess you could
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.290
see what happens how I guess you could
say if I have some vector field let's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
say if I have some vector field let's
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.020
say if I have some vector field let's
say I have some vector field f of XY

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
say I have some vector field f of XY
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.180
say I have some vector field f of XY
equals P of XY I plus Q of X Y J right

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190
equals P of XY I plus Q of X Y J right
 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.910
equals P of XY I plus Q of X Y J right
this is just a vector field over over

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
this is just a vector field over over
 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.970
this is just a vector field over over
the Dover the XY plane how the line

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
the Dover the XY plane how the line
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.360
the Dover the XY plane how the line
integral of this vector field of this

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
integral of this vector field of this
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.930
integral of this vector field of this
vector field over this path over this

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
vector field over this path over this
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.800
vector field over this path over this
path compares to the line integral the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
path compares to the line integral the
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.650
path compares to the line integral the
same vector field over that path how

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
same vector field over that path how
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.760
same vector field over that path how
that compares to this to we call this

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770
that compares to this to we call this
 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.440
that compares to this to we call this
the minus curve so if this is the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
the minus curve so if this is the
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.020
the minus curve so if this is the
positive curve this is the positive

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
positive curve this is the positive
 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.790
positive curve this is the positive
curve we're going to call this the minus

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800
curve we're going to call this the minus
 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.160
curve we're going to call this the minus
curve so how does it going over the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
curve so how does it going over the
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.780
curve so how does it going over the
positive curve compared to going over

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
positive curve compared to going over
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.820
positive curve compared to going over
the minus curve f of F dot d R so before

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830
the minus curve f of F dot d R so before
 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.590
the minus curve f of F dot d R so before
I break into the math let's just think

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
I break into the math let's just think
 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.180
I break into the math let's just think
about it a little bit let me draw this

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
about it a little bit let me draw this
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.640
about it a little bit let me draw this
vector field F so maybe it looks I'm

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
vector field F so maybe it looks I'm
 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950
vector field F so maybe it looks I'm
just going to draw a random stuff so you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960
just going to draw a random stuff so you
 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.380
just going to draw a random stuff so you
know on every point in the XY plane it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390
know on every point in the XY plane it
 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.380
know on every point in the XY plane it
has a vector it defines or maps a vector

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390
has a vector it defines or maps a vector
 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.780
has a vector it defines or maps a vector
to every point on the XY plane but we

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
to every point on the XY plane but we
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.190
to every point on the XY plane but we
really care about the points that are on

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
really care about the points that are on
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.770
really care about the points that are on
the curve so maybe the on the curve you

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
the curve so maybe the on the curve you
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.810
the curve so maybe the on the curve you
know this is the vector field at the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
know this is the vector field at the
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.479
know this is the vector field at the
points on the curve and let me draw it

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
points on the curve and let me draw it
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.979
points on the curve and let me draw it
over here too so all the points on the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989
over here too so all the points on the
 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.740
over here too so all the points on the
curve where we care about this is our

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
curve where we care about this is our
 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.629
curve where we care about this is our
vector field

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639
vector field
 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.839
vector field
that is our vector field and let's just

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849
that is our vector field and let's just
 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.249
that is our vector field and let's just
get an intuition of what's going to be

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259
get an intuition of what's going to be
 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.490
get an intuition of what's going to be
going we're summing over the dot we're

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500
going we're summing over the dot we're
 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.040
going we're summing over the dot we're
taking each point along the line right

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050
taking each point along the line right
 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570
taking each point along the line right
we're going to take each point along the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580
we're going to take each point along the
 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.119
we're going to take each point along the
line and we're summing let me start over

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129
line and we're summing let me start over
 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.709
line and we're summing let me start over
here we're taking each point along the

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719
here we're taking each point along the
 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.800
here we're taking each point along the
line we did a different color and we're

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810
line we did a different color and we're
 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.559
line we did a different color and we're
summing the dot product of the value of

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569
summing the dot product of the value of
 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.050
summing the dot product of the value of
the vector field at that point the dot

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060
the vector field at that point the dot
 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.350
the vector field at that point the dot
product of that with dr or the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
product of that with dr or the
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.749
product of that with dr or the
differential of our position vector

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759
differential of our position vector
 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.760
differential of our position vector
function and dr you can kind of imagine

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
function and dr you can kind of imagine
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.909
function and dr you can kind of imagine
as a small an infinitesimally small

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919
as a small an infinitesimally small
 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.800
as a small an infinitesimally small
vector going in the direction of our

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810
vector going in the direction of our
 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.869
vector going in the direction of our
movement and when we take this dot

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879
movement and when we take this dot
 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.209
movement and when we take this dot
product here it's essentially it's going

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219
product here it's essentially it's going
 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.159
product here it's essentially it's going
to be a scalar value but the dot product

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169
to be a scalar value but the dot product
 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.339
to be a scalar value but the dot product
if you remember it's the magnitude of F

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349
if you remember it's the magnitude of F
 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.189
if you remember it's the magnitude of F
in the direction of D R times the

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199
in the direction of D R times the
 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.279
in the direction of D R times the
magnitude of D R so it's this you can

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289
magnitude of D R so it's this you can
 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.950
magnitude of D R so it's this you can
imagine it's the shadow of F onto D our

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960
imagine it's the shadow of F onto D our
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.540
imagine it's the shadow of F onto D our
let me zoom into that because I think

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550
let me zoom into that because I think
 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.800
let me zoom into that because I think
it's useful so this little thing that

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810
it's useful so this little thing that
 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.019
it's useful so this little thing that
I'm drawing right here let's say that

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029
I'm drawing right here let's say that
 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.439
I'm drawing right here let's say that
this is my path this is F at that point

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449
this is my path this is F at that point
 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.869
this is my path this is F at that point
F at that point looks something like

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879
F at that point looks something like
 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.379
F at that point looks something like
that and then D R at this point looks

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389
that and then D R at this point looks
 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.219
that and then D R at this point looks
something like that

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229
something like that
 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.879
something like that
let me do a different color dr dr looks

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889
let me do a different color dr dr looks
 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.269
let me do a different color dr dr looks
something like that so that is f and so

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279
something like that so that is f and so
 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.010
something like that so that is f and so
the dot product of these two says okay

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020
the dot product of these two says okay
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.719
the dot product of these two says okay
let's how much of f is going in the same

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729
let's how much of f is going in the same
 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.369
let's how much of f is going in the same
direction as dr and you can kind of

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379
direction as dr and you can kind of
 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.490
direction as dr and you can kind of
imagine it as a shadow so you take the f

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500
imagine it as a shadow so you take the f
 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.320
imagine it as a shadow so you take the f
that's going the same direction as dr

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
that's going the same direction as dr
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.540
that's going the same direction as dr
the magnitude of that times the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550
the magnitude of that times the
 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.390
the magnitude of that times the
magnitude of dr that is the dot product

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
magnitude of dr that is the dot product
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.379
magnitude of dr that is the dot product
in this case we're going to get a

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389
in this case we're going to get a
 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.300
in this case we're going to get a
positive number because this length is

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310
positive number because this length is
 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.369
positive number because this length is
positive this length is positive that's

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:04.379
positive this length is positive that's
 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.600
positive this length is positive that's
going to be a positive number

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610
going to be a positive number
 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.339
going to be a positive number
now what if our dr was going in the

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349
now what if our dr was going in the
 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.110
now what if our dr was going in the
opposite direction as it is in this case

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120
opposite direction as it is in this case
 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.110
opposite direction as it is in this case
so let me draw maybe that same part of

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
so let me draw maybe that same part of
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.529
so let me draw maybe that same part of
the curve the same part of the curve we

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539
the curve the same part of the curve we
 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.920
the curve the same part of the curve we
have our F our F will look something

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
have our F our F will look something
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.010
have our F our F will look something
like that that is our F I'm drawing this

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020
like that that is our F I'm drawing this
 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.990
like that that is our F I'm drawing this
exact same part of the curve but now our

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000
exact same part of the curve but now our
 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.959
exact same part of the curve but now our
dr our dr isn't going in that direction

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969
dr our dr isn't going in that direction
 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.320
dr our dr isn't going in that direction
our dr that at this point is going to be

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330
our dr that at this point is going to be
 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.869
our dr that at this point is going to be
going in the other direction we're

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879
going in the other direction we're
 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.459
going in the other direction we're
tracing the curve in the opposite

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469
tracing the curve in the opposite
 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.649
tracing the curve in the opposite
direction our dr is now going to be

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659
direction our dr is now going to be
 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.809
direction our dr is now going to be
going in that direction so if you do so

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819
going in that direction so if you do so
 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.310
going in that direction so if you do so
this is

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320
this is
 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.520
this is
our dr so if you do f dot dr you're

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530
our dr so if you do f dot dr you're
 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.830
our dr so if you do f dot dr you're
taking the shadow or how much of f is

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840
taking the shadow or how much of f is
 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.030
taking the shadow or how much of f is
going in the direction of dr you take

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040
going in the direction of dr you take
 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.000
going in the direction of dr you take
the shadow down here it's going in the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010
the shadow down here it's going in the
 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.770
the shadow down here it's going in the
opposite direction of dr so you can

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780
opposite direction of dr so you can
 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.060
opposite direction of dr so you can
imagine that when you multiply the

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070
imagine that when you multiply the
 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.410
imagine that when you multiply the
magnitudes you should get a negative

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420
magnitudes you should get a negative
 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.390
magnitudes you should get a negative
number our direction is now opposite

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400
number our direction is now opposite
 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.730
number our direction is now opposite
they're not going into the shadow of f

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740
they're not going into the shadow of f
 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.120
they're not going into the shadow of f
on to the same direction as dr is going

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130
on to the same direction as dr is going
 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.010
on to the same direction as dr is going
in the opposite directions dr in this

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020
in the opposite directions dr in this
 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.480
in the opposite directions dr in this
case it's going in the same direction as

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490
case it's going in the same direction as
 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.730
case it's going in the same direction as
dr so the intuition is is that maybe

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740
dr so the intuition is is that maybe
 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.620
dr so the intuition is is that maybe
these two things are the negative of

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630
these two things are the negative of
 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.080
these two things are the negative of
each other and now we can do some math

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090
each other and now we can do some math
 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.630
each other and now we can do some math
and try to see if that is definitely

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640
and try to see if that is definitely
 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.040
and try to see if that is definitely
definitely the case so let us first

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050
definitely the case so let us first
 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.050
definitely the case so let us first
figure out let's write an expression for

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060
figure out let's write an expression for
 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.200
figure out let's write an expression for
the differential dr so in this case dr

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210
the differential dr so in this case dr
 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:32.050
the differential dr so in this case dr
dr dt is going to be equal to X prime of

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060
dr dt is going to be equal to X prime of
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:39.730
dr dt is going to be equal to X prime of
T times I plus plus y prime of T times J

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740
T times I plus plus y prime of T times J
 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.200
T times I plus plus y prime of T times J
in this other example in the reverse

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.210
in this other example in the reverse
 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.320
in this other example in the reverse
case our dr dr dt is going to be what's

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.330
case our dr dr dt is going to be what's

of it let me put a plus a plus and I'll

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.110
of it let me put a plus a plus and I'll
 

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.710
of it let me put a plus a plus and I'll
put the minus sign out front

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720
put the minus sign out front
 

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.780
put the minus sign out front
so the minus sign is just a scalar value

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:08.790
so the minus sign is just a scalar value
 

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.610
so the minus sign is just a scalar value
so we could put that minus sign out you

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620
so we could put that minus sign out you
 

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.500
so we could put that minus sign out you
know when you take a dot product and if

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:12.510
know when you take a dot product and if
 

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.210
know when you take a dot product and if
you multiply a scalar times a dot

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220
you multiply a scalar times a dot
 

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.650
you multiply a scalar times a dot
product that's you could just take the

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660
product that's you could just take the
 

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.360
product that's you could just take the
scalar out that's all I'm saying

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.370
scalar out that's all I'm saying
 

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.640
scalar out that's all I'm saying
so we can take that minus sign out to

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:19.650
so we can take that minus sign out to
 

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.680
so we can take that minus sign out to
this part right here and then you have X

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:21.690
this part right here and then you have X
 

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:29.630
this part right here and then you have X

of a plus B minus T you scroll over a

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:33.870
of a plus B minus T you scroll over a
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:41.180
of a plus B minus T you scroll over a
little bit T J D T so this is the

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.190
little bit T J D T so this is the
 

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.160
little bit T J D T so this is the
forward this is when we're following it

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.170
forward this is when we're following it
 

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.050
forward this is when we're following it
along the forward curve this is when

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060
along the forward curve this is when
 

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.390
along the forward curve this is when
we're following it along the reverse

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:47.400
we're following it along the reverse
 

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.880
we're following it along the reverse
curve now let's like we did when the

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:49.890
curve now let's like we did when the
 

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.890
curve now let's like we did when the
scalar example let's make a substitution

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:51.900
scalar example let's make a substitution
 

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.060
scalar example let's make a substitution
I want to make it very clear what I did

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.070
I want to make it very clear what I did
 

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.950
I want to make it very clear what I did
all I did here is I just took the dot

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:54.960
all I did here is I just took the dot
 

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.870
all I did here is I just took the dot
product but this negative sign I just

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880
product but this negative sign I just
 

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.790
product but this negative sign I just
took it out I just said this is the same

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800
took it out I just said this is the same
 

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.650
took it out I just said this is the same
thing as negative 1 times this thing or

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660
thing as negative 1 times this thing or
 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.150
thing as negative 1 times this thing or
negative 1 times this thing is the same

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160
negative 1 times this thing is the same
 

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.920
negative 1 times this thing is the same
thing as that so let's make a

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:03.930
thing as that so let's make a
 

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.390
thing as that so let's make a
substitution on this side because I

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:05.400
substitution on this side because I
 

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.470
substitution on this side because I
really just want to show you that this

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480
really just want to show you that this
 

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.110
really just want to show you that this
is the negative of that right there

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120
is the negative of that right there
 

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.430
is the negative of that right there
because that's what our intuition was

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440
because that's what our intuition was
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.230
because that's what our intuition was
going for so let me just focus on that

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240
going for so let me just focus on that
 

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.290
going for so let me just focus on that
side so let me make a substitution U is

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:17.300
side so let me make a substitution U is
 

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.370
side so let me make a substitution U is
equal to a plus B minus T then we get D

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380
equal to a plus B minus T then we get D
 

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.950
equal to a plus B minus T then we get D
U is equal to minus DT right just take

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:24.960
U is equal to minus DT right just take
 

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.320
U is equal to minus DT right just take
the derivative of both sides or you get

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.330
the derivative of both sides or you get
 

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.880
the derivative of both sides or you get
DT is equal to minus D U and then you

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:31.890
DT is equal to minus D U and then you
 

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.750
DT is equal to minus D U and then you
get when T is equal to when T is equal

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760
get when T is equal to when T is equal
 

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.920
get when T is equal to when T is equal
to a U is equal to a plus B minus a so

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:39.930
to a U is equal to a plus B minus a so
 

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.390
to a U is equal to a plus B minus a so
then U is equal to B and then when T is

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:44.400
then U is equal to B and then when T is
 

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.460
then U is equal to B and then when T is
equal to B U is equal to a right when T

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.470
equal to B U is equal to a right when T
 

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.880
equal to B U is equal to a right when T
is equal to B a plus B minus B is a U is

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:52.890
is equal to B a plus B minus B is a U is
 

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.530
is equal to B a plus B minus B is a U is
equal to a so this thing using that

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540
equal to a so this thing using that
 

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.890
equal to a so this thing using that
simple

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:54.900
simple
 

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.380
simple
that's that substitution simplifies to

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:57.390
that's that substitution simplifies to
 

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.260
that's that substitution simplifies to
this is the whole point that simplifies

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.270
this is the whole point that simplifies
 

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.700
this is the whole point that simplifies

DT I need to put a D u DT is equal to

00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:48.449
DT I need to put a D u DT is equal to
 

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:51.800
DT I need to put a D u DT is equal to
minus D u so I could write minus D u

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:51.810
minus D u so I could write minus D u
 

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.509
minus D u so I could write minus D u
here or just to not make it confusing

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519
here or just to not make it confusing
 

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:56.240
here or just to not make it confusing
I'll put the D u here and take the minus

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.250
I'll put the D u here and take the minus
 

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.040
I'll put the D u here and take the minus
out front I already have a minus out

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.050
out front I already have a minus out
 

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.710
out front I already have a minus out
there so they cancel out they will

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720
there so they cancel out they will
 

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.189
there so they cancel out they will
cancel out just like that and so you

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199
cancel out just like that and so you
 

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:05.749
cancel out just like that and so you
might say hey Sal with these two things

00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.400
might say hey Sal with these two things
look pretty similar to each other they

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:07.410
look pretty similar to each other they
 

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.509
look pretty similar to each other they
don't look like the negative each other

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519
don't look like the negative each other
 

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.519
don't look like the negative each other
and I would say well you're almost right

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:10.529
and I would say well you're almost right
 

00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:12.710
and I would say well you're almost right
except this guy's limits of integration

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720
except this guy's limits of integration
 

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.949
except this guy's limits of integration
are reversed from this guy so this thing

right here if we reverse the limits of
 

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:19.970
right here if we reverse the limits of
integration we have to then make it

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980
integration we have to then make it
 

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.210
integration we have to then make it
negative so this is equal to minus the

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220
negative so this is equal to minus the
 

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.790

we're having D u here but we're going to
 

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.889
we're having D u here but we're going to
get the same exact number for any A or B

to summarize everything up when you're

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:09.209
to summarize everything up when you're
 

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.910
to summarize everything up when you're
dealing with when you're dealing with

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920
dealing with when you're dealing with
 

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.439
dealing with when you're dealing with
line integrals over vector fields the

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:15.449
line integrals over vector fields the
 

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.059
line integrals over vector fields the
direction matters if you go in the

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:17.069
direction matters if you go in the
 

00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:18.499
direction matters if you go in the
reverse direction you're going to get

00:15:18.499 --> 00:15:18.509
reverse direction you're going to get
 

00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:20.870
reverse direction you're going to get
the negative version of that and that's

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880
the negative version of that and that's
 

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.189
the negative version of that and that's
because at any point we take the dot

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199
because at any point we take the dot
 

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:23.629
because at any point we take the dot
product you're going to get you're not

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639
product you're going to get you're not
 

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.340
product you're going to get you're not
going into necessarily you're going in

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:25.350
going into necessarily you're going in
 

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.379
going into necessarily you're going in
the different in the opposite direction

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:27.389
the different in the opposite direction
 

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:28.819
the different in the opposite direction
so it'll be the negative of each other

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:28.829
so it'll be the negative of each other
 

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:30.800
so it'll be the negative of each other
but when you're dealing with a scalar
