WARREN RIEUTORT-LOUIS:
I think what

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.320
inspires me is to make
people feel something.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.910
Very much a lot of my
work as an engineer

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.280
is building things that
are useful to people.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.670
Me, my inspiration as music is
sort of more qualitative, more

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.430
in sort of how can you create a
bond between an actor or singer

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400
and a audience member.


00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.840
And it's how to develop that
really sort of inspires me.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.530 position:97%
 


00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.540
I'm Warren Rieutort-Louis,
and I'm a fifth year

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.450
electrical engineer.


00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.110
I'm studying in the PhD
program in electronic materials

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.640
and devices.


00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.000 position:97%
 


00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.520
I've always had a very big
interest in electronics

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.840
from quite a young age.


00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.310
You can build these
really cool systems that

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.290
are so dense and so powerful.


00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.470
I'm now looking, along with so
many other people in my field,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.080
that taking those elements of
electronics that have allowed

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.160
things like
computing to develop,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.350
to grow into things
like large scale systems

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.020
that can be around us all
the time in monitoring us.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690
I think it's a very
cool thing to be

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.090
able to do to have
sort of living

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.700
electronics-- have electronics
that can respond to you.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.000
And so I came to Princeton
a couple of years ago

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.310
and started my PhD.


00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.350
And the first few years
of PhD are very intense.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.410
So we spend time studying,
prepare for the general exams.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.620
And then after my
general exam there

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.910
was this opportunity to
take a course in conducting.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.620
And it kind of all
snowballed from there.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.340
Taking that course
in conducting allowed

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.820
me to create so many contacts
within the musical field

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.030
at Princeton and the
theatrical field at Princeton.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.820
I joined the Princeton
University Glee Club

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.960
for example, as
part of this course.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.360 position:97%
 


00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280
So as an engineer
obviously I've studied

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.760
a great deal of the basic
mathematical properties

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.180
of music, and the
properties of sound,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.430
the properties of frequencies.


00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.090
Finding how to apply how they
actually work in a real setting

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.600
where you have a music piece
and you see how that music

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.780
piece develops, and you realize
that sound is a great deal more

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.890
than a set of
frequencies, that sound

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.540
is about creating emotion.


00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.220
And how do you combine different
melodies, different lines

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.080
in a piece to inspire people.


00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.830
I've used my
engineering knowledge

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.110
to better understand the
theoretical underpinnings

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.090
of music.


00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.910
The theory that goes behind
why it is that a piece sounds

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.940
as good as it does,
or a piece sounds odd

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.590
when you listen to it.


00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.630
But at the same time
putting that aside

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.630
in a way and sort of
coming from the other angle

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940
and thinking of well,
what is the emotion

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.760
we want to convey here.


00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.060 position:97%
 


00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.300
Everything can
come together, all

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.410
these moving parts of a
theatrical production.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.700
And it's very much like an
engineering system in a way.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.890
You have the equations
that make things work,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.430
and then the practical
systems that are built,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.610
and then correlating
everything into something

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.060
that works is incredible.


00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.000
And so when I wake up
in the morning, one

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.550
of the first things I
do I go and play piano

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.530
because I know that a day
that starts with piano

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.610
is going to be a good day.


00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.870
And so for me it's incredible.


00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.620
