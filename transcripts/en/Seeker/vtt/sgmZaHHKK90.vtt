00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.550
Dark matter has been the go-to explanation
for many scientists as to why there seems

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.179
to be more gravitational influence in our
universe than the gravity measured by visible

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.179
matter.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.980
But what if there’s no dark matter at all?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.460
The idea of dark matter was first proposed
by Henri Poincaré in 1906.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.620
Then in 1933, evidence of dark matter was
found by Fritz Zwicky while studying galaxy

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.620
clusters...

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.380
And then more evidence of dark matter was
found based on the calculations of rotational

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.780
velocities in galaxies made by Vera Rubin
in 1978.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.520
Our universe is made up of less than 5% of
visible matter---like stars, planets, galaxies

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000
you, me, everything we can see.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Everything else, is stuff we can’t see which
we call dark matter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.940
And scientists think 95% of the matter in
our universe is dark matter.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.870
Right now, Dark Matter is used to explain
a few pesky things in astrophysics.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
Liike…

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.400
Why hot galaxy clusters don’t blow themselves
apart.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.420
Why stars don’t get flung out into space
because of galaxy rotation.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.079
And also, the temperature fluctuations of
the CMB -- or cosmic microwave background

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.079
radiation.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.740
That said, there are theories that are trying
to explain all this without assuming it’s

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.890
dark matter…These are: scale invariance
and emergent gravity.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.950
The empty space scale invariance theory says
that properties of empty space should not

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.970
change based on scale.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.870
An astrophysicist looked back at the early
equations of Einstein, and Newtonian Dynamics,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.240
and modified an acceleration term in Newton's
law.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.490
With this change, the law could explain a
new force.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.810
This force can explain things that were explained
by dark matter… such as holding a galaxy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.910
together that’s spinning at high rotational
velocities.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.770
The only problem is, on Earth, this force
can be up to billion times smaller than the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.570
force of gravity--making it difficult to measure.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.110
It doesn’t explain gravitational lensing,
--which is the bending of light-- or the temperature

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.659
fluctuations of the CMB.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.119
The craziest, but to me the most interesting,
is the holographic principle, which says that

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.140
our entire universe can be described on an
imaginary sphere that surrounds ordinary matter.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.000
It lead to the theory of emergent gravity.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.119
That is the idea that gravity arises (or emerges)
through the presence of matter.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.230
This suggests this happens the same way temperature
arises from the movement microscopic particles

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.230
of matter.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.290
So, if gravity is formed this way then it
can be used to explain gravitational phenomena

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.580
again!

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.349
Because something is keeping galaxies gravitationally
bound.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.160
It’s possible that the force created in
the emergent gravity theory does this!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.440
But it still doesn’t explain the CMB temperatures...

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.540
Scientists are still developing theories,
like these, so they can explain things like

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.510
the reason our universe hasn’t blown apart
because of invisible matter.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.230
And they think it might be because of a gravitational
field that developed through the movement

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.099
of visible matter in our universe.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.379
It’s all very complicated, and yet, epic.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.319
At the moment, arguments for dark matter still
stand tall above many of these other theories,

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.470
but hey, maybe not forever.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.060
Hey peeps, take a sec to subscribe for more
videos.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.030
Plus, check out Trace’s video about a new
form of matter excitonium!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.080
And one last fun fact: the holographic principle
says we’ve always looked at life as 3 dimensions,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.660
but if we looked at it as 2 dimensions then
MAYBE the universe is just a holographic projection

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.810
of ourselves.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.630
Thanks for watching!
