00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.730
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.850
And welcome to the African
Middle Eastern Division.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.420
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of
the division and I'm delighted

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.580
to see you here to attend
this exciting presentation

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.150
by Professor Ittai Joseph Tamari,
the director of the Center Archives

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.870
for Research on the History
of the Jews in Germany.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.530
Which is in Highland Burg.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.710
A fascinating subject.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.500
The transformation
of the [inaudible]

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.710
from manuscript to printed text.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.450
Sorry, I'm paraphrasing, the
title is not quite that way.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.250
This will be followed by very
special display of rare editions

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.000
of the Talmud, which your program
says is a unique opportunity

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.280
to compare rare editions,
page by page.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.980
I only say a few things about
this division before we start

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.280
the program.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.250
Many of you already know
that this division is made

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.540
up of three sections.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.530
The African section, which
covers [inaudible] in Africa,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.940 position:56%
the near East section, which covers
the whole of the Arab world, Turkey,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.840
Iran, Central Asia, the [inaudible]

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.800
and smaller areas,
even close to China.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.680 position:56%
We responsible for 78 different
countries and regions in those areas

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.110 position:56%
and we're very active in collecting,
acquiring, developing collections

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.870
in the vesicular, in the
languages of those regions.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.020
We also do briefing for visitors
when they come to the library.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.840
We do symposium, workshops, we
have displays, we have exhibits

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.720 position:56%
and our staff is one of the best
staff you can possibly hope to have.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.700
They're scholars in their own
rights, they know the languages,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.240
they know the culture of
the regions that they cover.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.850
And, so, we serve our
patrons in many ways.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
One of which, of course, serve
them with our collections.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.920
But we also bring scholars to the
library as we are doing today.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.490 position:56%
We bring scholars who can illuminate
and enhance our understanding

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.540
of those collections that we
hold and that we treasure.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.890 position:56%
So, it's so exciting to have
Professor Tamari here with us today.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.760
And to introduce this lecture
is Professor Michael Brenner,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.040
the director of the
Center of Israel Studies

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.760
at the American University
in Washington DC.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.640
He's also a professor of
Jewish history and culture

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.920
at the Ludwig Maximilian
University of Munich.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.440
So, I think you want
to hear from them now.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.510
And, so, Professor Brenner
if you would please come.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.630
[ Applause ]

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Brenner: Thank you.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.870
It's a real pleasure to introduce
my dear colleague Dr. Ittai Tamari.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.820
Let me first thank the
Jewish Studies Program

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.590
at American University and
also the Judaic Studies Program

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.130 position:56%
at George Washington University and,
of course, the Library of Congress,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.450 position:56%
who cooperated making this possible.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.890
Especially Ann Brener who
helped us so much here.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.120 position:56%
I am very happy to see Dr. Tamari
here, who was my colleague in Munich

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.870
for many years until he moved
to Heidelberg earlier this year

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.970
to direct the center -- to
direct the archives for research

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.740
and study of the Jews in Germany.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.800
The major archives for this purpose
in the German speaking world.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.430
He is best known, I think, for his
many publications on Hebrew print.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.900
The history of Hebrew print,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.190 position:56%
especially in the Ashkenazi world I
would say he is probably the leading

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.580
expert in this field today.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.470
Has published many books.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.080
One very beautiful recent book
came out about the Hebrew holdings

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.140
of the Bavarian State Library,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.250
one of the leading libraries
actually in this field.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.780
In fact, the only completely extent
medieval Talmud manuscript is

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.920
in Munich and many other
manuscripts in early prints.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.750
He has also published numerous
articles on Hebrew printing

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.330 position:56%
and related topics in Hebrew, in
German, in English has been lecturer

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.360
in several universities
in Germany and Israel.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.070
Recently gave a lecture series at
the National Library in Jerusalem

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.030
and I am really very
happy to see him here.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.560
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Tamari, who will speak

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.120
about the topic, I think you all
see the front of you on your screen

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.590
from manuscript to printed text,
the transformation of the Talmud.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.390
Thank you.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.890
&gt;&gt; Ittai Joseph Tamari:
Thank you very much.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.090
And thank you again for all the
institutions that made it possible

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:09.450
to be here in this
wonderful and amazing place

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.140
of where knowledge is
at home, so to say.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.620
What I'm trying to do in the coming
hour or so is to give here in front

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.070
of you a kind of introduction
to the theme.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.210
And then I will invite you all
to come with me to the room

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:39.900
in the rare here and see very
fine selection of Talmud volumes

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.490
that are presented here, I think.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.500
So, for the first time, one
might say, in such a -- yeah.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.420
Okay, let's start.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.990
The Talmud is considered the corner
stone of the Jewish oral low.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.680
Which is traditionally
comprehended as a compass

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.150
that should not be
transferred into written form.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.560
The Talmud is composed of
citations from the mission half,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.030
followed by the Gemara, which
consists of the discussions

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:24.610
of the sages relating at times
loosely to the precursory citation.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.050
But and to what extent
the Talmud was copied

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.860
or written down is unknown.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.520
Unfortunately, there are not too
many manuscripts of Talmud treaties

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.390
that have survived to our
day, much less manuscripts

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.250
that contain the whole copies

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.210
of either the Yoma Shimy [assumed
spelling] originated in the land

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.960 position:56%
of Israel, or the Bovini in Babylon.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.190
The persecution of the Talmud
by the church is another cause

00:07:53.190 --> 00:08:00.430 position:56%
for the disappearance of many Talmud
manuscripts and printed versions.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.850
Nevertheless, in the
following minutes I will try

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.020
to discuss the transformation
of the text

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.790
from its hand written version
to its printed version.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.920
I would also like to follow some

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.370
of the prevalent verbal
stereotypes concerning the topic

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.180
and compare them with the material
reality of the vast [inaudible]

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.420
of literature called the
Talmud, which is the amplest

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.160
and the most complicated
Jewish tradition ever created.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.660
The Talmud is also probably
the first multi-layered text

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.740
in a tradition that after
the Renaissance and then

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.830
in [inaudible] brought
by its printed version,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.510
could no longer be read linearly.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:55.480
Generally Jewish communities are
considered learned societies,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.880
apart from dealing with
a tradition of learning,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.040
traditions of learning
disputing, ruminating on

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.480
and transmitting various
kinds of knowledge,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.770
we may as well turn our attention
to the preparation, production

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.600
and dissemination of printed books

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.970
through which knowledge
was kept and transferred.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.470
During the first period of
the new technology of printing

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.620
with moveable letters that
is in [inaudible] crafted

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:41.700
between about 1415 until
1500, approximately 28,000

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:47.130
to 30,000 titles were printed,
mostly in three European centers,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.510
Italy, Germany and France.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.060
Of those some 140 were
set with Hebrew letters.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.370
Then half a percent of the 140
titles using Hebrew letters,

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.150
the biggest section
was biblical text

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.530
and their common [inaudible],
something like 38%.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:15.110 position:56%
Less than 5% of printed [inaudible]
of this period were Talmud treaties.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.600
But the low percentage of printed
Talmud treaties does not provide

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.130 position:56%
binding evidence of the poor
interest in this kind of literature.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:30.400
Rather, it speaks to the
practical hardships of printers

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.740
in finding appropriate manuscript
copies and matching proper

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.870
and suitable commentaries,
as well as the elaborate

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.860
and [inaudible] way parts of
text were set on the printed page

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.870
or better saying that
they will spread.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:51.060
We will see all these
later in the rare room.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:11:01.440
In 1936 Walter Benjamin wrote
his essay, "The Work of Art

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.720
in the Mechanical Reproduction," in
it he argues, among other things,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.420 position:56%
that through the act of reproduction
the significance is taken

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.750
from the original by
taking its context.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.470 position:56%
The former [inaudible] of the hand
manufactured object gets lost amidst

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.020
the multitude of reproductions
and the deliverance

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.170
of the reproduced work of art

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.040
from its symbiotical
dependence on ritual.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.620
Such are among the most
known citation from his essay

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.310
that later had the considerable
influence on the [inaudible].

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.690
When considering the printed
Talmud after [inaudible] most

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:53.720 position:56%
of the arguments Benjamin brought up
tend to show exactly the opposite.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.160
Through the printing of
the Talmud Jewish tradition

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.030
and its ritual components
were restructured,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.040
strengthened and standardized.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.720
Learning and ruminating

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.130
on its knowledge became
an obligatory activity,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:15.330
the artisanal quality of the
Talmud manuscripts disappeared,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.100
but the student of the text
became part of a big hard

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:25.460
to quantify society of daily
students of a modern ritual.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.670
Volumes of the printed
Talmud became, if not holy,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.850
at least venerated and took a
central place on the shelves

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.740
of the living room of
every learned Jewish adult.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:45.500
Since the 16th century the Talmud
has possessed, one may say,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.400
a practical [inaudible]
of essentially --

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.120
essentiality that was
not feasible before.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.610
In this way two polar
opposites approach each other.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.640
The ruminative individual struggle

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.620
with the text approaches
the mass learning of it

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.250
in quantities never known before.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.690 position:56%
Another point of interest that may
strike our attention is the vicinity

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.560
of those texts to technology.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.360
From 1520 Venice to our day
with the still new translations

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.230
of the whole text now,
the Talmud can be read

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.450
on our cellphones and
tablets and so on.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.360
Compared with text
of other religions.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.480
It is most unique.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.280
These and other peculiarities

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:47.260
of the printed Talmud made it
almost form its earliest days along

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.940
for goal for printers who were in
many cases during the long history

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.610
of printing with Hebrew letters
themselves devote scholars.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.560
Of the some 15 known completed
editions of the Talmud,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.960
as well as numerous partial
publications one can assume a very

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.800 position:56%
active and highly professional field
where they are fascinating efforts

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.690 position:56%
to innovate, improve and squeeze
more content into the limited frames

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.260
of the double spread
on both letters.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.250
The texture and the
physical topographical.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:32.540
Within less than a century the
printed Talmud set a new standards

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.190
for the Jewish tradition and
modified it in an essential way.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.830
The study of the Talmud in its
new version, the printed model,

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.860
gave almost every interested
person the opportunity

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.660
to encounter it independently
and study it without a mediator.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.760
Beyond that, since then, there
has been much easy access

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.310
to different bodies of information

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.420
that is a [inaudible],
commentaries and so on.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.400
That accompany the Talmud's main
text, making the need to travel

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:18.740
to study with learned devotees or
see scarce manuscripts obsolete

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.410
for most readers and users
of the printed Talmud.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:29.750 position:56%
Through the act of printing the
main text lost considerable quantity

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.120
of entrancing variations.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.520
Subsequently, parts of text that
did not confirm the commentaries

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.450
of [inaudible] and the following
[inaudible] were neglected

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.810
and eventually vanished.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.380
Further phenomenal losses
of Talmud text were those

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.630
of the traditional circulating

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.360
in the Iberian Peninsula during the
expulsion of the Jews from Spain

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:02.560
and subsequently Portugal
from 1492 to 1496.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:09.110
Most of the manuscripts, as well
as printed treaties form these area

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.690
and region did not survive.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.470
The [inaudible] tradition
of studying the Talmud,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.150 position:56%
particularly in its printed version,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.470
came to us in a diminished,
incomplete form.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.050
The first generation of printers
and their printed efforts,

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.160
scarcely proceeded
beyond their own lifetime.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.390
Members of the Sandino [assumed
spelling] family succeeded

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.000
with a printing during
the 16th century.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.020
Two descendants succeeded
even longer.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.500
But it was a Christian
mention from [inaudible]

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.570
that through enormous
investments in money and manpower,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.370
managed to publish in
Venice more than 250 titles

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.900
of books printed with
Hebrews letters.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.360
Among others the publications
included the [inaudible] and both

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.310
of the Talmud from more
consecutive editions.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:14.340
To start with a cliché that Talmud
is referred to us as an ocean

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.910
because of its monumental
volume and the immense numbers

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.130
of themes mentioned and
discussed among other things.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.210
Let us have a look at
the means that grant

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.550
that ocean its form
and lay its boundaries.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.850
The text next stage

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.540
of our consideration
concerns the outer form

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:41.220
of the double spread of the Talmud.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.580
Okay. This is what
was mentioned before.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.750
This is the famous -- most famous
complete manuscript of the Talmud,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.880
a Babylonian Talmud called, "Cod.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.970
Hebr." 95, which was
written in France, 1342.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.210
In systemizing the whole text,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.850
students of the Talmud could
study the text more easily

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.970
and profoundly then they ever
could in its handwritten version.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.100
As long as the Talmud was
handwritten, the different parts

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.590
of its contents, the [speaking
foreign language] were not always

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.320
set clearly apart.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.170
Nor were there always written
separately from other text,

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.900
let alone written on
the same surface.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.600
The fact that those texts were
sometimes interweaved has to do

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.030 position:56%
with those who read or prepared the
manuscripts already being acquainted

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.140
with the full length text and
therefore preparing the new version

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.750
to function as a commemoration.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:05.110
Another development one may
find in the later 12th century

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.680
in the same three European centers
of printing, was manuscripts

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.010
or so called multi-layered books

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:18.120
that gifted craftsmen created
using varying page layouts

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.860
in different forms of
diverse text clusters.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.310
Let us have a short look at it.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:29.650
Here you see a manuscript which
was written in Segovia, Spain,

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.510
containing the -- one of
the books of the Bible.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:41.930
And you can see that the copies
played with various layers of text

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.210
of commentaries and so on.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.800
They are not functional,
these layers,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.530
but you can see it
was a known tradition.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.970
Another sample coming from Vienna.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.920
Since the 13th century,
the catholic respondents

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.950
in Italy have used a
multi-layered double spread design

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.960
for printing the [inaudible]
of the church log.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:24.750 position:56%
Here you have one of the famous --
oh, I'm sorry, it's got a bit lower.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:31.380
It's a very known manuscript
of the catholic law,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:37.980
which gives you an impression how
catholic law texts were written

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.920
down in the 14th century.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.690
A similar multi-layered design of
the printed page was later used

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.080
in Spain to print the
complutense polyglot bible.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.420
Here you have it.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:03.320
It was printed 3 years -- in 3
years and you may see the -- yeah.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:14.340
Hebrew, Latin, you have it
here, the Aramaic translation.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.840
There was some of the conditions
before the first printed --

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.190
these were the conditions
before the printed --

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.840
the first printed Talmud treaties.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.720
The first attempts to print
the Talmud treaties tried

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.330
to structure the reading surface.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.910
This effort is neither new,

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.160
nor appears primarily
in the Jewish tradition.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.290
It is rather one of the intrinsic
qualities of printing text.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:52.460 position:56%
The appearance of fully functional
multi-text themes is in Jewish text,

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:58.120
like the Talmud, or the Bible,
the lord is a genuine innovation.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.990
Here one can read the main
text, on the same page,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.650
compare it with other
text in the old tense,

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.130
thus commemorating
the oral tradition

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.400
in which the Talmud was
brought up and evolved.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.520
The printed Talmud is
a cultural phenomenon,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.150
it's one of the rarest
idiosyncrasies.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.790
Its main textural components
are still unconsolidated,

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.210
whereas its format, the layout,
even the exact positioning

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.340
of the wording are already fixed.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.560
This is a page of the Sandino
[assumed spelling] it is believed

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.000
to be the first dated
treaty of the Talmud,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.530
a treaty [inaudible] was
printed in Sandino 1484

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.160
and then again in Bomberg.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.970
And this is our June,
the Bomberg printing.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:08.320
The Sandino's were the first to
use the known [inaudible] layout

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.830
of the double spread, called the
Talmud, but various obstacles,

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:19.910 position:56%
above all finances, hindered them
from fulfilling their father's wish,

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.850
mainly printing the whole Talmud.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:27.120 position:56%
The treaty, [inaudible], regarding
the menstruating woman is considered

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.410
the first dated Talmud treaties.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:35.380
It was first printed 1484 in
Sandino and for the second time

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:45.640
and for the second time in 1509 in
[inaudible] served as the prototype

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.220
for the later Bomberg Talmud.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:54.350
Daniel Bomberg a cloth and art
merchant was a religious Calvinist,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.130
who was sent by his
family to Antwerp

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.750
to in Antwerp to Venice in 1516.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:06.300
His friend, the appestat Felix
[inaudible] taught him Hebrew

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.780
and advised him to open a
printing shop for books in Hebrew.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.340 position:56%
Bomberg did not hesitate to invest
immense sums of money and man power,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.920
previously unknown in
the Jewish world and open

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.870
in Venice a big printing shop that
functioned as an editorial office

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.390
for his future publishing plan.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.610
In this shop he employed dozens
of Jewish scholars from all

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.800
over North Africa,
Germany, France and Italy,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.190
who otherwise were not alone
to stay in the lagoon city.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.030
Two or maybe three of them
converted to Christianity.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.790
Nevertheless, after four editions
of the Talmud and more than 20 --

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:56.370
250 titles, he abruptly left
Venice and returned Antwerp,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:02.520
leaving the printing shop to be
distributed among other printers.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.940
Mark Antonia Degala
[phonetic spelling],

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.760
Mark Antonio Justinyani [phonetic
spelling], and [inaudible].

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:16.610
Although, his editions consisted of
presumably 500 to 1500 copies each.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:22.690
His publishing activities could not
be considered a financial success.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.880
Yet, in the Jewish tradition,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.600
he's praised as a great
minister of the Jews.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.550
Therefore, our family,
this is the copy

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:38.750
that the estate library
in Bavaria has.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:45.780
It's a complete set and it's
in a very fresh situation.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:52.120
This is the so called
Gustiononi copy.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:03.860
And this is [inaudible],
it is the best copy

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.690
that was printed in this time.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.800 position:56%
before our family printers active in
[inaudible] and later in Amsterdam,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.230
Pisa, Venice and Torino,
printed in 1553

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.980
in Sabbionetta [assumed
spelling] in an enhanced edition

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.490
of the Talmud treaties, which is
called [speaking foreign language]

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.430
or marriage ceremony.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:27.050
Edited by the renown
scholar Joshua [inaudible].

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:32.210
With a Cornelio Adelton [assumed
spelling] that worked before

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.850
with Bomberg as the head
of the printing shop.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.420
Unfortunately, no further treaties

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.040
of that kind was printed
in Sabbionetta.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.980
Daniel Bomberg significant
achievements is the printing

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:51.650
of the Talmud, which later
became the text [inaudible].

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:57.990
It was produced in four
consecutive editions.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:04.560
Only the first was complete edition
containing 44 message thought

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.860
or treaties.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.750
The other three were as follows.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:13.800
The second was contained
only 40 treaties.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.770
The third eight.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.860
And the fourth 33.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.130
The wonderful letters in
[inaudible] style were cut

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.330
by the famous letter cutter Geome
Lebardafirst [assumed spelling].

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:29.020
Some of his original
punches are kept nowadays

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.290
in the Plantin-Moretus
Museum in Antwerp.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:38.920
The year 1520 when the Bomberg
Talmud was first printed could be

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.520
seen as the amoos meelabilous
[phonetic spelling]

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.540
for in this year not only the
[speaking foreign language]

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.300
of Prague, [speaking
foreign language] was born,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:54.480
but also this my [inaudible]
Talmud edition made its appearance.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.860 position:56%
10 years later another important
student of Jewish knowledge was born

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.380
in Prague and namely
[speaking foreign language].

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.760
Who substituted for
[inaudible] in Prague.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:14.850
He would later consider the
publishing of the printed Talmud,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.690
[inaudible], which is
called "The Set Table,"

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.860
compiled Roberreso Caro
[assumed spelling],

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.210
a trend of leaving the old
tradition of learning overly

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.130
and studying out of books.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.570
Later he would gain his own renown

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.090
and compose his famous [speaking
foreign language] meaning "Garments

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.340
of the Kingdom" to assist
those who will still depend

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.250
on old Ashkenoshic [assumed
spelling] tradition.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:46.590 position:56%
This new way of printing the Talmud
was not accepted without opposition.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.460
Centuries later there are
still printing, Ashkenosic

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.100
and Sephotic [assumed
spelling] alike,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.660
who object to the Bomberg layout.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.030
Nevertheless, they will indicate

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.340
in their Talmud editions
their parallel passage

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.630
in the Bomberg edition, which
has already become the standard.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.270 position:56%
Over the course of the 17th century,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.510
all the Talmud edition adopted
the Bomberg double spread style

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:16.900
and that was eventually
the multifaceted situation

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.200 position:56%
that was known to be to [inaudible]
scholar [speaking foreign language],

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.970
when he prepared the last
monumental Talmud enterprise

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.960
in recent centuries.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.090
The Rome, or better
known as [inaudible].

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.960
Let us have a few pictures to see.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.590
This is the [inaudible]
edition of the Talmud,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.880
made in Basil by Ambrosio Froben.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.420
But the men behind it, [inaudible]
came from Italy and brought

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:58.200
with him letters and then you
-- and new stanza edition.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.840
This Basil edition, which is
known as the Stanza edition,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.560
was printed many editions
through Europe.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:17.270
Here we come to the [inaudible]
tradition and you can see

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.340
from the outside that
this is another tradition

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.620
that we do not know so much.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.290
The letters look much
other than we had before.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:37.810
And as you can see here in the
[inaudible], these are editions

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.670
that were made for
students, young students,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:47.340
so they can read the main
text in the main column

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.960
and older [inaudible],

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:57.660
older commentaries were
set in a shorter form.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:07.450
This is another version of the
Talmud that was made in Poland.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:17.070
It used a very small letter in
order to let the original text

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.280
of Bomberg inside, but
nevertheless it didn't manage

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.900
to have the whole commentaries
behind.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.900
We will see it in the room later.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:38.750
It's a very moving story about
this Talmud that was printed

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:47.600 position:56%
in 15 copies, 500 of them were
given to poor students of the Talmud

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.240
in order that they could read the
Talmud and study it in their homes

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.970
without having to pay for this.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:32:03.120
This is another edition for
students, for young students

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:10.290
in order to read the
Talmud in its basic version.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:20.120
And here we come to the modern
era, where the known letter code,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.090
Amsterdam, makes its
appearance, which --

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.150
of which we have to our days.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:33.690
This is what happened
as the late emperor

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:42.920
of Habsburg didn't let
printed books from other places

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.320
in Europe come inside his reign.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:55.030
Christian printers started to
print the Talmud with letters

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:59.340
that they could buy in
Amsterdam and other places.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.880
One of them was [inaudible].

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.750
A very nice example.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:10.630
And this is the last, as I said
before, the last enterprise

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.730
that was done printing
the Talmud Villa,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:19.390
which is the new Bomber, so to say.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:26.000
I would like you now to come with
me to the room and have a look

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.420
at the volumes that we have.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.280
And, yes.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.480
&gt;&gt;Ann Brener: Okay, on behalf
of the Hebraic Section I'd

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.510
like to thank Dr. Tamari
for a wonderful talk.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:42.130
[ Applause ]

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.530
And we do want to invite you back.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.290
I hope everyone has a checklist.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.600
As you will see our display
is divided into five groups.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.310
Each group is open up to the same
page, but in different editions.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.840
Now, usually when we have a
display I'll let you all walk

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.570
around in peace and quiet
and enjoy everything.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:07.390
This time I suggest that we treat
this as a master class and --

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.650
because this is such a wonderful
opportunity to have such a scholar,

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.190
to walk around with us and to
point out to us the differences

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.790
in the different editions.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:22.040 position:56%
So, again, warmest thanks to Dr.
Tamari and please use the side doors

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.490
and come on into the display room.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:26.750
Thank you.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.410
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
