00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
 
so my work and the work of my colleagues

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090
so my work and the work of my colleagues
 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.510
so my work and the work of my colleagues
for this prize is about trying to see

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520
for this prize is about trying to see
 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.030
for this prize is about trying to see
small things so particularly living

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
small things so particularly living
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.940
small things so particularly living
things and cells so your body is

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
things and cells so your body is
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.009
things and cells so your body is
composed of cells and the cells

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
composed of cells and the cells
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.770
composed of cells and the cells
themselves are composed of molecules and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
themselves are composed of molecules and
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.160
themselves are composed of molecules and
in particular proteins come together to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
in particular proteins come together to
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529
in particular proteins come together to
create the life inside of cells and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
create the life inside of cells and
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080
create the life inside of cells and
there's about 10,000 different kinds of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
there's about 10,000 different kinds of
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120
there's about 10,000 different kinds of
proteins but they're about a hundred

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
proteins but they're about a hundred
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.849
proteins but they're about a hundred
times smaller than old microscopes could

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
times smaller than old microscopes could
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.759
times smaller than old microscopes could
look at so the microscope we developed

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
look at so the microscope we developed
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650
look at so the microscope we developed
is a microscope to allow you to see much

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
is a microscope to allow you to see much
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290
is a microscope to allow you to see much
closer to the level of the individual

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
closer to the level of the individual
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.370
closer to the level of the individual
molecules that make up single cells
