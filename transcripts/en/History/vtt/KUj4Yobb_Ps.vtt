00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:06.673
NARRATOR: Thousand Oaks,
California, May 2017.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.801
Ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.096
visits the Ventura
BioCenter to examine

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.890
one of Earth's most
curious creatures,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.809
the Bombardier beetle.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.104
This little bug is a
marvel of evolution,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:25.734
or some say, intelligent design.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.651
Peter, good to see you.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.527
Giorgio nice to see you.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.945
And this is Tom.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.238
Hello, Tom.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:30.947
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.115
How's it going.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.408
Tom is our insect
wrangler who's

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.160
going to help us set
up a demonstration

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.371
on one of the coolest animals
on Earth, the Bombardier beetle.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.082
That's fantastic
because about a year ago,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.084
Erich von Daniken
gave me his latest

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.754
manuscript for his newest book.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.090
And we all know that there are
these multiple creatures that

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.135
seem to defy
Darwinian evolution.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.471
And one creature that
jumped out at me,

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:58.266
that I hadn't heard before,
was this beetle right here.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.769
This beetle is fascinating
from an evolutionary point

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.061
of view.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.521
In fact, it's been
used by many people

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.648
to suggest that evolution
doesn't work at all.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:09.027
And the reason is the enormous
complexity of this thing.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.321
This animal is a
chemical warrior.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.324
It's able to shoot out
boiling hot streams

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.868
of a really toxic liquid
that have the same sort

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.369
of mix as rocket fuel.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.038
That's amazing.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.332
And it could shoot over 500
of these bursts per second.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.583
Wow.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.168
But the process
happens so fast, it's

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.836
almost in a blink of an eye.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.172
So we have a high speed camera
over here that could shoot

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.090
about 2,500 frames per second.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.385
And with that camera, we
can slow down this process.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.888
And then seeing that
process, we can work out

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.723
the exact sequence of events.

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:42.143
So let's set this up with Tom
and watch this take place.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.728
- Let's do it.
- OK, guys.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:46.523
So what I've got is some
nontoxic, very mild adhesive.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.483
And I'm just going to touch
it to the beetle's back.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.318
And that will suspend
him in the air.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.111
We're going to give him a
little bit of stimulation

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.780
with these forceps.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.491
It simulates the predator
and makes him feel defensive.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.914
Oops, there it was.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.462
NARRATOR: While it is almost
imperceptible to the naked eye,

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.798
with the high speed
camera, the beetle

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.259
can be seen blasting
rapid fire streams

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.555
of deadly chemicals, directed
at any would-be predator.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.597
Oh, wow.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:20.974
- There it goes.
- How cool.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.101
It project it in that
particular direction.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.978
Right.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:29.649
You can actually see the
squirts, the mist, the vapor.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.902
The appendage which allows
this to happen can rotate.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.445
It can move back and forth.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.323
So it can shoot this in lots
of different directions.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.576
Yeah, this is really awesome.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.996
NARRATOR: Dr. Ward has set
up a computer generated model

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.082
of the Bombardier
beetle to show Giorgio

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:51.546
the incredible process that is
taking place inside its body.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.173
You've got the organs
that produce the chemicals.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.343
And two separate
chemicals are being made.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.429
We've got this
hydroquinone, which

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.223
is actually a makeup of the
organics of the creature.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:03.975
It's part of its
external skeleton.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.852
The second one is a
chemical called hydrogen

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.104
peroxide, which is rocket fuel.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.064
Now, if we combine
these two together

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.902
in a chamber, what we can do
is build this chemical material

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.029
that's going to get
really hot and blast

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.780
out the back of the bug.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.782
So one of the coolest things
about this whole system,

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.451
it's got a one-way valve.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.330
Once this chemical concoction
that's getting really hot

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.790
starts reacting, the
last thing you want

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.585
is having it blast back into
the interior of your body.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.378
So it can direct it.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:36.966
It squirts out this super
hot, super toxic material

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.551
into that predator's face.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.012
And one has to
wonder, what was

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:45.141
the evolutionary process of
this beetle for that defense

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.353
mechanism to even exist?

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.979
Yeah, that's the
critical question.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.899
If evolution takes
place in step by step,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.317
what's the intermediate?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.027
How does this thing not
blow itself up as it's

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.488
experimenting through time?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.740
And how do you go
from just a garden

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.451
variety beetle to a
super beetle like this?

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.079
Mm-hmm.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.500
One has to wonder if this
creature, perhaps, was brought

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.545
here in its finished
form, or at least

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.090
the genetic material
for this creature

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.551
came here as a finished product.

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.304
NARRATOR: Could the physiology
of the Bombardier beetle

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:26.432
be proof that there are
animals on this planet

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.727
of extraterrestrial design?

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:33.856
The gases that the beetle emits
can burn the skin of humans.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.526
And if the mechanism it
holds within its body

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.195
was constructed
on a larger scale,

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:43.324
it could be a very
deadly chemical weapon.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.536
Is it possible that aliens
placed certain creatures

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.956
on this planet so that
humans can learn from them

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.250
and recreate their abilities?
