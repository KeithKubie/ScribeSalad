00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:03.041
- [Instructor] We're asked to
draw the line of reflection

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.329
that reflects triangle ABC,
so that's this blue triangle,

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:09.294
onto triangle A prime B prime C prime,

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:11.260
which is this red
triangle right over here.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.151
And they give us a
little line drawing tool

00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:16.558
in order to draw the line of reflection.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.605
So the way I'm gonna think about it is

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.835
well, when I just eyeball it,

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.700
it looks like I'm just flipped over

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.133
some type of a horizontal line here.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.289
But let's see if we can actually construct

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.984
a horizontal line where
it does actually look

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:29.833
like the line of reflection.

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.468
So let's see, C and C prime,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.327
how far apart are they from each other?

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:37.494
So if we go one, two,
three, four, five, six down.

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:40.062
So they are six apart.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:43.954
So let's see if we just put
this three above C prime

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.862
and three below C, let's see
if this horizontal line works

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:49.581
as a line of reflection.

00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:53.086
So C, or C prime is
definitely the reflection

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.633
of C across this line.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:57.943
C is exactly three units above it,

00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:00.645
and C prime is exactly
three units below it.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.518
Let's see if it works for A and A prime.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:06.815
A is one, two, three,
four, five units above it.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:11.787
A prime is one, two, three,
four, five units below it.

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.056
So that's looking good.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:14.697
Now let's just check out B.

00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:18.166
So B, we can see it's at the
y-coordinate here is seven.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.836
This line right over here
is y is equal to one.

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.510
And so what we would
have here is, let's see,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.458
this looks like it's six
units above this line,

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.105
and B prime is six units below the line.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:31.209
So this indeed works.

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.775
We've just constructed
the line of reflection

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:36.370
that reflects the blue
triangle, triangle ABC,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.537
onto triangle A prime B prime C prime.
