00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:02.485
- [Voiceover] So we have
here the square root,

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.917
the principal root, of one two-hundredth.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:06.984
And what I want to do is simplify this.

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:09.485
When I say "simplify it" I really mean,

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:10.986
if there's any perfect squares here that

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:15.986
I can factor out to take it
out from under the radical.

00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:17.318
And so I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.884
and see if you can do that.

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:21.351
Alright so there's a couple of ways that

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.351
you could approach this.

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.924
One way is to say, Well this is going to

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.551
be the same thing as the square root of

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.284
one over the square root of 200.

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:32.517
The square root of one is just one

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:36.151
over the square root of 200.

00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.451
And there's a couple of ways to try to

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:39.851
simplify the square root of 200.

00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.685
I'll do it a couple of ways here.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.617
Square root of 200.

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.351
You could realize that, OK, look

00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.484
100 is a perfect square.

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.051
And it goes into 200.

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:53.953
So this is the same
thing as two times 100.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.851
And so the square root of
200 is the square root of

00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:01.717
two times 100, which is the same thing as

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:06.384
the square root of two times
the square root of 100.

00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:09.451
And we know that the
square root of 100 is 10.

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.352
So it's the square root of two times 10

00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:14.585
or we could write this as
10 square roots of two.

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:15.984
That's one way to approach it.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:18.018
But if it didn't jump out
at you immediately that

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:21.784
you have this large perfect
square that is a factor of 200,

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:24.084
you could just start with small numbers.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.460
You could say, alright, let me do this

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550
alternate method in a different color.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.485
You could say, ah it's the same color that

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:31.885
I've been doing before.

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:36.518
(laughing) You could say that
the square root of 200, say

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:38.284
Well it's divisible by two.

00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:40.685
So it's two times 100.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.285
And if 100 didn't jump out
at you as a perfect square,

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:46.784
you could say, Well that's
just going to be two times 50.

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:48.251
Well I can still divide two into that.

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.951
That's two times 25.

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.884
Let's see, and 25, if
that doesn't jump out at

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:56.388
you as a perfect square,
you could say that

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.584
that's not divisible by
two, not divisible by three,

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:01.051
four, but it is divisible by five.

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.351
That is five times five.

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.851
And to identify the perfect
squares you would say,

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.151
Alright, are there any factors where

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.918
I have at least two of them?

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.651
Well I have two times two here.

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:18.651
And I also have five times five here.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:21.118
So I can rewrite the square root of 200 as

00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:23.918
being equal to the square root of

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:27.917
two times two.

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:31.684
Let me just write it all out.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.451
Actually I think I'm
going to run out of space.

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.284
So the square root, give
myself more space under

00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:39.784
the radical, square root of

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:44.018
two times two times five times

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:49.018
five times two.

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:51.984
And I wrote it in this order so

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:54.151
you can see the perfect squares here.

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.351
Well this is going to
be the same thing as the

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:58.418
square root of two times two.

00:02:58.418 --> 00:03:01.518
This second method is a
little bit more monotonous,

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:05.434
but hopefully you see that it works,

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:06.917
(laughing) I guess is one
way to think about it.

00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:09.384
And they really, they boil
down to the same method.

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.051
We're still going to
get to the same answer.

00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.285
So square root of two times
two times the square root

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:19.417
times the square root of five times five,

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:27.687
times the square root of two.

00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:30.385
Well the square root of two
times two is just going to be,

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:31.584
this is just two.

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:33.051
Square root of five times five,

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:35.784
well that's just going to be five.

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:38.417
So you have two times five
times the square root of two,

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:43.417
which is 10 times the square root of two.

00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:46.017
So this right over here,
square root of 200,

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.485
we can rewrite as 10 square roots of two.

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:52.151
So this is going to be equal to one

00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.417
over 10 square roots of two.

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:58.384
Now some people don't like having a

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:00.384
radical in the denominator
and if you wanted to

00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:02.251
get rid of that, you could multiply both

00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:05.451
the numerator and the denominator
by the square root of two.

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:07.217
'Cause notice we're
just multiplying by one,

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:08.264
we're expressing one as square root of

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:09.684
two over square root of two,

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:10.983
and then what that does is

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.351
we rewrite this as the
square root of two over

00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:14.617
10 times the square root of two times

00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:15.551
the square root of two.

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.351
Well the square root of two
times the square root of two

00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:18.985
is just going to be two.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:21.784
So it's going to be 10
times two which is 20.

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:26.024
So it could also be written like that.

00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:29.451
So hopefully you found that helpful.

00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:31.085
In fact, even this one, you
could write if you want to

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.452
visualize it slightly differently,

00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:34.218
you could view it as one twentieth

00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:36.018
times the square root of two.

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:40.079
So these are all the same thing.
