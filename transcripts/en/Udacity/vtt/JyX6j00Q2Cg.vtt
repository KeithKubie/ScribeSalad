00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:02.810
Okay, so let's familiarize ourselves with this dataset a little bit

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.770
more, and what I really mean here is let's get a little

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.210
bit better understanding of the OpenStreetMap project itself and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.830
get started learning what we need to know in order to do

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.350
this particular case study. Okay, so I'm actually going to go

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.140
ahead and submit a search for Chicago to OpenStreetMap and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.430
you'll see that I get a number of different results here.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.220
The one I'm interested in is this one, the city boundary of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, United States of America. Doing this is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.750
essentially going to select from the OpenStreetMap data set,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.670
just that data that has to do with the city of

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.690
Chicago. So I'm going to click through to this and you can

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.550
see the outline here that identifies the city boundary. And so,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.510
the data that I would be working with is anything that falls

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.300
in here. So now if I click export, what's going to happen

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.190
is that I'll see the latitude longitude and it's going to tell me,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.590
this is too large to be exported. Okay but

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.800
then, if I scroll down, I can see that there

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.700
are actually already prepared extracts from this data set. Okay,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.210
so let me make this a little bit bigger. Now

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.390
what this is, is pre-prepared extracts from this particular

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.290
data set and these are extracts for major metropolitan areas.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.510
So, you can see I've actually clicked on Chicago link

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.771
before. I'm going to go ahead and click on that and

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.570
then here I have an opportunity to download a zipped up version of this OSM data

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.810
as XML. So I click on that and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.450
it begins downloading. And once it's done downloading, then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.700
we can go ahead and take a look at it. Alright, this data is downloaded, I

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.420
am going to take a look at it.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.850
It's in my downloads directory. I've already unzipped it,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340
and here it is. Lots and lots and lots of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.160
XML data. This should look somewhat familiar to you. We've seen

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.750
these note tags before and we've actually extracted a little data

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.590
from this data set previously. Okay, I'm going to use the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.100
shell command LS, see what the size of this dataset is.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.340
You can see here that it's about 1.8 gigabytes. So, this

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.130
is a huge dataset. What this means is that in order

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.160
to process this data, we can't really read it into memory.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.430
And so as you'll see a little bit later on, we're going to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.130
use an approach to parsing this that uses a SAX parser, which we did

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.930
look at a little bit in a previous lesson. Okay so now, what I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.350
usually do in a situation like this is I explore the data itself a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.600
little bit. I might even write a little code to parse out a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.580
little of what's here just so I can get a feel for it. The

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660
next thing then that we'll want to do is to read enough documentation to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.110
answer any questions that we have or at least enough to get us started.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.470
Okay so what I'm going to do here, then, is simply query for

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.010
OpenStreetMap documentation and I can see that there's actually a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.020
Wiki for OpenStreetMap. So if I click through to that,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.670
I land on the Wiki page which gives me quite a bit

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.480
of information about OpenStreetMap. Now I'm going to make this ridiculously

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.020
big so that you can see it on your screen. And if

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.350
we scroll down, you can see there's a lot to read here.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.430
So you can see there's a beginners guide, information for developers, and other

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.320
pieces of information - map features, that sort of thing.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.990
I know from having looked at this page before that there's

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.720
actually documentation on the XML format which is going to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.710
be useful to us as we move forward. This provides an

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.730
example of the different sorts of tags that you're going to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.730
see in this data set and a little bit of an

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.390
explanation about it. For example, we can see from this documentation

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.980
that this data is essentially instances of 3 different data primitives.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.590
Data primitives being nodes, ways, and relations and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.560
if we click through to any one of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.640
these, we'll get a little bit more information

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.960
about them, okay? So I encourage you to take

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.040
a look at this documentation for yourself. Make

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.020
sure you understand nodes, ways and relations and

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.640
you'll be in good shape to more on. Just do a little bit of reading for now.
