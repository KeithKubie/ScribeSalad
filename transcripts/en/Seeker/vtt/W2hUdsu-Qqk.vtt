OLYMPICS OLYMPICS OLYMPICS OLYMPICS. Everybody's
talking about it. Or maybe I'm just talking

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about it a lot lately, but what about those
medals guys? Are they real gold or what?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
[Music]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.940
Hey guys, Trace here for DNews! Have you ever
seen photos of people biting their olympic

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.070
medal? As if placing a piece of metal in your
mouth after finally achieving sports success

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.250
wasn't weird enough; there's actually a lot
more you're not seeing.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.190
Firstly, the actual BITE is an old practice
of collectors, testing the softness of gold

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.440
by biting it. The Mohs hardness scale measures
how HARD a mineral is. Enamel on your

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.670
teeth, for example, scores a5... but PURE
gold scores only a 2.5, so your tooth would

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.629
be able to scratch or dent pure gold.
Silver is around 2.7, so you should be able

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.019
to scratch that too, but the point is -- CHECK
OUT HOW PURE THIS SHIZ!

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.229
The thing is, Olympic medals are a pretty
new tradition. The ancient Greeks placed a

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.149
wreath of olive branches on the head of the
winner.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.969
When the Olympics were revived in 1896, the
winners of the first Athens Olympics all received

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.189
silver medals, not because they were cheap,
precisely the opposite.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.259
Silver was MORE precious than gold at the
time. First place got silver and second got

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.390
copper.
During the 1900 Paris Olympics the medals

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.850
were rectangular, and in St. Louis in 1904
the first gold medals were awarded! It wasn't

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.439
until London's 1908 medals that gold was awarded
for first, silver second, and bronze for third

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.920
place. The thing is... the last actual SOLID
GOLD medal was awarded in 1912 in Stockholm.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.119
The dirty secret of the Olympics is gold medals
aren't really gold. Well, they are. Six grams

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.380
of gold. Six. That's like three pennies.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.450
The weight of the medals varies from one Olympics
to another, as does the size... the International

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.679
Olympic Committee requires -- for fairness
I guess? -- Gold and silver medals be made

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:55.079
of 92.5% silver, plated with at least 6 grams
of gold. Yep. You heard me right.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.450
The gold medals are almost all silver, the
bit that's not gold or silver is copper. Which

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.109
means, factoring in the six grams of gold,

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.749
the medals currently stand at 1.45-percent
gold, and 6-percent copper.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.220
The SILVER medals replaced the gold with...
surprise... more silver.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.410
Bronze is an alloy of tin and copper with
a touch of zinc added in. The reason the cities

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.590
don't use gold anymore is it's frickin' expensive!
The cities have to BUY the metal to make these

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.920
things.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.450
For the London Olympic games in 2012, the
medals weighed 412 grams -- for comparison,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.450
a can of coke weighs 373 grams.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.110
The new Sochi medals will be between 460 and
531 grams depending. So... they might have

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.890
as little as 1.13-percent gold.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.690
Salt Lake City's medals were tiny and light,
whereas London's were heavy. But regardless,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.220
they are ALL ceremonial, they're not going
to balance your budget with the precious ingredients.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.480
If London's were allllll Gold the medals alone
would have cost 40-million dollars.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.140
If you sold the gold medal for scrap, you'd
get about 708 buckazoids, but by contrast...

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.900
the Bronze medal is worth less than five.
dollars. Yay, third place is still good!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.290
To satisfy the curious, medals DO come
up for auction once in a while. A gold medal

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.320
from one of the members of the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.040
"Miracle on Ice" team at the 1980 Lake Placid
Olympics went for over $310,000 four years

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.290
ago.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.680
Long story short, it's not about their monetary
worth - it's about the glory.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.650
Many of the athletes spend years of training
and blood and sweat to have that thing slung

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.040
around their neck.
Does it bug you that the medals aren't what

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.480
you think they are? Should we go back to olive
branches? Tell us what you think below the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.350
video and thanks for watching, and happy Olympics
to you!
