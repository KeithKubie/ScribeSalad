00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.467
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:04.064
is think about "How does the circumference

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:06.073
"and how does the area of a circle change

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.452
"as we change its radius?"

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:08.882
And, in particular, we'll focus on

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:11.067
what happens when we double its radius.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.437
Let's think about a
circle right over here.

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:15.633
So, this is a circle.

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:19.425
And let's say its radius is X units.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:20.464
Whatever our units is.

00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:23.122
This distance right over here is X.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.120
And then let's think about another circle

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.641
that has twice the radius.

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.700
Its radius will be two X.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:30.274
Let me draw its radius first

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:33.300
so it looks roughly accurate.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.866
This is two X is this circle's radius.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.614
And so this circle might
look something like that.

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:43.715
That's my best attempt at
freehand drawing a circle.

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.169
Let's just think about

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:47.160
what the circumference
of both of these are,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.804
and what the areas of both of these are.

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:52.071
The circumference of any circle

00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.079
is two pi times the radius.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.057
So, in this case, the circumference,

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.456
and I'll use C for circumference,

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:01.093
is equal to two pi times the radius.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.734
Which, in this case, is X.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.659
What's the circumference here?

00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:07.390
Once again, the circumference is equal

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.886
to two pi times the radius,

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:13.032
but this time the radius is two X.

00:01:13.032 --> 00:01:14.509
So, the circumference is equal to

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.454
two times pi times two times X,

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:17.292
which is the same thing as

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.910
two times two times pi times X,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.300
or we could write it as four pi X.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.353
We see here that this circumference

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.736
is twice as large as this one.

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:30.137
To go from two pi X, to four pi X,

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:34.456
you have to multiply by two.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:35.350
You double the radius,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.312
it doubled the circumference.

00:01:37.312 --> 00:01:39.030
What about the area?

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.100
And I'll do area in a new color.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:45.334
We already know that area
is equal to pi R squared.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.236
In this circle the radius is of length X.

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:50.803
It's pi times X squared.

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:52.869
In this circle, right over here,

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.649
the area is going to be equal to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.026
pi times the radius squared,

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.529
but now the radius is two X.

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:00.906
Two X squared.

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:02.743
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:04.902
Our area is equal to pi.

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:07.078
Two X squared is two X times two X,

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:10.074
which is the same thing as four X squared.

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:11.734
Four X squared.

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:13.769
Or, we could rewrite this as

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.769
area is equal to four pi X squared.

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.025
Notice, now the area has increased

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.860
not by a factor of two.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.830
The area has increased

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.830
by a factor of four when
we doubled the radius.

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:31.168
Why did this happen?

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:32.354
I encourage you to pause the video

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:33.734
and think about it.

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:36.067
It comes straight out the formulas

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:37.837
for circumference and area.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:42.704
Remember, circumference
is equal to two pi R,

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.333
while area...

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.640
Let me do this in a different color.

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.713
While area is equal

00:02:52.713 --> 00:02:55.500
to pi R squared.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.512
You see here, area is proportional

00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.267
to the square of the radius.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:01.359
If you double this,

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.498
you're gonna increase your
area by a factor of four.

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:05.554
If you triple it, if
you triple your radius,

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.627
you're gonna increase your
area by a factor of nine.

00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:09.961
If you increase radius
by a factor of four,

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.244
you're gonna increase your area

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:14.800
by a factor of four squared, or 16.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.795
While, circumference,

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.960
whatever factor you increase
you increase your radius,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.166
the circumference is going to
increase by that same factor.

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:23.022
And if you don't believe me,

00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:24.426
I mean, we essentially
showed it right here

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:25.657
through a little bit of algebra,

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:26.625
but you could try it out

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.305
with as many numbers as you see fit.
