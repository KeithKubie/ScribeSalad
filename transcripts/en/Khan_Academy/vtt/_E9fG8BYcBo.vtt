00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:02.570
So let's think about all
of the different ways

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.105
that we can represent 7/9.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.130
So let's just visualize 7/9.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.280
So here I have 9 equal sections.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.820
And 7/9 you could represent
as 7 of those equal sections.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.710
So let me get myself a
bigger thing to draw with,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.237
so that I can fill this in fast.

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:26.820
Actually, I don't
like how that looks.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.520
I'm going to use
the paint brush.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.530
So here we go.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:39.020
So that's 1, 2, 3,
4-- you know where

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.470
this is going-- 5, 6, and 7.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.366
So that's one way
of representing 7/9.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.240
We already know that.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.364
That's not too interesting.

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.150
But let's see if we
can represent 7/9

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.290
as the sum of other fractions.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.350
So let's imagine maybe
we can represent it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.040
as-- let's do it as 2/9.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.470
Let me use a
different brush here.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.285
So let's represent it as 2/9.

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:18.350
2/9 plus-- I don't know,
let's see, maybe 3/9.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.140
But that doesn't quite
get us to 7/9 yet.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.960
2/9 plus 3/9 is going
to get us to 5/9.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.210
So we're going to need 2 more.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.140
So it's going to be
plus another 2/9.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.270
So what would this look like?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.964
So let's just draw
another grid here.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:42.630
So this is going to
look like-- and I'll

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.254
try to do it right
below it, so that we

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:46.940
can see how they match up.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.000
So we have 2/9, this
2/9 right over here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Well, we have each
of these as a ninth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.270
We have 9 equal sections.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.880
So we're going to get 1 and 2.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.110
And then we're going
to add 3 more ninths.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.100
So 1, 2, 3.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.380
So we add 3/9 right over
there and then 2 more ninths,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.300
1 and 2.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.249
So notice, when I added 2/9 to
3/9 to 2/9, this equals 7/9.

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.290
And we know that when we
add a bunch of fractions

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.181
like this that have
the same denominator,

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:36.430
we can just add the numerator.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.100
And this is why.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.694
This is 2/9 plus 3/9 times
2/9 is going to give me 7/9.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.860
Let's do this one more time.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.600
This is actually a lot of fun.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.065
So let me draw my grid again.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
And then let's see
what we can do.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.430
So let me get my pen tool out.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.420
Let me make sure my
ink isn't too thick.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.600
Well, this is fine.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.360
And let's add a
couple of ninths here.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.700
So let's add first 1/9.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.810
And I'm going to draw
out all the 9's in blue.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.980
And let's add 2/9.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.915
And then we could add-- I don't
know, maybe we could add-- let

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.050
me give some space here
so we can add more.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.880
And maybe we could add 3/9.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.135
And then we could add, let's
see-- actually, let me just

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:26.760
write this out.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.980
I'm going to try to add
four fractions here.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.320
So let's say add first 1/9
and see where that gets us.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.640
So 1/9 is going to get
us right over here.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.740
So that's 1/9.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.940
So let's say we add 2/9 to that.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.990
I've got my little
paint brush going on.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.070
So that's 1 and 2 more, 2/9.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.540
So that still
doesn't get us there.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.310
This gives us a total of 3/9.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.370
1 plus 2 is 3-- 3/9.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.100
So let's add 4/9.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.780
And I'll do that
in this blue color.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.760
So 4/9.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.890
That's different enough.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.760
So let's see where this gets us.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200
Actually, well, why not?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.370
So 4/9.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:28.390
And so that's going
to get us 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.250
So that looks like it
got us all the way,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.057
because 1 plus 2 plus 4 is
going to give us 7-- 7/9.

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:35.140
So what could we put here?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.090
Well, we could say 0/9.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.290
Why not?

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.017
So we could call this
one right over here 0/9.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.350
And how would we visualize that?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.110
Well, we're saying
none of these.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.360
No ninths right over here.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.770
So this is 1/9 plus 2/9
plus 4/9 is equal to 7/9.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.840
So these are all different
ways to decompose

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.130
the exact same fraction.
