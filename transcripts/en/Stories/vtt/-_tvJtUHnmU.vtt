00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.420
NARRATOR: You can't
see it on the outside,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.540
but this old
industrial neighborhood

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.610
is an agricultural oasis.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.870
Inside this former
laser tag arena,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.930
about 250 kinds of leafy greens
are growing in huge quantities,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.140
to be sold to local
supermarkets and restaurants.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.980
This is AeroFarms, a massive
indoor vertical farm in Newark,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.700
New Jersey.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.800
DAVID ROSENBERG: Our mission
is to build farms in cities

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.840
all over the world
so people have access

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.270
to fresh, great tasting,
highly nutritious food.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.660
NARRATOR: Crops are stacked
more than 30 feet high

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
inside this 30,000
square foot space.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.335
They're grown using
aeroponic technology.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:43.210
DAVID ROSENBERG: Typically
in indoor growing,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.540
the roots sit in water and one
tries to oxygenate the water.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.650
Our key inventor realized
that if we mist nutrition

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.380
to the root structure,
then the roots

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.920
have a better oxygenation.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.860
NARRATOR: AeroFarms
says the root misting

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.330
system allows them to use 95%
less water than a regular field

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.180
farm.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.470
They also use no
pesticides or herbicides.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730
Instead of soil, plants are
grown in reusable cloth,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.370
made from recycled plastic.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.170
And instead of the sun,
there are rows and rows

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.974
of specialized LED lighting.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.890
DAVID ROSENBERG: A lot
of people say, sunless?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.010
Wait, plants need sun.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.460
In fact, the plants don't
need yellow spectrum,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240
so we're able to
reduce our energy

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.720
footprint by doing
things like reducing

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.100
certain types of spectrum.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.600
NARRATOR: This
sophisticated climate

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.360
controlled system cuts
the growing cycle in half,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.530
so crops can be
grown all year round,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.894
but with a much smaller
impact on the environment.

00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:40.310
DAVID ROSENBERG: There's all
these stresses on our planet.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.690
70% of our fresh
water contamination

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.660
comes from agriculture.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.870
70% of our fresh water
usage goes to agriculture.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.780
One third of our
arable land has been

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.920
degraded in the last 40 years.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.410
All these macro trends
point to the fact

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.780
that we need a new way
to feed our planet.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.150
NARRATOR: One of the early
champions of vertical farming

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.730
is Columbia University
ecologist Dickson Despommier.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.210
In 1999, Despommier
and his students

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.330
proposed that vertical farms
could feed overpopulated cities

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.490
while using less
land and less water.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.640
They would also cut
greenhouse gases

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.860
by eliminating the
need to transport food

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.330
over long distances.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.790
And the idea is
finally taking root.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.870
Over the past few
years, vertical farms

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.850
have sprouted all
over the world,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.430
including in Vancouver,
Singapore, Panama,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.740
the UK, and around the US.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.980
Here in Newark, AeroFarms is
building out another new farm

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.890
in a former steel
mill, one that's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.400
bigger than a football field.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.920
Once it's fully
operational, it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.660
expected to produce two
million pounds of greens

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.854
a year-- all grown vertically.

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:49.520
DAVID ROSENBERG: We
listen to the plants

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.410
very carefully to
try and understand

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.139
what they're telling
us and try and optimize

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.930
all these different
qualities of the plant.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.050
It's a tough business, but
it's one that's going to stay

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.370
and it's going to have a
bigger and bigger impact.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.953
NARRATOR: Do you think vertical
farms will help solve our food

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:04.810
production problems?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.720
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.430
And check out this
next episode to see

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.240
how this major US city is
striving to become zero waste.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.590
ROBERT REED: When I started
at Recology 23 years ago,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.540
the recycling rate
was around 38%.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.850
Today, we've more
than doubled that.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.130
NARRATOR: So far, San Francisco
has diverted 80% of its waste

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.540
away from landfills,
and its success has

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.530
been getting global attention.
