00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 align:start position:0%
is the problem that intellectuals have
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
is the problem that intellectuals have
are<00:00:30.990><c> quite</c><00:00:31.650><c> frequently</c><00:00:32.130><c> is</c><00:00:32.250><c> that</c><00:00:32.369><c> they</c><00:00:33.059><c> sort</c>

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 align:start position:0%
are quite frequently is that they sort
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
are quite frequently is that they sort
of<00:00:34.079><c> once</c><00:00:34.260><c> they</c><00:00:34.440><c> start</c><00:00:34.649><c> reading</c><00:00:34.800><c> difficult</c><00:00:35.610><c> and</c>

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
of once they start reading difficult and
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
of once they start reading difficult and
rewarding<00:00:36.120><c> stuff</c><00:00:36.360><c> yeah</c><00:00:36.719><c> they</c><00:00:37.050><c> stopped</c>

wanting to talk to regular people and I
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 align:start position:0%
wanting to talk to regular people and I
think<00:00:40.680><c> that</c><00:00:40.860><c> contributes</c><00:00:41.430><c> to</c><00:00:41.520><c> the</c><00:00:41.730><c> disconnect</c>

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
think that contributes to the disconnect
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.049 align:start position:0%
think that contributes to the disconnect
that<00:00:42.360><c> you</c><00:00:42.450><c> see</c><00:00:42.660><c> between</c><00:00:42.899><c> intellectuals</c><00:00:43.770><c> and</c>

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 align:start position:0%
that you see between intellectuals and
 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
that you see between intellectuals and
working-class<00:00:45.059><c> people</c><00:00:45.300><c> and</c><00:00:45.750><c> stuff</c><00:00:46.170><c> like</c><00:00:46.350><c> that</c>

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
