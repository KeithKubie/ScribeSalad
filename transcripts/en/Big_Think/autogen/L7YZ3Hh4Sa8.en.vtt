so the patent system has been a great

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430
so the patent system has been a great
 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.660
so the patent system has been a great
driver of medical inventions we've seen

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670
driver of medical inventions we've seen
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.209
driver of medical inventions we've seen
some terrific discoveries and inventions

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219
some terrific discoveries and inventions
 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.650
some terrific discoveries and inventions
in the medical space but as we've as as

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660
in the medical space but as we've as as
 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.990
in the medical space but as we've as as
we've evolved in the system I think

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000
we've evolved in the system I think
 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.990
we've evolved in the system I think
we've we're starting to see as a lawyer

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000
we've we're starting to see as a lawyer
 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.370
we've we're starting to see as a lawyer
who's practiced in this area we're

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
who's practiced in this area we're
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.320
who's practiced in this area we're
starting to see a lot of strategies that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330
starting to see a lot of strategies that
 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.359
starting to see a lot of strategies that
are played by pharmaceutical companies

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369
are played by pharmaceutical companies
 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.420
are played by pharmaceutical companies
in order to maintain them an optic hold

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430
in order to maintain them an optic hold
 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.310
in order to maintain them an optic hold
or their exclusivity hold over a

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320
or their exclusivity hold over a
 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.290
or their exclusivity hold over a
particular product and what they do is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300
particular product and what they do is
 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.750
particular product and what they do is
they ratchet up a number of patents

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760
they ratchet up a number of patents
 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.819
they ratchet up a number of patents
around a particular product in order to

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829
around a particular product in order to
 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.920
around a particular product in order to
prevent competition from getting in and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930
prevent competition from getting in and
 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.910
prevent competition from getting in and
we all know that once you have

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920
we all know that once you have
 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.619
we all know that once you have
competition prices drive down as a

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629
competition prices drive down as a
 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.200
competition prices drive down as a
number of studies that show prices can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
number of studies that show prices can
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.920
number of studies that show prices can
drop well below 50 but more than 50% if

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930
drop well below 50 but more than 50% if
 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.959
drop well below 50 but more than 50% if
you get competition in the marketplace

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969
you get competition in the marketplace
 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.850
you get competition in the marketplace
sooner so the idea that companies want

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860
sooner so the idea that companies want
 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.060
sooner so the idea that companies want
to do is is to basically prevent that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
to do is is to basically prevent that
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.740
to do is is to basically prevent that
competition from coming up in earlier

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750
competition from coming up in earlier
 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.470
competition from coming up in earlier
and also it and then the other argument

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480
and also it and then the other argument
 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.939
and also it and then the other argument
of that is is are they then really

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949
of that is is are they then really
 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.279
of that is is are they then really
inventing new things because what they

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289
inventing new things because what they
 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.230
inventing new things because what they
do is they hold on to the marketplace as

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
do is they hold on to the marketplace as
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.240
do is they hold on to the marketplace as
long as they can on the existing product

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250
long as they can on the existing product
 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.620
long as they can on the existing product
they extend the franchiser

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630
they extend the franchiser
 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.039
they extend the franchiser
by using patents sometimes with the

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049
by using patents sometimes with the
 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.750
by using patents sometimes with the
potential of holding the market for 40

litigation doesn't solve all the
 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.130
litigation doesn't solve all the
problems and we've seen that in a number

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140
problems and we've seen that in a number
 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.749
problems and we've seen that in a number
of the top-selling drugs in the United

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759
of the top-selling drugs in the United
 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.730
of the top-selling drugs in the United
States we've done studies as an

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740
States we've done studies as an
 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.399
States we've done studies as an
organization where we have seen price

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409
organization where we have seen price
 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.730

68 percent and we've seen in in parallel
 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.140

to that the number of patents that have

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150
to that the number of patents that have
 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.990
to that the number of patents that have
been stacked up on those products even

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000
been stacked up on those products even
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.389
been stacked up on those products even
after the products being approved even

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399
after the products being approved even
 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.340
after the products being approved even
after the initial initial patent has

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
after the initial initial patent has
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.800
after the initial initial patent has
expired which is a 20-year term and so

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810
expired which is a 20-year term and so
 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.300
expired which is a 20-year term and so
they're just pushing it out further and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310
they're just pushing it out further and
 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.399
they're just pushing it out further and
further and further so that they can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409
further and further so that they can
 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.580
further and further so that they can
delay the competition getting in and

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590
delay the competition getting in and
 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.709
delay the competition getting in and
that all leads to market power and it

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719
that all leads to market power and it
 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.840
that all leads to market power and it
all leads to the ability to increase

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
all leads to the ability to increase
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.370
all leads to the ability to increase
prices at will I believe that there are

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380
prices at will I believe that there are
 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.959
prices at will I believe that there are
there are there are differences between

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969
there are there are differences between
 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.960
there are there are differences between
if you look at a pharmaceutical company

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
if you look at a pharmaceutical company
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.630
if you look at a pharmaceutical company
the scientists who work there

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
the scientists who work there
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190
the scientists who work there
the people who work on the development

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
the people who work on the development
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500
the people who work on the development
of drugs their primary purpose is to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
of drugs their primary purpose is to
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750
of drugs their primary purpose is to
help people I believe I've generally

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
help people I believe I've generally
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030
help people I believe I've generally
believed that I believe they the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
believed that I believe they the
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130
believed that I believe they the
conversations I've had with people from

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
conversations I've had with people from
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.720
conversations I've had with people from
that sector they they believe that if

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
that sector they they believe that if
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.730
that sector they they believe that if
they bring a new product to mark and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740
they bring a new product to mark and
 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.650
they bring a new product to mark and
save someone's life or it can actually

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
save someone's life or it can actually
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.330
save someone's life or it can actually
make somebody healthy they really do

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
make somebody healthy they really do
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860
make somebody healthy they really do
believe that unfortunately there's a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
believe that unfortunately there's a
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.380
believe that unfortunately there's a
business side to it as well and so what

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
business side to it as well and so what
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.150
business side to it as well and so what
you have is for every scientists you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
you have is for every scientists you
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.410
you have is for every scientists you
have probably two lawyers who are

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420
have probably two lawyers who are
 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330
have probably two lawyers who are
watching over them saying okay how can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
watching over them saying okay how can
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.970
watching over them saying okay how can
we extract a patent out of this and to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
we extract a patent out of this and to
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.740
we extract a patent out of this and to
make sure that nobody else gets in there

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
make sure that nobody else gets in there
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.110
make sure that nobody else gets in there
and so what we have is then you have the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
and so what we have is then you have the
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.060
and so what we have is then you have the
particular pharmaceutical market there's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
particular pharmaceutical market there's
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.440
particular pharmaceutical market there's
an argument that it's become overly

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
an argument that it's become overly
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900
an argument that it's become overly
financialized in terms of its investors

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
financialized in terms of its investors
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.410
financialized in terms of its investors
who drive what companies do rather than

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
who drive what companies do rather than
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.410
who drive what companies do rather than
then the maybe the initially intended

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
then the maybe the initially intended
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.140
then the maybe the initially intended
prints purpose was to deliver health

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
prints purpose was to deliver health
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.350
prints purpose was to deliver health
products and to help make people not

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
products and to help make people not
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.830
products and to help make people not
have to become ill and and stay alive

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
have to become ill and and stay alive
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.830
have to become ill and and stay alive
and I think a lot of some of that has

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
and I think a lot of some of that has
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.500
and I think a lot of some of that has
got lost in the process as the pumps

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
got lost in the process as the pumps
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.509
got lost in the process as the pumps
have cook up is down really start to

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
have cook up is down really start to
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.620
have cook up is down really start to
look at their bottom line in their

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
look at their bottom line in their
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.720
look at their bottom line in their
shareholders and what the investors want

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
shareholders and what the investors want
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.280
shareholders and what the investors want
rather than what their original purpose

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
rather than what their original purpose
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.729
rather than what their original purpose
was was to help people become healthier

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
was was to help people become healthier
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.370
was was to help people become healthier
and I think that the bargain of that has

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
and I think that the bargain of that has
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.340
and I think that the bargain of that has
tilted more towards the financialization

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350
tilted more towards the financialization
 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.800
tilted more towards the financialization
of things rather than thinking about

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
of things rather than thinking about
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.310
of things rather than thinking about
health first I'm at comprises lawyers

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320

taken that knowledge to apply it in a
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.430
taken that knowledge to apply it in a
public interest way whereby we look at

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440
public interest way whereby we look at
 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.240
public interest way whereby we look at
particularly the drug in the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
particularly the drug in the
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.610
particularly the drug in the
pharmaceutical industry how do

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
pharmaceutical industry how do
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.289
pharmaceutical industry how do
pharmaceutical corporations strategize

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
pharmaceutical corporations strategize
 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.190
pharmaceutical corporations strategize
their patent filings in order to get the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200
their patent filings in order to get the
 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.560
their patent filings in order to get the
maximum protection so what we do is we

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570
maximum protection so what we do is we
 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.050
maximum protection so what we do is we
we look at a product it could even be

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
we look at a product it could even be
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150
we look at a product it could even be
still in development and we'll do that

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
still in development and we'll do that
 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.740
still in development and we'll do that
we'll do what we call the due diligence

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
we'll do what we call the due diligence
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.009
we'll do what we call the due diligence
and the analysis of all their patent

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019
and the analysis of all their patent
 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.349
and the analysis of all their patent
filings so for example if it's a pata if

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
filings so for example if it's a pata if
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.270
filings so for example if it's a pata if
it's a product that revolves around a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
it's a product that revolves around a
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.270
it's a product that revolves around a
small chemical compare

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280
small chemical compare
 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.580
small chemical compare
we'll identify what that chemical

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590
we'll identify what that chemical
 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.560
we'll identify what that chemical
structure is and then what we'll do is

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570
structure is and then what we'll do is
 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.750
structure is and then what we'll do is
we do pattern searches there various

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760
we do pattern searches there various
 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.540
we do pattern searches there various
databases that you can use we put in

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550
databases that you can use we put in
 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.090
databases that you can use we put in
keywords we will use a compound searches

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100
keywords we will use a compound searches
 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.730
keywords we will use a compound searches
and then we'll find out what it is that

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740
and then we'll find out what it is that
 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.560
and then we'll find out what it is that
the company is filed for and then we

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
the company is filed for and then we
 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.080
the company is filed for and then we
track how many other patents that the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090
track how many other patents that the
 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.730
track how many other patents that the
company is adding on in the lifetime of

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740
company is adding on in the lifetime of
 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.100
company is adding on in the lifetime of
the product and that way we build up a

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110
the product and that way we build up a
 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.410
the product and that way we build up a
sense of what is their entire portfolio

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420
sense of what is their entire portfolio
 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.720
sense of what is their entire portfolio
around that particular product and that

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730
around that particular product and that
 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.010
around that particular product and that
then gives us a sense of what their

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020
then gives us a sense of what their
 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.770
then gives us a sense of what their
strategy is what potentially is the new

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
strategy is what potentially is the new
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.030
strategy is what potentially is the new
version of the product that they're

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040
version of the product that they're
 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.370
version of the product that they're
maybe lining up so that what they do is

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380
maybe lining up so that what they do is
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.840
maybe lining up so that what they do is
typically products these days in the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850
typically products these days in the
 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.700
typically products these days in the
pharmaceutical market they're on the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710
pharmaceutical market they're on the
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.840
pharmaceutical market they're on the
market for five years and then they'll

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850
market for five years and then they'll
 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.280
market for five years and then they'll
switch it out to the next version of the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290
switch it out to the next version of the
 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.110
switch it out to the next version of the
product and these patterns usually tell

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120
product and these patterns usually tell
 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.420
product and these patterns usually tell
you what's coming down the line then and

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430
you what's coming down the line then and
 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.940
you what's coming down the line then and
we use that essentially then to make

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950
we use that essentially then to make
 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.330
we use that essentially then to make
decisions and often at the behest of

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
decisions and often at the behest of
 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.170
decisions and often at the behest of
organizations such as Doctors Without

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180
organizations such as Doctors Without
 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.610
organizations such as Doctors Without
Borders who want to get access to these

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620
Borders who want to get access to these
 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.080
Borders who want to get access to these
products but they say you know the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090
products but they say you know the
 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.730
products but they say you know the
patents are a barrier the prices are too

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740
patents are a barrier the prices are too
 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.620
patents are a barrier the prices are too
high and then we'll investigate the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
high and then we'll investigate the
 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.330
high and then we'll investigate the
science behind them as we're doing these

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340
science behind them as we're doing these
 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.000
science behind them as we're doing these
analysis and what we realize is some as

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010
analysis and what we realize is some as
 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.159
analysis and what we realize is some as
many times that the science behind her

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169
many times that the science behind her
 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.440
many times that the science behind her
it's not new and then at that point we

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450
it's not new and then at that point we
 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.550
it's not new and then at that point we
decide whether we want to challenge

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560
decide whether we want to challenge
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.100
decide whether we want to challenge
those patterns in order to remove the

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110
those patterns in order to remove the
 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.750
those patterns in order to remove the
barriers so that competition get in

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760
barriers so that competition get in
 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.290
barriers so that competition get in
earlier and by doing that then we lower

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300
earlier and by doing that then we lower
 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.390
earlier and by doing that then we lower
the we get generic competition in

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400
the we get generic competition in
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.520
the we get generic competition in
earlier if we're successful and prices

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530
earlier if we're successful and prices
 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.140
earlier if we're successful and prices
dropped significantly and we've achieved

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150
dropped significantly and we've achieved
 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.969
dropped significantly and we've achieved
that in in various ways for example in

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979
that in in various ways for example in
 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.350
that in in various ways for example in
India we've been very successful with

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360
India we've been very successful with
 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.610
India we've been very successful with
the HIV drug collector which was a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620
the HIV drug collector which was a
 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.260
the HIV drug collector which was a

product owned by Abbott Laboratories now
 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.320
product owned by Abbott Laboratories now
AB V and we were able to challenge the

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330
AB V and we were able to challenge the
 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.810
AB V and we were able to challenge the
key patents on their drug and such that

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820
key patents on their drug and such that
 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.570
key patents on their drug and such that
Abbott eventually withdrew all this

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580
Abbott eventually withdrew all this
 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.300
Abbott eventually withdrew all this
patent applications and Indian generic

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310
patent applications and Indian generic
 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.340
patent applications and Indian generic
companies could continue to supply this

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350
companies could continue to supply this
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.080
companies could continue to supply this
particular product at a much lower price

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090
particular product at a much lower price
 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.560
particular product at a much lower price
not only to Indian patients but also

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570
not only to Indian patients but also
 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.670
not only to Indian patients but also
many patients around the world and

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680
many patients around the world and
 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.200
many patients around the world and
particularly in Africa and so we were

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210
particularly in Africa and so we were
 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.290
particularly in Africa and so we were
able to keep that market at a much

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300
able to keep that market at a much
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.650
able to keep that market at a much
accessible way for for people living

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660
accessible way for for people living
 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.690
accessible way for for people living
with HIV AIDS and that for us has been

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700
with HIV AIDS and that for us has been
 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.940
with HIV AIDS and that for us has been
one of the greatest successes but more

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950
one of the greatest successes but more
 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.170
one of the greatest successes but more
recently we've done it for the new

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180
recently we've done it for the new
 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.140
recently we've done it for the new
hepatitis C drugs for example just this

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150
hepatitis C drugs for example just this
 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.620
hepatitis C drugs for example just this
year we got a decision in the drug

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630
year we got a decision in the drug
 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.410
year we got a decision in the drug
the drug by Gillian Cole sofosbuvir we

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420
the drug by Gillian Cole sofosbuvir we
 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.630
the drug by Gillian Cole sofosbuvir we
were able to win a case in China and

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640
were able to win a case in China and
 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.460
were able to win a case in China and
China has ten million people living with

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470
China has ten million people living with
 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.830
China has ten million people living with
hepatitis C and the fact that we won

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840
hepatitis C and the fact that we won
 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.890
hepatitis C and the fact that we won
these two cases in China now has the

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900
these two cases in China now has the
 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.230
these two cases in China now has the
potential of other actors to come in and

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240
potential of other actors to come in and
 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.910
potential of other actors to come in and
supply the Chinese market which could

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920
supply the Chinese market which could
 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.310
supply the Chinese market which could

living with hepatitis D in China that
 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.870
living with hepatitis D in China that
would save thirteen billion dollars so

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880
would save thirteen billion dollars so
 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.150
would save thirteen billion dollars so
overall our impact of our work has the
