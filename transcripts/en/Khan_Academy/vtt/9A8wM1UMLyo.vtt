00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:03.022
Voiceover: Let's say that
you have two folks that are

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:07.377
trying to collectively
push a box across the snow

00:00:07.377 --> 00:00:10.428
towards a target, so
this is where the box is,

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:14.840
right over here and this is
the target, right over here.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.683
Let me write that, that is the target.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.482
That's where they're
trying to get the box,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:21.515
and person A, because for
some reason, they can't

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.341
push it from exactly behind the box,

00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:25.915
maybe there's not a good footing there,

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:27.346
or I guess if they pressed
there, maybe the box

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:30.891
squeezes a little bit,
so person A has to push

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.556
in a direction that's not
exactly going in the direction

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.409
of the target, so they push in a direction

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:37.754
that looks like this,

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:40.624
and so let me show you
this vector I'm drawing,

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:43.109
essentially represents the
force that they're exerting.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.944
This is their force vector.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.762
This is person A's force vector.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:50.037
So this is person A's force vector,

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:51.621
and we know the length of this vector,

00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.484
or another way to think
about it, the magnitude

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:59.155
of vector A is 330 newtons, 330 newtons.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.151
And let's say person B, once again,

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.022
because they can't push exactly

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:06.020
in the direction of the target,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.524
maybe the box is really
soft right over here,

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:17.154
person B is pushing at
this angle right over here,

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:19.402
so that right over there, that vector is

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:23.414
the force that person B is pushing onto it

00:01:23.414 --> 00:01:27.357
and the direction, and the
magnitude of that force,

00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:32.892
of that vector of person
B's pushing, is 300 newtons.

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:34.868
And we know their angles that those make

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:36.473
with the direction of the target.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:40.800
So if this is the direction
of the target right over here

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.895
we know that this is a 35 degree angle,

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:50.492
and we know that this
is a 15 degree angle.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.799
Now what I want you to
do, is pause this video

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.742
and think about how much
of each of their force

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.965
is going in the direction of getting

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:02.628
the box towards the target, and then who

00:02:02.628 --> 00:02:05.616
is actually exerting more
force in that direction.

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:08.215
We see that person A is exerting a total,

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.349
a higher magnitude of
force in this direction

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.491
than person B is doing in that direction.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.533
330 newtons versus 300,

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.558
but who's helping the box
go more in that direction?

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:18.895
And by how much more?

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.120
And also, what's the total force

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.761
now pushing the box in that direction?

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.825
So I'm assuming you had a go at it,

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:27.615
and the key here is to find the component

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.343
of each of these vectors, the magnitude

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:33.449
of each of these vectors
in this direction,

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.285
in the direction towards the target.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:40.035
And so, let's look first at vector A.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.058
So vector A looks like this,
and I'll just draw them

00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:45.127
separately just so we can
clean it up a little bit.

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:46.241
Vector A looks like this.

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:49.993
We know its magnitude -
the magnitude of vector A

00:02:49.993 --> 00:02:54.557
is equal to 330 newtons, and if we say

00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:57.182
that the target is in this
direction right over here,

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.838
so that's the target
is some place out here,

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:04.170
we've already been told
that this is 35 degrees.

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:10.927
So what we really want to
do is find the component,

00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:14.056
the magnitude of the component

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:16.721
going in that direction right over there.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.536
The way we can do that is just

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:20.728
with our traditional trig functions.

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.419
This right over here is a right triangle.

00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:25.991
We are looking for this
side right over here.

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:32.882
We have - let me just call that A sub X.

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:35.562
And we already know
that the magnitude of A

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:39.118
is 330 newtons, so the magnitude -

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.223
let me just say that the magnitude -

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:42.860
let me just write it this
way so we don't confuse.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.110
So let's just say the
magnitude of the vector

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.151
in the X direction, so this
vector right over here,

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:49.783
we can write like this.

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:51.209
The magnitude of that, we'll just write it

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.134
without the vector notation.

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.350
So how can we think about that?

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.237
Well we know cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:04.222
so we could write cosine
of 35 degrees is equal

00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:06.264
to the length of the adjacent side.

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:09.260
That would just be A sub X,
without the vector over it.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.411
We're just saying that
that's the magnitude

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:14.331
of vector A sub X, over
the magnitude of vector A,

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:23.586
over 330 newtons, or we
could say that A sub X

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:31.184
is equal to 330 times
the cosine of 35 degrees.

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:35.238
And we can make the exact
same argument for B.

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:38.389
Vector B, so let me draw it like this.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.950
Vector B, you could, maybe
I'll draw it like this

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.399
just to make it a little bit -

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.549
let me do it a little bit different.

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:48.241
If this is the direction to the target,

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.904
so once again, I'll just draw
a horizontal line for that.

00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:51.922
Then relative to that,

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:54.931
vector B looks something like this.

00:04:57.337 --> 00:05:00.757
Vector B looks something like that,

00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:03.606
so that is vector B.

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:06.049
B sub X, in the direction of the target -

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:09.440
so we would drop a
perpendicular like that.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.455
This would be - this
right over here would be

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:17.703
the vector B sub X, and
so what is the magnitude

00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:19.502
of B sub X going to be equal to?

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:21.941
Now we could say that the
magnitude of B sub X -

00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:25.359
we'll just call that B sub X
without the vector notation,

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:26.785
same exact logic.

00:05:26.798 --> 00:05:29.032
This is 15 degrees.

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:32.352
Cosine of 15 degrees is
going to be the length

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:33.403
of the adjacent side over

00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:35.135
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:35.740
So we already know that the length

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.070
of the hypotenuse is 300 newtons.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.298
So we could write that
cosine of 15 degrees

00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:47.637
is equal to B sub X,
length of the adjacent side

00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:49.384
over the length of the hypotenuse.

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:53.718
Or that B sub X is equal to 300

00:05:53.718 --> 00:05:58.679
times cosine of 15 degrees.

00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:00.812
So let's get our calculator out

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:03.280
and let's calculate what these things are.

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:10.673
So, let's see, we have 330 times

00:06:10.673 --> 00:06:17.369
cosine of 35 degrees,
gets us to 270 newtons.

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:19.509
So that's A sub X is 270 newtons,

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.828
and B sub X is 300 times
cosine of 15 degrees.

00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:30.092
We get 289.777, so what we see is,

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:32.334
even though B's magnitude is less

00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:36.462
than A's magnitude, the
component of vector B

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.325
going the direction of the
target is actually larger

00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:40.573
than the component of
vector A going in it.

00:06:40.573 --> 00:06:43.410
So if we were rounding
to the nearest newton,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.455
this right over here, the
magnitude of this vector

00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:53.150
right over here, B sub X, that is,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.017
if we round to the nearest
newton, 290 newtons.

00:06:56.622 --> 00:07:01.329
So this is approximately
290 newtons length,

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:02.939
or I guess you could say magnitude,

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.870
while this one is a little bit shorter -

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.534
it's a little bit shorter.

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:11.029
We saw if we round to the nearest newton,

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.804
it's about 270 newtons.

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:19.373
The length of this one is
270 newtons, approximately.

00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:21.376
So if you were to say, how much more

00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:24.364
is person B pushing in the direction

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:26.442
that we care about, it's about -

00:07:26.442 --> 00:07:28.143
well, if we want to be
a little more precise,

00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:30.654
we can subtract the two, so we can take

00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:40.541
300 cosine of 15, minus 330 cosine of 35,

00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:44.773
and we get about 19.5 newtons difference.

00:07:44.773 --> 00:07:47.022
The blue, person B, is contributing

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:53.204
19.458 newtons more in that direction

00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:55.147
towards the target than person A is.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:56.390
But if we wanted to talk about,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.123
what is the total force
going in that direction,

00:08:00.123 --> 00:08:02.446
then we would take the
sum of these two things.

00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:07.798
So we would - the total
force in that direction

00:08:07.798 --> 00:08:10.633
is going to be 560 newtons

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:12.181
if we round to the nearest newton.

00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:14.106
So if you add this blue component

00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:17.138
to this magenta component,
you get this one

00:08:17.138 --> 00:08:22.582
right over here, which is 560 newtons.

00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:27.173
So this whole vector right
over here, it's magnitude -

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:35.755
so I could write that as
the magnitude of A sub X,

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:41.486
plus B sub X, which is
the same thing as A sub X,

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:43.978
plus B sub X - I already
said these are the equivalent

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:46.722
of the magnitude of each of
these vectors is equal to

00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:55.149
- I could write approximately
equal 560 newtons.
