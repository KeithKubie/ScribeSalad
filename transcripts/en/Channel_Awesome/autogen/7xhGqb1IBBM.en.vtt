00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 align:start position:0%
different dynamic so then that I don't
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.450 align:start position:0%
different dynamic so then that I don't
feel<00:04:10.050><c> like</c><00:04:10.260><c> these</c><00:04:10.500><c> three</c><00:04:10.770><c> characters</c><00:04:11.160><c> are</c><00:04:11.280><c> all</c>

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
feel like these three characters are all
 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
feel like these three characters are all
the<00:04:11.700><c> same</c><00:04:11.910><c> and</c><00:04:12.240><c> therefore</c><00:04:12.360><c> you</c><00:04:12.510><c> get</c><00:04:12.630><c> a</c><00:04:12.690><c> bonding</c>

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 align:start position:0%
the same and therefore you get a bonding
 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.450 align:start position:0%
the same and therefore you get a bonding
episode<00:04:13.590><c> you're</c><00:04:13.740><c> just</c><00:04:13.950><c> going</c><00:04:14.130><c> to</c><00:04:14.160><c> see</c><00:04:14.340><c> the</c>
