00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.410
My name is Hamad Al Magbal, I'm head of the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.940
website development programs at Udacity.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.830
Website development programs aim to teach the basics for programming languages

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.260
through which we can develop websites.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.169
By taking this course you'll learn the basics

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.079
of programming languages using Python

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.560
one of easiest and most common programming

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560
languages.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.130
After that you'll start a project oriented

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.329
programming that
will set you in advanced fields in programming

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.329
development.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.220
Soon after you'll learn GIT technology which

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.109
is one of the technologies that is used for
the developments in the tech and programming

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.109
communities

00:00:51.109 --> 00:01:00.260
so that you'll be able to participate in this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.649
community and fully able to benefit from it.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.950
After you finish this course you'll manage

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.610
to solve problems
using available programs and apply it onto

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.610
websites.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.110
After finishing this course you'll have the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.110
required skills that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
the tech.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.740
Community demands and those needed by big
companies

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770
like Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.310
In the end I encourage you to enroll in this

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.009
program whatever your technical ability is

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.150
in order to develop your skills in problem

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.750
solving using programming tools

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.010
to develop your field and your society.
