00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.450
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Glad to see you all here
today.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.560
A few months ago I got into the car and turn
on NPR and the program that was on the air

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.460
immediately captured my full attention.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.710
The guest was commenting about how we've gotten
to a point where America's different ideological

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.269
factions could no longer even understand each
other at all, let alone work together constructively

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.949
for the common good.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.659
He pointed out that while it maybe convenient
for us to look at our opponents as evil or

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:38.020
stupid, they're not evil or stupid, they believe
in making a better world, just like we do.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.530
The guest was Jonathan Haidt who's here to
talk to us at Google today.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.510
He mentioned to me that he's sick of talking
about politics, so he's not going to be talking

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.510
about that subject.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.610
Instead he's going to talk about the group
dynamics and psychology that make effective

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.809
organizations like Google function as well
as they do.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.920
He's been a professor of psychology at the
University of Virginia for 16 years.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.470
In the summer, he moved to NYU where he's
starting a program to study complex social

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.520
systems.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.790
He's the author of "The Happiness--

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.210
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Haidt: Hypothesis

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hypothesis" and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.680
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Righteous Mind

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.700
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: "The Righteous Mind" which
opened up at number 6 on the New York Times

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.430
bestseller list.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.040
By the way, the book is for sale over in the
corner here, Nadine from Books, Inc. has the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.130
book for $10, which is heavily subsidized
courtesy of Google.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.579
So grab a copy and get it autographed at the
end.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.219
Now, fresh from an interview with Michael
Krasny on Forum, please welcome Dr. Jonathan

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.630
Haidt.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.049
[Applause]

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Thanks so much, David.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.320
So, Hive Psychology, bees.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.720
That's kind of creepy and gross.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.810
Why would I come here and give you guys a
lecture about hives and bees?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.790
Well, as David mentioned, my last book was
"The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.430
Truth in Ancient Wisdom" and I reviewed great
ideas from across cultures, across the eras

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.090
and evaluated them in terms of what we now
know in modern psychology.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.930
And chapter 10 reviewed ideas about happiness,
where it comes from.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.349
And how really, the deepest forms of happiness
come from between, from getting the right

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.910
kinds of connection and embeddedness.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.900
There wasn't that much research to review,
just a lot of claims from people long dead,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.879
but the way I summarized it was "Mystical
experience is an off button for the self.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.260
When the self is turned off, people become
just a cell in a larger body, a bee in a larger

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.260
hive."

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.480
And I reviewed religious experiences, all
kinds of awe experiences and I've long been

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.050
an awe junkie myself.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.840
I would do almost anything to get experiences
of awe.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.050
So, I really was kind of proud of this sentence.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.150
I thought, "Oh great, this is one of the things
that I care most about".

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.530
But there wasn't much more to say about it.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.792
Well, I went on to then write this new book
"The Righteous Mind" and in the interim, there

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:13.340
has been a little bit of research around this
and thinking about morality and where it comes

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.560
from helped me think through this hivishness,
this groupishness, that is one of the most

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.610
important facts and features of human nature.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.750
So, this is the cover of my book in the United
States, where the slash, I think, perfectly

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.290
captures what it feels like to be an American
these days, something is torn, something is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.530
ripped, something is wrong.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.090
In the UK, they have a different cover which
I think works just as well as in the United

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.090
States.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.090
It looks like that.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090
[laughter]

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.780
Now the book is, in a sense, very simple,
in that it's really just about 3 ideas.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.200
If you get these 3 ideas, you get moral psychology.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.120
So the three ideas are first: intuitions come
first, strategic reasoning second, that's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.450
what my early research was on.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.370
And if you've read Malcolm Gladwell and Blink,
and know about all the research on implicit

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.350
cognition, you're familiar with some of that
work.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.189
The second part is on the principle that there
is more to morality than harm and fairness.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.800
This is about how liberals and conservatives
build their moral worlds on different sets

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.390
of moral foundations.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.600
This is what every newspaper and radio station
that interviews me wants to talk about because

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.850
of the election year and as David said, I'm
sick and tired of talking about it.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.380
And I'd much rather talk to you about hivishness
and awe.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.110
So that comes out of part 3 of the book, mortality
binds and blinds.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.380
That's where it comes from.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.130
It comes in part from this novel ability we
humans have, to be bound together into teams

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.280
that are not kin.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.850
That can work together towards higher goals.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.540
And one particular chapter is on hive psychology
and I thought it'd be fun since I'm here talking

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.610
to one of the most novel and interesting companies
in the world, to talk about hive psychology

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.200
and let's see in our discussion afterwards
how well these ideas apply to what you experience

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.250
here at Google.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:14.790
So, perhaps the most over-rated or over-hyped
idea in the social sciences in the last 70

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.340
years has been the idea that people are basically
selfish.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.260
That our fundamental nature is selfish.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.140
Economists have told us that for decades.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.370
Political scientists have told us that people
vote for their self-interest.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.800
Evolutionists, such as Richard Dawkins told
us about selfish genes.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.470
Which, they can make us cooperate with our
kin in cases of reciprocity.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.080
But by and large as Dawkins said, "let us
try to teach generosity and altruism because

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.780
we are born selfish."

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.980
George Williams, one of the greatest evolutionary
biologists, said it even more bluntly.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.210
"Morality is an accidental capability produced,
in its boundless stupidity, by a biological

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.780
process that is normally opposed to the expression
of such a capability."

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.280
So the view is, human nature is selfish.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.750
We can transcend it, we can act in ways that
go against our fundamental nature, but our

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.250
fundamental nature is selfish.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.370
Now, this view has been widely embraced in
business schools and the business community

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.220
and it's been embraced even more strongly
by people who hate business.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.550
Here's an essay that was published in The
New York Times last week, "Capitalists and

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.130
Other Psychopaths".

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.850
It reported, down at the bottom you can see
it reported when it came out in paper it said

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.650
"2010 study found that 10% of a sample of
corporate managers met a clinical threshold

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.130
for being labeled 'psychopaths'".

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.880
I read that and I said "that's nonsense, it
can't possibly be true".

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.800
And I was right, the guy just made up that
number.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.770
The actual study that he was quoting said
4% which is even still probably too high.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.880
But the point is that there's a narrative
out there about business which is that it

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.730
is a bunch of psychopaths and that explains
why businesses act the way they act.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.000
It's because of that narrative, that long
standing narrative which I suppose goes back

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.090
to the 19th century that Google, of course,
came up with its identity, its brand.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.840
Which is "Don't be evil", but then of course,
people being what they are, there are many

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.750
cynics on the web who think that Google is
evil.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.560
[laughter]
So, now my talk today is about how our nature

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
is other than this.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.460
Our nature is not entirely selfish.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.660
There's been a kind of a little boomlet in
the last 10 years or so on altruism.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.430
A lot of people reject this idea and want
to prove no people are deeply altruistic.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.890
And there are cases like Mother Theresa, although
from her biography, as I understand it, even

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.380
Mother Theresa wasn't exactly like Mother
Theresa.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.150
But there are cases of people who devote themselves
to helping others.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.120
That's interesting but I think actually that's
not really where the action is.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.250
If you wanna understand what's so amazing
about human beings, don't go looking for all

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.750
the cases where we do extreme acts of altruism
for strangers.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.860
Rather, what's really remarkable about us
is our extraordinary cooperation.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.430
We're just really cooperative, you guys have
all cooperated more than a hundred times since

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.520
breakfast.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.470
It's just when you walk in the hallway, when
you drive on the road, we are all cooperating

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.800
all the time.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.800
There's a particular kind of cooperation I'll
focus on which I'll call "groupishness" and

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.500
I'm calling it this to be able to make a very
precise comparison to selfishness.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.510
Because when I say, as a psychologist, that
we are selfish, that our nature is in part

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:28.890
selfish, what I mean is that the human mind
contains a variety of mental mechanisms that

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.970
make us adept at promoting our own interests
in competition with our peers.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.970
Of course, we're good at that.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.800
Of course, we evolved these complex minds
that make us selfish very often.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.860
I'm not arguing that.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.560
What I'm arguing is that's not the whole story.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.700
We are also groupish, by which I mean our
minds contain a variety of mental mechanisms

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.650
that make us adept at promoting our group's
interests in competition with other groups.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.170
I'm arguing that we focus too much, in the
social sciences, on the competition of individual

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.130
versus individual and not enough on the competition
of group versus group.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.740
Which I believe has also shaped our mind.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.990
That's a side story about multi-level selection,
group selection versus individual selection.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.350
We don't need to get into that today.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.940
But that's the background to part of what
I'm saying here.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.940
[clears throat]

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.130
So, the reason I believe this, the reason
I began studying groupishness as a moral psychologist

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.950
that is I'm a social psychologist, but I specialize
in the study of morality.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.760
The reason I study this is because I was studying
the moral emotions, like moral elevation and

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.560
I just found there are so many ways that people
have found to shut down their selves, shut

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.890
down self-interest, transcend the self.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.710
The metaphor that I'll use is that it's as
though there's a staircase in our minds and

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.830
there's a kind of a door that sometimes opens,
very rarely, but most of us have had it open.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.770
There's a kind of door that opens, it's as
though there is kind of a secret staircase,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:06.840
and when this door opens, it invites us to
go up, we climb the stair case and we emerge

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.620
into a different realm.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.840
A realm in which we are fundamentally different.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.820
We transcend ourselves and it isn't just different,
it's ecstatic, it feels wonderful.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.870
Most of us are familiar with these experiences
in nature.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.440
Raise your hand if you have ever climbed a
mountain or gone out in nature specifically

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.870
to experience some sort of an altered state
of consciousness, a state of self-transcendence,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.870
please raise your hand.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.500
OK, so right, especially here in Northern
California, you kind of stumble out to get

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.460
the milk and that seems to happen to you.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.860
But anyway.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.600
Most of us are familiar with this kind of
experience.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.660
Ralph Waldo Emerson described it, I think,
in the most eloquent way that it has even

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.720
been described.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.140
Just describing what it's like to go for a
walk in the woods in New England.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.880
And I've had some animators animate his words,
these are from an essay from, I think, 1839

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.430
and again, it's as though this staircase opens,
the door opens, you go up the staircase and

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.090
here's what he said about it.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:11.360
&gt;&gt;male narrator: In the woods these plantations
of God, a decorum and sanctity reign.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.310
Standing on the bare ground, my head bathed
by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.750
space, all mean egotism vanishes.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:32.120
I become a transparent eyeball, I am nothing,
I see all.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.170
The currents of the Universal Being circulate
through me.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.100
I am the lover of uncontained and immortal
beauty.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:48.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: So, he had lines like
"all mean egotism vanishes" again, this self-transcendent

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.970
nature of nature experiences.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.590
William James, one of the founders of American
psychology, wrote a book called "Varieties

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.740
of Religious Experience" were he cataloged
all these sorts of experiences and he noted

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.890
that they don't just make us happy; they don't
just make us feel good.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.560
They make us feel different.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.760
That our self is fundamentally changed.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.100
People don't come back from these experiences
saying "I can do anything.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.590
Now I'm going to make as much money as I can
as quickly as I can."

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.920
Rather, they come back experiencing a moral
commitment and a desire to serve, to be part

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.610
of something larger.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.800
Many of the world's religions have developed
techniques and technologies to foster these

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.370
self-transcendent experiences.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.990
Meditation is one developed especially in
most of the eastern religions.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.420
Many of the world's religions discovered psychedelic
drugs.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.350
Substances that can, within 30 minutes, attain
the kind of self-transcendence that takes

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.610
years of study through meditation to achieve.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:53.090
This is from a sixteenth century scroll showing
a mushroom eater about to consume a mushroom.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.430
And as soon as he eats it, this god is going
to yank him up the staircase into the other

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.430
world.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:03.150
We don't know much about the Aztec's religion
and to what degree it was a moral transformation.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.040
But in the '60s there was a great deal of
interest in psychedelic drugs, there was research

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040
on it.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.870
A famous study by Walter Pahnke, in conjunction
with Timothy Leary, gave psilocybin or niacin

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.870
pills.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.720
It was a placebo controlled study.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.250
They gave the pills to divinity students in
a basement in a chapel at Boston University.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:28.930
And all 10 of the students who took psilocybin
had religious experiences and those who took

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.020
niacin, they first felt a flush, you feel
like something is happening, they were really

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.020
psyched.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.100
They said "Yes, I'm one of those who got the
pill."

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.850
But it was just niacin and that quickly faded
and nothing else happened.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:45.250
So the subjects who got psilocybin experienced
profound transformations, as one of them put

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:50.380
it "feelings of connectedness with everybody
and everything".

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:56.950
So again, these many many roots of self-transcendence
which have a morally transformative effect,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.380
this is what I'm interested in.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.871
Many of the world's religions use circling,
rhythmic movements to create an altered state

00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:06.839
in which one gets closer to God.

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:12.490
And if you put this all together, you put
chemicals that alter the brain with movement

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.720
that also triggers ancient circuits, what
you get is a rave.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.950
It was discovered in the 1980s that if you
put ecstasy and certain kinds of music together

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.710
you can achieve certain altered states of
consciousness and it's not just a celebration

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.710
of hedonism.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.680
Its peace, love, unity and respect.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.350
Again, unity, it's a sense of oneness, togetherness,
transcending the self.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.680
And here's the weirdest place of all, which
is war.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.860
War is hell of course, but many journalists,
when they serve with the men and women down

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.690
in the trenches, they find that actually war
unites people like nothing else.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.980
And it gives warriors experiences that they
cherish for the rest of their lives.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.089
There's an extraordinary book by Glenn Gray
who served in the American Army in World War

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:59.880
II, and D-Day and came back and wrote a book.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.390
He wrote a book in which he interviewed many
other veterans and he describes the experience

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.260
of communal effort in battle.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.031
Once again, I've had this animated, I hope
we can keep the volume louder this time, here

00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:12.031
it goes.

00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:16.470
&gt;&gt;male narrator: Many veterans will admit
that the experience of communal effort in

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.510
battle has been the high point of their lives.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:29.600
I passes insensibly into a we, my becomes
our and individual fate lose its central importance.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:37.270
I believe that it is nothing less than the
assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.430
at these moments so relatively easy.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.880
"I may fall, but I do not die.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:50.050
For that which is real in me goes forward
and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.050
up my life"

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:56.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: "I" passes insensibly
into "we", "my" becomes "our" and individual

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.050
fate lose its central importance.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.630
If bees could speak, I think this is the sort
of thing that they would say.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.430
So it's because of these experiences, they
are so ubiquitous; you find them all over

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.930
the world, across the eons.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.649
It's as though we were designed to be able
to lose ourselves.

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:17.899
At very least there's something in our minds
that makes it easy to do so.

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:21.910
This is what led me to formulate what I called
the hive psychology hypothesis.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:28.800
It's a hypothesis, but my claim is that human
nature, alright this parts a metaphor, not

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800
a hypothesis.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.600
Human nature is 90% chimp, 10% bee.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.760
That's the metaphor.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.089
The idea is that most of our sociality is
strategic or selfish.

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:45.360
When you read books on human nature or evolution
where they invariably compare to other animals

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.770
and the author will trace out kin selection,
reciprocal altruism.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:56.610
So we're able to cooperate as other animals
are but it's ultimately for our own benefit.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:02.089
Just like chimpanzees, but we have the ability
to forget our self-interest and lose ourselves

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:05.660
in something larger than ourselves, like bees.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:12.089
My claim here is that we are like bees, in
part because we went through a parallel process

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.630
of evolution as bees did.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.550
Namely a long period of group versus group
competition.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.230
Which chimps didn't really go through, or
our primate ancestors didn't go through.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.450
But group selected species do.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.870
So, we're very good in situations that call
for every man for himself.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.720
This is a photo of a tomato fight in Spain,
everybody throws tomatoes at everybody.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.251
But, I would note, they had to actually all
get together and agree on the rules, get a

00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:36.390
permit you know they're all having fun.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.110
So actually even this isn't every man for
himself.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.990
But, we're good at it, we can do that.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.670
But we are especially good at one for all,
all for one.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.010
Alright, how does that happen?

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:54.059
Well, let's look at sociality, let's step
back and look at what forms sociality takes

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.780
in the animal kingdom.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.450
Many many animals are social.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.429
Darwin wrote about this and noted that it's
often adaptive to hang out with others, not

00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:06.120
because they work together as a team but because
the odds are that you won't be the slowest

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.440
out of the thousand deer.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.390
And so when the lion comes, it will be your
neighbor that gets eaten, and not you.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:17.900
So, deer are like this, they live in herds
and these herds are not cooperative at all.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.220
It's just safety in numbers, there's no team
work.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.679
So this does not provide a good metaphor for
anything in the corporate world.

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.210
I don't think there are any corporations that
are herds.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.640
Alright, but let's move up a little bit.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.820
A lot of animals live in packs.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.310
Now packs are very different.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:37.960
Packs, you especially find them among carnivores
because teamwork lets them take down larger

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.450
prey.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.120
Four wolves working together can take down
a much larger animal.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.820
But, a wolf pack is a rough place to be, there's
constant competition for status and resources.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.500
Well, now it's beginning to sound more familiar.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.790
So familiar in fact that many textbooks of
organizational behavior specifically feature

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.790
wolves.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.520
And we train our MBA students to be effective
wolves.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.680
Most MBA companies can be analogized to wolf
packs.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.270
Teamwork lets them take down larger prey.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.720
They can do things they could not do as individuals
but there's constant competition for status

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.850
and resources.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.250
So that works, that works throughout most
of the business world.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.770
Raise your hand if the description I've just
given you describes what it's like to work

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.830
at Google.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.840
OK, I thought not.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.860
Of course, if you did raise your hand I'm
sure there are cameras everywhere and who

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.540
knows what would happen to you.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.640
[laughter] But, for you, I think you would
resonate more towards the third alternative

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.650
which is hives.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.841
Only a few kinds of species live in hives,
it's only been discovered a few times in the

00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:39.930
evolution of life on earth.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.360
A few dozen times actually.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.730
The Hymenoptera were the main discoverers
of this way of living.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.620
The bees, wasps and ants and they are able
to live in gigantic colonies with massive

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.400
division of labor, and they are able to do
it because they are all sisters.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.170
They suppress breeding, so they're really
all in the same boat, all in the same hive.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.120
It's one for all, all for one.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.090
There was a species of cockroach that discovered
this form of living and their bodies morphed

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.470
into those that we now call termites.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.300
And there's one species of mammal that did,
the naked mole rat.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.760
In all five of these cases, it's the same
trick.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.390
Suppress breeding, so that you have just one
queen who lays all the eggs or gives birth

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.751
to all the babies and now everybody's interest,
their biological interest is one for all,

00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:24.751
all for one.

00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:27.250
Keep the queen alive, keep the babies alive.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.460
And so they're able to cooperate, massively
build gigantic nests, thousands of times larger

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.790
than any individual.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.630
It's really quite extraordinary what they
can do, but it's not hard to explain because

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.450
it's straight kinship.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:46.080
Now, once you get hive living, you can get
this amazing division of labor and you can

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.580
the group functioning as a super organism.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.740
This is an image of giant Asian honey bees
that do this behavior.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.270
And what scientists have figured out is that
they do this when there is a wasp, a larger

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.301
predatory insect, there's a wasp trying to
get in.

00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:04.540
Trying to attack them, to get in, trying to
get the honey.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:10.760
So, they're able to flick their tails and
their bodies in unison, in a pattern that

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.710
basically flicks the wasp off.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.591
It's an amazing feat of coordination possible
because they live in this way, one for all,

00:21:18.591 --> 00:21:19.591
all for one.

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:24.390
And these emergent behaviors have evolved,
quite extraordinary.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.260
This yields massive efficiency; you have massive
division of labor and trust.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.160
Is this an analogy or even a homology for
anything in the corporate world?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.670
Are there any businesses that work this way?

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:42.400
Well, there's no business that has no competition,
in which people are truly perfect hive members,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.410
where there's no politics, no competition.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.390
But there are many businesses that come close.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.880
I've visited a couple times at zappos.com
and they pride themselves in being like this,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.140
and my sense is that they really are.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.670
If you put Zappos into Google image search,
this was one of the first images that came

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.179
up when I did this.

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:05.880
And it is them forming this symbol of one
for all, all for one and when they do this

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.750
love to spin around like those bees.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.450
So, some companies, I think, are like this.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.230
Now, I want to tell you about this little
bit of research that has been done on hive

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.690
psychology recently.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:24.590
It's been discovered that synchronous movement,
moving together, seems to change our minds,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:29.750
chance our physiology in ways that make us
extra good hive members.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.520
So, many religions use synchronous movement
well.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.860
Scott Wiltermuth and Chip Heath at the Stanford
Business School, brought people into the lab,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.110
had them basically sing a drinking song.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.590
They didn't actually give them alcohol but
they had them wave mugs around while singing

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.920
'O Canada'.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.840
They wanted a song that people wouldn't have
any particular emotional attachment to.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840
[Audience laughter]

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: They had them sing
'O Canada' while listening on headphones to

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.580
the song so that they could either be singing
or moving in unison or not quite in unison.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.970
And then they had them play various games
and dilemmas to see how well they could cooperate.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:11.080
And after moving together in synchrony, they
were better able, they could go further in

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.360
these games that required extreme cooperation.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.450
Something that has very direct relevance to
any sort of collective effort, certainly in

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.450
the business world.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.110
Moving together in time increases cooperation
and trust.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:28.760
Another study found that when you take rowers,
college level rowers and you have them row

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.150
either in synchrony or not in synchrony, they
did it in a rowing tank so they could measure

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.880
exactly how much force was being applied.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.370
They actually were able to deliver the same
amount of force, but then when they gave them

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.740
the pain tolerance test afterwards.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.910
Those that had rowed in synchrony were able
to withstand more pain.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.710
In other words, it changes the endorphin system
which would be adaptive if this is a reflex

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:51.990
for battle.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.930
Groups that move together in time can fight
together better, they can trust each other

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.500
better.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.910
So we're changing some relatively low level
aspects of brain chemistry that would prepare

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.320
individuals to be a part of a team in combat.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:09.140
Now in case you want any evidence that this
can be used in the corporate world, Japanese

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.610
companies have long used synchronous movement
in the morning to bind the group together.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.030
The Japanese corporate structure is very much
based on a hive model, a family model, not

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:24.010
so much competition within the group, but
fiercely competitive across companies.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.480
Synchrony has been used in the business world
for exactly this purpose.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.970
And actually, how many people have ever done
any sort of like team building exercise or

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.560
corporate retreat where they had you move
in synchrony, is this commonly done?

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.910
OK, ya it is often used, it's not studied
very much so we need to do better research

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:40.940
to find out if it really works.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.950
But I suspect that it does.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.320
So, here's one dramatic example of how, again,
how it's just people [unintelligible] this

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:57.660
is the All Blacks, New Zealand, one of the
premiere rugby teams.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:04.900
The All Blacks.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.720
[Sportscaster narrative]

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:33.850
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Watch their poor opponents
in the end.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:54.460
[crowd cheers][rugby players chant the Haka]
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haidt: So it's fun, it feels good

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.140
and there are reasons to believe that it actually
works to bind teams together more closely.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.940
So I want to make the point now that while
a corporation is always a super organism.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.580
In fact, the legal definition of a corporation,
going back to eighteenth century Dutch and

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.049
British law, is a group of people united into
one body.

00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:16.240
The word corporation literally means body.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.880
So Mitt Romney is not entirely wrong when
he says corporations are people, although

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.000
of course, it they are people they are a certain
kind of person that does not have much in

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.650
the way of moral sentiments in and of itself.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.540
But we won't go there.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:35.550
Alright, so, a corporation is always a super
organism, it is a kind of emergent entity.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.180
But I want to make it clear, I'm not saying
that they are hives, most are not.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.550
Very few are hives.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.270
There's a dimension of hivishness and even
within the same industry.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.842
So, here are some companies just from my limited
experience in the business world around or

00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:50.640
rather just teaching courses to people in
the business world.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.750
I hear from the students that some companies
are very much hivish; these are places where

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.390
they really feel one for all, all for one.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:04.510
I asked David on the way in, whether this
is really true about Google, what I've heard.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.730
Oh absolutely, right away from my first day
here it was clear that I could call up somebody

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.090
if I needed help and no matter how busy he
was, he would just help me.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.940
Even though there was nothing in it for him,
it wasn't his project.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.430
But everyone just has this sense that you
know, you help, you do what's needed.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.760
You do whatever another fellow employee needs.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.760
So like those bees, you function as an organism,
division of labor, but you're all in it together.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.360
So here are some companies that are known
for not quite being that way.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.620
So competition even, of course Amazon bought
Zappos and people at Zappos were concerned

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.440
that their corporate cultures would be very
different.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:46.770
But so far it seems as though Amazon has respected
their very, very different culture at Zappos.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:54.630
So, I think that there are some obvious benefits
of hivishness, just on its face now, I just

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.640
signed on at the Business School at NYU, so
I haven't done the front line research on

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.070
this directly but there are reasons to think
that hivishness is going to have these two

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.620
major, major benefits.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.530
The first is almost, by definition, higher
social capital.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.900
Social capital is an important concept from
sociology, popularized in the 1990s.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.220
It refers to the trust that is found in relationships.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.110
So if two companies have, if one company has
more financial capital than another, but everything

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:28.520
else is equal, more money in the bank is going
to let them beat out the other company.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.690
Similarly, if two companies are identical
and identical in financial capital, but one

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.740
has more social capital, that is, people can
do as David said you need help, you ask for

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.740
it, you get it.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.470
There's no backstabbing or there's no turf
guarding, that's social capital.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.700
If everything else is equal, that company
is going to beat out the other company.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.850
They're more efficient.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:54.200
So hivishness by definition is going to give
you higher social capital, which should generally

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.740
translate into higher productivity and flexibility.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.640
Management can make changes and assume that
people will trust them, go along with it,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.429
not fight over well, should we change.

00:29:04.429 --> 00:29:05.900
You're a team, you're like one body.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.750
When I say move to the left, my right hand
doesn't say "wait a second, what's in it for

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.750
me?"

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.760
Secondly, hivishness is going to give you
employee morale.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.400
It's just a lot more fun to work in a place
where everybody likes and trusts each other

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.910
and works as a team.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.429
So you get lower turnover.

00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:26.240
Turnover is extremely expensive for companies.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.880
And when people are fired, or when they leave
for any reason, they're much less likely to

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.490
sue if it's a hivish organization, were there
was much more trust.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.730
It makes it much easier to recruit, and once
people are here, it makes it harder to lure

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.730
them away.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.179
So hivishness has obvious benefits for companies.

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:46.760
Now it also surely has downsides and it depends
how you do it, so I'm not standing here saying

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.360
"Oh, every company should become more hivish."

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.270
I have no idea if that's true.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.590
But I do want to introduce these terms.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:56.000
I think it's helpful for people in the business
world to think about.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.600
So possible risks or downsides are at a certain
point you spend so much time playing drinking

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.250
games and charades and other things that they
do in some of these hivish companies.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:10.900
Billiards, what else do I see here Ping-Pong,
scooters, pogo sticks.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.059
At a certain point you spend so much time
that it will lower productivity.

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:20.860
Secondly, if you have that really hivish feeling
of love of the group, that could become sort

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.360
of toxic for outsiders.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.090
You could no longer care about other stake
holders, other people outside the company.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.930
Of course, if you have more group loyalty
then there might be more pressure to cover

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.929
up misdeeds, it would be harder to be a whistle
blower, perhaps.

00:30:35.929 --> 00:30:39.620
And lastly you could have more group think
if everybody is sort of on the same wave length

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.500
and people are emphasizing their similarity.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.390
On the other hand, at least what I heard at
Zappos, and what I've also heard from a student

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.970
of mine, Jesse Kluver who is a Marine, is
that when you have a really hivish group,

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.700
there is such trust and everybody values the
mission that actually, often what you have

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.230
is it's easier to speak up because everyone
trusts that you're not grandstanding, you

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.460
really have the interest of the group at heart.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:08.860
So, it's an open question when hivishness
will have a profile of benefits and when it

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.700
will have costs.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:16.450
Now, some advice on what one can do if you
have an organization, this is not just true

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:21.330
in the corporate world, this is any organization
any non-profit a soccer team, anything.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.870
Well, some of the basic ideas from classic
social psychology are that when people have

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.440
a sense of shared fate, and especially a sense
of shared sacrifice.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.470
We're all pulling together; we're all in the
same boat.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:37.820
That really brings out the bee in us; it really
brings out the cooperator in us.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.860
It's very important in any organization to
suppress free riders if there's a sense, because

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.980
in such an organization there's so much freedom.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.429
Anybody who wanted to could stock up on all
these snacks and go sell them on the street

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:52.059
corner if you wanted to.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:57.480
And anybody who did that would be violating
the group's trust.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:03.659
Any organization that lets free riders do
such things then suddenly activates more negative

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:06.780
psychology in everybody else, people don't
feel that they can trust each other.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.159
So free riders are really poisonous.

00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:12.100
It's crucial that free riders be punished
and punished quickly.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.790
But punishment doesn't have to involve spanking
or firing or anything else.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.960
Gossip is the normal human form of punishment.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.929
Gossip is actually, generally speaking a good
thing, especially in a hivish organization.

00:32:23.929 --> 00:32:27.929
Gossip gets a bad name because in junior high
school people tend to use it to destroy their

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:28.929
rivals.

00:32:28.929 --> 00:32:29.929
So that's ugly.

00:32:29.929 --> 00:32:37.070
But, what's been found, a study by Naft and
Wilson, looked at gossip on a crew team.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.559
And when you have a group working together
like that, most of the gossip was actually

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.429
who's shirking, who's not working out hard
enough.

00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:47.309
When people really care about the mission
of the group they tend to gossip in way that's

00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:52.190
will shame and punish those who are drifting
off and sort of pull them back in.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:57.170
So gossip is the front line of defense for
a healthy organization.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.809
Third, heightened similarity, anything that
makes you feel like you are all one will help

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:02.940
this feeling.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.720
So of course many companies emphasize diversity.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:12.309
It's important to emphasize diversity for
justice reasons and diversity especially of

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:16.000
perspectives, has many benefits for creativity.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.620
But I want to emphasize that to get trust
and cohesion, you don't want to tell everyone

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.679
oh, we're all so different and that's great,
you want to say we're all the same.

00:33:24.679 --> 00:33:28.400
And when you do that race stops mattering
because so many other things link you together.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.650
So, just think about emphasizing similarity
not diversity.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.690
Fourth point, synchrony moving together to
the extent possible, has been shown to have

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.830
these effects.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.900
Healthy competition is good.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:47.400
When you divide people into groups, they tend
to trust the people in their group more and

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.180
interestingly, they don't dislike the people
in the other group.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.860
So, are there any intramural competitions
here?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.960
Is there any time where you do group versus
group or division versus division here at

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960
Google?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.500
Do you ever do that?

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.659
I assume you don't then hate the people on
the other team?

00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:02.659
It's playful, it's fun.

00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:04.350
You get to work together more closely.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.559
So this is the classic social psych finding,
in-group love is not purchased at the cost

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:10.230
of out-group hate.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.999
Unless the competition gets really nasty,
and then it gets viciously tribal and that's

00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:15.889
where we are in the US Congress.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.849
But within a healthy company that's not what
happens.

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:24.170
Lastly, to the extent that you can say your
company is pursuing a noble mission, it's

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.240
much easier to inspire people.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.079
So at Zappos, for example, they don't talk
about selling shoes, they talk about their

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.589
mission is delivering happiness.

00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:34.149
They're a service company.

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:36.059
And Google is organizing the world's information.

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:37.419
Google is making our lives easier.

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:39.059
Google is doing all these wonderful things.

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:44.879
So, to the extent that one is thinking about
the culture of one's team or organization,

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:48.039
these are some pointers for how to make it
more hivish and cooperative.

00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:52.269
There are some specific things that leaders
can do, behaving in particular with integrity

00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:53.730
and charisma.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:57.170
A leader must be worth of respect, admiration
and perhaps even awe.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.410
Not necessarily but these things do help.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.749
Great leaders, such as Julius Caesar, inspired
their men because their followers could trust

00:35:04.749 --> 00:35:05.749
them.

00:35:05.749 --> 00:35:06.749
They looked up to them.

00:35:06.749 --> 00:35:10.440
One of the most important things about being
a leader or a boss is that people are willing

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.680
to cede you authority and to follow you as
long as they trust that you really are out

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.869
for the good of the group.

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:21.789
As soon as they get the sense that you're
a self-aggrandizer, that you're out for yourself

00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:27.200
or you've got your favorites and you're out
for your faction and not going to help the

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.510
other members of team, then they'll turn against
you very, very quickly.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:35.460
So an important part of leadership is impartiality,
fairness, people really have to trust you,

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.460
that you're really impartial.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.799
And then they will accept decisions from you
that work against their self-interest.

00:35:41.799 --> 00:35:45.530
Self-sacrifice is crucial, that leaders sacrifice
when times are tough.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:50.680
I was at a, there was a positive psychology
conference, a month after 9/11 and corporate

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:57.569
CEO got up and said to this room of 300 psychologists
"We, the business community, we are on the

00:35:57.569 --> 00:35:59.329
front line in the fight against terror."

00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:02.810
Which seems to me to be incredibly pompous
when we are sending troops over to Afghanistan

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.320
to actually fight and face bullets, but anyway.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.839
So, "we CEOs are on the front line of the
fight against terror, and we need ideas from

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:15.480
you as to what we can do and how we can win
this fight" So I stood up and I said "Well,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:21.520
we've just gone through the 90s when CEO pay
skyrocketed as profits were going up.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.369
Now the economies turned and 9/11's pushed
us down further, profits are dropping, pay

00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:26.369
is dropping.

00:36:26.369 --> 00:36:31.989
So, I would think if CEOs would take a massive
cut in pay on the way down, that would inspire

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:34.520
more cooperation and help you win the fight
against terror."

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.520
[Audience laughs]

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jonathan Haidt: He says "That isn't
helpful, any other suggestions?"

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.339
[laughter] So anyway, shared sacrifice.

00:36:42.339 --> 00:36:49.079
And lastly eloquence, history books are full
of times when a battle turned or the history

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:53.569
of the world turned on one person giving an
inspiring and eloquent speech that rallied

00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:56.869
others to work or fight their hardest.

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:02.450
So to conclude, we have this story about human
beings being fundamentally selfish.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:08.259
And certainly businesses and business people
being fundamentally selfish and while I think

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:11.269
there is a little bit of truth to this, this
story does work in some corners of the business

00:37:11.269 --> 00:37:12.269
world.

00:37:12.269 --> 00:37:14.969
And right now we're all trying to figure out
whether the finance business, the finance

00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:18.650
industry is different from the rest of the
corporate world where they actually make things

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.009
that are of use to people.

00:37:21.009 --> 00:37:24.329
Finance does seem to be plagued by many more
problems than other areas of the business

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:25.329
world.

00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:31.219
But I'd like to replace this idea of human
nature with this idea: that we are both selfish

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:37.509
and cooperative, we are selfish and groupish,
and I think this is not just a more inspiring

00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:41.099
of what we are but I think it's actually a
true vision.

00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:43.490
Thank you very much.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.599
[Applause]

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:52.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We have time for questions,
so if you're interested come up to the microphone

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.719
and ask away.

00:37:54.719 --> 00:38:01.469
&gt;&gt;male #1: So you've made some pretty compelling
arguments about the benefits of hivishness

00:38:01.469 --> 00:38:04.029
and the human propensity for hivishness.

00:38:04.029 --> 00:38:08.999
And given those benefits, it seems reasonable
that people would have this psychological

00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:10.690
propensity.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:18.119
But we all know that evolution is not a teleological
mechanism that seeks long term global optimization-

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:19.119
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Not at all.

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:22.759
&gt;&gt;male #1: -and in fact you cited the fact
that a lot of the insects have to adopt these

00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:28.690
very strange genetic patterns into their hives
in order to make it evolutionarily stable

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.609
strategy for them to behave that way.

00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:36.249
You said at the beginning you didn't really
want to dive into the whole issue about individual

00:38:36.249 --> 00:38:39.710
versus group selectionism, but I just have
one sort of top-level question-

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Sure.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.390
&gt;&gt;male #1: -which is, do you think it's necessary
to invoke group selectionism to explain the

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.210
human propensity for hivish behavior?

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Well yes, a great question.

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:52.229
Is it necessary to invoke group selection?

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:54.000
I think it's not necessary.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.759
There are some very clever explanations as
to why we're so groupish, that rely on individual

00:38:57.759 --> 00:38:58.759
level selection.

00:38:58.759 --> 00:39:03.670
That is individuals who could show off that
they were good team players would be rewarded

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.680
and trusted more and therefore they would
benefit.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.690
But part of the reason why I'm attracted to
ideas about multi-level selection that is:

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.609
human nature was shaped in part by group versus
group competition, is that there's all this

00:39:14.609 --> 00:39:19.930
weird stuff we do that's very hard to explain
as something that will redound to my personal

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:20.930
benefit.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:26.769
For example, after 9/11 there was sort of
the 'rally around the flag' effect.

00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:31.670
And it's kind of hard to explain that people
who rally around the flag and had this urge

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:38.109
to support the leader that they beat out the
other ones who had less of that urge.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:41.509
A better example I think would be the urge
to kill traitors and apostates.

00:39:41.509 --> 00:39:43.019
So what you do with it.

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:46.009
A traitor is worse than an enemy, in many
religious books and in many societies.

00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:49.799
A traitor, there's only thing you have to
do with a traitor, you have to kill them.

00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:55.749
Now, do we suppose this urge to kill traitors
came about because long ago individuals who

00:39:55.749 --> 00:39:59.019
killed their traitorous neighbors had more
children than individuals who hung back and

00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:00.220
didn't kill their traitorous neighbors?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.709
There's just a lot of really tribal groupish
stuff, initiation rites, a lot of weird stuff

00:40:04.709 --> 00:40:09.979
we do that makes perfect sense if you think
that our genes came down to us in part by

00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:13.430
being lodged in successful groups.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.359
It's being currently fought out, nobody has
a knock down argument but I think the total

00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:23.380
picture of human nature is more consilient
with group selection than with individual

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.190
selection.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:33.329
&gt;&gt;male #2: You mentioned searching out and
destroying traitors just now and that kind

00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:35.950
of gets at what I was going to ask.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:41.969
What about when the hive sort of goes off
track and I was sitting there thinking a little

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:43.839
about like Salem witch trials.

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:49.930
You mentioned bullies in school, what happens
when you have a mob?

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.799
A hive turns into a mob?

00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:53.359
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Right, right.

00:40:53.359 --> 00:40:57.239
So I take an ecological view of human evolution.

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:03.029
That is if you think about a total ecosystem
and there's lots of niches then there all

00:41:03.029 --> 00:41:05.249
these creatures in the niches.

00:41:05.249 --> 00:41:09.529
Most of those creatures are individual animals
but some of them are groups.

00:41:09.529 --> 00:41:15.089
So if we think about religion, so in my book
I developed at great lengths ideas from David

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:16.559
Sloan Wilson and others.

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:20.910
That religion is an adaptation for binding
groups together for intergroup conflict.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:26.680
That means that religion in its original tribal
form is very much about getting people to

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.829
trust each other, develop virtues that will
help maximize their productivity and especially

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:35.130
make them more fit, or at least wipe out or,
at least, out compete neighboring groups.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.640
Not a very pretty picture.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.359
And in many parts of the world, as the new
atheists love to document, religions look

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:42.829
sort of that way.

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:46.740
But in the American ecosystem, things are
very, very different.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.140
In America, we've had a free market in religion
since the beginning.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.299
And especially for Protestants who shift around
quite a lot, between sects.

00:41:54.299 --> 00:41:57.829
So they all have to be good at marketing and
they all have to be appealing and if you go

00:41:57.829 --> 00:42:02.119
to a church, and I'm a Jewish atheist but
I assign my students to go to various, you

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.500
know far right or far left churches.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.969
I had to do it myself.

00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:09.130
You go in there and everyone is so welcoming,
so nice wherever you go.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:13.380
In the American ecosystem, nasty tribal religions
don't propagate.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.940
But nicer ones do.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.880
So in our ecology, religion actually turns
out to be a great benefit overall.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.489
So there's a book called "American Grace"
by Putnam and Campbell where they just look

00:42:24.489 --> 00:42:28.410
at whether religions have a net benefit to
society.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.989
And they conclude that in America at least,
they really, really do.

00:42:30.989 --> 00:42:36.180
So even though this stuff emerged in ways
that could have all kinds of negative externalities,

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.829
depending on the ecosystem, it can actually
be quite positive.

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:40.010
There are lots of externalities.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:44.770
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:48.480
So when Steven Pinker was here, he was talking
about his theory about the history of violence

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.849
and it's declining in human society-

00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:50.849
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: -yes-

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:52.040
&gt;&gt;female #1: - and he brought up this idea
of moral circles-

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: -yes-

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.119
&gt;&gt;female #1:- like that us has sort of expanded
outward in time.

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:59.730
It used to be maybe just our family, then
just our tribe then our nation and then the

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:02.109
groups get bigger and bigger.

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:03.509
And I'm sorry, I'm blanking on the philosopher-

00:43:03.509 --> 00:43:04.509
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: -Peter Singer-

00:43:04.509 --> 00:43:05.829
&gt;&gt;female #1: - Peter Singer.

00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:10.630
So how do you think that dovetails with your
idea about groupishness and hivishness?

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.630
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Yes.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.630
So, groupishness.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.970
We get more groupish when we're attacked.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.779
And after 9/11 we got a lot more groupish,
I think everybody thought there's going to

00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:22.529
be anti-Muslim violence and there wasn't,
to the credit of Americans' generally tolerant

00:43:22.529 --> 00:43:23.529
nature.

00:43:23.529 --> 00:43:29.839
But, war and intergroup conflict shrinks the
circle and makes us more competitive whereas

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:32.499
peace and prosperity lets that sort fade away.

00:43:32.499 --> 00:43:36.950
Also, intergroup contact trade and travel,
which keep going up, thin that out.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.999
So I think that Pinker is absolutely right,
violence is declining.

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:44.510
There are many reasons for that and one of
the reasons he cites is actually trade and

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.650
commerce.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:51.900
Because trade and commerce makes you not care
at all what those people eat or how they have

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900
sex.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.249
Just, do they have the goods and will they
honor their contract?

00:43:54.249 --> 00:43:58.229
And this is why, to this day, Amsterdam is
one of the most tolerant places on earth.

00:43:58.229 --> 00:44:03.019
Because it was the origin of this kind of
new modern global trade.

00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:12.029
So, I think Pinker is right and as the internet
has helped us see more interact with people

00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:14.569
more globally, it is thinning this stuff out.

00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:18.289
The other piece of the story that Pinker mentions
is strengthening institutions.

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:22.789
This groupishness, this hivishness, works
well to structure groups when there is no

00:44:22.789 --> 00:44:29.130
police forces, no courts but as you get stronger
institutions, you can weaken this tribalism,

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.130
this hivishness.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:34.779
And the Scandinavian countries are the forefront
in world history of having effective civil

00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:38.329
institutions and ever decreasing groupishness.

00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:41.089
So it's possible to have a very humane society
without it.

00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:45.180
But, people need groups, people thrive in
groups and so it remains to be seen whether

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.209
you can healthier or less healthy forms in
America.

00:44:48.209 --> 00:44:53.119
&gt;&gt;male #3: There's been some research that
suggests that there's sort of an inbuilt limit

00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:57.339
in the number of other primates that we can
consider part of our group.

00:44:57.339 --> 00:44:58.339
Dunbar's Number?

00:44:58.339 --> 00:45:02.039
Do you think there's a similar limit for how
large we can find our hive to be?

00:45:02.039 --> 00:45:04.019
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Right, that's a good
question.

00:45:04.019 --> 00:45:07.789
So the Dunbar Number is one hundred fifty,
there's not been any firm research on it but

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:13.269
the basic idea is that there's a certain number
of people that we can know personally.

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:16.451
But not just know personally, because you
can know a thousand people personally, but

00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:19.740
know how everybody is connected to everybody
else.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.059
And once you get above one hundred and fifty,
that's very hard.

00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:25.380
So that's kind of a natural break point for
human groups.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.200
But one of the cool things about human social
cognition is that it's recursive.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.849
So there's this Arab proverb: "Me against
my brother, me and my brother against our

00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:36.479
cousin, me and my brother and cousin against
the stranger."

00:45:36.479 --> 00:45:40.079
And, the US military uses this beautifully.

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:41.700
There's competition at every level.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.719
Everybody is competing with everybody.

00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:49.499
But within the lowest level, you know they'll
compete within a patrol; they'll then cooperate

00:45:49.499 --> 00:45:52.670
to compete against the next patrol and all
the way up until the Marines are competing

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:53.670
against the Navy.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:59.109
And then of course in war, the whole US Military
is competing against another military organization.

00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:04.619
So, there is no limit to how high we can go
as long as there's someone on the other side.

00:46:04.619 --> 00:46:09.529
So there will never be a human hive until
either we're attacked by Mars or we get serious

00:46:09.529 --> 00:46:11.530
and declare war on those goddamn mosquitoes.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:12.530
[Laughter]

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:18.049
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I'm interested in the same topic,
the scale at which this groupishness can operate.

00:46:18.049 --> 00:46:22.109
I just joined Google a few weeks ago and I'd
be surprised if I knew somebody in this room.

00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:26.440
And so you showed slides of people moving
together, so I wonder if I signed up for like

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.930
an aerobics class here at Google, but I didn't
happen to know anybody else in the class and

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.400
after I was done and I came back to my group,
is that gonna foster groupishness?

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.630
In me, or do I have to actually know the people
I'm moving with?

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.859
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Thank you, that is exactly
the experiment I would like to run, I will

00:46:39.859 --> 00:46:42.310
credit you when I run it, that is something
that we need to do.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:47.219
But my hypothesis would be, that if you simply
exercise with people that you don't know and

00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:54.660
don't see again, that would be enough to foster
or facilitate your integration into this company.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.890
So it should work at that very minimal level.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:01.109
Secondly, if you do at least recognize the
people that you're moving with and then you

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:04.720
see them in some other context, or at a party,
you would be able to strike up a conversation

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.529
more easily.

00:47:06.529 --> 00:47:12.109
And third, if you took one division of Google
and sort of encouraged it, you can't force

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:16.340
people or you'll get reactance, but you encourage
one division to do a lot of this stuff and

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.859
another one to not do it.

00:47:17.859 --> 00:47:22.390
My prediction would be that you would see
a measurable bump up, depends on the outcome

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:27.000
measure, but for certain tasks that require
trust and ability to work together, you would

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
see it.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.029
So that's the hypothesis, we don't know yet
whether it's true.

00:47:30.029 --> 00:47:32.880
&gt;&gt;Male#5: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:41.579
I sort of have two questions, about intention
and consciously doing, consciously acting.

00:47:41.579 --> 00:47:45.880
So both when you're looking at sort of selfish
actions or groupish actions.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.690
How much does it matter whether those are,
you're trying to be selfish or trying to be

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.109
groupish versus it just being the subconscious?

00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:54.619
Like, does that even come into play?

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:55.619
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Right.

00:47:55.619 --> 00:48:04.790
&gt;&gt;Male#6: And sort of semi-relatedly for groups
or hives, what is intention?

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:10.570
Previous question about when the hive starts
to drift away, you know, that's sort of the

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.170
hives will is sort of drifting.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:20.290
You were talking about a leader sort of having
a role in sort of defining the direction of

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:21.299
a group.

00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:27.709
How much is sort of emergent, no one's really
trying to apply a direction versus how much

00:48:27.709 --> 00:48:30.529
is really just an individual applying their
own will.

00:48:30.529 --> 00:48:31.729
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: OK, thank you.

00:48:31.729 --> 00:48:32.930
That's given us two good questions.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:38.749
So the first, I deliberately said 90% chimp
10% bee, not 50/50.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:44.089
Because we are very, very concerned with our
self-interests and especially our reputation.

00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:46.030
So a lot of cooperation is for show.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.619
A lot of cooperation is because people are
watching.

00:48:48.619 --> 00:48:53.910
And if there's no monitoring and you're relying
only on people's team spirit and they can

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:58.249
get away with anything they want, research
shows that most people tend to cheat more

00:48:58.249 --> 00:49:00.779
than they even realize that they are doing.

00:49:00.779 --> 00:49:06.759
So some of it is for show and a well set up
organization is one in which people will do

00:49:06.759 --> 00:49:08.441
good and get credit for it.

00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:12.900
To the reputation you want, to harness reputational
concerns as much as you can.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:18.640
As for the extent to which a leader is making
it happen versus letting it happening organically,

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.869
I think a good metaphor is gardening or maybe
more like forestry.

00:49:23.869 --> 00:49:30.509
You can manage an ecosystem, but it's very
hard to just create one from scratch.

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.789
You have to let it grow to some extent.

00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:35.459
And this to the extent that I'm very interested
in liberal and conservative ideas.

00:49:35.459 --> 00:49:40.329
I am dispositionally a liberal, I think there
are problems, we can solve them.

00:49:40.329 --> 00:49:43.740
But I've been very persuaded by conservative
critiques that say that liberal efforts to

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.380
just come in and impose a new system tend
to fail.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.140
And I think the way to think about social
engineering is more like ecosystem management.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.430
If you come in and say well, we're going to
have a whole new way of supporting children

00:49:54.430 --> 00:50:00.319
or marriage or anything and you put something
new in place, you get all kinds of invasive

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:01.319
species as it were.

00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:02.989
You get all kinds of things you didn't expect.

00:50:02.989 --> 00:50:07.299
But yet you can still influence Yellowstone
Park, you just can't raze it to the ground

00:50:07.299 --> 00:50:08.749
and plant it from scratch.

00:50:08.749 --> 00:50:12.299
So I think a good leader is someone who is
a little modest about what can be done but

00:50:12.299 --> 00:50:15.959
sort of tries to get organic processes growing
and then you can still direct them to some

00:50:15.959 --> 00:50:18.670
extent.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:19.670
Where are we on time?

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:24.690
Oh, it's been almost an hour; I guess we have
time for one or two more questions?

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.870
We've got 5 more minutes.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.180
&gt;&gt; Male#7: I guess more along those lines
– Can you have a hive without a leader?

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.839
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Can you have a hive
without a leader?

00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:33.599
Yes, I think you can.

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:34.989
Bees certainly do, there's no leader in a
beehive.

00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:38.569
The queen is just the ovary, she's not the
leader.

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:44.880
In a street gang or any group of friends,
yes, they can definitely be hivish, if they're

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.880
small.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.150
I think it'd be very hard to have a large
hive without a leader.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.150
[cellphone rings]

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:55.170
And this is one difficulty I see with Occupy
Wall Street, it's very, it's an intensely

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:58.869
idealistic group, very committed to horizontality.

00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:03.009
That's where their emphasis on horizontality,
very afraid, very opposed to having leaders.

00:51:03.009 --> 00:51:08.249
So it can happen but it makes it very, very
hard for them to get anything done.

00:51:08.249 --> 00:51:12.869
I was at a Occupy Wall Street meeting where
they were trying to draft their vision statement.

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:17.450
And you know they had to do it by consensus,
and consensus means unanimous.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:22.920
And it just goes on month after month because
it's very hard to get a unanimous statement.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.440
So yes, you can have a hive without a leader
but if you want to get things done, good leadership

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.440
helps.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.259
And especially if it's a large group, yeah,
I think you have to.

00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:35.940
&gt;&gt;Female#2: So thank you for coming here.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:43.319
Talking about leadership, I'm just reading
a Steve Jobs' biography and there is repetitive

00:51:43.319 --> 00:51:48.670
mention of his reality distortion and how
finicky he was, so I'd like to hear your views

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:49.999
about his leadership and the psychology you
talked about.

00:51:49.999 --> 00:51:56.839
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: So I haven't read the
book, I don't know much about Steve Jobs but

00:51:56.839 --> 00:52:00.569
I do want to reiterate the point – that
a company can be extremely good and extremely

00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:03.210
profitable without being a hive.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.950
And you know, apparently Jobs was not a very
nice guy.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:10.509
Does anybody know whether Apple was a hivish
place like Google, where there's very little

00:52:10.509 --> 00:52:11.589
backstabbing, or politics?

00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:12.670
Does anyone know?

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:13.670
Yeah?

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.670
What is it?

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:15.670
No?

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:16.670
OK.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.569
[Audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: No.

00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:20.299
OK Alright, so.

00:52:20.299 --> 00:52:24.990
Their trick was incredible devotion to good
design.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.299
And that made them the most profitable, one
of the most profitable companies in history.

00:52:29.299 --> 00:52:31.030
You don't have to be a hive to be successful.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.239
You don't have to be a hive to change the
world.

00:52:33.239 --> 00:52:36.690
But it's a lot nicer to work in a place where
people are hivish.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:41.650
&gt;&gt;Female#2: Yeah, but how does a leadership
like that work?

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:45.869
Where there is a lack of trust, there is a
lack of you know-

00:52:45.869 --> 00:52:46.869
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: mmm hmm.

00:52:46.869 --> 00:52:47.869
Yeah.

00:52:47.869 --> 00:52:48.869
&gt;&gt;Female#2: - there is a lot of favoritism.
[computer beeps]

00:52:48.869 --> 00:52:49.869
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: Yes, that's right.

00:52:49.869 --> 00:52:50.869
Well, so I don't know much.

00:52:50.869 --> 00:52:52.880
There's a gigantic field of leadership studies
– ahh, oh my computer just shut off – but

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.709
one of, it's a vast field, I don't know much
about it.

00:52:55.709 --> 00:52:58.770
But the terms – oh, here it is, there we
are, my computer somehow knew what I wanted

00:52:58.770 --> 00:52:59.770
to show.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:00.770
[Audience chuckles]

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:05.410
&gt;&gt;Dr. Jonathan Haidt: One of the pair of terms
is transactional leadership versus transformational

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:06.720
leadership.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.749
Transactional leadership basically says: let's
align interests, I want you to do X and I

00:53:11.749 --> 00:53:14.029
will pay you more to do X.

00:53:14.029 --> 00:53:19.079
So you can have a very effective company if
you align incentives and pay people for it.

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:23.480
You're sort of leaving money on the table,
as it were, in that people are actually willing

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.559
to do a lot of stuff, not just for pay if
they get a sense of meaning and connection

00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:28.930
and happiness from it.

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:33.410
So it can work, and most companies, as I said
most companies are wolf packs, not hives.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:37.599
So think about what you're doing and what
style is right for your organization.

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:40.880
And there are many ways to run a successful
organization.

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.920
OK, I think that's 1 o'clock.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.380
Thank you all for your attention.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:45.609
[Applause]
