00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.061
Hey it's me Destin and welcome back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:05.843
So I was challenged by Grant Thompson to do the Ice Bucket Challenge

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.560
and I want to do a video that's: smart, and teaches you something

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:09.216
, that's fun to watch

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:13.318
and something that actually ends up giving a lot of money to the ALS Research Cause.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.760
We've got this dry ice, 'cause that's what Grant did

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.280
We're gonna put dry ice here in the, uh...

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.900
In the bucket.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.800
We've got a phantom running about 1000 frames per second

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.740
Is this a good idea‽ -laughs-

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.240
(No)

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.280
It's not a good idea...

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
(bubbles)

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.780
Ha, are you ready ?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.600
Do you wanna trigger it?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.940
Okay, so here we go

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.680
ALS does affect your ability to react...

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.180
 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.040
I don't really want to do this now...

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.760
Okay, so here we go

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.560
(sploosh)

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.600
(children laughing)

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.374
Yea it's funny, daddy's wet. Isn't it!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.920
Okay my part is now done, now time for a little pseudoscience

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.640
Just for fun

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.260
What we're gonna do is test the reaction times for 4 different animals

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.440
As you know ALS affects the ability of nerves to fire muscles.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.080
So we're gonna remove the ice so there's no danger to the animals at all,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120
and just put, just a little bit of water in there

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.340
so we can just startle them

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.700
Maybe splash beside them?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.980
and see which ones react the fastest

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.320
This should be pretty fun!

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.700
Okay, take it and put some water in there

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520
Yea, go put water in it!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.140
First animal up:

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.260
My two-year-old son!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.880
(laughs)

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.460
Are you ready to get wet?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.660
Here you go!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.260
Come here Buckshot!

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.420
Isn't that food good‽

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.800
(laughs)

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.300
She doesn't care!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.180
Okay, now we're gonna test an old cat

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.260
Very good, Old Cat!

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.460
Man, look at all that food!

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.000
Lot of food, don't you like food, Speckles

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.460
(cluck cluck cluck cluck)

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.820
Okay, lets compare

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.640
Okay, in the end I hope you realised that:

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.120
This was an educational video

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.140
and you leaned something about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.840
or ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.920
I hope it was entertaining,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.580
I had fun, I hope you did too

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.480
And number three

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
I hope you recognize that we're gonna convert whisker shaving to scientific reasearch

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.640
to help people

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.140
(plop)

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.960
Okay, this time we're gonna let it get really really cold

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.440
with the dry ice before we drop it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.080
so,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.720
While we are doing that let me explain to you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.280
how I'm actually gonna donate to ALS reasearch

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.380
I was listening to my favourite pod cast: Hello Internet

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.840
when my friend, Brady, did an ad for this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.760
which is Harry's Razors

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640
It's a really cool razor subscription service

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.420
that I use after I listened to him on Hello Internet talk about it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.715
I really like it and I've taken it all over the world with me

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.960
So, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day go to...

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.020
Harry's.com and you get subscription razors, like this

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300
just do that, that one falls off you get another one

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.540
you're good to go, it's really awesome, I really like it

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.300
use that promo code SMARTER, they'll give you $5 off

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.320
I'm gonna use this money to help you donate to ALS

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.800
this should be cold now, let's do it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.820
here we go!

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.380
(splash)

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.680
all right, there you go

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.160
if you're interested... uhh, go to harry's.com and use the promo code SMARTER

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.460
if I recommend it to you, and you do it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.160
we can convert whisker shaving into scientific reasearch

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.540
which is pretty cool

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720
by all means, don't let it stop you from donating straight up to ALS research

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.480
however, I like the product

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.080
and, if that gets more money into ALS reasearch

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.920
I'm all about it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.520
so if you're interested go to harry's.com

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.700
use the promo code smarter

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.920
and you'll get a discount and I'll get cred for doing it

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.140
and maybe in the future they'll sponsor me and I can use it for other stuff

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.400
But for now...

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.120
harry's.com, the promo code SMARTER

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.160
I'm Destin and you're getting smarter every day

Have a good one!
