00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.550
This is Jocko podcast number 57 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.993
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.390
<v 0>If the outcome of the battle is favorable,</v>

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.480
one should not be satisfied with merely driving the enemy back.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.090
This is a mistake made by inexperienced leaders who do not know how to take

7
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:30.091
advantage of an opportunity and who like to hear the saying be victorious,

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.250
but do not press your victory too hard

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.940
by not seizing the opportunity.

10
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.230
These people only cause themselves in more trouble and place the ultimate

11
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:42.520
results in doubt.

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.180
There can be no rest until the enemy is completely destroyed.

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.290
If they seek refuge behind fortifications,

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.150
apply pressure by direct force or by preventing them from getting more supplies

15
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:03.151
for men and horses until they are annihilated or else agree to a treaty to our

16
00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:05.254
advantage,

17
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.950
one should not slacking after driving them back just a short distance nor after

18
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:18.761
so much hard work and the dangers of war should one jeopardize the success of

19
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.720
the whole campaign

20
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.060
because of lack of persistence.

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.620
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

22
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.210
Now that's some direction there on how to pursue your enemy until they are

23
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.840
completely destroyed

24
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.680
and that direction comes from a book called

25
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.900
strategic on a book that's normally a credited to a guy by the name of Flavius

26
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.370
Mauritius Tiberias Augustus or as he is more commonly called Maurice Emperor

27
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.610
and he was the emperor of eastern room,
which is what we now call Byzantine,

28
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.460
a term that wasn't even created until the 16th century,

29
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.970
but Maurice wasn't Roman emperor who started his journey as a soldier,

30
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
a general who campaigns successfully against the Persians,

31
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.650
the avatars,

32
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:40.651
the lombards all over Persia and the Balkans and basically around the

33
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.340
Mediterranean Sea and his military experience served them well and this is the

34
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.300
book that he's credited with Andy Unit.

35
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.380
He details a variety of the mindset of the famous Roman Legion and what ahead

36
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.083
evolve too,

37
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
especially as they adopted the strengths of their enemies.

38
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

39
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.400
<v 0>and transitioned to use horses along with the use of Lance's and spears and bow</v>

40
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.830
and Arrow in swords.
Again,
all these things that you'd be using them all together

41
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.370
much as we do today,
what we call combined arms,

42
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.700
which is when we attack from the sea and from the air,

43
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.570
we land forces and we dropped bombs and we use artillery.

44
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:39.430
We use everything to lock people,
get people in the combined arms dilemma,

45
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.370
my favorite ideas

46
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.770
and something that's that combined arms dilemma.

47
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.890
It's when you're getting attacked with all these from all these different

48
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:53.050
positions,
it's very hard to contend with.
And obviously the,

49
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.890
they were able to do this as they adapt the different their enemies,

50
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.090
they adapted what they use,
but then they use them together.
And so this book,

51
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.380
Maurice's book,
Strategic Con,
captures a lot of those ideas.

52
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.810
I know it's no surprise,
but a lot of these ideas remain pertinent today.

53
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.430
And I know it's no surprise,
but not only on the battlefield,

54
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.850
but also in business and in life

55
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.830
and famous historian Charles Oh mom said about the Byzantine armies in courage.

56
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.740
They were equal to their enemies in discipline,

57
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.060
organization and armament,
far superior.

58
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.703
<v 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.963
<v 0>And we go into the,</v>

60
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.870
go into the introduction in this book a little bit here because there's some

61
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:48.790
good information to know about.
And here we go.

62
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.200
From the,
from the introduction to the book,

63
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.190
they inherited the long tradition of Roman tactics and strategy with its

64
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.990
emphasis on constant adaptation to the changing of war.

65
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.690
It was largely this remarkable ability to adapt to new situations and new

66
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:10.460
peoples,
which guaranteed the Byzantine military success gotta be adaptable.

67
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.370
The Byzantines moreover,

68
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.430
like the Romans took warfare very seriously for the Byzantines war was an art to

69
00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:22.730
be practiced by professionals.

70
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.420
They possessed books on all aspects of warfare,

71
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.710
which were collected,
copied over and over again

72
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.803
<v 2>and red.</v>

73
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.450
<v 0>The fact that officers in the Byzantine army had to be able to read and write by</v>

74
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:43.750
itself sets it apart from other medieval armies.

75
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.550
So obviously we do a lot of reading over here in this tradition,

76
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.770
right?
This is what set them apart.

77
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.800
One of the things that set them apart was the fact that they read and they

78
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:57.130
collected books on this subject.

79
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.020
Byzantine General's carefully studied the habits and tactics of their enemies.

80
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.000
Whereas Western nights found themselves at a loss when facing an unknown foes.

81
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.320
The western European considered himself a good warrior.

82
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.790
If he could ride and wheeled his weapons well,
and if he showed no fear.
Okay,

83
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.600
so that's cool.
You can ride and you can,

84
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.580
you can wield your web as well and you show no fear.
For the Byzantine,

85
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.120
it was not superior strength or courage which won battles.

86
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:28.400
But after God's favor,

87
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.250
thorough planning and intelligence,

88
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.250
nothing could be left to chance.

89
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.060
Marise twice reminds his readers that the Byzantine general should never have to

90
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:45.090
admit.
I did not expect that.

91
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.860
Now let's get,
so that's,

92
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.690
that's just from the introduction kind of getting into the book and now we'll go

93
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.810
to the actual book and I'm not going to go into the whole thing of who actually

94
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.990
put these words on the paper.
Again,
it's credited to Maurice,

95
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.890
but did someone else possibly write it and he blessed it?

96
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.460
Did he tell someone right it,
did he have a ghost writer?
I don't know,

97
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.820
but he's the guy that's credited as having the brains behind it.

98
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.190
Starting off here.
The training and drilling of the individual soldier,

99
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.450
he should be trained to shoot rapidly on foot either in the Roman or the Persian

100
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.250
manner.
Speed is important in shaking the Arrow loosened,

101
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.850
discharging it with force.

102
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.740
This is essential and should be practiced while mounted.
In fact,

103
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.520
even when the Arrow is well aimed firing slowly as useless,

104
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.890
he should practice shooting rapidly on foot from a certain distance at a spear

105
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.860
or some other target person that you're shooting at a spear with a bow and
Arrow.

106
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.110
He should shoot also rapidly mounted on his horse at a run to the front,

107
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.540
the rear right and left.

108
00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:01.460
He should practice leaping onto the horse on horseback at a run.

109
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.900
He should fire one or two wars rap arrows rapidly and put the string,

110
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.880
the strong bow in its case.

111
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.570
If it is wide enough or in the half case designed for this purpose and then you

112
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:15.950
should grab the spear which he has been carrying on his back with the strong bow

113
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:16.611
in its case,

114
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.520
he should hold the spear in his hand and quickly replaced on his back and

115
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.354
grabbed the bow.

116
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.860
Is a good idea for soldiers to practice all of this while mounted on the march

117
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:27.560
in their own country for such exercises,

118
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:30.530
do not interfere with marching and do not wear out the horses.

119
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.570
The reason I had to put this in here,

120
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.740
this cause this is very much what we do in the seal teams.
And you're shooting,

121
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.320
you're shooting off hand,
which means you're shooting with your weekend.

122
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.500
We reloading magazines with only one hand.
So you've got to put the,

123
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.170
put the weapon between your legs,
you gotta pull them bags,

124
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.390
you're doing all this stuff,
you're shooting while you're running,

125
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:48.290
you're shooting while you're laying down,

126
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:49.520
you're shooting while you're behind a vehicle,

127
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.890
you're shooting from inside a vehicle,
you're shooting from outside of vehicle.

128
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.920
You're,
you're doing all these things,
all these different ways all the time.

129
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.210
Because the better you get in all these strange situations,

130
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.010
the better you're gonna perform.
Any strange situations,

131
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.820
and you can apply this to any,
you know,
a busy enough talked about this before.

132
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.900
When you're dealing with business,

133
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.380
you want to train your people so they can handle these weird situations.

134
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.220
You know,
be a bad customer.
You don't pretend to be the be a bad.

135
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.010
And if you've got leaders that you're trading,
be a pourable employee,

136
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.590
be that person,
put them to the test.

137
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.800
How are they going to handle employee that flies off the handle?

138
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.100
How are they going to handle employee that doesn't fly off the handle at all?

139
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.430
Verbal but just goes cold of what are you going to do now?

140
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.230
How are you going to handle this person?
Yeah.

141
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.810
I remember you guys were doing at the muster,
you guys are doing that.

142
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.430
You did that role playing thing real quick.
It was like real quick too.
And Yeah,

143
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.820
when I caught Lafe off guard.
Yeah.
Oh,
you're going to role play.
All right,

144
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:45.450
let's do this.
Oh Yeah,
when you've presented the little,
yeah.
But man,

145
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.590
that was such a good point though,
because you go through one situation,
right?

146
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:50.760
And the guy liked is like,

147
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:54.180
I don't got time for you or whatever is however years went and then you're like,

148
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:57.600
okay.
And you get to,
you get to put yourself through a potential situation.

149
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.250
And then at the end of it you said,
okay,
look,

150
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.550
we just went through that and we did it.
And you know,
maybe there was problems,

151
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.510
maybe not,
but now you're familiar with it.
Kind of like the lights are on now.

152
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.260
You're not going live into a dark room,
not knowing,
you know,

153
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.320
you're doing exactly what Marie said to do here,

154
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.120
which is the most important thing is intelligence.

155
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.730
So it's combining what he's saying,
right.

156
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.000
The more you prepare for that in that particular situation,
that live life.

157
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.980
And I did that little roleplay on.
Yeah.

158
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.510
He acted like he was a company commander that didn't have time for me.
Yeah.

159
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.580
And he took it to the next level and said,

160
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.500
I don't have time for you because I got guys in combat.
Right.

161
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.380
And I've gotten troops in contact,
which is,
you know,

162
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:35.400
when you've got troops in contact,

163
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.660
that's where everyone's going to focus on that.

164
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.410
So I'm in there playing this young seal officer going,
excuse me,
captain.
Hey,

165
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:41.580
I'd like to talk to you about an operation.

166
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:45.810
We're going to do in your area of operations tonight.
Leif says,
Hey,
I'm busy.

167
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.030
I got troops in contact.
Leave me alone.
Yeah.

168
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.500
And I was kind of taken aback and I said,
sir,
sir,
you know what?

169
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:55.050
Can you just tell me where your ops officers?
And I'll go talk to him.

170
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.690
And that was it.
I overcame it because what else are you going to do?

171
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.380
But it took me a second.
I had to think on my feet.
If that ever happened again,

172
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.060
I would have to think on my feet and I have the answer.

173
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.090
And you went through like if you were to do that in a real situation and you

174
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:13.020
stumble you to know what to do,
that web,
huge deal.
It's looking bad.
You know,

175
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:15.570
you're not giving any confidence.
You're,
you're saying,
hey,

176
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.140
I want to come into your area of operations and execute a mission tonight and I

177
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.950
can't even put a sentence together.
Yeah,
not good.
Yeah.
So that's why we rehearse.

178
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:24.450
That's why rehearse worst case scenarios.

179
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.850
That's why you'd practice shooting on the horse off the horse,

180
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:29.280
putting your bow way,
pulling it back out,
thrown your spear,
get,

181
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.430
that's what you do.
Yeah.
It's crazy how even going through once Islamic time,

182
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.340
well,
when I work with companies,
I'll do a role play and I'll tell them,

183
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.720
watch what happens in three times,
three iterations.
They get that much better.

184
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:48.170
They'll go from totally stumbling and not being able to handle a bad employee to

185
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.580
where the third time they got it.
That's all it takes.

186
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.630
Then it was the same thing we put through in the,

187
00:11:53.631 --> 00:11:57.730
in the seal teams with guys through really hard training scenarios and they

188
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.810
would blow it and I'd kill all this training.
I'd kill all the good guys.
Right?

189
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:03.460
They'd all be getting hit with paint ball.
You're dead.
You're dead.

190
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.310
Next time I'd say,
okay,
here's the mistake.
You May,
let's look at it.

191
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.190
What would you do?
Step back?
What would you do different?
Nah,
man,

192
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.090
I didn't see that.
I got,
you know,
I got drawn to the situation I should.
Okay,

193
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.500
so let's do it again.
They're going to be 50% better than the next time the neck,

194
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.970
the time after that,
we can't even catch them anymore because they got it.
Nope.

195
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.840
That's crazy preparation.
All right.

196
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.480
Going back to the book,
another thing that Maria says,

197
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.370
in actual combat,

198
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.270
nobody can properly supervise the entire battle since the line is spread out so

199
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:41.530
far and some can dessert from their bands and bands is,

200
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.720
there's two meanings of the word abandons.
One is a flag,
like this is our flag,

201
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.290
but then it's also a group of about 300 troops.

202
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.970
So what he's saying is that people can can dessert back to the book unnoticed

203
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.370
and give all others and excuse to retreat.
If they do retreat,

204
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:04.450
there's no way of turning back or of checking the flight for.

205
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:09.310
Nobody is able to get them back since,
as we said,
the whole army is routed.

206
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.970
So he said this is,
this is why we need a little bit of decentralized command.

207
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.650
Right?
Cause he's saying you're no one can.

208
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.080
No one's going to know you can't keep track.
The whole battle.

209
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.640
How many people can you keep track of during battle?
For maybe five.

210
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.550
These guys are going into battle with thousands.

211
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.940
You can't keep track of them all.
So one of the things that they do,

212
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.540
and this is sort of a,
it's sort of a cover and move scenario.

213
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.530
So the way they set up,
they set up two lines instead of just one line,

214
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.060
they set up two lines back to the book and there should be two lines,

215
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.960
one of them a support the troops in the front line,

216
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:48.910
we'll fight more eagerly knowing that their rear is protected by the second line

217
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.760
and that their flanks by the flank guards.

218
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.610
So even if you just know you're covered,
man,

219
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:56.470
you're going to fight harder cause you don't have to worry about what else is

220
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:59.530
going on.
That's what we do.
Cover and move.
Second,

221
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.550
a man in the first line is not as likely to run away when he knows there are

222
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.790
many other soldiers are stationed to his rear.

223
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.550
That is in his second in the second line.

224
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.610
And we'll see anyone deserted his post.

225
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.110
See there's a little psychological they made.

226
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.130
I'm not going to run cause the guys were right behind me.

227
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:22.420
They're gonna know in combat.
This can be extremely important.

228
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.320
Supposing that the first line retreats where is pushed back.

229
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.370
Then the second line is there as a support and as a place of refuge,

230
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.200
so he got back each other up.
Cover,
move.
Next one.

231
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:41.250
A small army should not prepare to face an organized and more numerous foe in

232
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.490
open battle except in case of necessity.

233
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.310
Boom.
Don't go,
go.

234
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.310
Don't go and fight against a bigger battery opponent with more people.

235
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.050
Don't fight against them.
Back to the book.
If the necessity does arise,

236
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:05.110
do not mass all your troops in front and even if the enemy number is superior,

237
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.220
direct your operations against his rear or his flank for his dangerous and

238
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:18.320
uncertain and all conditions and against any people to engage purely frontal

239
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.250
combat,

240
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.230
even if the enemy stations is a smaller number of troops upfront.

241
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.410
So this is,
we talk about this over and over again.

242
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.720
Don't attack the front.
Don't attack the the hardened position.

243
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:44.010
Next squads should be made up of old and young men in proportion.

244
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.350
Otherwise,
the older men,

245
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.620
a formed by themselves may be weak and the younger inexperienced men may turn

246
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:56.140
out disorganized.
So this is,
uh,

247
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.630
this is obviously important,

248
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.400
but sometimes people have a tendency to want to build a super team,
right?

249
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.770
I'm going to take all of these guys,
all the best guys.

250
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.570
You want to make your teams as even as possible.
This is a classic example.

251
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.870
Don't just take all the old senior guys who have all the experience,

252
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.650
but they might not be in the best physical condition.
I mean,

253
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:21.610
you take a seagull Petunia,
you know,
you take a a 43 year old seal.

254
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.530
Now there's some studies out there,
don't get me wrong,

255
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.080
but you compare them to a kid that's 24 that's on fire.
You,

256
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.690
that guy's going to be,
you tell that kid to go climb a ladder,

257
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.740
jump up a building,
he's going to do it.
It's there.
They're beasts.

258
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.610
So you want to have both those elements in your team.

259
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.150
And it's the same thing in a bigger organization or a business organization,

260
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.050
spread out the knowledge and spread out.

261
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:51.070
The enthusiasm is that,
does that have to do with like,
um,

262
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.603
<v 2>okay.</v>

263
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.770
<v 0>Are you saying like a senior guy,</v>

264
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.730
he might have a bunch of knowledge versus you know,
a younger guy,

265
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:03.230
he'll have a lot athleticism and physical capability or in the business world it

266
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.950
could be enthusiasm,
right?
Yeah.
It could be like,
Hey,
I'm just gonna Grind.
Right.

267
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.680
Hunger Young Guy,
my age echo,
I'm going to head home.
You take care of this.

268
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.870
I got it,
boss.
Let's do this.

269
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.960
Is that also because let's say a young guy who has enthusiasm and if you,

270
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.740
if you mix it up with instead of all enthusiastic people,
you have older guys,

271
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.790
they can teach the knowledge to the guy and then yes,

272
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.400
we're going to make our team stronger.
Okay.
Yeah.

273
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.450
Next one,
various tactics and drills.

274
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:42.120
Constant drill is of the greatest value to the soldier.

275
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.950
Each formation drill should be identified in a special way so that the soldiers

276
00:17:47.951 --> 00:17:52.110
who are trained in these maneuvers may recognize the differences and not be

277
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.160
puzzled by them.

278
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.080
I can't even tell you how much you do what we call in the seal teams that do in

279
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:00.660
the Marine Corps to do in the army immediate action drills.

280
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.550
So it's contact roles and something goes wrong,

281
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.580
how you're going to maneuver your troops on a battlefield and the more you do

282
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.760
that,
the better you're going to get at it.
The better you get at it,

283
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.860
the better you're gonna perform in combat.
Period.
End of story.

284
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.890
Is that like a fire drill at home?
Yeah,
it's like a fire drill at home.

285
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.070
It's like a fire drill home.
It's like when you drilled Jiu Jitsu,
when you say,

286
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.910
Hey,
I'm going to practice this escape.
Right.
You know,
we do that a lot.

287
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.000
Jeff Glover makes us do that all the time is okay,

288
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:28.650
let the guy basically put you in a triangle or dean will make you go in triangle

289
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:33.300
danger,
right?
Or arm locked,
danger,
whatever.
So then you're going to drill,

290
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.000
how are you gonna get out of that?
And that way when you're rolling live,

291
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.450
it's an instinct.
It's the same thing with,
with,
with this situation,

292
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:43.740
with your military unit.
Yeah.
As soon as you make that simple call flank,

293
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.650
you know,
punch,
right,
move left,
whatever the peel left,

294
00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:48.120
whatever that call that you're gonna make.

295
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.330
Everybody knows what to do and it provides instant organization and focus and

296
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:56.760
direction to everybody.
Everybody.
It's weird.
You know,

297
00:18:56.761 --> 00:19:01.320
there's certain calls and the seal teams,
certain maneuvers that everybody knows.

298
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.030
If you make one of those calls,

299
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.500
like everyone knows that every single person in the entire seal community knows

300
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:09.420
exactly what the same thing in the Marine Corps that were me,

301
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.710
there are certain standard operating procedures that you learn in Marine Corps

302
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.370
bootcamp.

303
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.370
If you say it to to a hundred different marines that had been assembled for the

304
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.690
first time ever in their lives.
You say one of these commands,

305
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.450
they're all going to get on it and make it happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.

306
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.820
It's awesome.
Yeah.
All right.

307
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.430
Going back to the book strategy,

308
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.460
the points which the general must consider before the day of battle.

309
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.250
A ship cannot cross the sea without a helmsmen,

310
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.090
nor can one defeat an enemy without strategy and tactics with these and the aid

311
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:52.710
of God,
it is possible to overcome not only an enemy force of equal strength,

312
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.890
but even one greatly superior in numbers for it is not true as some

313
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:03.150
inexperienced people believe that wars are decided by courage and number of

314
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:06.840
troops,
but along with God's favor,

315
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.120
by tactics and general ship,

316
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.990
and our concern should be with these rather than wasting our time mobilizing

317
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.030
large numbers of men.

318
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.030
The leader must take advantage of favorable times and places in fighting against

319
00:20:26.031 --> 00:20:30.020
the enemy.
First team must guard against hostile attacks,

320
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:34.580
which can injure our man and then he must attempt to launch the same against the

321
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:38.570
enemy.
Above all,
he must look for enemy ambushes,

322
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.080
sending out frequent and far ranging patrols in all directions in the area

323
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:42.920
around the battlefield.

324
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.510
He must avoid disordered and uncoordinated.

325
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.770
Now this is thinking about what we started this whole thing off.

326
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.930
You get the advantage,
you get the upper hand and battle go finish him,

327
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.510
keep pursuing them until all the enemies completely destroyed.

328
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.010
But he's saying this right here,

329
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.780
he must avoid disordered and uncoordinated pursuits.

330
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.783
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

331
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.950
<v 0>Now that my first deployment to Iraq,
there's a couple times we got ambushed.</v>

332
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.060
We are in our vehicles,

333
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:18.061
got ambushed and the urge is stopped the vehicles.

334
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.340
Let's go get these guys,

335
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.710
and we didn't do that on these particular missions.
We were going,
we had a prize,

336
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.900
some kind of priority target we're going after,

337
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:31.390
so we're going after a bad guy somewhere.
We make it through.

338
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:34.360
The ambush evolves and I said,
okay,
stop.

339
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.900
We're going to go get these guys like an ego thing that that would basically be

340
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:41.440
an ego thing.
Oh,
stop.
Stop.
The vehicle's going to go get these guys.

341
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.160
Not a good call.
We made it through the ambush,
so we were good.

342
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.490
We have a mission to accomplish.
Let's report this up.
The chain of command.

343
00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:51.650
Maybe they can get some aircraft overhead or something like that,

344
00:21:51.651 --> 00:21:56.651
but we're not going to just go into this disorganized pursuit of an enemy that

345
00:21:58.191 --> 00:22:00.470
actually has the upper hand because we made it through that faster.

346
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.150
What else do they have prepared for us?

347
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.320
Because I can guarantee you they want you to stop so you need to think before

348
00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:09.890
you just get overly aggressive.
Back to the book.

349
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.670
We would not allow the general to take part personally in raids or other

350
00:22:13.671 --> 00:22:14.930
reckless attacks.

351
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.640
These should be entrusted to other competent officers for if one of the

352
00:22:19.641 --> 00:22:21.770
subordinate officers,
blunders or fails.

353
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.840
The situation may be quickly straightened out,

354
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.780
but if the leader of the whole army fails this fall can open the way to complete

355
00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:34.520
disorder.
The general is wise who before entering into war,

356
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:39.170
carefully studies the enemy and can guard against his strong points and take

357
00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:40.850
advantage of his weaknesses.

358
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.560
Obvious stuff that we talk about every single day

359
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.060
back to the book warfare is like hunting.

360
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.640
Wild animals are taken by scouting by nets,

361
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.680
by lying in wait by stalking,

362
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.800
by circling around and buy other stratagems rather than by sheer force.

363
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.650
In waging war.
We should proceed in the same way,

364
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.730
whether the enemy be many or few to try to simply overpower the enemy in the

365
00:23:18.391 --> 00:23:21.180
open hand to hand and face to face.

366
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.020
Even though you might appear to win is an enterprise which is very risky and can

367
00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:26.640
result in serious harm

368
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.750
apart from extreme emergency.

369
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:35.990
It is ridiculous to try and gain a victory which is so costly and only brings

370
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:38.820
empty glory.

371
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.880
We're talking about flanking,
we're talking about taking,

372
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.430
always making sure that the cards are stacked in your favor.
Yeah,

373
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.070
that's what we're talking about here.

374
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

375
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:58.350
<v 0>Then it's again,
it applies in life.
It applies any supplies in Jujitsu.</v>

376
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.780
We had a little battle like that today.
You were called.
I was.
I was actually,

377
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.950
did you see me smiling?

378
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.150
I was like kind of laughing because you were boom coming at me,

379
00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:10.710
coming at me and I was,
I was,

380
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.790
I was kind of laughing cause I was thinking about this podcast and I was

381
00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:15.690
thinking,
Hey,

382
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.080
he's going head to head with me face to face and I'm going to find them.

383
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.870
But that's,
that's the way it works.
Been gently.
Yeah,
apparently.

384
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.070
All right.
Back to the book.
On the actual day of the battle,

385
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.080
the general should not take on too many tasks.
He might exert himself too much,

386
00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:41.490
become worn out and overlook some really essential matters.

387
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.540
Now,
that to me is number one,
you got to detach.
And number two,

388
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:46.770
you don't want to be in the weeds.

389
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.480
If you're trying to get everything you've done yourself,

390
00:24:48.481 --> 00:24:50.190
you're going to overlook some really essential matters.

391
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.880
He should not look downcast or worried,

392
00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:57.600
but should ride gently along the lines and encourage all troops.

393
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.810
He should not himself join in the actual fighting.

394
00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:02.970
This is not the role of the general but of the soldier.

395
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.700
After making all the proper arrangements,

396
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.500
he should stationed himself in a suitable spot from which he can observe which

397
00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:15.501
troops are exerting themselves and which might be slacking when needed.

398
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.070
He should be ready to send assistance to a unit in trouble by making use of his

399
00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:23.640
reserves.
That is the flank and rear guards.

400
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.120
So you got to stay detached.
So when we're talking to general here,

401
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.230
this is the general,
this is the CEO,
right?

402
00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:37.231
This is the president of a company not getting so far into the weeds that you

403
00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:42.970
just don't see what's happening and you can't.

404
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.280
If you're in the weeds fighting,
who's going to be watching to see that?

405
00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:49.120
That area slackening who was going to be able to direct the rear guard to help

406
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:52.570
out who's going to send the reinforcements answers.
Nobody does.

407
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.190
You're not doing your job.

408
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.040
Here's another one.
Even though the general decides against a pitched battle,

409
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.650
he should still make preparations for one

410
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.390
gotta be ready.
Somebody asked me actually on Twitter a couple of days ago,

411
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.200
are you worried about another nine 11 in America?

412
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.620
And I said,
I'm not worried.

413
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.800
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

414
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.330
<v 0>I'm prepared.
And that's what this is saying.</v>

415
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.270
Even you,
even though you don't want to do a pitch battle mess,

416
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.750
I'm not gonna meet them.
Hey,
that's,
that's too much of a frontal attack.

417
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:40.760
I'm not going to do that.
You better be ready for one.

418
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.090
That might be the only choice might get attacked.
What you,

419
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.400
you've got to always be ready to back to the book.

420
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.960
He should make it appear that he plans on one and convey the impression to all

421
00:26:51.961 --> 00:26:54.000
his troops that he will definitely attack the enemy.

422
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.130
This will cause trouble for the enemy when it comes to their knowledge.

423
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.870
So you,
you've got to prepare.
Be prepared.

424
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.370
No slack.

425
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.593
Another one here.

426
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.950
This is about infantry drill movements that we're going back to training here.

427
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:19.930
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.600
<v 0>the Herald commands silence.</v>

429
00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:28.600
Observe orders,
do not worry.
Keep your position,

430
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.410
follow the standard.
Do not leave the standard and pursue the enemy.

431
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.660
The troops then advance at a steady pace and in silence without anyone even

432
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.213
whispering,

433
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.140
they should become accustomed to these movements so that as a spoken command on

434
00:27:48.141 --> 00:27:51.530
nod or some other signal,
they march or Holt,

435
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:56.590
reduce or divide the depth of the files march steadily in close order for a good

436
00:27:57.231 --> 00:27:59.030
distance over various kinds of terrain.

437
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.690
Close or tighten their ranks in depth and width.
March,

438
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.670
engage in mock battle,
sometimes using staffs and sometimes naked sorts.

439
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.220
So this is,
this is a really important one.
This is,

440
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.860
this is reminds me very much of something that we used to do.

441
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.260
So he's saying you're going to do a drill right and you're not allowed to talk.

442
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.120
You have to be completely silent.

443
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.600
And this is something we absolutely used to drill us in the seal teams where

444
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.500
you're not allowed to talk.
And we would actually sometimes take radios away.

445
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.900
So hey you can we turn off,
hey everyone,
turn off your radios.

446
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.460
So you just have to figure this out.
And if you run like that all the time,

447
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.280
eventually everybody returns.

448
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.850
How it makes everyone more proactive because you know you're not going to hear a

449
00:28:40.851 --> 00:28:45.340
command,
you know the boss isn't gonna go on the radio and say flank left you.

450
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.170
That's not coming.
Cause that's,
so you have to learn to look around.

451
00:28:48.171 --> 00:28:49.610
You have to learn to sense what's going to happen.

452
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.990
And it makes everybody better at what they're doing.
And I'll tell you,
you know,

453
00:28:53.991 --> 00:28:57.230
I've talked about this before.
We didn't in my task and my platoon,

454
00:28:57.231 --> 00:29:00.620
we didn't talk on the radio.
We didn't,
we barely talked on the radio.
If,

455
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.290
if I came on the radio and said something,
it was everybody was scoped,

456
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.510
the jock would just talked her,
you know,
life would say to me,
Jacqueline,

457
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.400
moving to building 48 that's say do it.
They'd go,
they wouldn't,
he,

458
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.860
he did Roger and he'd go,
they wouldn't say anything else.

459
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.530
And that was because when we were in training,

460
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.680
we would do these drills where we wouldn't talk.
You're not allowed to talk.

461
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.360
You're allowed to make a head nod.

462
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.000
You're allowed to give somebody of a visual signal,

463
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.310
but you're not allowed to come on the radio and you're not allowed to talk.

464
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.890
And that makes you so good.

465
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.400
It what it does is it makes your verbal,

466
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.550
your nonverbal communication skills on point.

467
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.770
It was cool when I went to officer candidate school.

468
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.000
So at officer candidate school,
they got a little things that they do to you.

469
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.440
And I'll give you a couple examples.

470
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.080
One of them is you're not allowed to look at your food when you're eating.

471
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.900
So you,
you have to stare straight ahead.

472
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.240
And this doesn't sound like a big deal cause you think to yourself,

473
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.690
well I'll just look at my food,
right?
If you look at your food,

474
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.980
everybody can see it in the drill.

475
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:58.990
Instructors come over to start and look at your food.

476
00:29:58.991 --> 00:29:59.780
You're not supposed to get food.

477
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.810
So what you have to do is you have to just look straight ahead.

478
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:04.690
You're looking straight ahead across the table and you're just guessing where

479
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:09.160
your food is pretty much stabbing your fork into the tray of food that you have

480
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.110
in front of you and it's,
you know,

481
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:15.340
it's a little hard to eat and then over time you start to be able to utilize

482
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:18.670
your peripheral vision a little bit more so that you can see it without looking

483
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:22.360
at it.
That's one.
The other one,
I think I've talked about this,

484
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:24.850
you have to scream everything that you say,
right?

485
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.840
There's so there's all these little things that they make.
You do go ballistic,

486
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.180
go ballistic at all times,
right?
It's,
I've told that story before.

487
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.260
But when it was pretty cool when,
when my drill instructor,

488
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.300
Gunnery Sergeant,
Marine Corps,
Awesome Guy,
when we got done,
you know,

489
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:45.040
he was explaining why we did all this stuff in the one about not looking at your

490
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:47.370
food comes from him.

491
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.470
It does come from improving your peripheral vision because the way the officer

492
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:58.270
candidate school was originally set up was for pilots,
potential navy pilots.

493
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.350
So guess what?

494
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.910
You got to be able to see your instruments down below you while you're looking

495
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.430
around and scanning for enemy aircraft.

496
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.460
And so this is what it does is it allows you to improve.

497
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.560
Well this is the same thing when when you build that muscle memory of hey,

498
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:17.860
I'm not going to talk and I need to look around and I need to be mentally

499
00:31:17.861 --> 00:31:22.480
proactive and make sure that I,
I'm not going to hear anything.

500
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.140
So as a junior guy,
I'm not going to hear anything.
I have to look around,

501
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:30.280
I have to make a decision,
I have to absorb and figure out what's happening.

502
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:35.080
That is unbelievably good.
So anybody that works in an environment,
you know,

503
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.820
police officers,
obviously military do these silent drills doing them,

504
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.080
it'll make you that much better.
You know,
it's funny,

505
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.840
I was just relaying the mats at our gym the other day and Andy was there,

506
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.620
big Andy by the way,
just got his black belt by the way.
Yeah,

507
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.290
we relay in the maths and you know he's just a,

508
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:57.100
we're just working and we didn't say a word to each other for five hours.

509
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.710
We're there,
we're just picking up stuff and doing stuff.
And you know,
he's an,

510
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.310
he's an iron worker by trade and so he just guy that,
you know,
just,

511
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.520
he sees me doing something he's doing,
I see him doing something.

512
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.200
What is non verbal communication?
Just nonverbal communication work on it.

513
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.440
It's awesome.
All right,

514
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.800
so this next section is,

515
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.480
is really kind of where I was heading with all this.

516
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.470
This is the,
these are maxims,
right?

517
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.490
General instructions and maxims.
And when we do books that are maximums,

518
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:34.990
it makes my job really easy because I'm not trying to pull stuff out.

519
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.970
It's there.
They already pulled it out for you.
You know,
we didn't.

520
00:32:37.971 --> 00:32:41.240
Napoleon's maximums,
there's nothing to pull out.
Read the maxims.
Boom,

521
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.510
San Suu auto war.
Oh,
there's nothing to pull out.
Read the maxims.

522
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.420
And that's what this rolls into right here.
Different.

523
00:32:48.421 --> 00:32:52.460
And in one of the things I talk about this in Jujitsu,
I talk about this in any,

524
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:56.360
in anything.
So these maxims,
you're going to see,
these are familiar.

525
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.350
So why would we go film again?
Why do we need to hear them again?

526
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.150
I'll tell you the reason why we need to hear him again.

527
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.000
Because just like Jujitsu,

528
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.530
you are going to see these things from a slightly different angle every single

529
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:12.500
time.
Just like in combat,
you're going to enter,

530
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.760
you're going to enter a million rooms as an assaulter on an assault team.

531
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.260
You're gonna enter a million different rooms and there's a basic structured,

532
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:25.670
all of them.
But no two rooms are alike.
No two rooms are exactly like,

533
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.460
and the more that you enter and the more different angles you see,

534
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.580
the better you get at handling them.
Just like in Jujitsu,

535
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.180
when you go against different body types,
the better you get at your arm locks.

536
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.540
When you do on a mock from the bottom,
from the top,
from the side,

537
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.180
you get better at those arm locks.
In the business world,

538
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.010
the more deals that you see and you understand how they unfold,

539
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.380
the better you're going to get.
The construction industry,

540
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:51.200
the more walls you build,
there are a little bit different.

541
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:56.180
Little things come out a little bit different.
So the more you see them,

542
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:59.690
the more you hear them from slightly different angles,

543
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.120
the more adept you are utilizing them.

544
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.120
That's why I love when I see these maxims.

545
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.120
<v 3>So
here we go.</v>

546
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.460
<v 0>General instructions for the commander</v>

547
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.990
in carrying out very critical operations.

548
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:23.020
The general ought not set himself apart as though such labor was beneath him,

549
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:30.190
but he should begin the work and toil along with his troops as much as possible.

550
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.270
Such behavior will lead the soldier to be more submissive to his officers,

551
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:40.340
even if only out of shame and he will accomplish more so.
So even though,

552
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.370
you know earlier saying,
hey,
general don't,
don't get in the weeds,

553
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:48.520
but if there's work to do,
do the work,
show them you're doing the work.
Yeah.

554
00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:50.990
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

555
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.440
<v 0>Next twin,
certain offenses are common among the soldiers.</v>

556
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.910
Moderation is called four.

557
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.480
Do not judge and punish all indiscriminately.

558
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:05.260
Widespread resentment might draw them all together and discipline would become

559
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:06.380
even worse.

560
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.550
It is wiser to punish just a few of the ring leaders.

561
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.040
So we,
you can talk about the harshness of the Roman Legion,
but here he's saying,

562
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:18.920
look,
[inaudible],
dial that back a little bit.

563
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.380
Dial that back a little bit.
If the offense is our common among the soldiers.

564
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.680
So when you,
this is,
you know,
this is also a little bit of Leif Babin.
Uh,

565
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.720
it's not what you preach.
It's what you tolerate.
If you're tolerating it,

566
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.020
then you can't just all of a sudden drop the hammer because you're going to look

567
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:40.190
inconsistent.
If you're not going to tolerate it,
don't tolerate it.
But if you do,

568
00:35:40.191 --> 00:35:44.460
and it's a common offense,
don't all of a sudden fly off the handle inconsistent.

569
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.830
Next,
the generals a way of life.

570
00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:52.650
Should be plain and simple like that of his soldiers.

571
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.710
He should display a fatherly affection toward them.

572
00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.920
He should give orders in a mild manner and he should always make sure to give

573
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:04.230
advice and to discuss essential matters with them in person.

574
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.980
So this is,
we heard this from pat and we hear this from everybody,

575
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.350
but patents said that exact same thing,
right?
You need to do that.

576
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.580
You need to live like your soldiers.
We hear that all the time.
Dick winters said,

577
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:19.170
everybody says this,
don't,
don't go up in there.
Don't go up in the ivory tower.

578
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.390
Don't do it,
boss,
man.

579
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.970
So like the boss who gets the huge corner,

580
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.660
everyone has cubicles as a huge gold plated stuff.

581
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:35.460
Yeah.
The way the massage chair in the office don't disturb me,

582
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.570
12 minutes,
I'm running the 12 minute massage cheer session.

583
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.990
His concerns ought to be with their safety,
their food,
and their regular pay.

584
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.140
Without these,
it is impossible to maintain discipline in an army

585
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.630
by being just in punishing offenders.

586
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.720
He should instill fear at the very first sign of a disciplinary problem.

587
00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.700
He should take action to end it.

588
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.880
And not delay dealing with it until it grows or becomes more serious.

589
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:10.810
The general successful when his men regard him as unshakeable and just,

590
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:12.760
<v 2>yeah,</v>

591
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.660
<v 0>you should also see that civilians are left on harmed.
Boom.</v>

592
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.310
So when you got the problem,
when you see the problem,
get the problem solved.

593
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.270
Don't wait.
It's not going to go away.
It's not going to get,

594
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.760
not going to get better on its own.
Next,

595
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.910
he should be temperant in his way of life and vigilant.

596
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.553
<v 2>Okay?</v>

597
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:38.080
<v 0>Pretty straightforward.
It's a maxim.
Next,</v>

598
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.790
it is essential to be cautious and take your time in making plans.

599
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.470
And once you have come to a decision to carry it out right away without any

600
00:37:47.471 --> 00:37:48.310
hesitation,

601
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.130
timidity after all is not caution,

602
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.790
but the invention of wickedness when you're going to go,
go,

603
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.580
go.
Once you make your decision,
go that a default aggressive,

604
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:06.990
that is a default aggressive thing.
Yes,
I,

605
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:11.991
healthy mind is not unduly elated by success or overly depressed when things are

606
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:18.060
not going well.
A lot of these speak for themselves.

607
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.050
That's one of them.

608
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.320
You gotta be mentally road maintain.
Don't get emotional,

609
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.200
not a lady to,
we would not to prove through loss,

610
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.360
no maintain.
Next,

611
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:38.350
it is safer and more advantageous to overcome the enemy by planning in general

612
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:41.440
ship than by sheer force.
In the one case,

613
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:44.890
results are achieved without loss to oneself while on the other.

614
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.320
Some price has to be paid.

615
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.543
Next,

616
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.870
it is very important to spread rumors among the enemy that you are planning to

617
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:58.000
do one thing and then go do something else.

618
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.770
Your plans about major operations should not be known to many,

619
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.980
but just a few and those very close to you.

620
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:08.973
<v 3>Next</v>

621
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.850
<v 0>alarming rumors or traps of treachery,</v>

622
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:18.030
whether on the part of the enemy on her own ought not be neglected or action

623
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:18.851
differed,

624
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:22.570
but steps should be taken to deal with them and put a shop stop to them before

625
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:27.370
they become realities.
You start hearing rumors smash him.

626
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.110
That's one thing I see in companies companies.

627
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.230
This is a problem that businesses have.
I mean it happens in the military you,

628
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.200
but businesses have this problem where they,

629
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.200
they let rumors grow,
they let messaging get formed.

630
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:48.610
By the uninformed.
And that's not what you want to do.

631
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.180
If you're in charge of a business and something bad is going to happen,

632
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.730
explain it to everyone.

633
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.270
Don't let the people explain it themselves because the idea that they're going

634
00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:01.060
to come up with is gonna be the worst case scenario possible that they can

635
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:01.894
imagine.

636
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.490
So proactive communications so people know what is happening.

637
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.590
Don't let them define their own messaging and their own rumors.

638
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.200
Stop them by giving them the information.

639
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.570
<v 3>Next,
the enemy's should be</v>

640
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.620
<v 0>deceived by false reports of our plans brought to them by deserters from us.</v>

641
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:33.150
So you got people that you think might leave you cool.
Give him some bad intel.

642
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.043
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

643
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.600
<v 0>Courage should be roused and our troops by fabricating report of a victory over</v>

644
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:48.910
the enemy,
one by our men someplace else.

645
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.680
Now this is a controversial in my mind,
right?
So what they're saying is,
hey,

646
00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:57.460
you should make up some stories about how well so-and-so's doing in another area

647
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.440
that you've got to think about what you're doing there.
And of course,

648
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.100
in this day and age,
that's hard to do.
We have just opened communications.

649
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:08.580
We have texting,
we have phones,
we have all this stuff.
So it's,

650
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.480
you'd be hard pressed to verify that.

651
00:41:10.481 --> 00:41:13.270
But one of the things that I thought about when I read that where I disagree

652
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:16.690
with this is in mixed martial arts for instance,

653
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.800
guy loses around in,
you know,
round one.

654
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.120
The guy goes out and doesn't do a good job is losing the round,

655
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.150
comes back to his corner.
What does his corner tell him?
You're doing great.

656
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:31.120
Keep it going.
That's the wrong worst thing you can do.

657
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.940
Worst thing you can do is lie to like,
cause he'll keep,
you'll keep it.

658
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:37.880
Keep doing that.
Keep it up.
All right.
Yeah.
You need to say,
look,

659
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:40.160
you're losing in anytime it's close.

660
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:43.580
You've got to assume that the other guy won any round that's even remotely
close.

661
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:47.000
You've got assume the other guy got that round.
Yeah,
so don't do this.

662
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.640
Don't say great round.
Keep it going.
No,

663
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.500
there's not a single MMA fighters that I've ever worked with that when you tell

664
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:57.950
them great round,
you're winning steps it up.
I'd never seen,

665
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.850
I've never heard it.
Never seen it.
Never heard it.

666
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:04.400
And if you watch the UFC because they got those corner cams now,

667
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.210
and I have the Internet thing where I can pick who I'm going to listen to and I

668
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:11.810
can rewatch and you can hear what the corners are saying to you,
check it out,

669
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.680
go and look at a fighter who's corner tells them they're doing a great job and

670
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:16.070
tell me,

671
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.220
find me an example of where a guy hears he's doing a great job and then he steps

672
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:21.200
it up.
Well,
even harder,
it doesn't happen.

673
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.400
Everybody goes into cruise mode and if they're losing,
guess what?

674
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:29.900
That cruise mode that gets them destroyed.
So be careful with that one.

675
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.390
Marise gotta disagree with you on that one.

676
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.111
Back to the book.

677
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:40.700
News about reverses suffered by us should be kept secret and report stating just

678
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:42.470
the opposite should be circulated about.
Okay,

679
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:44.390
so now we're talking about controlling,
controlling the messaging,

680
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.480
but we're talking about lying and in this day and age doesn't work,

681
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.930
you get it doesn't not going to work for you.
You can't say don't worry about it.

682
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:54.830
It was like,
remember Baghdad Bob?
When we went into Baghdad and he,

683
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:59.510
there's American tanks,
m one Abrams Rolling in crushing and music go.

684
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.430
We've got the Americans on the run.
Yeah,
we're running down your front door.

685
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.020
So this is not,
this isn't going to work,
right?

686
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:12.050
What you need to do is if reverses happen,
you need to come out.

687
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:12.830
You need to own them.

688
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.980
You need to explain what happened and you need to get ahead of them and don't

689
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:18.080
let the rumor mill turn into something worse than it is.

690
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.350
You might be able to mitigate it.
Don't lie about it.

691
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.550
I'm not going to get you anywhere.

692
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.430
Next defeated troop should not be allowed to fall into despair,

693
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:32.810
but they should be dealt with by stirring up hope by various other means.

694
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.730
Common Sense.
Next during combat,

695
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.320
one has to overlook offenses committed by the soldiers,
but afterward,

696
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.660
get rid of men.
Guilty of sedition,

697
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.690
which is like someone that's going to rebel against you.
Again,
this is very,

698
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.960
this is a questionable,
right?
If you,
during combat,

699
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:55.550
if you start overlooking offenses,
guess what?

700
00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:58.490
You're gonna end up with my mee Lai massacre.

701
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.780
That's what you're gonna end up with.
No,
stop them.
Disagree.
Marise sorry.

702
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:08.010
When you have a situation like that happening,
you need to stop it.
Yeah.

703
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:13.430
You need to put an end to it.
Now,
that being said,

704
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.590
are you gonna Hound on every little thing that happens?

705
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.820
No.
Right?
Maybe you're going to give a little bit of slack with

706
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.370
something that's pretty meaningless,
right?

707
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:33.150
Maybe give a little bit of slack at the same time.
You can't just,

708
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.640
you've got to give you guys some room.
That's what I'm saying.

709
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:38.130
You've got to give you guys some room.
You got to hold the line.
Absolutely.

710
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.930
You've got to hold the line,

711
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:44.940
but you can't freak out because you got bigger than you should.

712
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.740
Definitely have bigger things to worry about.
Then this little item,
right?

713
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.220
Let's just,
Hey,
get that tightened up.
Yeah,

714
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.040
let's move on.
Let's not focus on it.

715
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.670
Not going to fire you because you made a mistake.

716
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:03.583
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.980
<v 0>Next.
Our own dead should be buried secretly at night,</v>

718
00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:14.490
but the enemies should be left out there as a means of making them lose courage.

719
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.200
Good psychological warfare.

720
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:18.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

721
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.130
<v 0>Next.
When a delegation comes from the enemy,</v>

722
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.070
inquire about the leaders of the group and on their arrival,

723
00:45:25.071 --> 00:45:29.270
treat them very friendly,
so their own people will come to suspect them.

724
00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:31.790
There's a lot of,

725
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:36.170
there's a lot of little crafty little psychological warfare that they do,

726
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.710
and that's one of them.
Act like,
you know this enemy.

727
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.750
Make the enemy look at him like,
how's this?
Why is,

728
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.600
why is Jocko being so nice to echo right here?

729
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.840
They're acting like they're old friends.
You're going to get suspicious of you.

730
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:52.430
That's what I'm trying to do.
Cause some divide.
Plant the seat.
Yes.

731
00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.350
Acts of cowardice on the part of our soldiers should be kept quiet and not

732
00:45:57.351 --> 00:46:01.160
publicly condemned since this may make them even worse.
Again,

733
00:46:01.161 --> 00:46:04.460
we're talking about a communication thing and you're not going to be able to,

734
00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.750
you're not gonna be able to keep that stuff under wraps.
People are gonna know.

735
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.580
Yeah.
So get ahead of it.

736
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:18.260
Next away of arousing discord and suspicion among the enemy is to refrain from

737
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:23.631
burning or plundering the estates of certain prominent men on their side and

738
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.200
have them alone.
So going,
like I said,
go into the village,

739
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:32.220
burn everyone's house except echoes and you're like the prominent guy and they

740
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:35.640
go,
hey,
what's up?
How come you didn't burn your house?
No,

741
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.220
I'm not friends with them.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Really?
We're going to come back.

742
00:46:39.221 --> 00:46:43.150
I want to kill you.
Yeah,
like the,
like the cops,
right.
They do that where

743
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.170
<v 4>they'll apprehend some guy in the cartel,
I don't know.
Whatever,
the drug gang.</v>

744
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.850
Yup.
And then there'll be like,
okay,
bye.
Like,
oh they wait,
you got arrested?

745
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.880
Nothing happened to you in the like,
oh no,
it's all good.
Okay.

746
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.660
<v 0>Yeah,
exactly.
That's exactly it.</v>

747
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:05.880
Next one way of getting a besieged city to submit is by sending letters tied to

748
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:08.340
arrows,
promising freedom and immunity.

749
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.500
This can also be done by releasing prisoners.
Cool.
Next.

750
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:17.250
Great caution must be observed and pursuing the enemy over ground suited for

751
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:20.520
ambush was a good general turn back at the right time.

752
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.980
So we can come back later to attack more effectively.

753
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.260
That's why I'm not stopping my patrol to go back and attack an ambush that just

754
00:47:29.261 --> 00:47:33.790
got through their ground,
may have it.
The waiting for us in prompt to split.

755
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.260
They have the advantage.
They have it.
They'd been waiting there.
Every art of war,

756
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:41.350
every maximum ward will tell you,
you want to have the upper hand.

757
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:43.750
You want to pick the battlefield.
They picked it.
Yeah.

758
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.820
Don't get into a scrap of them right there.

759
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:46.763
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

760
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:53.410
<v 0>Next,
do not be deceived by humane acts of the enemy or by they're pretending to</v>

761
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:56.760
retreat.
Next,

762
00:47:56.761 --> 00:48:01.761
cowardly officers are recognized by their hesitation and pallor during combat.

763
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.100
They should be assigned to exhilarate forces.

764
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.690
Notice that he is using them right.
Just because someone's a coward,

765
00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:12.300
he's still got work for them.
You go and run the logistics,

766
00:48:12.301 --> 00:48:15.420
you know that's okay because I need bodies.
I need people.

767
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:24.300
When a populous city is taken is important to leave the gates open so that the

768
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:30.130
inhabitants may escape and not be driven to utter desperation.

769
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.700
The same holds on an enemy's fortified campus taken.

770
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.620
So we want to give people an out so that they don't fight to the death.

771
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:42.940
And this is very common with the ego,
Huh?
You don't,
you don't,

772
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.630
I don't trap you and prove you wrong in the room,
right?

773
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.340
I don't live in a big meeting.
I don't go and go,

774
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.150
here's the four reasons why you're completely wrong and they're indisputable.

775
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.040
No,
I give you a little out.
I see echo,
you know,

776
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.290
have found these things and I think this might be a better way to do it.

777
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.860
And by the way,
this also happens and this other thing,

778
00:49:02.861 --> 00:49:06.070
so maybe we could adjust your plan a little bit and do it here.

779
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.870
Now if you have any sense whatsoever,

780
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.020
you see all four of those reasons and you go,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

781
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:15.220
let's go ahead and do that.
Jocko.
That's a good call.
And I say,
no problem boss,

782
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:19.660
and we're good.
But if I come in there and start making you look like a jackass,

783
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.670
you're totally wrong.
Your system doesn't work.
You're going to dig in on that.

784
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:29.380
Now we got issues,
now you're fighting to the death.
I'm going backwards

785
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:37.320
next.
Even in friendly territory,
afford a camp should be set up.

786
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.060
A general should never have to say,
I did not expect it.

787
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.090
Even in friendly territory.
Be ready

788
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.530
for a safe retreat.
Build a fire in one place and go off quietly to another.

789
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.860
The enemy will head to the fire.
Deception.

790
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.240
Next letter's ought to be sent out to designers from our side who have joined

791
00:50:00.241 --> 00:50:03.900
the enemy in such a way that the letters will fall into the enemy's hands.

792
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:08.850
These letters should remind the designers of the prearranged time for their

793
00:50:08.851 --> 00:50:12.840
treachery so that the enemy will become suspicious of them.
They'll have to flee.

794
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.100
That's a crafty little move.
Crafty little move.
Oh,
Echo,

795
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.540
you deserted us and hey,

796
00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:21.600
we'll meet you at this night so you can give us the information you told us

797
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:26.430
you're going to give us.
They hang you.
Traitor.

798
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.870
Next,
when it comes to dangerous or surprise,
operations,

799
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.520
cowards could be weeded out if all the men who are sick or who's horses are too

800
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:39.230
weak or ordered to fall out.

801
00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

802
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.751
<v 0>The cowards,</v>

803
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.620
we'll then claim to be six and so they can be separated from the others.

804
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.520
They can be assigned to guard fortresses or some other duty involving little

805
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:53.390
danger.
That's a good tactic.
You think about that back in the day.
Hey guys,

806
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:56.900
if anyone's not feeling good followed over here cause we,
you know,

807
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.450
you're not 100% so we don't want to bring you in this operation.

808
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.510
The cowards go away.
I'm a little bit sick feeling a little under the weather.

809
00:51:02.511 --> 00:51:03.830
Okay,
cool.
You go guard the rear.

810
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.330
Is that cause like in a way they're not hundred percent either,
right?
Yeah.

811
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.840
Their cowardice a month and you're giving them an out.
Yeah.

812
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.460
Cause they're not gonna.
They might not say anything,

813
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:16.160
but then at the moment of truth,
they're not there to back you up.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

814
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.080
So you give a little out,
hey,
if you're not feeling good,

815
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:21.530
go over here in this line.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah,
you're over there a coward,

816
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.650
but I'm still gonna utilize you.
Yeah.
Next.

817
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:31.400
We should not furnish arms to those who promise to fight on our side because

818
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:33.470
their real intentions are not clear.

819
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.350
This is something America as a nation should get very familiar with.

820
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.070
We should not furnish arms to those who promised to fight on our side because

821
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:45.170
their real intentions are not clear.

822
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.030
We give away arms in a ridiculous manner.
Ridiculous manner.

823
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

824
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.760
<v 0>And we should,
because the real intentions are not clear.</v>

825
00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:01.800
Next after a victory,
we must not become careless,

826
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:06.870
but be on our guard.
All the more against surprise attacks by the vanquished.

827
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:12.000
Just because you won doesn't mean,
and this is,
you know Jeff eggs,
right?
Yes.

828
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:17.090
So this is something Higgs taught me like years ago.

829
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.380
I'm talking blue belt in Jujitsu.

830
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.950
Higgs do Jujitsu.
He's a seal.
He,

831
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.740
he got out of the seal teams,

832
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.800
he got totally into Jujitsu and the one of the original guys I trained with with

833
00:52:31.261 --> 00:52:34.950
master chief Steve Bailey back in the day.
So anyways,

834
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.630
we were rolling one day and we were talking and he said,

835
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.520
if you tap somebody,

836
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.880
you got to go harder because they're going to go hard.
So if you,
you know,

837
00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:48.980
and I'm,
I mean someone that you battle with,
right,
right.

838
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.710
Someone that you battle with and all of a sudden you get them better step up

839
00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:55.770
your game because they're going to go harder.
Yeah.
Same thing right here.

840
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.990
You get a storm.
Yeah.
You gotta Watch yourself.
Yeah.
Off.

841
00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:02.200
Like if you're running the mile,
you know,

842
00:53:02.201 --> 00:53:05.950
like in track your running the mile,
he pull away out of Hit,
right.

843
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.870
And you're like,
oh I'm,
you know,
this last lap,
whatever,
you know,

844
00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:11.790
I'm just going to can it,
yeah.
Ready?
You got to step it up.

845
00:53:11.791 --> 00:53:16.680
Cause that guy that you've been beating,
vanquished whatever.
Yeah.
You know,

846
00:53:16.681 --> 00:53:17.514
he's coming,

847
00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:23.420
he's coming next on voice from the enemy must not be treated disrespectfully

848
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.070
even when our forces are much stronger.
Next,

849
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:29.850
an army,

850
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.930
no matter how strong besieging the city must never leave its own camp unguarded.

851
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.700
Nor should it think that fortifications are sufficient to assure its safety.

852
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:41.640
But she keeps sending out patrols.

853
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.450
Don't ever let your guard down saying this over and over again.

854
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.740
Next suspected defectors should be told the opposite of what we intend to do so

855
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:51.600
that we may use them to deceive the enemy.

856
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.980
And treachery must be guarded against even during periods of truce or temporary

857
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:59.050
piece.
Next,

858
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:03.970
by no means should we believe reports that come from deserves or defectors
alone,

859
00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.960
but their reports should be checked against statements made by prisoners taken

860
00:54:07.961 --> 00:54:11.800
in raids.
And in this way,
that truth may be discerned.

861
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.800
So you got to check with all the different sources.

862
00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:19.801
And this is something that the intelligence community does extremely well,

863
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:25.470
which is they take all these different little chunks of information and they

864
00:54:26.231 --> 00:54:28.900
assemble it together into a picture.
You know,

865
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.480
we've seen those pictures where it's just like a bunch of dots when you look at

866
00:54:31.481 --> 00:54:34.400
it up close,
but then when you step back,
it's something real.
Yeah.

867
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.350
That's why these intelligence,
these intelligence communities,
do,

868
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:41.230
they take all those little dots,
it seems like a meaningless dot.

869
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.820
Just a meaningless little dot.

870
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:46.720
But they're going to put it on that broad picture and it's going to fill in one

871
00:54:46.721 --> 00:54:48.310
little piece of information that they need.

872
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.100
You put all that stuff together and all of a sudden they know who you are,

873
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.610
they know where to attack.
Yeah.

874
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.210
And that kind of makes sense there where it's like some dessert or somebody who

875
00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:01.840
basically doesn't have credibility.
Right.
So they'll be like,
hey,

876
00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:05.830
he's not necessarily lying,
but he could be silly.
He becomes real circumstantial,

877
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.150
you know?
And then like how you're saying,

878
00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:10.570
you put all the dots together and yet for some reason this dot it's not fitting.

879
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.970
It's not painting a picture,
but then you know,
okay,
he's wishy washy anyway.
So,

880
00:55:13.971 --> 00:55:16.750
oh,
I see he's lying right now.
You know what I mean?
Line about that piece,

881
00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:21.670
but maybe didn't lie about another piece.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Next,

882
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.290
in no way should a sworn agreement made with the enemy be broken.

883
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:32.200
So if you,
you need to hold,
hold,
hold your work.
Even with the enemy.

884
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:36.430
Hold your word
next after God,

885
00:55:36.431 --> 00:55:39.730
we should place our hopes of safety in our weapons,

886
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:44.650
not in our fortifications alone.
Don't just count on the defense.

887
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:50.590
Next orders should be given to the soldiers that they should be ready to march

888
00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:55.180
out on a holiday in the rain day or night.
For this reason,

889
00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.450
they should not be told the time or day beforehand.

890
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.340
So they may always be prepared.

891
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:01.303
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

892
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.020
<v 0>This is,</v>

893
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:08.020
this reminded me of when my last deployment to Iraq and you're winding down and

894
00:56:09.531 --> 00:56:10.880
I told my guys,
I said,
Hey,

895
00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:13.040
I'm not going to tell you guys when we're going to stop operations.

896
00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:16.460
Like we're just going to stop cause I didn't want ADB going out thinking this is

897
00:56:16.461 --> 00:56:19.930
the last operation.
Just play it safe.
Does it?
Hey guys,
when,

898
00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:24.280
when we're done with I'll loop,
you know,
but just keep going.
Yeah.
Kaiser,
look,

899
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:28.720
Roger that.
Yeah,
keep going.
And then one day we got done.
Yeah,

900
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:32.710
but to keep the mentality of,
you know,
don't think about,

901
00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:34.210
this is going to be the last operation.

902
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.330
You don't want them cruising and it's not the finish line.
Right.

903
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:44.070
Next risks should be taken without necessity or real hope of gain.

904
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.280
Sorry.

905
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.280
Risks should not be taken without necessity or real hope of gain

906
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:56.460
to do so is the same as fishing with gold as bait.

907
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.490
Next inhabitants of the area who seek refuge should not be received

908
00:57:05.491 --> 00:57:08.670
indiscriminately.
Often enough,

909
00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.840
they'd been sent by the enemy deceit deceitfully to plot against their hosts.

910
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:18.180
This is something we ran into a lot in Ramadi where people are acting normal and

911
00:57:18.181 --> 00:57:21.330
they knew our rules of engagement and so they knew like before they didn't have

912
00:57:21.331 --> 00:57:25.530
a gun,
they weren't going to shoot him.
Yeah.
And so they would do things,

913
00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:28.680
they'd probe and they'd see how close he could get and see where we were.

914
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.550
So just because these people are coming with their hands up doesn't mean they're

915
00:57:32.551 --> 00:57:34.830
are innocent.
You know,
they might not be guilty,

916
00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:38.100
they might not be innocent either.
Next,

917
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.120
we should also be on our guard against deserved.
As who approach a besieged city.

918
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:42.871
Often enough,

919
00:57:42.871 --> 00:57:46.530
they are sent by the enemy to set fires so that while the defenders are busy

920
00:57:46.531 --> 00:57:50.100
putting them out,
the enemy may have tax him.
Just be cautious.

921
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.930
Troops defeated.
An open battle should not be pampered.

922
00:57:54.931 --> 00:57:57.000
Or even if it seems like a good idea,

923
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.870
take refuge in a fortified camp or some other strong place,

924
00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.590
but while their fear is still fresh,
they should attack again

925
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.900
by not indulging them.
Yeah,

926
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.200
<v 3>may they may</v>

927
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.630
<v 0>with greater assurance renew the fighting.
It's don't take care of them.</v>

928
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:18.510
You can't just say,
oh,
we beat you,
so come on in the camp and relax.
No,

929
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:23.780
not happening.
Next,
if the general thinks he's ready to meet the enemy in battle,

930
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:28.160
he should get set to carry on the fighting in the enemy's country instead of his

931
00:58:28.161 --> 00:58:32.240
own men waging war in a foreign land become more aggressive.

932
00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:36.800
They will also feel that the war in which they are engaged is not only being

933
00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:40.370
fought on behalf of their country,
but also their own personal safety.

934
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:45.380
This is not necessarily the case if the war is fought in their own land in which

935
00:58:45.381 --> 00:58:50.381
the existence of fortresses eliminates the risks to men since in case of flight,

936
00:58:50.571 --> 00:58:52.640
they may easily take refuge in them.

937
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.380
There's a little bit different than what we might deal with today because today

938
00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:01.190
we deploy to some country and fight.
That's not your homeland.
Yeah.

939
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.300
So you're saying,
Nah,
you know what?
This is this.
You know,

940
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:08.030
I don't have to defend this.
And can you imagine if America got invaded?

941
00:59:08.031 --> 00:59:12.770
How hard the Americans would fight?
Yeah.
No one could ever pull it off.
Yeah.

942
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:16.190
It would be too hard.
Because once the Americans say,
Oh,

943
00:59:16.191 --> 00:59:20.300
you're going to think you're going to take my country wouldn't have anything,

944
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.550
any happening.
Not Happening.
Yeah.

945
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.690
Go try and take someone's parking space in America.
Here.

946
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.380
You're there ready to kill you.
So you think you're going to take land from us.

947
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:33.170
Not Happening.
Not going to happen.
So there's a little bit different,

948
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.210
but the mentality of being aggressive and in what,

949
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:40.880
what I think what the mentality is talking about is knowing that you can retreat

950
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:43.610
knowing that you can go back to your fortress.
So that means,
you know,

951
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.150
in this day and age,
or sorry,
in that era,

952
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:51.710
they knew they couldn't,
they didn't have any.
All they could do was fight.

953
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.490
They had to win.
You know what?
This is a great comparison is in the,

954
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.720
in the old school navy,
you had no choice.

955
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.310
You have no choice on a naval vessel,
you have no choice but to fight.

956
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:08.340
You have no choice because if your ship gets sunk,
you're dead in the hall,

957
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:12.650
in the on the ground,
you can run away,
you can hide,
you can retreat,

958
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.740
you can fall back.
Where do you fall back to you on a ship that's being attacked.

959
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:20.750
You don't go on the ocean and you die.
So that's one of the kind of core things.

960
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.470
That's old school navy.
You cannot retreat.

961
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.860
You cannot give up.
You can't use.
There's an order to surrender.

962
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.500
You can't surrender.
It's if you surrender,
you die.

963
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.970
If you don't fight with everything you got,
you die.

964
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.360
So you have no choice but to fight until you're dead.

965
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:43.070
That's kind of the mentality of the old school navy.

966
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:47.990
Nowhere to run to.
You can't,
can't retreat.
Can't fall back.
You're there.

967
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:50.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

968
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.210
<v 0>So that little section was called V,</v>

969
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.980
the general instructions for the commander and now we get into the straight up

970
01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:02.830
maxims.
First one,

971
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:08.110
the man who spends more sleepless nights with his army and who works harder in

972
01:01:08.111 --> 01:01:12.280
drilling his troops,
runs the fewest risks in fighting the fall.

973
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:15.410
Self evident

974
01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.910
reminds me of majorly in colder than hell,
who remember there?

975
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:25.790
They're like patrolling to combat and he's got the guys doing drills getting

976
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:29.300
after it
next,

977
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.670
never lead soldiers into combat before they,

978
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.610
before having made sufficient trial of their courage.

979
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.910
So why we train hard next,

980
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:42.860
it is well to hurt the enemy by deceit,
by raids,

981
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.730
or by hunger,
and never be enticed into a pitch battle,

982
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.410
which is demonstration more of luck than of bravery.

983
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.930
So he's saying a pitched battle is like there's luck is luck.
Yeah.

984
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:58.830
What's the pitch?
Pitch.
Battle.
Face to face.
Yeah.

985
01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:00.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

986
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.320
<v 0>Next.
Only those battle plans are successful,</v>

987
01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:07.230
which the enemy does not suspect before we put them into action.

988
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.651
Next,

989
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:15.540
the deception is often helpful in warfare and enemy soldier who deserts us apart

990
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:20.541
from some plot is of the greatest advantage for enemy is hurt by deserters more

991
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:23.580
than if the same man or killed in action.

992
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:30.720
Next.
He who does not care fully compare his own forces with those,

993
01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.060
the enemy will come to a disastrous end.

994
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.880
Here's a good one for you.

995
01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:43.060
Courage and discipline are able to accomplish more than a large number of

996
01:02:44.211 --> 01:02:47.240
warriors.
Often enough,

997
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:51.440
the lay of the land has been helpful in making the weaker force come out on top

998
01:02:51.441 --> 01:02:55.130
terrain.
Those of you in the military terrain,

999
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:58.190
learn how to read terrain.
Learn how to use terrain.

1000
01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.160
Learn how to figure out the high ground burnout out where the dead spaces are.

1001
01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:04.160
Learn where the ravines are that puts you in a bit better firing position.

1002
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.240
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1003
01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.620
<v 0>next nature produces,
but a few brave men,</v>

1004
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.030
whereas care and training make efficient soldiers,

1005
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.700
soldiers who are kept working,
improve,
encourage.

1006
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.090
I'm going to say that again.

1007
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:27.090
Soldiers who are kept working improve in courage while too much leisure makes

1008
01:03:28.091 --> 01:03:29.860
them weak and lazy.

1009
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.260
Next things which are unexpected or sudden frightened the enemy,

1010
01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.840
but they pay little attention to things to which they are accustomed.
Hm?

1011
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.330
Used to that
after gaining a victory,

1012
01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:52.720
a general who pursues the enemy with a scattered and disorganized army gives

1013
01:03:52.721 --> 01:03:54.090
away his victory.
To his foe

1014
01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:00.910
and here's a simple one,
but because of war must be just,

1015
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:02.183
<v 2>hmm.</v>

1016
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.471
<v 0>Next.</v>

1017
01:04:05.471 --> 01:04:10.030
It does not help to assemble the whole army in council or to keep sending for

1018
01:04:10.031 --> 01:04:11.890
men when they are off duty.

1019
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.510
These things only cause discord in the army.

1020
01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.570
I put that one in there because this applies to business a lot where all of a

1021
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:21.750
sudden you're calling that person all the weekend.

1022
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.530
Nice meeting another meeting.
I need to talk to everyone.
Okay.

1023
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:29.830
On their off day.
Burn them out.
Be careful with that.

1024
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:32.070
Next,

1025
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:36.090
the soldiers must always be doing something even if no enemy is bothering us.

1026
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.320
Habitual idleness spells trouble for an army.

1027
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:43.800
So those two are kind of contradictory.
Bailed on me calling people all the time,

1028
01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:48.180
but keeping busy,
we've got to figure out how we separate in the business world.

1029
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:53.181
How do you separate work from life and as the boss,

1030
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:57.030
you got to make that distinction.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1031
01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.820
It kind of seems like that makes sense.

1032
01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:01.470
I mean consider like exercise or something.

1033
01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.660
Like you got to have the recovery period.
Yes.

1034
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.630
I can't be just cruising,
skipping days all the time.
You know,
so it's like that.

1035
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:12.780
What do you,
what do you call it in the,
uh,
in the deal dichotomy.

1036
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.550
There's a dichotomy.
Yes.

1037
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1038
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:20.320
<v 0>Nicely done.
Thank you.
Next full.</v>

1039
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:22.030
What should be done?

1040
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:27.090
Seek the advice of many for what you will actually do.

1041
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.910
Take counsel with only a few trustworthy people.

1042
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.910
Then off by yourself alone.

1043
01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:38.590
Decide on the best and most helpful plan to follow and stick to it.

1044
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.960
Hey everyone,
tell me what's going on.
Give me your ideas.
Yeah.
Okay,
great.

1045
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:46.510
A little bit smaller group.
Okay guys,
there's the input we got,

1046
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:49.750
we think and then guess what?
The commanders gotta make a decision.

1047
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.200
You can weigh all those different inputs,

1048
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:54.780
but the commander has got to make a decision.
Yeah.

1049
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:58.120
And when you make the decision,
you got to own it.
Now,

1050
01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.920
one thing that's interesting,

1051
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:04.030
and I don't mean to go on too much of a tangent here,

1052
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:07.030
but I'll make a decision

1053
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.800
and execute with aggression,

1054
01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.320
but my mind is not closed.

1055
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.980
And if I go say we're going to do x and we start executing x and x is not

1056
01:06:20.591 --> 01:06:23.200
looking good,
I'll say,
stop executing X.
I was wrong.

1057
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.033
Here's what we're going to do.

1058
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.120
So just because you're being decisive doesn't mean that you're being stupid.

1059
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.970
Just because you're being decisive doesn't mean you're not.
You're,

1060
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:35.530
you're losing your plasticity.
We don't lose our plasticity.

1061
01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:36.730
Even when we make a hard decision,

1062
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.200
even when I say this is what we're going to do,
my mind is still open and again,

1063
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:43.390
a lot of times I'll try and break as a leader.

1064
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:48.630
I will try and break big decisions into smaller incremental decisions that allow

1065
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:54.361
me to change course during the execution and you know for for,

1066
01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:57.250
and I've told them,
I've said this something like this before,

1067
01:06:57.251 --> 01:07:01.270
but if we got a bad guy target and we think the bad guy is going to be there,

1068
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.670
the first thing that I tell dude,
dude,
tell the guys to start planning.

1069
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.230
So they're going to start planning.
Then I might put them,
okay guys,

1070
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:11.050
we're going to,
we're going to go and put you guys in the staging area.
Well,

1071
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:13.660
they execute,
we're executing,
but we're not executing.
Right.

1072
01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.280
All you're doing is going to a staging area.
Yeah.

1073
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.350
Then I might even put a reconnaissance element out to watch the target we're

1074
01:07:20.351 --> 01:07:22.690
executing,
but we're not executing.
I could still say,
okay,

1075
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:24.550
stop everyone come back home.
We don't think he's there.

1076
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:28.030
We don't think it's a good mission.
We think it's a trap or whatever.
So I gave,

1077
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:30.910
I committed,
I made a decision,
we're going to hit this target,

1078
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.010
but I made that decision incrementally.

1079
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.070
I didn't just say we're going to hit it and now no matter what happens,

1080
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:41.020
so a lot of times as a leader,
I look at all the big decision,
okay,
yeah,

1081
01:07:41.021 --> 01:07:43.360
that's a big decision and I'm going to be decisive on it,

1082
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.630
but I'm going to make incremental progress towards that decision.

1083
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:50.320
That way I can be adaptable.
As I moved towards that execution,

1084
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.440
the very important lesson to learn,
very important lesson to learn.

1085
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:57.400
I never just jump off the cliff.

1086
01:07:58.150 --> 01:08:02.680
It's like you're creating a point of no return,
right?
Yeah.
There's a,

1087
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:07.681
there's a last point of cover and concealment is an actual term that we use.

1088
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:10.330
Last point of covering.
So that means there's a target.

1089
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:15.420
And once you cross this line,
now you actually do have to go.
Now get your,

1090
01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.490
you're out in the open.
They can see you.
Yeah,
do or die.
So that's the point.

1091
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.520
But that point should come soul far down the road that you can execute the

1092
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:28.100
target.
You can execute the target,
you can execute the target,

1093
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.910
but you still haven't actually executed until you've gone past that last point

1094
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:33.680
of cover and concealment.
Once you're there,

1095
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.050
once you go pass the last point in covering concealment,
you're done.

1096
01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:39.050
You have to go.
But that should be very late in the game.

1097
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.030
And it's the same thing in the business world.
Oh,
we want to,

1098
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.360
we want to open up into this new market.
Okay,
let's do a reconnaissance.

1099
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:48.260
That market you're executing.
But you might do reconnaissance the market and say,

1100
01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:51.380
you know what?
It's not what we thought it was going to be.
Stop.
Okay,

1101
01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:54.830
let's get a building.
So now are you going to lease?

1102
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.770
We're going to buy you don't go in there and buy a building cause we don't want

1103
01:08:57.771 --> 01:09:00.170
to own that thing yet.
We don't know the terrain well enough.

1104
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.390
We're going to lease a building.
Guess what we're doing?

1105
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:06.500
We do an eight year lease.
No,
no,
no.
We're doing a two year lease.

1106
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.880
We're just gonna slowly execute incrementally cause we might get in there and

1107
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.510
say,
ah,
it's not looking good.
Right?

1108
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.480
So think about how you can break these major decisions down into smaller

1109
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:19.700
incremental decisions that give you the adaptability.

1110
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.253
Next.

1111
01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:29.570
If an enemy spy has captured while observing our forces that it may well be

1112
01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:31.770
maybe well to release him on harm.

1113
01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:33.860
If all our forces are strong and in good shape,

1114
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:39.350
the enemy will absolutely does be dismayed by such reports.
On the other hand,

1115
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:43.850
if our forces are weak,
the spine should be treated roughly forced to divulge,

1116
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:49.210
divulge enemies secrets and finally either be put to death or sent off elsewhere

1117
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:54.020
under guard,
obviously we don't put our prisoners to deaf anymore.

1118
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.020
But you know what's interesting about this in in the business world,

1119
01:09:57.021 --> 01:10:00.140
and I've worked with all kinds of different companies and the reason I keep

1120
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:05.090
talking about this spy stuff and the captured and is because every industry,

1121
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.040
every industry out there,

1122
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.240
they are constantly competing for people.

1123
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.960
And whether it's this,
uh,

1124
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.460
technology companies,
whether it's financial companies,

1125
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:22.970
they're always trying to recruit each other and to try and get this guy to leave

1126
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:25.280
and they're trying to pull this person over every different.

1127
01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.840
A lot of times I work with companies,

1128
01:10:26.841 --> 01:10:29.480
they don't realize that all of the companies are like this.
There's only the,

1129
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.550
you know,
they say,
well,
you know,
the thing is we get,
we,

1130
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:33.830
we people are trying to recruit our people all the time.
Yes,

1131
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.270
it happens in every industry.

1132
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.940
Every industry has got people trying to recruit their people.

1133
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.220
And that's why I'm talking about this stuff.
Because if you think about it,

1134
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.560
if you know someone's going to go to another company,

1135
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:50.580
let's give them some bad intelligence before they leave.
You know,
let's say that,

1136
01:10:50.581 --> 01:10:53.090
oh,
we're thinking we're working.
We're not going to go into that market.

1137
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:56.480
Let them know that you are going in and out market by the way.
Full speed.

1138
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:01.040
Full speed.
Yeah.
So that's why I'm saying this again.
You know,

1139
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:05.150
you'd get to this point where,
you know,
as a,

1140
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.830
as a upstanding human being,
let's be straight up with people.

1141
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:15.900
But I'm assuming now that someone has maybe done you wrong,
you know,

1142
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:17.790
they,
they're trying to take clients,

1143
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:20.430
they're trying to take business away from your business.

1144
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:22.470
He's now we're getting into a little bit of a,

1145
01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.930
we had a little some hostilities or brewing,

1146
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.210
so some psychological warfare game within the game,
within the game.

1147
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:32.550
And there's a game within the game.
And again,

1148
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.080
you have to maintain your integrity as a,

1149
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:41.640
as a human.
And then that's,
that is definitely for me,

1150
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:47.040
the,
the absolute primary thing,
right?

1151
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:51.810
It's to maintain your integrity.
They're not maintaining your integrity with you.

1152
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.230
We,
maybe they're going to get some misinformation on the way out the door.
Sorry.

1153
01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.730
That's the way it works.
And they'll name the other one problem.
But you know,
I'm,

1154
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.760
I'll,
I'll kind of draw back on that a little bit and I'll tell you why.

1155
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.710
One of the best things about when someone leaves the company,

1156
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.390
one of the best things you can do is treat them good as they leave.
Yeah.

1157
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:12.503
Really cause that,

1158
01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:16.140
cause when they show up at that new company that made all these promises to them

1159
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:19.770
that are not true and they're looking back and going,
man,
you know,

1160
01:12:19.771 --> 01:12:22.410
Jocko was just honest with me and he told me he wanted me to stay and he told me

1161
01:12:22.411 --> 01:12:22.801
that,
you know,

1162
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:24.720
we're going to grow and he told me he didn't have an opportunity right now but

1163
01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:26.900
we'll find in the future.
He believes me.
Yeah.

1164
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.800
So I'm going to actually retract my statement about using these kinds of,

1165
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:34.470
you know,
putting your integrity at risk.

1166
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.400
It's better to maintain your integrity and,
and it might not be better instantly,

1167
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.660
but in the long run you're going to be better off even with like a spy
situation.

1168
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:47.430
So,
I mean kind of considered,
if you were to draw the analogy of a spy,

1169
01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:48.930
like let's say a tamp came in,

1170
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:52.230
your co come to me and he's really a spy because he's attempt somewhere else,

1171
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:56.220
I don't know,
whatever.
And you find out or you get,
you know,

1172
01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.120
like information,
whatever that that leads you to believe all that guy's the spy.

1173
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.780
Right.

1174
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:04.710
And then you start essentially lying to them about projects or I don't know,

1175
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:07.500
whatever goals.
Yeah,
I'd probably just get rid of them.
Yeah,

1176
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.110
I'd probably just say treat them nice.
I'd be like,
hey listen,

1177
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.140
I don't think you're here for the best reasons.
Yeah.
And in fact,

1178
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:18.260
I think you came from this organization and I'm going to let you go if you ever

1179
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:22.180
want to come back here in earnest.
Do you know what?

1180
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.440
I think you've got a lot of potential.
And I say,
I think,
hold on.

1181
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.190
I think that the fact that they did this to you,

1182
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.170
it shows that they don't really respect you.
Yeah.
And,

1183
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.040
but if you want to come to a place where you will be respected and where we work

1184
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:42.510
with integrity,
this is the place for you.
Let me know if that ever happens.

1185
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:46.080
But for now,
because of the way this has shaken out,
I can't,

1186
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.850
I can't have you here because you know what I'm trying to do.

1187
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:49.380
I'm trying to protect my team.

1188
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:52.380
I'm trying to protect what we're doing here and you know we're doing,

1189
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.020
we're doing something positive and your breath,
what you're bringing right now,

1190
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:58.260
it shows you the weakness of the people that you've been working with on the

1191
01:13:58.261 --> 01:14:00.800
other side.
It shows you that they're weak,
they're trying to do these things.

1192
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.320
It's not going to affect us by the way.
We are going to win.

1193
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:07.350
Why are we going to win?
Because we are staying on the path.

1194
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.370
See now you'll approach it like that.
You're going to win all day long.

1195
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:16.870
So let's just retract.
You know?
That's why.
That's why people don't understand.

1196
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:19.630
Man.
Integrity is so important and the minute you start giving up,

1197
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.310
even under these adverse conditions,

1198
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.370
when you give up your integrity in the long run,
you're going to hurt yourself.

1199
01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.230
And I kind of got drawn into it.
Right.
Even myself,
I'm like,

1200
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:31.780
oh we spies and all this little be straight up.
Yeah.
Maintain your integrity.

1201
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:35.410
Don't put them to death.
They're not allowed to do that.
Yeah.
Dang.

1202
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.101
That's actually,

1203
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:38.860
that's way more advanced than kind of what I was going to ask you.

1204
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:40.750
So what if like

1205
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:45.280
you expose them,
you know,

1206
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.770
like you expose the company or the person like,
oh hey everyone,
I don't know.

1207
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:53.500
You know,
not we have,
you know.
Yeah.
Well I think it'd be,

1208
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.410
I would do it in an inappropriate way.
Yeah.
You know,

1209
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:59.080
I wouldn't be trying to set them up and make 'em look up and say,

1210
01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:02.800
hey listen guys,
we found out that bill,
he's actually,

1211
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:07.450
he's actually still getting paid by x company over there and bill,

1212
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.580
we were going to have to let you go.
Appreciate you coming over.
But you know,

1213
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:16.570
we,
here are a team,
we stick together.

1214
01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:21.040
You're not part of the team,
obviously,
so we can't have here.

1215
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:26.290
If you ever decide that the weak team you came from is not for you and you want

1216
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:30.400
to get on board with the winning team,
let me know.
Yeah,

1217
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.700
that's advanced to kind of let them know that like,
Hey,

1218
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:35.890
I still like you and everything kind of thing.

1219
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.310
You know the opposite of burning a bridge.
Yeah.

1220
01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:41.090
It's like you're in a building and there is nothing better.

1221
01:15:41.091 --> 01:15:42.670
And a lot of times companies that we work with,

1222
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:47.980
somebody will leave and it'll be under those weird circumstances.
Right?

1223
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:52.060
They'll get a good offer,
you know,
and again,

1224
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.840
all companies do this.
They say,
I'll give you a signing bonus,

1225
01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.650
signing bonus to come over.
Okay.
And a signing bonus.
That looks good.

1226
01:16:00.651 --> 01:16:02.440
That's a way to get somebody over.
And they say,
don't worry,

1227
01:16:02.441 --> 01:16:04.630
we'll give you this and we'll give you a corner office and we'll give you this.

1228
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.390
We'll give you a helpers and we'll give you this title.

1229
01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.870
Right till they Lorman with all those things.

1230
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:15.250
But all those are recruiters.
They're not telling the truth about stuff.

1231
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.660
Sometimes I'm the worst.
The best recruiters tell everything straight up,
right?

1232
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:21.880
The best recruiters are like,
oh,
you're doing this.
Yeah,

1233
01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:23.680
they were really good at that.
Your company,
you're at Echo,

1234
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:27.190
they're really good with that.
You're right.
Here's where their weaknesses are.

1235
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.960
Here's where we beat him.
Your decision,
it's,

1236
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.210
it's honest and it's set your expectations,
right?
So when you show up,

1237
01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.190
you're not thinking,
well,
Joc,
what you said that this was the best at that x.

1238
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.160
Now I didn't say that because they were the best of y in tax we're working on.

1239
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:46.600
Right.
That's what you want to do.
It's just what I'm talking about is integrity.

1240
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:50.500
That's what I'm talking about,
and you've got to maintain it.
Best thing to do.

1241
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.690
Dang.
Easy to win in those scenarios,

1242
01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.160
is that one of those take the high road or then take the high,

1243
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.090
take the high ground or the or the high ground is going to take you.
Yeah,

1244
01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:05.570
absolutely.
All right.

1245
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.320
Back to the book.
If the soldiers show signs of cowardice,

1246
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:16.280
various skills should be used to restore their courage.

1247
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.610
Next.
Take your time and planning.
But when you have made decision,

1248
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:25.700
be fast and putting it into action in war,

1249
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.160
opportunity is fleeting

1250
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.550
and cannot be put off at all.

1251
01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:35.630
Opportunity is fleeting and I was not just talking about war.

1252
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.030
That's talking about business,
that's talking about life.

1253
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:41.900
Your opportunities in life are fleeting.
What are you doing with them?

1254
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:44.510
What are you doing with the opportunities you have in front of you right now?

1255
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.530
Are you capitalizing on them?
Are you going after them?
Cause they're fleeting.

1256
01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.290
They're not going to be there.
They might be there tomorrow,

1257
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.940
they might be in a week.
Where are they in a month?
Whether they're gone.

1258
01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.470
Opportunities are fleeting.
Get after them

1259
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.273
next.

1260
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.810
Let the army see that you are not unduly elated over successes nor utterly cast

1261
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:11.330
down by failures.
We already covered that.
Next,

1262
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:14.870
it is not the general whose words are frightening,

1263
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.620
but the one who gets things done,

1264
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.750
who is feared by the enemy.
That's a big one right there.

1265
01:18:24.751 --> 01:18:26.990
And be the person that makes things happen.
Yeah,

1266
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.980
be the person that makes things happen.
That's it.
You,
you know,

1267
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:34.410
in the military,
my guys,
I was at,
you know,

1268
01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:39.660
seal platoon or a seal task unit or when I was running training that I had guys,

1269
01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:44.220
my boys,
my people,
man,
they made things happen.
If I said something to him,

1270
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.520
it was going to happen.
Who's going to happen?
There was no,
I didn't barely,

1271
01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:52.110
I can give them any direction as to,
hey,
we need this.
They take,
got it done.

1272
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.530
Done.
Yeah.
That's the kind of person you want to be.

1273
01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.450
Not the person that comes back.
You know,

1274
01:18:57.451 --> 01:19:00.180
a week later we tried to make some progress here,

1275
01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.140
but I really run into a brick wall with so and so.
Oh yeah.

1276
01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.870
My guys didn't hit brick walls and if they hit him,

1277
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:10.070
they hit him with sledge hammers and busted through him.

1278
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.370
So geed would

1279
01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.640
j Charles Echo Charles's brother.

1280
01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:22.090
<v 4>Yup.
So He'd be like,
yeah,
this happened more than once.</v>

1281
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.540
Is YMC saying he would do this,
but I'll maybe twice.
I don't know anyone.

1282
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.930
He'd say,
Hey,
I know you're going in the store,

1283
01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:32.350
go buy me some wine while you're there.
And he's like,
hey,

1284
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:37.150
it's this kind of whatever kind point.
So I'm like,

1285
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:42.040
all right,
I'll do that for you.
You know,
favor kind,
no problem.

1286
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:47.170
I go in the wine section aisle,
whatever.

1287
01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:51.580
And he's like,
hey,
it's this.
And if there's,
you know,
there's white,

1288
01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:56.590
there's White Ryan read rang Bordeaux,
Cabernet Ball.
This one.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1289
01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.410
And then there's the brand.
So basically it's a wall.

1290
01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:02.530
The whole thing is all wines.
It's not the kind of resist sugar oil,

1291
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.810
this all wine,
different kinds.
And he's like,

1292
01:20:04.811 --> 01:20:08.070
I want this guy and I'm looking at this thing.
Browse here for tomatoes.

1293
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.370
That's it.
I don't want to spend one hour looking for way.

1294
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.550
So you kind of come to like this decision you gotta make,
you know,

1295
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.940
I could easily just grab my tomatoes,
go home and be like,
Bruh,

1296
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:20.820
you know what you sent?
You sent me on a treasure hunt for year one.

1297
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:25.380
I could say that and it'd be justifiable.
Really.
So I'll have a bottle.
No,
yeah,

1298
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:29.310
no.
As you'd say,
he hold the line.
He asked for wine.

1299
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:31.620
I said I would get wine,
I'm going to get wine.

1300
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:34.920
And I'm not gonna say anything about it.
That's what I did.
Found it.

1301
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:39.720
Give it to him and I know where it is now.
Legit.
Right.

1302
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.080
Cause justifiably I could've said,
hey,

1303
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:46.260
I'll do it next time or show next time we're there.
Show me where it is.
You know,

1304
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:48.480
but,
but I didn't have that kind of time.
Whatever,

1305
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.140
you know you got the mission done.
Yeah.
Do uh,

1306
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.190
wha wha what did the guys say?
They say don't talk about it.
Be about it.

1307
01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.240
Don't talk about it.
Be about it.
All right.
Next.

1308
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:07.500
<v 0>Plan what you have to do at night and carry out your decision during the day.</v>

1309
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:12.730
One cannot plan an act at the same time

1310
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:17.140
for you to bed at night.
Make your list of what God's to get done

1311
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:20.440
next.

1312
01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.210
The general who is overly harsh with his subordinates and the one who is too

1313
01:21:25.211 --> 01:21:28.540
indulgent are both on fit for command.

1314
01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:29.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1315
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:34.950
<v 0>Fear leads to great hatred and giving in too much results in being despised.</v>

1316
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:38.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1317
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.750
<v 0>It is best to take the middle course</v>

1318
01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:47.380
means balance.
You gotta balance.
So this is the dichotomy of leadership.

1319
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.260
Nope.
Don't be overly harsh.
Don't want to be too indulgent.

1320
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:54.830
I liked the fact that he says giving too much results in being despised.
Yeah,

1321
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.900
and it's interesting you got,
I got,
I hear,

1322
01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:01.120
I've heard that like in the seal teams,
if you heard that expression.
No,

1323
01:22:01.121 --> 01:22:06.040
I haven't seen that idea where you get a guy,
of course you get a guy,

1324
01:22:06.041 --> 01:22:11.041
you get a platoon leader that's really over the bearing and and no one likes

1325
01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:13.240
him.
Yeah.
And it's not a good unit,

1326
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:17.590
but you get the guy that just gives everything he's not liked either.

1327
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.140
They need not respected.
Yeah,
that's the problem.
And he might be able to,

1328
01:22:21.141 --> 01:22:24.280
his body doesn't make anything happen.
It doesn't have a good unit.

1329
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.630
Maybe not enough.
Yeah,
no,
for sure.
Next,

1330
01:22:28.631 --> 01:22:30.820
after agreeing upon a treaty or a truce with the enemy,

1331
01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:34.540
the commander should make sure that as camp is guarded more strongly and more

1332
01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:37.810
closely,
I bet you Marise the way he writes these things,

1333
01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:42.490
they must have gotten re attacked on multiple occasions because he is paranoid.

1334
01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:46.060
If the enemy chooses to break the agreement,

1335
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.270
they will only gain a reputation for faithlessness.

1336
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:51.550
And Disfavor of God.

1337
01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.320
While we shall remain in safety and be true to our word,

1338
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.950
a general should not have to say,
I did not expect it.

1339
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:03.280
Next,
for smaller forces,

1340
01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:08.580
we should select a place with a narrow who's with corresponds to the size of our

1341
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:09.814
army.

1342
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.480
The superior numbers of the enemy are useless in such a place since there is no

1343
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:16.930
room for them.
This is classic bottle.
Have battled for knobbly.

1344
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:21.850
Pick a place that's really narrow so all those Persians can't attack you at the

1345
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:22.684
same time.

1346
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:29.200
Is it a good idea to maneuver so that the sun,
wind,

1347
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:32.080
and dust are behind our men and in the face of the enemy?

1348
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:37.030
By so obscuring his vision and making his breathing difficult,

1349
01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:39.490
we should quickly be victorious.

1350
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:42.990
Think about those environmentals.

1351
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1352
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:46.570
<v 0>Next we should put,</v>

1353
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.780
we should line up our troops for battle before the enemy gets ready.

1354
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:55.140
This puts us in a position to do what we wish and barely allows the enemy time

1355
01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:59.020
to arm.
So be ahead.
Be early,
get up early,
be first,
be first.

1356
01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:00.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1357
01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:02.160
<v 0>If we are all set for the charge,</v>

1358
01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.940
then we can attack the enemy in safety with our men.

1359
01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:09.390
Full of confidence in the enemy.
Very worried.

1360
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.370
Next,
if the enemy has put to flight,

1361
01:24:13.371 --> 01:24:16.130
our soldiers must be restrained from plundering.

1362
01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.690
Otherwise they are scattered doing.
While they are scattered doing this,

1363
01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.500
the enemy might reform and attack them.
Once again,

1364
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:26.420
I like Maria's paranoia.

1365
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:27.463
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1366
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.950
<v 0>Next,
the general is at fault.</v>

1367
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:33.470
If most of the army is destroyed in a single battle.

1368
01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.440
We wrote a book called extreme ownership.
That's what it's about.
Own it.

1369
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:47.280
Next and army,
which shouts out its war cries good and loud,

1370
01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:48.780
can strike terror into the enemy.

1371
01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.140
Is that like the rugby,
the New Zealand,
the hotdog,

1372
01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:56.760
<v 4>blacks,
you know they're,
yeah,
they're doing that.
Yeah.</v>

1373
01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:01.350
<v 0>Aw.
Cause awesome.
Have you ever seen there's a,
there's a,</v>

1374
01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:04.500
they do the Haka and like memorial services.
Yeah.
That is,

1375
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.220
that is very moving and it doesn't give much more movies that

1376
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.590
<v 4>yeah,
they,
yeah,
they get up.
Even the football teams in Hawaii do that too.</v>

1377
01:25:12.591 --> 01:25:15.380
So some of them,
they'll do that before the game.
It's kind of,

1378
01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.720
I think in Hawaii they're youth kind of used to it.

1379
01:25:17.721 --> 01:25:20.800
So this might not have the effect,
but what if like you never seen him before,

1380
01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.430
you're not expecting and they do that.
You're like,
Bro,

1381
01:25:22.431 --> 01:25:26.170
these guys are kind of like,
they're ready.
They're nuts,
you know?
Yeah.

1382
01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:27.043
That's cool.

1383
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:28.853
<v 0>Next,</v>

1384
01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:33.860
our commander all to adapt his strategy rims to the disposition of the enemy

1385
01:25:34.321 --> 01:25:35.154
general.

1386
01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:40.650
If the ladder is inclined to rash nish he might be enticed to premature and

1387
01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:41.484
reckless action.

1388
01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.110
If he is on the timid side,

1389
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.320
he may be struck down by continual surprise rates or you're making adaptions,

1390
01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.790
they're like,
oh,
I know you've got a bad temper.
Oh,

1391
01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:58.300
I'm going to be able to bring it out.
Or you're,
you're passive.
Cool.

1392
01:25:58.301 --> 01:26:02.930
I'm gonna get aggressive on you.
The general should be,

1393
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.170
and dealing with zone

1394
01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:06.560
<v 2>man,
with allied and with allied forces,</v>

1395
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:11.270
he should be adjust judged for both.
When he gives presence to the allies,

1396
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:15.200
he should make a regular increase in the gratuities for his own soldiers.

1397
01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:20.201
So he's talking about they would adopt these other armies and he seen treat them

1398
01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.910
fairly.
Treat them.
Just so you know,
where you see this as a lot is when,
uh,

1399
01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:26.990
when we get acquisitions in the business world,

1400
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:32.590
so one company takes over another company and a good leader is going to treat

1401
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:33.950
people fairly.

1402
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:37.140
A bad leader is going to be taken care of the guys that he's always been with

1403
01:26:37.141 --> 01:26:40.270
his boys.
Yep.
So you gotta be careful of that.
Yeah.

1404
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.170
<v 0>In wartime,</v>

1405
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:50.770
the general should do more than his share of the work and take less than his

1406
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:51.890
share of the gain.

1407
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.250
This will enhance his reputation and secure for him the goodwill of all do more

1408
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:00.650
than your share of work and take less of the share of the gain.

1409
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.740
Aware of the uncertainties of board.

1410
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:10.570
The general ought to be ready even after victory to listen to the proposals of

1411
01:27:10.571 --> 01:27:15.520
the enemy for peace on advantageous terms.
So got to keep an open mind.

1412
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.190
The best general was not the man of noble family,

1413
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.670
but the man who can take pride in his own deeds.

1414
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.700
Next,

1415
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.470
the general must correctly manage not only matters of immediate concern,

1416
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.430
but most also take thought for the future.

1417
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:43.730
Common Sense.
But how often do we see people not doing that?

1418
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.760
Not Thinking about the future only mean concerned with what's happening right

1419
01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:47.250
now.

1420
01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:48.083
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1421
01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:51.990
<v 0>Next,</v>

1422
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:56.990
the best leader is one who does not willingly engage in a hazardous and highly

1423
01:27:59.401 --> 01:28:04.080
uncertain battle and refrains from emulating those who carry out operations

1424
01:28:04.081 --> 01:28:08.730
recklessly and are admired for their brilliant success,
but one who,

1425
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:11.490
while keeping the enemy on the move,

1426
01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:16.670
remain secure and always in circumstances of his own choosing.

1427
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:23.130
We dictate the situation.
We dictate the situation.

1428
01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:33.140
A greedy general can be the ruin of his own people and an object of contempt to

1429
01:28:34.411 --> 01:28:35.244
the enemy.

1430
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:43.750
A general COO loves luxury can destroy the whole army.

1431
01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.753
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1432
01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:48.841
<v 0>next,</v>

1433
01:28:48.841 --> 01:28:53.841
the commander is the one who can instill courage at the right time and can hold

1434
01:28:53.881 --> 01:28:57.180
back the head.
Long flight of frightened soldiers.

1435
01:28:59.300 --> 01:28:59.930
Next,

1436
01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:04.930
a general who desires piece must be prepared for war for the barbarians.

1437
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:11.640
Become very nervous when they face an adversary.

1438
01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:13.380
All set to fight.

1439
01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:14.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1440
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:19.370
<v 0>That is why my,
that is why my foreign policy is one word strength,</v>

1441
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:25.570
because the barbarians getting nervous when they know you're ready to fight.

1442
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:27.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:35.060
<v 0>Mistakes made in ordinary affairs can generally be remedied in a short while,</v>

1444
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.190
but errors made in war cause lasting harm.

1445
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.300
This is why this is why combat is like life,

1446
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.340
but amplified and intensified.

1447
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.990
Next.
Those whose performance is consistently poor should not be in trusted,

1448
01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:56.750
even with just ordinary responsibilities.

1449
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:02.180
Next,
the general,

1450
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:06.860
the sharp a general takes into account not only probable dangers,

1451
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:11.060
but also those which may be totally unexpected.

1452
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.290
Next,
make peace.

1453
01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:21.330
A time of training for war and battle,

1454
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:26.160
an exhibition of bravery.
So during peace,
prepare.

1455
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:29.870
Hmm.
Next,

1456
01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.620
the general should not go to sleep before reflecting on what he should have done

1457
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:38.150
that he might've neglected and on what he has to do the next day.

1458
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:44.390
Get ready for the next day,
the night before period.
Can you do that?
Yes.

1459
01:30:44.391 --> 01:30:47.230
You can think that's good to do.

1460
01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:53.110
Not good bed without reflecting on it.
I think I don't.

1461
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:56.870
It seems like that's something that that most people probably wouldn't do it

1462
01:30:56.871 --> 01:31:00.170
just in life.
I mean,
you know.
Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
This is about life.

1463
01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:05.080
You don't have to put that caveat on there.
This is about life,
life thing.

1464
01:31:05.081 --> 01:31:08.120
That's a good one.
Yeah.
I mean shoot,
go to bed.
It's time to go to bed.

1465
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:09.590
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1466
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:12.970
<v 0>whatever.
Yeah,
I got work tomorrow,
but you know,
you typically,
you don't run it.</v>

1467
01:31:12.971 --> 01:31:16.380
That doesn't take long to say,
you know what,
this is what I got done today.
Yeah.

1468
01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:18.380
This is what I got done today.
And you know what?

1469
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:20.210
This is something to think about when it's,

1470
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.690
when you're prepping to get stuff done.
When you know you've got a long day,

1471
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:27.350
think about how good it feels when you accomplish a lot in one day.

1472
01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:32.210
That's how you want to go to bed at night.
You know,
going,
yeah,
I nailed this.

1473
01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.320
I nailed this.
I nailed this.
Oh,
I messed up this,

1474
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:39.620
but I'm going to get on it tomorrow and fix it.
Yeah,
that's the part,
right?

1475
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.880
[inaudible] doesn't take long.
Let me do that.

1476
01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.460
Echo is going to do it.

1477
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.670
And why don't you do it while you're editing videos for this podcast?
I do brand.

1478
01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:52.640
I like it.
I like it.

1479
01:31:55.410 --> 01:32:00.410
Next it is well for the general to exercise self control at all times,

1480
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:02.140
but especially during war.

1481
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:03.713
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:06.940
<v 0>Next,</v>

1483
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:11.050
the general should not be hasty in placing confidence in people who promised to

1484
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:14.980
do something.
If he does,
almost everyone will think he's light headed.

1485
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:21.520
So you gotta,
you can't just be a you.
I know you're going to take care of it.

1486
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:25.240
I trust you kind of got to put it in check a little bit.

1487
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.480
Next long.

1488
01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:32.050
And careful deliberation promises great safety in war,

1489
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:37.230
whereas hasty an impetuous generals usually commit serious blunders.

1490
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:46.300
Next,
the general should set an example of how things ought to be done for his

1491
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:49.420
subordinates.
Training himself in the highest ideals,

1492
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:53.830
doing what is right and refraining from those things his soldiers should refrain

1493
01:32:53.831 --> 01:32:55.450
from.
Set the example.

1494
01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.473
<v 2>Mm.</v>

1495
01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.950
<v 0>The general should make sure of the good disposition of his troops by an oath.</v>

1496
01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:05.780
Next,

1497
01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:10.340
if the general knows the inclinations and tendencies of each officer and

1498
01:33:10.341 --> 01:33:11.090
soldier,

1499
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:15.860
he will know better what duties should be assigned to each one.

1500
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:17.900
Know your people.

1501
01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:22.063
Next,

1502
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:25.730
the general who wants to keep his plans concealed from the enemy should never

1503
01:33:25.731 --> 01:33:30.200
take the rank and file of his own troops into his confidence.
So just be careful.

1504
01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:36.000
Be careful who you're telling
and does that,

1505
01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.970
does that contradict,
you know,

1506
01:33:38.971 --> 01:33:43.650
having a well does that transparent transparency in your leadership?
No,

1507
01:33:43.651 --> 01:33:45.580
it doesn't.
You,
you,

1508
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.160
you don't have to divulge every single idea that you have to your entire chain

1509
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:53.490
of command,
especially because you're going to change those ideas.

1510
01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:55.470
Things are going to adapt.
Things are gonna get different.

1511
01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:59.790
So this isn't contradictory to say,
you know what,

1512
01:33:59.791 --> 01:34:01.590
I'm not going to tell every single person,

1513
01:34:01.591 --> 01:34:04.530
especially if you've got a security situation,
right?
I mean,

1514
01:34:04.531 --> 01:34:06.390
we're talking about national security.
Yeah.

1515
01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:10.250
There's things that are need to know only that's a legitimate thing.
In fact,

1516
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:12.510
it doesn't need to know this.
And that can happen in the business world too,

1517
01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.900
because you do have people leaving.
You do have spies.

1518
01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:19.350
You do have all these people coming and going from businesses.
So this is legit.

1519
01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:23.260
This isn't,
this isn't a lack of transparency.
This is prudent.
Yeah.

1520
01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.290
Information control.

1521
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:28.250
<v 4>Yeah.
I go home,
I tell my wife,</v>

1522
01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.910
and she's cruising with her neighbor and they're like,
hey,
that was interesting.

1523
01:34:31.911 --> 01:34:33.450
So the wife goes home,
tells the husband,

1524
01:34:33.451 --> 01:34:36.290
and I was putting that into who's putting together all those little dots?

1525
01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:40.150
<v 0>A picture
next.</v>

1526
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:43.720
When both sides are equally well armed,
the better tactician will win.

1527
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:45.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:49.740
<v 0>Next,
the gentleman who possesses some skill in public speaking is able as in the</v>

1529
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:50.131
past,

1530
01:34:50.131 --> 01:34:55.110
to rouse the weak hearted to battle and restore courage to a defeated army.

1531
01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.040
Work on skills.
Just like

1532
01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.160
<v 1>we learned in the,
in the guidebook,</v>

1533
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:05.170
the 1950 guidebook for military officers work on your speaking skills.

1534
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.420
How do you do at practice?
Hmm.

1535
01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:15.900
<v 0>It is good to occupy any hills in the area before the enemy has a chance to do</v>

1536
01:35:16.361 --> 01:35:18.580
so.
Boom,
take the high ground.

1537
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:19.733
<v 1>Nope.</v>

1538
01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:21.323
<v 0>This is awesome.</v>

1539
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.670
Reiterated again and again and again.
Take the high ground.

1540
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:31.470
Next as in the past,

1541
01:35:31.471 --> 01:35:36.030
misleading moves taken by the general can be very advantageous.
For example,

1542
01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:38.730
if he makes it look as though he's going to set up camp,

1543
01:35:38.731 --> 01:35:41.070
the enemy might be lowered into doing the same thing.

1544
01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:44.010
Then while they are scattered about getting things ready,

1545
01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:48.330
he may secretly drop his troops in attack where you may quietly withdraw his

1546
01:35:48.331 --> 01:35:52.850
army.
If the terrain is unfavorable,
simple.

1547
01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.040
Next in his movements,

1548
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:58.100
the general should act like a good wrestler.

1549
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.710
He should faint in one direction to try and deceive his adversary and then make

1550
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:08.390
good use of the opportunities he fines and in this way he will overpower the

1551
01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:13.220
enemy.
Same thing that you do too,
by the way.

1552
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:17.960
Ready could swap those out.
I guess he could have said Ping Christian.

1553
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:18.973
Sure.

1554
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.550
Next in battles and in every action against the enemy,

1555
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.760
the wise general,
even the most courageous.

1556
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:32.910
We'll keep in mind the possibility of failure and defeat and we'll plan for them

1557
01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.570
has actually occurring.

1558
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:42.680
<v 0>Huh?
You're confident.
That's great.
Plan of what's gonna happen if it fails,</v>

1560
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:45.620
what's the worst case scenario?
What if things go wrong?
What are you going to do?

1561
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.693
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1562
01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:52.500
<v 0>The spirit of the commander is naturally communicated to the troops and there</v>

1563
01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:56.530
was an ancient saying that is better to have an army of deer commanded by a lion

1564
01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.190
than an army of lions commanded by a deer.

1565
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:04.990
Yeah,
that's a pretty common one.

1566
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:08.663
Next,

1567
01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:15.710
if you imitate the enemy and do what he is doing for his own benefit,

1568
01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:19.200
you only harm yourself.
Conversely,

1569
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:23.310
if you do something which is to your advantage in trying to imitate you,

1570
01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:26.160
the enemy will injure himself.

1571
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.810
A lot of times you do see that in the business world where the competitor is

1572
01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.940
something,
so that all will do it too.
Yeah.

1573
01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:38.810
I'm not saying that never good,
but if you're doing that means you're behind.
Hmm.

1574
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:42.870
So try and step up,
come with some original plans and make something happen.

1575
01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.650
Next,
a wise commander will not engage the enemy in a pitched battle unless truly

1576
01:37:49.651 --> 01:37:53.400
exceptional opportunity or advantage is present and vantage presents itself.

1577
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:57.000
We're hearing that over and over again.
Next,

1578
01:37:57.001 --> 01:38:00.660
whatever terrain the general chooses,
he should make his troops familiar with it.

1579
01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.380
They will then be able to avoid rough spots and because of their knowledge of

1580
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:08.040
the area will fight the enemy with confidence.
Know your terrain.

1581
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:12.720
Next.
When the general leads his men out to battle,

1582
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.400
he should present a cheerful of appearance,
avoiding any gloomy look.

1583
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:22.950
Soldiers usually estimate their prospects by the appearance of the general,

1584
01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:26.100
so if you're in a leadership position,
that's what they're saying.

1585
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:30.780
If you're in a leadership position that people are watching you and if you look

1586
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:32.910
like Sullen and downtrodden,
guess what?

1587
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:35.160
They're going to think we're good about to get warped

1588
01:38:38.650 --> 01:38:40.480
next.
After a victory,

1589
01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:45.130
the general should not allow the men to break ranks right away for his happened.

1590
01:38:45.131 --> 01:38:49.120
Often enough that the enemy on noticing that our men have let down their guard

1591
01:38:49.121 --> 01:38:52.560
and rejoicing and if broken ranks have regained their courage,

1592
01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:56.260
come back to fight and turned our victory into defeat.
Don't let your guard down.

1593
01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:57.213
Boom.

1594
01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:02.670
I think we're hearing that loud and clear from a Reese next when the enemy's

1595
01:39:02.821 --> 01:39:06.220
surrounded as well to leave a gap in our lines to give them an opportunity to

1596
01:39:06.221 --> 01:39:10.900
flee in case they judged that flight is better than remaining and taking their

1597
01:39:10.901 --> 01:39:11.890
chances in battle.

1598
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:17.840
Next in army is judged by the spirit of it's general.

1599
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:21.743
Next,

1600
01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:26.810
it is better to avoid a tricky opponent than one who never lets up.

1601
01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:29.993
Let me say that again.

1602
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:35.030
It's better to avoid a tricky opponent than one who never lets up the ladder,

1603
01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:37.260
makes no secret of what he's doing.

1604
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:42.630
Whereas it is difficult to find what the other is up to.
So conversely,

1605
01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:43.650
which one do you want to be?

1606
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:47.060
Of course we want to have determination and we never want one of them.

1607
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:48.870
Make sure they know that we're never going to let up,

1608
01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:52.780
but you really want to be the one that keeps them guessing.
Yeah,

1609
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:58.310
harder to deal with.
Next,

1610
01:39:58.311 --> 01:40:02.570
the commanders should be severe and thorough and investigating charges against

1611
01:40:02.571 --> 01:40:04.940
his men,
but merciful in punishing them.

1612
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:10.740
This will gain him in their goodwill,
in their goodwill.
Next,

1613
01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:14.910
the general should be common emergencies,
prudent in council,

1614
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:17.160
courteous to his associates.

1615
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.150
He will be most successful in battle if he charges against the enemy.

1616
01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:25.890
Not like a wild beast,
but in a calculated manner.

1617
01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:29.893
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1618
01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:31.043
<v 0>Next,</v>

1619
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:36.770
the general should be ignorant of none of the situations likely to occur in war.

1620
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.820
Who can attempt to accomplish what he does not understand and ask that again.

1621
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:48.750
Who can attempt to accomplish what he does not understand?

1622
01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:53.700
Who is able to furnish assistance and situation,
who's dangerous?

1623
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:57.730
He does not understand.
So you got to get the knowledge.

1624
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:04.240
Next,
the general must make plans to defeat the enemy,

1625
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:06.760
not only by arms,

1626
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.290
but also through their food and drink,

1627
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:17.310
making the water unfit to drink and poisoning the grain.

1628
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:24.690
And that's again,
we're not just attacking on one front,

1629
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.470
we're tacking on all the fronts.

1630
01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.980
We're not just attacking with swords and bows and arrows and Lance's were

1631
01:41:31.981 --> 01:41:34.170
poisoning the water for poisoning the grain.

1632
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:37.860
We're attacking it every possible angle.

1633
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.590
And that wraps it up.
That's,
that's Maurice's

1634
01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:48.900
strategic con.
And by the way,
I forgot to mention this.
This is somebody,

1635
01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:53.400
somebody on Twitter said,
hey,
check out this book.
I got it,
opened it up and said,

1636
01:41:53.401 --> 01:41:56.910
yes,
ancient war.

1637
01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.710
Bring it maxims,
bring it.
Awesome book.

1638
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:07.560
And you know,
I wanted to close this out kind of with something

1639
01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:11.130
Roman related.

1640
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:15.780
And of course I thought about Julius.
And when you think of Rome,

1641
01:42:15.781 --> 01:42:18.540
you think of Julius Caesar.
When you think of Julius Caesar,

1642
01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:21.060
you think about that guy named Shakespeare.
Sure.

1643
01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:27.380
Who wrote a play called Julius Caesar and obviously not going to do the whole

1644
01:42:28.111 --> 01:42:30.330
thing right now,
but there's a

1645
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:36.900
part of it.
Yeah.
And,
and you know,
we're,
we're talking about leadership,
right?

1646
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.470
And really in,

1647
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.520
in talking about Maurice and Caesar actual rulers of an empire,

1648
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:49.110
that's what they were rulers of an empire.
It,

1649
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:54.310
it's possible to think that maybe they were better than us,
right?

1650
01:42:54.311 --> 01:42:57.970
Like they were superior human beings.

1651
01:42:59.230 --> 01:43:00.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.770
<v 0>And
it's also possible to think that they were better than us,</v>

1653
01:43:04.771 --> 01:43:09.750
not by what they did and how they led.

1654
01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.580
It's possible to say,
Oh,
you know,
Maurice came up with this stuff.
Nah,

1655
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:18.780
that's just,
that's not why he was the ruler.
This is luck fate.

1656
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:25.640
But in the play,

1657
01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.120
Julius Caesar by Shakespeare Cassius reminds us as he speaks to Brutus that that

1658
01:43:33.141 --> 01:43:36.230
isn't so not so not luck.

1659
01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:42.050
He explains to Caesar in these great lines,

1660
01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:47.051
he explained to him that that the Caesar stands above the world like a giant.

1661
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:55.180
So Caesar's a giant like a colossus is the word he uses while we us down here,

1662
01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:59.510
we little men,
we just wander about,

1663
01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:05.690
wander about under his massive legs,
under his giant presence.

1664
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:10.190
We're just where does moving aimlessly towards a,

1665
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:13.700
toward death,
towards a dishonorable death.

1666
01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:21.260
But this is what I like about is then Cassius explains that it isn't fate

1667
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:26.380
that is put Cesar into that powerful position,

1668
01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:30.490
but that men,

1669
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.060
men control their own destinies

1670
01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.730
and that men are masters of their fate

1671
01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.030
and that the fault in men,

1672
01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:49.600
the thing that holds us back from greatness,

1673
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:52.930
it doesn't lie in chance.

1674
01:44:52.931 --> 01:44:57.340
It doesn't lie in the way that the stars are aligned.
No,

1675
01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.170
the fault lies within us,

1676
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:08.660
not in the stars.
It is our fault

1677
01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.840
that we become slaves instead of kings.

1678
01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1679
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:20.910
<v 0>And this is,
this is how Shakespeare put it.</v>

1680
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:28.700
Why man,
he doff the stride,

1681
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:31.580
the narrow world like a colossus

1682
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:38.390
and we petty men walk under his huge legs in peep about to find ourselves.

1683
01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.820
Dishonorable graves.

1684
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:49.680
Men at some time are masters of their fate.

1685
01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:55.020
The fault,

1686
01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:59.220
dear Brutus is not in our stars,

1687
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.590
but in our selves

1688
01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:03.960
<v 1>that we</v>

1689
01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.140
<v 0>are underlings.</v>

1690
01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.750
So Cassie is there,

1691
01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:17.810
is making an early case for ownership for extreme ownership,

1692
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:22.740
which is obviously something that I believe in.

1693
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:24.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:29.150
<v 0>Then that is that you can't blame fee.
You can't blame the stars.</v>

1695
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.730
The fault lies within us and you've got to own it.

1696
01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:39.260
You got to own that fault.
You got to fix it.

1697
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.460
You got to dictate your own future.

1698
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.950
Don't let fate dictate your future

1699
01:46:48.690 --> 01:46:50.000
<v 1>you.
You got</v>

1700
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.030
<v 0>to make that decision to be better,</v>

1701
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:59.500
to be a king like Caesar,
to be a general,

1702
01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:05.750
to be a leader and most most important

1703
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:11.810
to be a free human beings.
What he's talking about,
he's talking about underlings,

1704
01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.600
their slaves.
Don't be a slave.

1705
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.920
Be a sleeve to any other man and don't be a slave to weakness and don't be a

1706
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:25.390
slave to slow off.

1707
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:30.400
I don't be a slave to your ego.

1708
01:47:34.130 --> 01:47:37.670
Don't be a slave,
be free,

1709
01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:39.710
free your mind.

1710
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:46.160
And the thing is you can't free your mind until you realize.

1711
01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:48.500
Like Cassius says,

1712
01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.160
the fault is in ourselves and the pathway to overcoming our fault is not

1713
01:47:56.570 --> 01:48:00.860
complaining or blaming or making excuses

1714
01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.400
or attacking others.
No.

1715
01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:11.270
The pathway to freedom actually comes from attacking ourselves,

1716
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:17.500
attacking ourselves with with discipline and with hard work,

1717
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:23.050
pain with physical training and mental training in reading and studying and

1718
01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:28.060
learning.
Then that,

1719
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:29.810
that is how

1720
01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:35.920
we overcome those faults.

1721
01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:40.300
That's how we leave behind the underlings,
the slaves.

1722
01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:48.210
That's how we get away from the darkness of subjugation

1723
01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.410
and that is how
we become free.

1724
01:49:02.530 --> 01:49:03.400
And I think that's

1725
01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.290
all I've got for tonight.

1726
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:14.170
Looks like we're pretty long to slide into Q and a right now.

1727
01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:21.280
Yep.
So
Echo.
Yes sir.

1728
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.800
If we are not going to do Q and a,

1729
01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:27.993
I have a question.

1730
01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.760
Hit me if people we wanted to support this podcast.

1731
01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.660
Sure.
Do you know of any ways that they can do that?
I do.
As a matter of fact,

1732
01:49:37.661 --> 01:49:39.520
let me go.
Let me tell you about it.

1733
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:46.770
So people have been asking me and not the kind

1734
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.430
<v 4>of,
you know how like some people they'll,
they'll say that they'll be like,</v>

1735
01:49:51.431 --> 01:49:54.010
hey people,
a lot of people have been asking me about this,

1736
01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:58.420
but it's like two people and they see a lot of people.
It's not that case.

1737
01:49:58.421 --> 01:50:02.260
There's a lot of people probably like 20 people,

1738
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.540
which is a lot of people asking the same question by the way.

1739
01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:10.630
So anyway,
yeah,
they're like,
hey,
what,
what supplements?

1740
01:50:10.631 --> 01:50:13.270
Or are these Onnit Kim on amp talking about on it?

1741
01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:18.300
So the supplements and the Krill oil is that the good stuff is the strewn tech,

1742
01:50:18.551 --> 01:50:22.390
is that the good stuff?
And I was like,
cool.
Um,
yeah,
yeah,
they're,

1743
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:25.420
they're the good stuff or whatever.
But so kind of thinking,

1744
01:50:25.421 --> 01:50:28.720
I was thinking about this one us actually working out and I was like,

1745
01:50:28.721 --> 01:50:29.890
hey to myself,

1746
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:36.030
it's not like the supplements you take aren't gonna like get you in Jocko shape,

1747
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:41.620
you know,
it's going to be like all the other stuff.
Like,
do you mean hard work?

1748
01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.630
Yes,
exactly.
You know,
we'll work out diet,
rest,
like all this stuff.

1749
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.640
And if you have like,
you know,
whatever goal

1750
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:53.730
the supplements are gonna like they're gonna help you get there faster,

1751
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.050
they're going to create less roadblocks that,
you know,
injuries,

1752
01:50:56.051 --> 01:50:56.920
all this other stuff,

1753
01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:02.080
keep you put you and or keep you in better health.
Like all this stuff.

1754
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.150
Right.
But the way I kind of,
I don't know,

1755
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:08.500
I could have been taken her wrong though,
that it sounded like they were like,

1756
01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:12.670
oh yeah,
I'm looking for like the answer kind of thing.
Not all of them,

1757
01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:13.660
but that's kind of,
I don't know,

1758
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:15.880
maybe it was just collectively that's what it felt like.
Yeah.

1759
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:17.910
So I think that's important to point out on this or not.

1760
01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.430
Those supplements are not the answer.
Yeah.
Your squat rack is dancing.

1761
01:51:24.170 --> 01:51:25.820
Your pull up bars.
The answer.
Yeah.

1762
01:51:25.821 --> 01:51:29.800
And you've got to do that stuff over and over and over.
Like,
you know how,
okay,

1763
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:34.840
I'm not gonna mention his name,
but one of my friends would be like,
yeah,

1764
01:51:34.841 --> 01:51:38.560
you're like,
you're a genetic guy.
Whatever.
You know,
they'll be like,
yeah,
Janette,

1765
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:43.270
your genetics are like good.
And I'm not saying my genetics are not good.

1766
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:45.940
I'm not gonna say they are or are not.
I'm not saying that.

1767
01:51:45.941 --> 01:51:49.750
But I got into like working out when I was 14 years old.

1768
01:51:50.130 --> 01:51:53.890
Did it stop by the way,
knew about like diet and all this other stuff.

1769
01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.410
So when you hit,
let's say,

1770
01:51:56.411 --> 01:52:00.790
let's say you had not started working out when you're 14 let's say you were
like,

1771
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.300
Oh,
you know,
I,
I know what a weight room is kind of thing.
I'm out of shape.

1772
01:52:04.301 --> 01:52:08.200
I'm 35 or whatever,
however old,
and you say,
I want to get in good shape.

1773
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:13.300
It's like that's a completely different situation,
you know?
Yeah.

1774
01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.370
You could possibly try and blame the fault on your genetics,

1775
01:52:18.371 --> 01:52:23.371
but it's not the fault of your exact to the stars maybe exalted as yours yet.

1776
01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:28.600
So she didn't work out.
Now you could say,
Hey,
I didn't,
wasn't a environment.
Okay,

1777
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:30.650
cool.
That doesn't matter anymore.
Right.

1778
01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:33.130
What matters is how you're going to fix it.
Yeah.
What are we going to do?
Exactly.

1779
01:52:33.131 --> 01:52:37.090
Right.
So,
which brings us to the same kind of,

1780
01:52:37.091 --> 01:52:40.570
this profile may be fundamental concept of,

1781
01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:43.990
it's not like it's not these external things.

1782
01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:47.480
You're not going to escape fact that if you want like get in shape,

1783
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:51.260
you gotta go get in shape.
And that entails these fundamental things.

1784
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:55.220
It's not going to be the supplements,
it's not going to be your genetics,

1785
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:58.520
the supplements,
genetics,
all this stuff.
That's part of the game for sure.

1786
01:52:58.610 --> 01:53:01.220
But that's not what's gonna get you there.
So that being said,

1787
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.370
I'm going to recommend some supplements,

1788
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:08.510
but in the hopes of us,

1789
01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:12.740
everybody being on a good workup program,
yes,

1790
01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:17.030
these will help you if you're on a good workout program.
By the way,

1791
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:21.800
these will definitely help you and a lot of people,
speaking of,
again,

1792
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:23.960
a lot of people,
I don't mean to,
yeah,

1793
01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:27.420
I mean more than to

1794
01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:30.920
think about all the people on Twitter that have said,
oh,

1795
01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:33.560
I've been taking krill oil.
Yes,
my knees feel better now.

1796
01:53:33.561 --> 01:53:37.670
All my shoulders feel better.
No,
that's,
that's a fact.
Krill Krill oil works.
Yeah.

1797
01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:41.870
And personally,
however many people told me that it worked for them,

1798
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:46.640
that has no bearing on my understanding that it works because it works for me

1799
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:50.870
and I don't take like protein massive gainer to get big.
I don't do that.

1800
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:55.220
You can I guess.
And that's cool.
And I'm not gonna recommend necessarily that,

1801
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.730
but like Krill oil for example,
like that,

1802
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.420
we'll keep you in the game way more in my opinion.

1803
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:06.230
Then it will like a creatine situation I think.
And again,

1804
01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:09.950
I agree with you and your,
by the way,
for those who don't know,

1805
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.130
echo does have a doctorate and bro Science.
Yes.

1806
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.520
Well if you notice,

1807
01:54:16.521 --> 01:54:20.450
I won't make any scientifically lanes.
Yes.

1808
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:23.120
Or maybe I will.
I don't know.
Well the,

1809
01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:28.010
the best claim you can make is that you use it and you feel it.
That's,

1810
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:31.460
yeah.
You know that is bro Science,
I guess.
Yes.

1811
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:35.420
Well it's anecdotal to 10 but what if it works for me too?
Yeah.

1812
01:54:35.421 --> 01:54:36.650
There you go to two people.

1813
01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:38.540
Then we're starting to paint that picture with the dots.

1814
01:54:38.541 --> 01:54:41.440
Remember who you're talking about her the same thing.
And,

1815
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:45.590
and I do want to add that that does mean something when I say it works for me

1816
01:54:45.591 --> 01:54:50.450
because I was for a long time time anti slip supplements where it's like,
yeah,

1817
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:53.840
you're just taking that to make yourself feel better about working out or

1818
01:54:53.841 --> 01:54:54.560
whatever.

1819
01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.340
And they're selling it to you because they're telling you the same thing for

1820
01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:01.700
long time and take any supplements and still had gains and all,
you know,

1821
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:06.320
who's doing fine big time.
Um,
so I was like,
yeah,

1822
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:09.650
supplements.
You know when people talk about supplements so they bro,

1823
01:55:09.651 --> 01:55:14.120
you're totally wasting your time because you can just eat good and eat enough of

1824
01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:19.040
the right thing and,
and do everything that you can do that.
Yeah,

1825
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.970
but here's the thing.

1826
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.840
I don't know if you can do that with Krill oil unless you're eating a bunch of

1827
01:55:23.841 --> 01:55:26.780
Krill in a smoothie or something.
Even that,
I don't know,
you know,

1828
01:55:26.781 --> 01:55:30.620
do Kenyon shroom tech,
how can you replace that with diet?

1829
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:35.030
I don't know if you can man.
So I'm slowly,
and this is what it was.

1830
01:55:35.031 --> 01:55:39.420
He was like the correct 10 supplements.
That's what it is.
So krill oil,

1831
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:42.720
take care of your joints.
The other ones that you shaved your,

1832
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.160
the bones strong and bone.

1833
01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.950
<v 0>Yeah.
Dope.
I'm shroom tech.</v>

1834
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.390
If you want a little boo efficient oxygen usage,
you know,

1835
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:54.810
keep you in that,
those hard workouts longer,
better,
more comfortable.

1836
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:58.320
Get you in the like in the car,
the Rpms,
you know what goes,

1837
01:55:58.330 --> 01:56:01.740
it's in the black and then it goes into,
we know,
we know because they told you,

1838
01:56:01.741 --> 01:56:04.830
you told us.
Tell us what the slogan is.

1839
01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:07.110
You can't pull ahead if you're in the red.

1840
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:11.460
So the shroom tech keeps you in that like the yellow,
maybe the orange.

1841
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:17.790
Anyway,
the other day shroom tech I took,

1842
01:56:17.791 --> 01:56:20.310
we showed up to train and it was the kind of the,

1843
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:23.440
the pipe hitting training partners.
You know the guys that,
the big dogs.
Yeah,

1844
01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:28.170
the big dogs.
And before I waited,
before I went,

1845
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:32.700
I had worked out as normal.
Yeah,
yeah,
sure.
But I took,

1846
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.740
not only did I take shroom tech sport,

1847
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:39.600
I also took the pre workout drink.
Yeah.

1848
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:43.380
What is it called?
Earth grown earthbound something.
It's pre workout.

1849
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:48.260
And I took both and we did 10 rounds,
you know,

1850
01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:51.040
10 rounds.
That's a little ten five minutes early.

1851
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:53.580
They were firing rounds because I was trained MMA fighters.
So,

1852
01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.530
but it's hand one hour a little over an hour of training.
I was good.

1853
01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:02.340
You showed await.
Okay.
For that one.
Yeah.
But,

1854
01:57:02.490 --> 01:57:06.630
but I walked out of there going hmm.
Tags Room today.

1855
01:57:07.170 --> 01:57:08.003
Yes.

1856
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.080
10 rounds is hardcore when you're going with no cause cause you can do around

1857
01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:15.810
with three hard guys and then you go against someone that's not that great and

1858
01:57:15.811 --> 01:57:18.750
you can completely relax and recover some activity coloring.

1859
01:57:18.751 --> 01:57:19.890
You are going against.

1860
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:23.550
Every guy is trying to rip your head off and they have the capability of unit 10

1861
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:28.110
rounds.
A lot of rounds know tech and the feeling there is,

1862
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:29.440
cause I've been in the same boat.
Uh,

1863
01:57:29.630 --> 01:57:34.170
I'm not going to necessarily say 10 rounds but in the same boat where a lot of

1864
01:57:34.171 --> 01:57:38.080
rounds reco actually I've done six tens breast takes 10 minutes.

1865
01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.570
It might be harder.
Yeah.

1866
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.690
Some might consider with heavy hitters.
Have you?
Yeah.

1867
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:46.650
That's tiring.
Yes.

1868
01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.700
So basically what the shroom tech will do is put in layman's term.

1869
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:54.420
What it will do is you know the field,
let's say you go six tenths,

1870
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.990
who actually can you do scientific terms for us here?
Not at all.

1871
01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:57.903
I'm going to laymen

1872
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:04.860
after the sixth 10th or the one hour of rolling,
you're going to be like Phil.

1873
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:08.490
Just physically,
you know like Dang,
I'm done.
That felt good,
whatever,

1874
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:14.100
but we're done.
I'm good.
I'm going to go home and arrest,
eat my stuff.
I'm good.

1875
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.680
Yeah.

1876
01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:19.680
And even today when I showed up today to roll and we had some,

1877
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:21.630
we didn't do anything that extreme,

1878
01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:26.250
but when I showed up I already worked out hard strength and metcon.

1879
01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.510
Then I went surfing,
you know,
gave them after it.
Sure.

1880
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:34.440
Shredding Dee Dee didn't eat anything but just rolled in.
I had some,

1881
01:58:34.441 --> 01:58:35.880
I take that back.
I had some bacon,

1882
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:40.970
like three pieces of bacon in between working out and so I was like,

1883
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.940
<v 4>I had some bacon.
Sure.
Good Shit.
Then I had some shroom tech.</v>

1884
01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:51.200
I just rubbed it on the way to the gym.
I drank the a the pre workout stuff.
Yeah.

1885
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:56.320
And I felt ready to rock and roll.
Yeah.
Well I'm actually,

1886
01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:57.910
instead of me saying I was ready to rock and roll,

1887
01:58:57.911 --> 01:58:59.250
why don't you answer that question.

1888
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:04.630
Jocko appeared and demonstrated that he was ready to rock and roll as it were.

1889
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:08.160
I actually wasn't read to actually did rock and roll,
which is,
which is great.

1890
01:59:08.161 --> 01:59:11.320
You were,
you were,
you didn't talk about it.
You beat about it.
Yeah,

1891
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.780
that'd be about it afterwards.

1892
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:18.550
After the hard rules with the shroom tech,
you'll feel like.
Sure.
Yeah.

1893
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:22.120
That was good.
That was hard.
I could go another one like I could keep going.

1894
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:25.570
Just how you feel.
Not necessarily that you want to keep going,
but you could,

1895
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:30.130
you feel like you could,
I mean I want it where we will the podcast.
Yeah.

1896
01:59:30.131 --> 01:59:33.670
So that's a different button.
I get it anyway.
Yeah,
it's true.
And Tech,

1897
01:59:33.671 --> 01:59:37.690
that's a good on shroom tech sport still haven't,
didn't done from tech immune.

1898
01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:42.220
I think that's the next one.
Yeah.
Where are your bars and,
okay,

1899
01:59:42.221 --> 01:59:44.950
so we'll talk about that.
Preworkout one and I only,

1900
01:59:44.951 --> 01:59:47.950
I took it one time for rolling and I was like,
okay,
cool.

1901
01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:52.840
But I'd been taking it all week for lifting,
working out,
met cons.

1902
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:58.350
Very,
very good.
Very effective.
Okay.
And here's,
here's the,
the,
the,

1903
01:59:58.510 --> 02:00:01.810
the relief,
the results,
the proof straight up.

1904
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:05.880
He's right.
So you know how like,
okay,
do you do,

1905
02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:09.460
do you do any kind of like pressing or any kind of lifting,

1906
02:00:09.461 --> 02:00:11.740
doing pull ups or something?
You know how some days you're like,
oh,

1907
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:14.740
I feel like flat,
I can still do them,
but I feel flat.

1908
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:18.070
Then some days is opposite where you're like,
oh my God,
a little pot in my thing.

1909
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:21.190
Not necessarily stronger or doing more.
Maybe you are,

1910
02:00:21.191 --> 02:00:25.300
but I just got a little pop in it,
in my movement or whatever.

1911
02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:28.390
That's how you film.
And it was noticeable and I was like,
okay.

1912
02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:32.830
And here's the thing with mine,
I did do more,
more weight than I normally do,

1913
02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:35.830
more reps than I normally do.
But I was like,
okay,
those are the first sales.
Like,

1914
02:00:35.831 --> 02:00:39.580
okay.
You know,
that easily could have been other circumstances.
Totally could.

1915
02:00:39.610 --> 02:00:43.570
Yeah.
Cause sometimes you just feel them pop,
feel the pot,
you've got more rest.

1916
02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:46.690
You know,
yesterday was easier.
I don't know,
whatever,

1917
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:48.460
all these other circumstances,
you never know.
So boom,

1918
02:00:48.850 --> 02:00:52.810
next time I lift do it again.
St Pop,
same feeling.
I was like,
okay.

1919
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.920
And that's different.
Typically you don't get two pups in it in a week.
So anyway,

1920
02:00:56.921 --> 02:00:59.200
next time I go I go in again.
I'm like,
all right,
we're going to keep,

1921
02:00:59.201 --> 02:01:03.910
this coin is the telltale.
So here's what happens.
So I warm up,

1922
02:01:03.911 --> 02:01:05.740
my routine is a warmup.
I work out,
that's it.

1923
02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:11.650
I warm up and I had my son and he needs some something.

1924
02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:15.670
Without going too far into it,
I warm up,
ready to go,
ready to go first set,

1925
02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:20.590
he needs something for half an hour.
I'm like,
okay,
you know,
I go,

1926
02:01:20.591 --> 02:01:23.200
so do I have to warm up again?
Am I,
you know,

1927
02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:27.750
am I going to utilize the pop to care for your son?
So no,

1928
02:01:28.050 --> 02:01:32.090
no.
What I'm saying is kind of physiologically and mentally it I'm out of.

1929
02:01:32.091 --> 02:01:35.830
I went out of the game for a little bit out of the workout,
so I come back,

1930
02:01:35.831 --> 02:01:39.830
I got to reengage mentally and I'm fit to be honest,
like mental health,

1931
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:42.500
shoot them kind of flap back in the day.

1932
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:45.020
That might've posable Norco till tomorrow,

1933
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.270
back in the day anyway,
so I'm like,
all right,
I'm a little bit flat,

1934
02:01:50.271 --> 02:01:53.800
whatever.
I truly,
I'm working out today.
That's it.
You know,
whatever.
Oh,

1935
02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.360
maybe you've got a warm up again.
I don't know.

1936
02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:59.960
Maybe you just got to get mentally harder for sure.
Yeah,

1937
02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:04.490
that's no question about that.
Everyone knows that,
so whatever I get under there,

1938
02:02:04.730 --> 02:02:07.880
I choose the weight that I had already showed,
you know,

1939
02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:12.800
chose before when I was like,
I'm,
I'm in it.
Yeah,
boom,
boom,

1940
02:02:12.801 --> 02:02:17.660
boom,
boom.
More reps than I expected.
It was a winning day.
That's good.

1941
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:23.060
Three in a row.
Anyway,
that was it sounding like some strong,
well,

1942
02:02:23.061 --> 02:02:25.430
I'm in,
it's,
to me that's like,
okay.

1943
02:02:25.431 --> 02:02:27.760
Even if you say scientific proof or not scientific role,

1944
02:02:27.761 --> 02:02:31.430
of course in that scientific proof,
but that's like,
to me that says,
okay,

1945
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.070
this is something you're going to be taken now.
You know what I mean?

1946
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:36.680
It's not like I tried at me no different.
I'll try it again.

1947
02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:41.390
Maybe a different sort of what the 10 rounds give me.
Yeah,
you're on your,

1948
02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:45.970
you're in it.
You know what I did today?
Target again,
do it again.

1949
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:50.900
There you go.
You know,
and actually we had some no shows today at the gym.
Yeah.

1950
02:02:50.901 --> 02:02:54.170
I don't know.
I wasn't one of those.
So yeah,
you were there.
I was there,
but,

1951
02:02:54.450 --> 02:02:56.060
and we had some other heavy hitters there,

1952
02:02:56.061 --> 02:02:59.870
but we didn't get the full spectrum spectrum of heavy hitters that were there to

1953
02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:04.040
crush.
So I didn't even need to take it.
Yeah,
it didn't get put to the test.
No,

1954
02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:09.260
it's good.
So now I'm kind of,
in a way,
I'm my supplement guy.
Okay.

1955
02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:12.800
So if people wanted to get these supplements,
how could they get them

1956
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.880
on it.com you want 10% off?

1957
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:21.230
You go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko you want the 10% off and support

1958
02:03:21.231 --> 02:03:24.720
yourself,
support the podcast if you're in the mood to and you know,

1959
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.180
go handle your business.
Another cool way Amazon click through.
So

1960
02:03:31.130 --> 02:03:32.480
Sarah,
thanks for the duct tape.

1961
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:36.560
I want to say that all the d the duct to have like a pilot duck tape too,

1962
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:40.070
which is none of it here by the way.
No,
because I needed it.

1963
02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:44.380
She sent it to her phones.
Yeah,
well there's smiley faces on it.

1964
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:49.080
It can't be on the podcast,
but this smiley face.
So you know,

1965
02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:52.400
now the new iPhones,
you type a word and it,

1966
02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.870
it suggests Emoji.
If you type in good,
guess what's right there.

1967
02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.800
That's my face.
Should be your face.
But now it's a smiley face.

1968
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:05.270
Currently slack HQ has,
that's for some reason.
Yeah,
I face or someone,

1969
02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:06.590
I don't really understand it fully,

1970
02:04:06.591 --> 02:04:11.030
but somebody sent me a little picture of an Emoji that said good.
Yeah.

1971
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:15.530
So it's kind of the same concept,
but generally speaking,
it's a smiley face.

1972
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:19.670
Smiley face went on the duct tape layers is insane.

1973
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.770
And the ones that's good.
Good duct tape.
But emoji style,

1974
02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:28.610
you know Sarah is,
she's clever like that.
Anyway,

1975
02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:33.440
the point is Amazon,
if you're shopping for duct tape or anything else,

1976
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:36.050
not necessarily duct tape,
but I'm like books,
you know,

1977
02:04:36.051 --> 02:04:38.850
you want to get this one or,
and we list that on the website too.
By the way,

1978
02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:43.170
if you didn't already know,
um,
click through,
go to the website Jocko,
podcast.com.

1979
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:46.890
Click through the Amazon banner over there on the site and then do your
shopping.

1980
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:48.330
Can support by cast that way.

1981
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:53.850
You said small click like it takes like two seconds,
right?

1982
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:58.200
Click on it.
Go do your shopping,
two seconds supports,
you know,
like a big amount.

1983
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:02.270
Well because there's a lot more than just you.
Yeah.
Cause I like just one.

1984
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:04.860
It's not just one person clicking.
Yeah.
Which would be helpful.

1985
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:07.560
But when a bunch of people click through is very helpful.
Yeah.

1986
02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:11.670
Creates a bigger reaction.
Yeah.
So small action.
Huge reaction.

1987
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:16.170
And I made the reference to when you throw a small piece of sodium metal in a,

1988
02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:20.400
you know,
in water and the big chemical reaction,
something like,
wait,

1989
02:05:20.401 --> 02:05:23.070
did I remember that correctly?
I looked up on youtube,
look up.

1990
02:05:23.071 --> 02:05:26.640
So put sodium in water,
it looked that up.
So you get guys,
they'll,

1991
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.440
they'll have a big fish tank with water.

1992
02:05:28.441 --> 02:05:30.510
They'll throw the sodium and the fish tank will blow up.

1993
02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.690
People posted them on Twitter.
Did you do the one where somebody had a,

1994
02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:38.700
somebody is holding a small brick of sodium food in lake.

1995
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:43.080
Did you [inaudible]
I'll leave her ass.

1996
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:47.580
So seniors get that exactly.
Wrestle when you,
next time you shop Amazon,

1997
02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:50.220
you think,
Hey,
I'm shopping Amazon.
I'm going to buy some batteries.

1998
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:54.840
That little click through the Jocko podcast.com boom.

1999
02:05:55.230 --> 02:06:00.210
That's that sodium that we were looking at on those videos.
It's crazy.
Anyway,

2000
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:04.650
that's a good way to support in a big way.
Uh,
and and uh,
yes.
Uh,
youtube,

2001
02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.890
that's a good one,
right?
Subscribe to the Youtube Channel.

2002
02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:11.730
Subscribe to the iTunes one as well.
But that one seems kind of obvious.

2003
02:06:11.731 --> 02:06:14.420
Most people are already subscribed,
but if you haven't,
well we went over,

2004
02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:17.610
we went over an entire book today of obvious things that people don't always

2005
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:18.503
don't myself,

2006
02:06:18.590 --> 02:06:23.130
so we need to reiterate just so we all make sure we're on board.
Yeah.

2007
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:26.700
Reinforced with our friends.
Yeah.
Yes.
You should always be prepared.

2008
02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:29.930
Always what I've heard.
Yeah.
Really that one was all about preparedness.
Yeah.

2009
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:32.120
Subscribe,
iTunes,
subscribe.

2010
02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:35.610
Be a subscriber to the podcast and that's no commitment.
You just unsubscribe.

2011
02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:38.540
If you don't like what Jack was talking about,
you just subscribe.

2012
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:42.840
But if you like and you do want to support [inaudible] you're talking about that

2013
02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:44.130
too.
You know that too.

2014
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:50.220
I heard some rumor that he's a popper.
Youtube.

2015
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.140
Luckily you don't talk a lot.
Yeah.

2016
02:06:52.141 --> 02:06:56.090
I try to keep it to like sometimes you can just suck it up,
you know,

2017
02:06:56.091 --> 02:06:58.620
want the fast forward his voice.
Yeah.

2018
02:06:58.621 --> 02:07:01.090
And most of you don't realize that you're pretty screwed.
Yeah.

2019
02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:01.993
You can have a long,

2020
02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:05.130
long struggle or just people that are there just listening to echo their like

2021
02:07:05.131 --> 02:07:07.430
fast forwarding through me.
Yeah.
You press the skips,

2022
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.110
Gay San second goes about to say something super dope.

2023
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:18.530
The one guy,
my mom or something like this.
Anyway,

2024
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.370
youtube,
we do more videos now.
We pulled out the little,

2025
02:07:23.371 --> 02:07:27.270
the shareable nuggets,
bread,
how's this?
My brother the other day,
he's like,
hey,

2026
02:07:27.271 --> 02:07:31.370
there's this new guy,
you know,
he listens to a lot of like talks and stuff.

2027
02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.490
They said,
you guys talking about this?
I'm like,
oh,
that's good.
He's like,
Hey,

2028
02:07:34.491 --> 02:07:37.360
he's talking about he into this little ideas that he's talking.
I was like,
oh.

2029
02:07:37.361 --> 02:07:41.440
I was like,
Hey,
send that to me and I usually won't tell.
I'll be like,
cool,

2030
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:44.970
maybe I'll look into it kind of thing.
And I'm like,
does this one sound good?

2031
02:07:44.971 --> 02:07:49.410
I said,
send it to me,
send it to its hour,
37 minutes long.
I'm like,
Bro.
Yeah,
I,

2032
02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.030
and I scolded him.
I said,
Bro,
you can't do that to me.

2033
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:54.790
We've got him two likes on the thing.
You're going to have everyone that listens,

2034
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:57.430
scolding you.
Yeah,
but not anymore.
You know why?

2035
02:07:57.431 --> 02:07:59.770
Because we have chocolate mcnuggets three minutes.

2036
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:02.920
You want to learn about how to,
how to not learn necessarily,
but yeah,

2037
02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.950
if you want advice,
good advice,
Jocko,

2038
02:08:06.951 --> 02:08:11.890
advice on what,
how you should approach college after the military,

2039
02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:16.690
after high school,
whatever.
Go ahead and listen to that three,
four minutes.
Boom,

2040
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:20.980
you're good to go.
You're ready to go to college.
Created a function.
If you say,

2041
02:08:20.981 --> 02:08:25.550
hey,
listen to this podcast,
it's in there somewhere,
two hours long.
No.
Anyway,

2042
02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:27.550
I don't,
people don't have the attention span for that.

2043
02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:31.750
But you do other ones besides just college.
Exactly right.

2044
02:08:31.751 --> 02:08:33.720
We do multiple [inaudible] McMahon.

2045
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:37.030
I do suggestions like got 20 pack of mcnuggets.
Sure.

2046
02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:42.370
More than that even really and you know,
you can share and consume,
you know,
boom,

2047
02:08:42.371 --> 02:08:46.090
boom,
boom.
I do suggestions as well.
Requests,
if you will.

2048
02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:48.790
People on Twitter,
they're like,
Hey Jocko podcast,

2049
02:08:48.791 --> 02:08:50.920
what does it take to actually make that come true?

2050
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:55.510
It's not a 100% turnover.
People don't like that.

2051
02:08:55.690 --> 02:09:00.010
I know and liable.
It's quite respond and say yes or no

2052
02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:06.080
kind of.
Yeah.
I don't say yes or no.
Like yes,
I'm going to do that one.
I'm,

2053
02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:10.630
I just noted,
you know,
so,
yeah.
I mean they're all go did I know?

2054
02:09:10.690 --> 02:09:14.350
But when they see them,
boom,
there it is.
You should actually tell him that.

2055
02:09:14.370 --> 02:09:17.860
I know.
Might be hard maybe because you're going to lose track of them all.
Yeah.

2056
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.730
Maybe.
Or maybe you should just do them all.
Oh yeah,
there it is.

2057
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:25.750
I think that sense.
But yeah,
so you know,
there's no downside,
right?

2058
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:30.120
There's no downside to doing them all,
dude.
No.
To doing a book.
There's,

2059
02:09:30.121 --> 02:09:33.400
is there a downside to saying making a bunch of them,
there's not,

2060
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:37.510
unless you make ones that are lame,
right.
Unless you pick out a lame one.

2061
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:41.440
When I'm talking about something stupid or making mistakes or giving bad advice

2062
02:09:41.441 --> 02:09:45.160
to the world,
don't do those.
Those are the,
that's the downside for sure.

2063
02:09:45.230 --> 02:09:48.910
Good ones.
Yeah,
no downside.
Okay.
There you go.

2064
02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:52.060
And when you subscribe,
boom,
you,
you have like,

2065
02:09:52.090 --> 02:09:55.720
cause they notified because I subscribed.
Yeah.
And when you upload something,

2066
02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:57.310
you don't tell me.
Right.

2067
02:09:57.730 --> 02:10:02.530
I just get a leave mail that says Jocko podcast just uploaded a video and I was

2068
02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:04.830
going,
wow.
Yes.
Yeah.

2069
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:08.230
Echo has been hard at work for four minutes to making a video

2070
02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:15.060
anyway.
It's good to um,
or taking heavies today for me.
I'm,

2071
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:18.220
I'm sorry.
All Day April.
All good though.

2072
02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:23.820
I did get off of brainstorms all,
I don't think.
Yeah,

2073
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:25.960
so some credit t subscribe if you're in the mood,

2074
02:10:25.961 --> 02:10:30.130
subscribe to youtube if you like that stuff,
which is cool.

2075
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:35.090
Um,
and then of course Jocko has a store,

2076
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:39.860
it's called Jocko store.
Url Is Jocko store.com.

2077
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:43.700
Anyway,
shirts,
you like these slogans,

2078
02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.900
his slogan is that only one word for like discipline equals freedom.
I Dunno.

2079
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:52.940
I think it's going to get factually is what it could be used,

2080
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:55.550
but I don't know that it necessarily,

2081
02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:58.870
I'm not waving it around and been up and down.
Yeah.

2082
02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:03.500
Although if you ask me a question on Twitter,
like guy asked me the other day,

2083
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:05.180
how can I wake up early?

2084
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:08.080
How can I work out everyday and how can I eat the right foods?
Yeah.

2085
02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:13.140
I'm just going to tell you discipline.
Your right.
Right.
There you go.

2086
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.180
This is so easy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2087
02:11:17.210 --> 02:11:20.990
Well all the point there is that there's some shirts there.
Cool.

2088
02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:25.010
I think they're cool,
but if you think they're cool,
you want to support podcasts,

2089
02:11:25.011 --> 02:11:27.860
you get assured a Hoodie,
like some good stuff there.

2090
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:31.610
Then add even some more stuff.
Um,
and look at them.
If you,

2091
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:34.700
if you'd like some stuff,
get some of that support the podcast.

2092
02:11:34.930 --> 02:11:38.840
So for yourself to get a new shirt.
It's kind of cool when you order something,

2093
02:11:38.841 --> 02:11:42.410
you know the day it comes in,
you know,
even this regular Amazon stuff,

2094
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:45.890
but the little microphone adapter for my other stuff.

2095
02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:49.530
It comes into your other stuff.
I do stuff.

2096
02:11:49.570 --> 02:11:53.490
This is kind of messed up and then do stuff just doing this

2097
02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:58.820
anyway.
So yeah.
Well,
you know,
shirts come in,
you can wear on,
you got a new shirt.

2098
02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:02.220
Discipline equals freedom.
Chocolates hits is good backwards.

2099
02:12:02.221 --> 02:12:04.100
So when you look in the mirror,
it's telling you good.
Like,

2100
02:12:04.101 --> 02:12:08.930
you know that whole thing.
Yeah,
that's a good one.
Whatever else.
The coffee mugs,

2101
02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:11.540
I'm,
I'm working with this Guy Chris.

2102
02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:16.000
He's really helping you narrowed down a better travel travel mug.
Yeah,

2103
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.950
the travel.
It's going to be good.
Real good.

2104
02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:23.190
That's good.
Yeah.
Oh,
there's stuff on there.
Look at it and nothing.

2105
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:24.710
I'm not saying buy it.
I'm seeing go there.

2106
02:12:24.711 --> 02:12:26.680
If you like something to get something,
a interview,

2107
02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:29.960
it's a good way to support the podcast.
Yes.
And actually,

2108
02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.890
so maybe someone will ask you about what that means and you say,
oh,
it's,

2109
02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.520
I listened to a podcast.
Yup.

2110
02:12:36.650 --> 02:12:40.940
Which happens a lot according to my experience and the experience of others that

2111
02:12:40.941 --> 02:12:45.260
email me.
They meet,
they spread the word.
People will be like,
what does that mean?

2112
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:48.350
Who's that guy on your shirt?
And if you're like,
and here's a,

2113
02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:50.480
here's a funny one that you wouldn't really think of.

2114
02:12:50.481 --> 02:12:54.350
So let's say I'm wearing the Jocko.
Good shirt has your face on it,
right?

2115
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:59.960
I'm at my friend's house,
Barbecue,
whatever.
And we're like,
hey,

2116
02:12:59.961 --> 02:13:03.470
let's all take a picture and you have the thing and it's,

2117
02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.610
you know the square that finds the faces.
It's finding your face on my shirt.

2118
02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:09.830
And they're like,
oh wait.
They're like,
oh,

2119
02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:13.340
it's finding you're the face on your shirt echo.

2120
02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:17.600
And then later on they're like,
who's that on your shirt?
Boom.
Spread that work.

2121
02:13:17.630 --> 02:13:19.340
You know,
it's like one of those kinds of things.

2122
02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:24.290
I like the idea of spreading the word because it's cool is uh,
you know,

2123
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:28.670
we get all,
I get a lot of messages,
people saying,
Hey,
thanks.
Yeah,

2124
02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:31.530
I lost 40 pounds.
Hey,
thanks.

2125
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.300
<v 0>I'm back in school.
Hey,
thanks.
I got a promotion.
I'm not doing any of that.</v>

2126
02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:37.530
You guys are doing it,

2127
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:42.490
but you are somehow influenced on the fact that you're getting your,

2128
02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:45.360
you're getting your discipline together,
you're working hard and you're getting,

2129
02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:47.970
your life is getting better.
So when you spread the word,

2130
02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:51.360
you're helping somebody else too,
which is cool.
Yep.

2131
02:13:53.130 --> 02:13:54.390
100%

2132
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.600
<v 4>oh,
but yeah,
those are the ways you know,
other ways.</v>

2133
02:13:57.601 --> 02:14:01.800
There's a psychological warfare in here.
This is never used one,

2134
02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.040
so no more.
Oh wait,
no.
Every day.
Those are two different ones,
right?

2135
02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:10.130
No more in everyday.
Yes,
I believe so.
Yeah.

2136
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:14.460
I listened to the everyday one because you know how like when you're like,
Hey,

2137
02:14:14.461 --> 02:14:17.580
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,
I'm,
I'm new.
I turned over a new leaf,

2138
02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:21.120
whatever the expression is,
I did my new year's resolution.
And you go hard.

2139
02:14:21.121 --> 02:14:26.070
Typically.
Typically you go hard and you're like,
oh,
carbs who?
God,
you know,

2140
02:14:26.071 --> 02:14:30.090
you don't cut a little bit.
They're gone,
right?
Yeah.
After lake a little while,

2141
02:14:30.091 --> 02:14:34.260
usually like four or five days,
you're going to like,
ah,
maybe not gone,
you know.

2142
02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:38.880
So you listened to every day write every day.
It really is,

2143
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:41.850
not only does it like make you like fired up to keep going,

2144
02:14:41.970 --> 02:14:44.040
but it puts it in perspective.
You know,

2145
02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.550
it's like you got know this is a Cliche,

2146
02:14:47.551 --> 02:14:49.890
but Michael Jordan or something like that.

2147
02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:52.830
Someone who's doing someone who's successful,
you know,

2148
02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:57.980
he didn't go back to old him five days later and that sounds real obvious and

2149
02:14:58.651 --> 02:15:01.740
yet we heard that'd be,
but that's what,
why that's effective.

2150
02:15:01.741 --> 02:15:05.550
So psychological were free.
If you don't know it is an album.

2151
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:08.760
Spoken word album is available on iTunes

2152
02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:13.020
<v 0>of like little,
for lack of a better term,</v>

2153
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:18.360
trickle warfare.
Yeah,
like verbal.

2154
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:20.820
You can listen to it.

2155
02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:25.850
It tells you to get after it under certain circumstances.

2156
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:26.610
Yes.

2157
02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:31.610
There's actually specifically made to deal with common everyday weaknesses that

2158
02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:35.120
we all,
yes,

2159
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.800
you can just press play track seven track for w o everyone that's asked for an

2160
02:15:44.170 --> 02:15:48.750
alarm clock to wake up and just get this album.
Set it as your alarm tone.

2161
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.440
I'm waking you up in the morning.
Yup.
Tell your wife,

2162
02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:54.210
tell your significant others.

2163
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.060
Otherwise they're going to think there's a strange man in the room talking to

2164
02:15:57.061 --> 02:16:01.110
them and they're gonna freak out,
pull out their firearm.
Bad things could happen.

2165
02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.710
But limited psychological warfare.
It's all that tense.
Yeah.
Psycholo

2166
02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:12.350
I should think I should put on it like Amazon music too.
That's a good show.
Yeah.

2167
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.440
But yeah,

2168
02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:17.850
currently iTunes search psychological warfare is on Google play to Jocko
Willink.

2169
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:21.240
Oh,
I dunno.
I Dunno if the podcast is or no,

2170
02:16:21.241 --> 02:16:26.241
I know the podcast is the distribution channels you need to expand for sure.

2171
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:30.250
Expand getting the game.
Yeah,
but that's a good one.

2172
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:34.630
And incidentally supports the podcast.
That's true.

2173
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:37.570
Very true.
Which is appreciated.
All right,

2174
02:16:37.571 --> 02:16:42.571
so also you can get Jocko white tea that supports the podcast and it supports

2175
02:16:43.811 --> 02:16:45.580
you and it's in stock.

2176
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:51.150
We've got a bunch of it and it will do things to you.

2177
02:16:55.750 --> 02:17:00.750
If you want to crush the soles of your enemies drinks and Jocko white tea,

2178
02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.630
it'll be a little bit easier to do that.
You'll,
it'll,
it'll taste better.

2179
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.410
So that's that.
We had to get after it.
Mugs,

2180
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:16.450
they're out of stock as I wanted to.
Joe Rogan,
he took a picture of it.

2181
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:20.440
They're gone,
they're gone.
So I got more being ordered.

2182
02:17:20.441 --> 02:17:24.340
They're being made logistical nightmare,
all that.
Sorry,
keep checking.

2183
02:17:24.370 --> 02:17:26.200
They'll be back in stock.
They say get after it

2184
02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:30.190
while you're there on Amazon,

2185
02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:34.990
you can also get a book called extreme ownership written by me and my brother

2186
02:17:34.991 --> 02:17:39.400
Leif Babin.
It's about leadership and it's about combat,

2187
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:44.440
so if you like the podcast,
you're dig that book.
You know,

2188
02:17:44.441 --> 02:17:49.441
I also have another book that's going to be coming out in May.

2189
02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:54.280
It's not available for preorder yet,
but it will be,

2190
02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.560
and I will announce it when it comes out.

2191
02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:00.940
I think everyone's going to be pretty psyched on it because I am.

2192
02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:07.380
And also the extreme ownership muster.

2193
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:12.640
May 4th and fifth at the Marriott Marquis in New York City.
This is it.

2194
02:18:12.670 --> 02:18:17.650
This is the gathering.
It's about leadership.
It's about strategy,

2195
02:18:17.651 --> 02:18:19.180
it's about tactics.

2196
02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:25.690
It's about getting after Google it,
you'll find it.
We'll see you there and

2197
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:28.150

2203
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:06.070
Thanks for the support and you know we talk a little bit about these Amazon

2204
02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:08.440
clicks and the store purchases and they're getting the t and the mugs and the

2205
02:19:08.441 --> 02:19:09.700
teachers and all that stuff.

2206
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:14.820
Just so you know that support is actually literally what fuels the podcast.

2207
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:20.080
That's what the podcast runs off of.
So thanks for all that.
Truly,

2208
02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:23.200
we appreciate it.
Thanks to the military,

2209
02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:27.680
the military personnel that are out there smashing our enemies

2210
02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:34.540
and thanks to law enforcement and firefighters for protecting us here at home.

2211
02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:40.060
And the rest of you that are out there listening,

2212
02:19:40.210 --> 02:19:42.010
that are working through your lives,

2213
02:19:42.011 --> 02:19:47.011
that are building and creating and grinding and finding faults,

2214
02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:54.470
finding faults,
not in others,

2215
02:19:56.250 --> 02:19:57.330
but in yourselves.

2216
02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:05.360
And thank you for crushing those faults by getting out there with discipline

2217
02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:11.700
and getting after it.

2218
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:16.490
So until next time,

2219
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:22.790
this is echo and Jocko
