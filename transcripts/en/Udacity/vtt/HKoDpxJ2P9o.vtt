continue practicing things they already know how to do. They should drink lots

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.360
and lots of alcohol. They can incorporate physical exercise into their daily

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.002
routines. They can socialize with others or they can play with pets. Choose as

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.560
