[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:07.675
This course is about software design focusing on high level

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:12.950
architectural design rather than detail design. It is not a programing course.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.570
In particular, you should already know how to program in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.960
at least one programing language in order to succeed in this course.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.130
It is also not an introductory software engineering course. A prerequisite of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.880
the course is that you have already been introduced to this subject,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.910
even by another course or because you have worked as a developer in a software

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.300
development organization. This course focuses on object-oriented design, and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.440
the projects make use of the Java programming language. Experience with these

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.470
topics is not strictly required, but familiarity will help.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.790
If you want a refresher, the class resources page linked to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.390
from the instructor's notes points to video lectures I prepared on these topics.
