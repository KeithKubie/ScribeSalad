00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.180
In the past 40 wonderful weeks together, we've
explored all of the fundamentals of biology,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.340
from the tiny little machines that make us
work to the systems that power the most awe-inspiring

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160
and most complex organisms on earth.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.550
Now, I want to take our learning to the next
level, simply by broadening our perspective.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.520
With a solid understanding of biology at the small scale under our belts, it's time for the long view.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.140
For the next 12 weeks we'll be learning how
the living things that we've study interact

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.040
with and influence each other and their environments.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.480
It's the science of ecology.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.399
The idea of an organism interacting with its
environment may sound simple,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.579
but it is actually pretty marvellously complicated.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.960
Nothing escapes the long arm of ecology, life
influences the chemical make-up of the atmosphere,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.370
the geology of the planet, the climate.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.399
And nothing impacts life on earth today more
than humanity does.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.059
And so we're going to be exploring that relationship, between mankind and our environment in a lot of detail in the coming weeks.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.560
Life is powerful, and in order to understand how
living systems work, you first have to understand

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.700
how they originated, and developed and diversified over the past 4.5 billion years of Earth's history.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.720
The principles that you hear about here today will form the framework of our next 12 weeks together.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.550
Get ready for the epic drama that is the history
of life on Earth.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:29.350
[Theme Music]

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.480
Earth is like a cheap rental house in a college
town, there's always somebody living there,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.400
but tenants are always moving in and out,
and new tenants moving into old one's rooms,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.520
and sometimes the electricity gets turned
off because nobody paid the power bill.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.260
It's pretty much just chaos.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.160
And like a rental house the Earth isn't invincible;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.460
I mean, a good semester of back-to-back frat
parties could tear a house up pretty fast,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.760
and then you know then everybody gets evicted
and some new tenants move in.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.600
Which gives you a little bit of perspective on humanity's position as the current dominant species on the planet.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.420
There have been others before us and there
will probably be others when we're gone.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.000
That's just how the planet rolls.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.460
But it's taken eons for the Earth to get the
way that it is today.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.100
Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago,

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.659
and for a while it was just a junk of rock
circling the Sun suffering collisions with

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.719
other junks of rock, generating unreal amounts
of heat.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.519
Eventually the constant smashing slowed down
a little bit and the outer layer of the Earth cooled,

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.439
but the core of the planet remained hot.
Like really hot, as hot as the surface of the sun.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.880
It gives you some idea of how much energy
and radiation contributed to the Earth's formation

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:37.369
when you consider that 4.5 billion years later there's still molten stuff in the middle of our planet.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.249
And it's that inner heat that makes the Earth's
surface so dynamic.

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.730
The planet's insides that continually bubbling
up, destroying what's there,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.290
renovating and rearranging furniture. It's this constant renewal, that's part of what makes life here possible.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.790
And in the scheme of things it didn't actually take life very long to show up on that hot rock.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.379
About 4.4 billion years ago the planet was
still getting pelted with giant chunks of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.499
rock and ice left over from the formation
of the solar system.

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.619
There was no oxygen in the atmosphere and
volcanoes were firing off all over the place,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.099
but it was finally cool enough for some of the water in the atmosphere to turn from vapor into liquid.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.579
The first seas formed and in them and in the
atmosphere, a soup of chemicals:

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.549
nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide,
methane, ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide.

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.329
All those things that with the help of heat
and lightning and who knows what else,

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.880
eventually created small organic molecules.
In some way, some how, life happened.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.139
We don't know how it happened.
I wish we did, but we don't.

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.819
The first life on earth probably wasn't even
life as we think of it, it was just a collection

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.629
of chemicals surrounded by a membrane,

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.870
because phospholipids, as you may remember,
spontaneously form bi-layer membranes in water.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.040
Over time, some of the chemicals inside these
membranes developed into amino acids,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.840
and eventually RNA, the nucleic acid that
was probably the first genetic material.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.340
These collections of chemicals trapped within
membranes, called protobionts,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.980
most likely began to grow and split and replicate
themselves until some crazy copying error

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.129
gave way to DNA nucleotides,

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.709
which is a way more stable repository for
genetic information because it's double-stranded,

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.300
not single-stranded like RNA.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.579
And once these little guys had DNA, they were
on their way.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.599
They might have only been one cell, and they were probably living in the equivalent of a hydrothermal vent,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.200
but they were making the most of it.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.739
So the first living things were prokaryotes,
single-celled organisms with no nuclei

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.000
that were probably pretty similar to the archaea
that we find living today in hydrothermal

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.180
vents, sulfur hot-springs, and oil wells.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
And I apologize for pronouncing archaea wrong
for the entire biology series. My bad.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.740
These prokaryotes probably made their grand
entrance between 3.9 and 3.5 billion years

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.590
ago during what is known as the Archaean Eon.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.800
This is the first of what scientists would
identify as three eons in Earth history:

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.970
the Archaean, the Proterozoic, and the Phanerozoic.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.930
The Phanerozoic being what we've been experiencing
for the last half billion years or so.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.919
An eon, as you might expect, takes freaking
forever.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.490
The first one went on for 2.5 billion years.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
So we break up the eons into eras, periods,
and epochs,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.300
which are organized by the big deal events
that we can see in the fossil record.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.980
So from 3.5 billion years ago until about 2.1 billion years ago, these prokaryotes were all alone on Earth.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.840
But then, something weird happened; the amount
of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly shot up,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.860
basically from none to 10%, in a very short
period of time, geologically speaking.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.530
This oxygen was most likely produced by a
brand new prokaryote, called cyanobacteria,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.979
which had figured out how to make its own
food through photosynthesis.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.099
The more cyanobacteria were out there, the higher the atmospheric concentration of oxygen became.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.319
This "oxygen revolution," as it's called,
probably spelled D-double-O-M for a lot of

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.299
prokaryotes out there that had evolved without oxygen.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.610
And this was also one of the first real game
changers for life on Earth,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.789
because it was the first major instance of living things bringing massive change to their own environment.

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.349
In fact, it may be the earliest example of
ecology at work.

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.539
Cyanobacteria changed the atmosphere, judo-chopped
the competition,

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.580
and made way for the evolution of living things
to take a new, specific direction.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.620
Then, about 2.1 billion years ago, a new kind
of organism made its big debut: eukaryotes.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.440
These, as you know, are a big deal because
they include all plants and animals.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.740
Eukaryotes probably evolved by a process called
endosymbiosis,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.320
where one prokaryote parasitized another prokaryote,
or maybe just ate it but forgot to digest it.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.160
And the result was actually really awesome for both the host and the parasite/undigested prey.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.120
It formed a single-celled organism with organelles,

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.309
specifically mitochondria and plastids, which probably evolved from those eaten or parasitic prokaryotes.

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:45.220
This allowed for much more complexity and
by 1.5 billion years ago we start seeing multi-cellular

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.380
eukaryotic organisms in the fossil record.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.380
The very first of them probably being algae,

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.030
but it wasn't until around 535 million years
ago that the eukaryotes went berzerk.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.030
And that's known as the Cambrian Explosion,
a super-major biological golden age when the

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.310
diversity of all animal life on Earth exploded.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.800
Nobody's entirely sure what started it, but suddenly life created innovations that the planet had never seen.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.500
Creatures used minerals and seawater to build
skeletons and shells,

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.379
some acquired weapons like claws, while others
developed defensive plates.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.659
The evolutionary arms race between predators
and prey was underway.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.680
This heralded the dawn of the Phanerozoic
Eon, the one that we're in right now.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.659
That's right, the Earth spent the better part of two eons under the rule of a bunch of archaea, and bacteria,

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:35.319
and some, like, soft-bodied worms, until the Cambrian exploded and we started to see a lot of animal phyla

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.180
that we actually are hanging out with today.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.509
After the Cambrian, the party got so hot in
the oceans that by the Ordovician Period,

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:42.919
about 500 million years ago,

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.899
plants, animals, and fungi started colonizing land, probably as a strategy for escaping predation.

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:53.590
Now there were whole new ecosystems to explore
and adapt to and create!

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.030
During the Devonian Period, about 365 million
years ago,

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.969
tetrapods, four-legged vertebrates that probably evolved from lobe-finned fishes, showed up on land,

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.939
and so did arthropods like insects and spiders.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:07.389
From here we begin to see ecological systems
that we recognize today,

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:13.800
because organisms were changing their environments by consuming oxygen in the atmosphere and releasing carbon dioxide.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.599
And you know who likes carbon dioxide: the
plants.

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:22.360
The Carboniferous Period that extended from
359 to 299 million years ago was when the

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.120
plants entirely went nuts.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.909
The forests were so dense and so widespread
that they made all our fossil fuels.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:36.000
All the coal and oil that we now use to power all the things with were made over the course of about 60 million years.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.800
This time, it was the plants that had changed
both the climate and the geology of Earth.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.040
These forests cranked out so much oxygen that the atmosphere contained around 35% oxygen rather than today's, like, 21%.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.920
All this oxygen started cooling the planet,
because there wasn't enough carbon dioxide

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.100
to maintain the balmy temperatures that the
vast carboniferous jungles needed to survive.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.680
So, the whole system crashed, and all the
carbon from these forests sunk into swamps

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.630
and eventually got locked in rocks.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.290
Of course, now we're releasing all that carbon
by burning fossil fuels, which is certainly

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.959
helping to keep the planet toasty now.
That right there, some good ecology!

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:14.739
In the Permian Period, 299 to 251 million
years ago,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.560
all the land masses of the world joined to
form one giant continent that we call Pangaea,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.300
altering global climate and ocean currents,
and animals and plants evolved in response.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.100
We started seeing gymnosperms, the first plants
with seeds like modern pines and spruces and firs,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.720
and archosaurs, the grand-daddys of dinosaurs
and modern birds showed up.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.840
But you probably picked up enough of the pattern
here to predict that this party didn't last forever.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:43.500
About 252 million years ago, something happened, or maybe a lot of things happened in quick succession.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.880
But whatever they were
-- movie executives, take note --

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.940
the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event would make the most awesome disaster film of all time,

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:57.270
because up to 96% of all marine species and 76% of terrestrial vertebrate species bought the farm.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.050
And it's the only known mass extinction of
insects.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.860
About 57% of all taxonomic families and 83%
of all genera became extinct.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.010
It was the most significant extinction event
on the planet, ever.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.339
It's been hard to pinpoint the reason for
this extinction event because most of the

00:10:12.339 --> 00:10:14.079
evidence has been wiped out, of course.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.510
It may have been kicked off by an asteroid
that released the energy-equivalent of the

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.720
detonation of a few million nuclear weapons
all at once.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.920
And then insult added to injury, when a whole
bunch of volcanoes erupted,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.180
methane was released from the sea floor, there were probably some gas explosions in what's now Siberia,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.820
and then a whole bunch of climate changes, sea level changes, and changes in ocean salinity probably occurred.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.199
Nobody's sure exactly what happened, but we do know that it took a long time for life on Earth to make a comeback.

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:42.939
But look on the bright side, as a result of
the Permian-Triassic event we got dinosaurs!

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.260
They were able to evolve during the Triassic because there wasn't much competition for resources.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.100
So they evolved to fill an available niche,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.320
that is, a combination of living and non-living
resources that they could use to survive.

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:58.870
Remember that word, because a lot of ecology
comes down to who's exploiting or leaving

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.630
or getting kicked out of or altering their
niches.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.589
And during the Triassic period, there were
tons of niches, the sky was the limit,

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:10.470
because hey! there weren't very many animals
or plants to compete with.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.790
So by the Jurassic Period, about 199 to 145
million years ago, huge herbivorous dinosaurs

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.740
were roaming the Earth; smaller, mean-as-crap carnivorous dinos were stalking the herbivores;

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.769
the oceans were full of giant squid and
ichthyosaurs and long-necked plesiosaurs;

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.410
the air was full of pterosaurs and the first
birds.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:34.959
And there were mammals! Small ones, but they were all over the place, it just wasn't our time to shine.

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.230
The Jurassic was dino time, and the dinos
lived it up.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.209
They partied down until about 65 million years
ago when they all went extinct,

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:46.250
as I'm sure you're aware, except for their
surviving descendants, the birds.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.579
It was probably an asteroid that hit the Yucatan
peninsula in Mexico that did them in,

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:53.980
but other theories suggest it could've been
climate change due to increased volcanic activity,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.860
and the possibility that they just couldn't adapt
to changes in other living things around them.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:04.279
For instance, about 100 million years ago, angiosperms, or flowering plants, first appeared, and they did really well.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:09.319
Especially since flying insects evolved with
them, providing a great vehicle for reproduction.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.660
This is a great example of another ecological
principle, co-evolution.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.230
But dinosaurs liked to eat the old-fashioned gymnosperms -- we know that from studying their fossilized poop.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.880
So maybe their pickiness made them go extinct,
who knows?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.440
And with the dinos out of the picture, mammals
and birds were free to take over.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.459
And this is where the flora and fauna on Planet
Earth start looking a lot more like they do today.

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:30.660
Since then, there have been climate fluctuations
and extinction events

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.820
and the evolution of many animals and plants,
including humans.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.280
And on a geological scale, oddly enough, that
kind of brings us up to today.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.080
Ecology is all about action and reaction: an asteroid hits and a bunch of stuff happens because of it;

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.060
plants take over and different stuff happens
because of that.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.779
Humans start releasing all the carbon dioxide locked in 300 million year old rocks and the planet heats up,

00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:57.269
and, you know, we don't know what happens.
But ecology is providing us our best guesses.

00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:01.149
Over the next three months, we're going to explore these relationships in more and more detail,

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:05.569
as well as, like, how humans relate to the
whole thing and how we're affecting all of this.

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:09.401
