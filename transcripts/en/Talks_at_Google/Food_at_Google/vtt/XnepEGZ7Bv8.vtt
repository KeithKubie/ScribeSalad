&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Hi.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
My name is Jen Huang and I work in ads at
Google.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.160
And I'm here to introduce Anthony, from Anthony's
Cookies.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.530
So I'm very excited that you guys are all
here today.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.760
So
just give a really short introduction.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.830
Anthony was
attending San Francisco State University working

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.000
toward
an accounting degree when his friends jokingly

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.289
suggest he actually bake
cookies to make ends meet.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.409
So he started baking cookies
out of his small student apartment which kick

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.440
started his ten
year career in baking.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.660
And despite having no formal
culinary training, he opened his own bakery

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.820
and is now
the number one producer of gourmet cookies

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.440
in the Bay Area.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.489
And his 'cookies and cream cookie' has also
been featured

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.740
as one of the Best Eats of San Francisco in
both 2010 and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.740
2011.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Okay.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.820
So give a warm round of applause for Anthony.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.400
[Applause]

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.140
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Thank you.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.570
First, I want to say -- I'm not going to
lie -- I hope you don't mind my just being

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.570
myself.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.570
If I
stutter or trip on a cord or something like

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.170
that, just let me
do it.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
And I got to say, I got to first thank Twitter.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.240
And you're going to understand why.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
That was the first
time I ever did something like this.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.880
And if there was a
bucket to catch all the sweat, [chuckles]

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.950
it would have been very
full.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.360
So that was -- I kind of broke the ice and
I kind

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.510
of get this.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.530
It's not that bad speaking in front of many
people.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.820
But did that about a month ago.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.211
But I also want
to say thank you all for taking the time . Because

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.890
I know you
all work at Google.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.730
I'm sure it's extremely busy.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.500
It's an assumption but I'm
almost guaranteed for you to take your time

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.900
out of your
schedule and come see me or hear what I have

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900
to say.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.690
So
all right.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.840
The first thing, I just want to let you
know, you know, a little bit about Anthony's

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Cookies.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.799
Jen pretty much told you how it all started.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.530
And I'm
just going to kind of go into detail if you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
don't mind.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.709
So, first of all, I never in my life was good
at baking.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.370
I know my mother, she was good at baking,
but the most

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.110
I ever came to baking was licking the spoon
after she got

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.349
done whipping whatever she made.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.230
I never was good at
baking, wasn't inclined to baking.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.430
And I want to make a
statement -- you're going to see how this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.680
is connecting
later, but my -- I was always a.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.950
I love mathematics.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.090
I
love mathematics.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.799
So I was inclined to doing things
towards accounting, even possibly engineering.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.439
Architecture.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.489
Things of that nature.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.459
So that's how I
ended up at State.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.170
You're probably thinking, accounting, math,
how in the world is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.849
he doing cookies and good at it?

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.610
But, you know -- so I
end up at State and somebody suggested I make

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.629
some
cookies.

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.769
It wasn't anything to be taken serious, but
I'm

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.439
the type of person where, if it makes a little
bit of

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.200
sense sometimes, I just go ahead and run for
it and do

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
it.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.139
So I ran and I did it and I made some cookies.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:56.480
And
again, I wasn't, I wasn't planning on doing

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.669
this for
the rest of my life.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.760
Or even turning it into a business
that it is now.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.029
That was the farthest thing from mind.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:07.581
It was something on the side just make a few
dollars here

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.830
and there, you know?

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.290
And I did it.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.470
So a few dollars
started adding up.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.890
[laughs] You know, nothing huge, nothing big.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.660
But I started doing it.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:29.940
And I just took an interest;
just got good at making cookies.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.580
You know, so as time
went on, I learned I'm a little business savvy.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.860
Natural
business savvy.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.280
And I took my ability to make cookies
and I started marrying the two.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.960
Using my natural
business sense.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.600
And it's funny.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.560
Like now, people tell
me, "Anthony, you're doing great marketing.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560
You're doing
this."

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
And I'm like I am?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.300
[chuckles] And so, later on I'm like, "I
am."

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.770
Just doing things that naturally came to me.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.270
So
for example, one of the things I would do

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.870
was -- because
as I'm making the cookies, I wanted people

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.600
to know,
"okay, look -- I'm the one making the cookies.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.161
[chuckles] If you
want the cookies, I want to make sure you

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:24.650
can contact me.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.270
You can distinguish me from anybody else.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.270
You know?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.150
So
it's the little things like putting -- I can't

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.150
come up
with the name.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.040
I put a name attached a name to the
business.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.680
Just most simplest thing that I thought.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.040
Those are the things that I did.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.450
You know from the
beginning.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.450
Okay.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.390
And so, years later, you know -- as
like I said.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.790
And I have to say this.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.910
And I'm sure many
of you can relate to this.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.970
What has driven me and what
still continues to drive me is, I don't like

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.190
to
disappoint people.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.870
You know, I really, I hate
disappointing people, you know?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.730
And I don't like to
offer something that is not 100 percent if

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.750
not more.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.580
So
if it was cookies, and like I said, forgive

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.910
me if I kind
of dance around a little bit.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.390
But it was cookies in a
sense.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.390
So I wanted to make sure when you got the
cookie,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.370
you were blown away.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.670
You were satisfied.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:40.010
You know, so
having that as, you know, the batch up the

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.340
reason behind
what I did, that's how things always came

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.080
out better and
really good.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.850
You know, and that was from the service
that I gave.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:01.300
And that was also of course directly to the
cookies that I made, you know?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.230
So all of that, you know,
years later, I ended up saying, "I got to

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.070
have my own
place."

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.540
I can't continue doing this the way that I
was

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.080
doing.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.870
You know, so I went ahead and started putting
things together trying to figure out, "how

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.900
can I get my
own place to bake from where I can control

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.110
everything and
get more creative and offer a better service

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.010
and keep the
quality up?"

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.550
So I went ahead, did that, and so my mind
is working.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.200
So I started reading books.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:46.200
And if I jump a
little bit, forgive me, but that's why -- some

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.050
of the
people that I really admire are like Steve

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.230
Jobs, Jay-Z.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.590
I'm like dang it.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.770
Making cookies.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.730
This is completely
different.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.780
But really business and success and when you
have goals, it's very, very similar.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.010
There's so many
similarities.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.800
You know, so, and the reason why I
mention them, a lot of, many of them had humble

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.080
beginnings.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:25.390
They just pretty much had a dream or they
had, they figured out they were good at something.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.870
And
sometimes when you figure out you're good

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:33.710
at something,
you just start seeing what you're capable

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.710
of.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:40.930
Or you
begin to see what you're capable of.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.499
And where it can
possibly go.

00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:48.730
And you just, there are walls and different
things in front of you.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.019
But you just don't see.

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:53.329
You see
that's something you can overcome.

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:59.230
I had nothing at the
time of my idea of getting my own shop.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.180
And I just
started reading books.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.800
OK, "how can I raise the money?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.569
How
can I do this?

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:08.069
How can I do that?"

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.490
So I started that.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.680
I started, you know, asking different people.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.579
I even
went as far as being told, "yes, I can do

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:17.579
this."

00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:18.670
And
people back out on me.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.389
And I was just never -- I was
always motivated, you know?

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:24.690
Nothing discouraged me.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.310
So
eventually things happened.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.439
And it was still rough.

00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:31.579
It
was still very rough.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:35.290
I ended up finally finding a
place.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.660
Somebody told me to come look at this one.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.660
I'm
like okay.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.079
And I went and looked.

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:42.939
And it was a place on
Valencia.

00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:44.779
That's where , that's the first shop.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:47.850
The first one.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.540
So okay.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.709
And there's a friend of mine I was living
with at the

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:52.709
time.

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:53.709
He said, "you should go for this one."

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:55.249
"you
should go for this one."

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.910
"I trust you."

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.690
So I went for
it.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:05.790
It was probably the, where we were, nothing
there.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.760
Just
like the dead end of that street.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.350
So, went ahead.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.660
Took
dead end and started building it.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.930
We opened up and it
was -- I was a new kid on the block.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.790
I didn't have a big
name.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.150
I didn't have any, you know, big chef that
I can

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.639
mention trained me or went to this culinary
school.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:32.240
It
was nothing.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.139
You know, except heart, passion, and I was
good at what I did.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:39.350
And I'm confident.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.290
Not arrogant
confident, but confident.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.790
[laughter] Not arrogant confident.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.360
So I
just -- I did it and we opened up.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.079
I'm telling you
there's -- and I'm actually glad.

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:56.130
If you ever start
something or do something, I am asking you

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.399
take pictures.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:03.839
Write notes, because you actually need to
see -- so a

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.720
year later you'll look back and say, "wow,
we've come

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.949
far."

00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:14.019
But if you don't take pictures and do different
things like that, you can't really

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:18.459
see how far you've grown.

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:22.370
Somebody came in and took a
video of us.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.230
And the place was bare.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.230
Bare.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.230
We were
unorganized.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.430
We didn't know what we were doing.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.560
All we
had was the cookies and they were good and

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.019
just passion.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:43.470
So years later, you know, we just kept building,
kept

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.209
building, kept building.

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.439
Whatever came in, we kept
reinvesting.

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:49.379
Kept reinvesting.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:56.110
And just kept, you know,
whether it's -- identifying a piece of equipment.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.050
Different things that's going to make the
product more

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:06.220
consistent, you know, make a better product.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.540
You know
make it easier on the staff.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:13.720
We always reinvested
whatever could make it -- things more pleasant

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.199
for the
customers coming in.

00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:16.649
We did that.

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:17.871
So that's how we
grew in that capacity.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:22.059
This is after we finally got the place.

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:27.360
And I got
to say.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.319
I think one of the main things about being
successful, you have Google -- huge.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:37.309
You have so many Huge places out there.

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:44.790
I think just the main
thing that successful businesses focus on,

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.889
even down to
something as small as us, is never losing

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:51.920
sight of your
customers.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.170
You know, never ever losing sight of your
customers.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.189
You know, so it's funny.

00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:01.949
Somebody mentioned
everybody that goes in there is so nice.

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.110
Employees so nice.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.160
We're very strict on hiring process.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.920
Because somebody
comes into your shop, you don't want to disappoint

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
them.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.339
Not just with the product.

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:19.529
You want to make sure they're
pleased with how they're treated.

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:20.529
You know.

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:24.820
So and
again like the product itself.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.740
It has to be 100 percent,
because you just don't want to disappoint

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.740
anybody.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.860
Because why would anybody want to come back
to you?

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.930
So
those are some of the things that were at

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.559
the beginning
of Anthony's Cookies.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:46.529
So now, we are -- right now I want
to go very well.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:51.619
Constantly looking into growing.

00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:55.940
And
hopefully I gave you a good foundation of

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.170
where Anthony's
Cookies came from.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.399
And I want to, of course, share more
things with you but I really want to open

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.399
the floor.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:08.119
Any
questions that you have for Anthony, the owner

00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:11.100
of Anthony's Cookies, please ask it.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.350
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Please step forward to
the microphone

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.720
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Hi.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.160
Thank you so much for coming.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160
&gt;&gt;Anthony: Thank-you

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.019
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I've been to your
place on Valencia many times.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:30.480
And actually Jen was the
one who introduced me to it, to your place.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.800
My
question is where do you get your recipes

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.993
and how do you
come up with it?

00:14:34.993 --> 00:14:37.519
And you talk about making the product
better.

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:40.880
What's the process there of how you make the
product better?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.040
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Okay.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.709
Where I get the recipe -- the first place
I got

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:48.510
the recipe was -- I just read it off the back
of a box or

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.639
something one time.

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:55.889
[laughs] Because I was not serious about
this.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:58.170
When I first started, I didn't have develop
a

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.339
business plan or anything like that, because
it wasn't to

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:02.339
me taken serious.

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:07.400
But as I started, you know, this is gonna
answer your question, then I

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.010
started paying attention to it.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:20.699
So I took one basic
recipe and I just changed it as I understood

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:24.779
how the
baking process went.

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:26.559
You know, which is very
mathematical.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.060
That's why I said earlier.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.899
You see how it
ties in.

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:32.000
It's a science.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
It's a science.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It's like my
cooking.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.850
You know, you get to taste, change this, change
that.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.749
But with baking, it's a science.

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:46.189
It's very
mathematical.

00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:52.179
So the way I came up with the recipe, I
figured out one base recipe.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:55.649
And then, from there, I
would just change it.

00:15:55.649 --> 00:15:58.899
You know, I would just change
until I was completely satisfied.

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:00.790
I knew my end result.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.939
I knew my end result.

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:11.589
And I would just change it until I
got the result that I desired.

00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:13.420
You know, and I would
just listen to people.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.059
Listen to people's criticisms.

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:17.569
I
would listen to people's, you know, if they

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:19.989
say this is
really good, I would stick with it.

00:16:19.989 --> 00:16:23.420
If it's something
that they complained about, then I would change

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.399
it until
they were completely satisfied.

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:30.929
And then, as time went
on, I would just do different things and change

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:31.929
it.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:34.779
Does
that make sense?

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:35.779
Yeah.

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:43.379
And one thing I got to say is,
when you're -- pretty at much anything -- but

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:46.660
when you're
making something every step you have to pay

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.410
strict
attention to it.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.600
And that's the same thing with baking.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.540
If you're making cakes, if you're making cookies,
every

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.439
single step, you can't take for granted.

00:16:57.439 --> 00:17:00.029
You have to
put -- you have to pay strict attention to

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:02.959
it and make
sure it's done thoroughly.

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:06.150
Does that answer your
question?

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.419
All right.

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:09.640
Please, any other questions?

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.020
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Okay.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.220
So I have two questions for you.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.309
One is, what
is your favorite cookie?

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:23.449
And then the second one is do
you have any plans to expand your business

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:26.220
in terms of
maybe doing a cookbook or doing other types

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.000
of sweets
like cupcakes or cakes?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.030
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Yes, yes.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:36.090
There are definitely plans of expansion.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.980
Right now, we don't plan on getting into different
types

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980
of food.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.789
We want to make sure we do one thing and do
it

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:44.789
well.

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.590
Do one thing and do it well.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.660
And there are
definitely plans for expansion.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.030
As far as a cookbook,
yes -- that's later though.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.179
[laughter] Yes, we're going to get very
creative.

00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:02.250
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Yeah, hi.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.570
One thing I've always respected about
entrepreneurs, is you guys got to pretty much

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.250
navigate the
highs and lows all by yourself, right?

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.870
So I was wondering
sounds like I'm catching you on a high.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.809
You seem
exuberant today.

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:18.169
But I was wondering if you could talk
about some of the low points you hit in your

00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:21.749
business and
how you went about handling that.

00:18:21.749 --> 00:18:24.610
&gt;&gt; Anthony: That's a really good question.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:32.460
Definitely the first thing I
would say is attitude.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.820
I try to make sure I have a
positive attitude.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.630
And very optimistic.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:42.220
You know, so --
and when we do reach a low or challenge or

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.330
difficulty, I
try to embrace it.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.320
You know, at first, I would get a
little, you know, frazzled.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.560
You know, a little nervous.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.649
But now, it's more, usually if something goes
wrong or

00:18:57.649 --> 00:19:02.210
something happens, you know, you embrace it
and learn

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.210
from it.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.210
And just improve from it.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.779
It may sound silly,
but that's really what you have to do.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:13.039
You know, so I
would say some of the -- really hasn't been

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:16.850
major low
points.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.870
I would say some of the biggest challenges
that

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:26.870
we've faced are -- I would say one of the
things that was

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:36.270
new to me is managing 
like plumbers and different

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.610
professionals.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.899
Whether general contractors or, you know,
different professionals like that.

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:45.710
It's a task managing
everybody, you know?

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.710
So I learned a lot from that.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.700
And
the way I learned was I just paid attention

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.820
to what I
did.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.980
I tried to make sure I didn't want make the
same

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980
mistake twice.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.430
And one of the things that I love.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.640
I've
always done and I continue to do.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.590
If I see somebody
strong where I'm weak, I'm very quick to ask

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.519
them
questions.

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:15.500
You know, whether it's a successful business
person, whether it's a book or, you know,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.639
somebody that's
a successful business person that's around

00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:19.639
me.

00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:20.740
I pick
their brain.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.300
You know, I develop relationships with the
right people.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.590
Pick their brain.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.789
Generally they give you
some very good pointers on how to deal with

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:30.139
your lows, you
know.

00:20:30.139 --> 00:20:33.760
And ultimately I try to make sure I stay on
top of

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.320
things every single day so that you can prevent
as many

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.200
lows as possible.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:52.350
And you know, and just when a low
comes up, you assess it and assess it.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.090
Use all the
resources that you have and then overcome

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.570
it.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.970
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I have a couple of questions.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.580
Maybe you answered kind
of the first one.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.280
So what was the hardest part of
starting a food related business in San Francisco,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.059
because there's a lot of competition.

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.240
Is it finding
affordable places to rent?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.450
Was it finding talent?

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.610
Was
it raising money?

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.610
Was it advertising?

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.960
And then I'm
going to ask the second question later.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.389
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Yeah.

00:21:20.389 --> 00:21:23.080
So I want to repeat that.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:31.730
So what was the
hardest part of starting a business with food

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.900
in San
Francisco.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.910
One of my benefits was I kind of didn't know
what I was walking into.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.230
[laughter] You know, I guess I was a
little naive.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:55.730
So, I didn't realize till later -- wow,
I'm in pretty much the mecca of food, you

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.730
know?

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.880
In San
Francisco.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.470
You know, so it was pretty much what I do.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.029
I
just did it.

00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:07.880
Sometimes you have to -- whether it's a
food industry.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.820
If it's technology.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.880
There's so many different --
there's so much competition out there.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.480
Sometimes you
just have to go for it, you know, and just

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.799
do what you
absolutely know is your best.

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:29.950
You know, do what you
absolutely know is your best.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.820
And then, under no
circumstance, compromise.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:39.500
You know, so in the food
industry, I just didn't compromise anything.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.980
And you
know, the challenges -- with the food industry

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:50.260
-- it's
pretty much dealing with San Francisco -- the

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.679
health
department and building permits.

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:58.279
But again, it goes back
to embracing challenges.

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:04.399
I'm so glad they were hard on
us, because now, if you can open up in San

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:08.610
Francisco, if
you can open up a food establishment in San

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.309
Francisco and
be successful, you can pretty much be successful

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.809
anywhere.

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:16.220
Because it's so strict.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.159
It's very strict.

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:23.490
You know, so San Francisco -- they're very
strict when it

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.830
comes to health.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.220
You know, making sure you're following
the guidelines.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:35.010
You know, making sure you're following
the guidelines of our sanitation.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.500
You know, the building
permits.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.809
And you would -- when you think about it,
it's

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:40.919
like, "oh, man, it's a headache going through
all this."

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.539
But then again, if you look at, "if this wasn't
done right,

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:46.389
this could cause a major disaster."

00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:52.251
So you're actually kinda
glad they're on you very strict and you can

00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:56.450
learn from it
to the point where now I can probably be a

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.159
general
contractor for any food--.

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.330
[chuckles] I'm glad I went through all of
that.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.919
If you
ask me for food, people come to me regular

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:03.919
now.

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:04.919
How do
you do this?

00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:05.919
How do you do that?

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.509
I can answer their
questions.

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:10.309
Does that answer your question?

00:24:10.309 --> 00:24:12.230
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Kind of.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.990
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Well, I want to make sure it's
fully.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.990
[laughs]

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.700
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I just want to get any one of
those things stands out.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.600
Was it really hard to find a place for instance
that was

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600
affordable.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.690
&gt;&gt; Anthony: It was hard.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.690
That's hard.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.180
Because I'm going to say
it like this.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:34.570
It's easy to do anything, but if you have
standards, [laughs] that's where the difficulty

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.769
comes in.

00:24:35.769 --> 00:24:40.610
You
know, if you want -- I can go pick a place

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.020
right now.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.960
I
might be in the middle of nowhere.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.679
[laughs] You know, so I can --
you can do anything you want, but if you have

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.679
standards.

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:53.690
I think the higher your standard is, that's
what really

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.009
dictates your level of difficulty.

00:24:56.009 --> 00:25:04.080
So if I want a place
that is in a certain location, well, then

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.509
money is a
factor.

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:06.559
You have to factor that in.

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:10.380
You have to factor
in -- of course getting a little more expensive.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.710
We open
up.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:16.659
If you want to open up in -- then you have
to also

00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:20.070
take into consideration will your concept
work here.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.490
Just because it works here doesn't necessarily
mean it will work

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.490
there.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:30.019
I mean, so you have to take all of those things
into consideration when you make a move as

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:31.929
far as finding
the right location.

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:36.990
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Yes, my second question was what's
your experience

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.470
advertising on Google?

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.910
&gt;&gt; Anthony: What's my -- ah -- ah, I see where
he's going.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.640
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Jen invited me.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.270
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Anthony: Ah.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.880
When you said the highs and lows -- and the
challenges.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.169
[laughter] I wasn't expecting that.

00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:58.910
But you got to
look into that.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.000
But just so far as advertisement.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.429
To be
honest, we haven't done any advertisement.

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:09.399
And that's
one thing people are like, "you have done

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:10.529
no
advertisement?"

00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:16.090
It goes back to -- I guess a natural
business sense.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:22.730
I make sure every single thing that goes
out has our logo on it.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.409
You know, we emphasize word of
mouth.

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:31.860
And sometimes people make -- and I'm not trying
to interfere with nobody's marketing [laughter]

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.120
or advertisement.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.760
So Google forgive me.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:44.270
[laughs] But we just strongly treat
everything organic.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.899
And it's not naive.

00:26:45.899 --> 00:26:52.110
You know, if
you make a great -- I'm going to say this.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:59.050
I like Jay-Z. [audience member whoops]
You'll see why I'm saying it.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.480
Love Jay-Z's music.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.549
Everybody I talk
to -- look what I'm doing now.

00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:06.909
Because I like Jay-Z.

00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:08.610
I
like his music.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:14.009
I just mentioned Steve Jobs.

00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:16.179
You know?

00:27:16.179 --> 00:27:21.380
I can mention several people, you know?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.450
If you like
something, people are going to talk about

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.950
it.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.140
People
have fallen in love with our cookies.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.390
They've fallen in
love with our cookies.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.390
People have fallen in love with
our service.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:39.900
And I mean, I'm not trying to be, you
know -- people, you know, they like me.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.870
You know.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.110
So
when they like you, they like your product,

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.049
they
naturally talk about it.

00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:48.700
They naturally talk about it.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.240
Right now, you have a cool little smile when
I say

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240
something.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240
It was something there.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.940
If I got to know
him, I might talk about him.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.940
I'll talk about you.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.970
[laughter] Sorry
to put you on the spot like that.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.380
[laughter] But you talk about it.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.340
So if you have that going for you, which is
I believe the

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.240
best thing, now what you do is make sure everything
that

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.330
goes out people are able to attach that product
with who

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.830
produced it.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:25.740
And so, when you eat this cookie and you
open a box and it says Anthony's cookies -- oh,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.760
you know?

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.790
We got to talk about that, Google.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.790
All right.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.890
&gt;&gt; Male #3: All right.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.830
I'm going to be the last question..

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:36.830
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Yeah.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.090
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Because I know everybody wants
cookies.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.919
I've known
Anthony for almost 20 years and you guys have

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:46.840
seen the
calm side so I do have a question for you.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.950
Let's see
some passion.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.580
What has been the best moment in doing
Anthony's cookies.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.129
Like, what has made this journey
worth it all?

00:28:55.129 --> 00:29:01.340
&gt;&gt; Anthony: What has made this journey worth
it all.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.320
You got to
come up with that one, huh?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320
[laughter] Because it's endless.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.110
&gt;&gt;Male #3: This is the most passionate person.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.940
This is the
mellow side.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.100
You see this little animation but this is
the most passionate person I've ever come

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100
across.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.620
So I want
to see that passion come our right now.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.629
Pick that thing that "wow, I never thought
I'd be here

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:20.629
doing this.

00:29:20.629 --> 00:29:23.570
Or never thought I would have this."

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.220
&gt;&gt; Anthony: He just answered it.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.220
He just answered it.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.549
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Maybe this is it.

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:30.259
[laughter]

00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:33.789
&gt;&gt; Anthony: I was -- there's so many.

00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:34.789
It's.

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:38.019
I'll mention the
last thing.

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:40.110
It's so many.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:48.000
And I think because of my
attitude, everything is just great.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.019
Because just
being -- I'm like oh, I'm sitting here at

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:54.019
Google.

00:29:54.019 --> 00:29:56.179
I'm standing at Google, it's
an honor.

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:59.850
It's an absolute honor that you all would
take

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.390
your time out.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.960
That drives me.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.250
That drives me to do
even more.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:13.590
You know, just the passionate -- just seeing
where, I never in my life thought I would

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.460
be doing what
I'm doing and making these accomplishments

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.080
and continue
to make this continued success.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:29.330
You know, so seeing
where I started and seeing where I am now,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.450
that's an
ongoing great feeling.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:39.629
You know, to passionate.

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:44.169
Just working, meeting so many different people,
you know,

00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:52.970
and just not falling under challenges when
they come.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.009
Not falling under challenges when they come.

00:30:55.009 --> 00:31:05.120
And when
you're actually able to excel, I could talk

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.860
for days
about that.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:14.649
You know, making people smile or when people
are pleased with you or they're -- they love

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:16.320
what you're
doing.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.590
It's just a great feeling.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.289
It's just a great
feeling.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:24.850
So and that's pretty much.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.970
So hopefully if
there was a little rough at the beginning,

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:29.970
forgive me.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.830
Now it's funny after ten minutes later
you start, "ha, I wish that little ha would

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.860
come five
minutes into it."

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.460
I keep telling myself we're going to be all
right though.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.200
But once again, thank you.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.529
Thank you so much for taking
your time out.

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:47.100
Hopefully you enjoyed the presentation.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.149
Take something from it.

00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:50.799
And I know you'll enjoy these
cookies.

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:51.799
All right?

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:52.799
Thank you.

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:52.800
[Applause]
