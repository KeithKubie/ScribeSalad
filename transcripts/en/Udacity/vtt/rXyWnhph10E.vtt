00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.620
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we have out text editor.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.540
We're ready to make changes to code, but we

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.210
need to get it. And from the searching

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.860
I did earlier, I gather we're going to use GitHub.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.270
&gt;&gt; And what is that? What is GitHub?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.340
&gt;&gt; It's a version control system that let's you keep track of

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.960
changes that you make to your code and let's people collaborate easily.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, I know, I mean, at Udacity you engineers

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.110
are using it, and what are you guys doing with GitHub?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so basically at Udacity we have one, like,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.320
main master branch that everybody uses as sort of

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.120
the, the source of truth. And then people will make

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.040
branches to that their own separate branches that they

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490
then make changes on. And then submit pull requests back

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.960
to everybody else, and everybody else can, can look

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.480
at it. Usually there's one particular code reviewer who will

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.690
approve the change or say, you know, maybe you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.440
need, you know, you should change this here or there.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.360
&gt;&gt; Change this variable and, whatever.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.010
&gt;&gt; Okay. So for

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.800
our purposes, we're not going to be, like, merging anything back into

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.050
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.260
&gt;&gt; The original code. What are we going to do?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for our purposes, we're just going to check out

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.300
the main branch, make some changes, and leave it at that.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
&gt;&gt; That's going to be our own new thing now.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.126
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, so let's install GitHub.

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:06.934
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
