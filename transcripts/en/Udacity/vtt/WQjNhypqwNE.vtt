00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.550
Now that Git is installed, you'll need to download the asteroids repository.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.610
To do that, you'll need to be somewhere with internet access,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.340
which is why I've left the forest.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.200
Now let's get started and download the repository.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm sure you've downloaded files before, but

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.280
in this case, what we're doing is a little different.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400
Because we don't just want to download the actual files,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.910
which would be the files from the most recent comment.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.840
Instead, we want to download the entire history.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.490
Git has a command allowing you to copy an entire repository from one

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.910
computer to another.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.830
The command is called git clone because it creates a clone of the repository.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.640
To use it, type git clone followed by a URL to the other repository.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.830
We put the URL for the asteroids repository in the instructors notes, so

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.220
go ahead and copy that URL and clone the repository like this.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.770
Now I won't need Internet access anymore for

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.100
the rest of the lesson, so I'm going to head back to the forest.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.480
Once the repository is finished cloning, go ahead and cd into it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.360
Now you should be able to use git log and git diff just like I did earlier.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.420
Go ahead and give it a try.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500
In order to get the colored diff output like you saw earlier, with the red for

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.810
deletions and green for

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.981
insertions, run the command git config --global color.ui auto.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.370
If you don't do this, you'll just see black and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.890
white diffs, which will be harder to read.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.960
The git config command just changes your settings in Git and the --global flag

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.270
means that it will apply to all of your Git projects and not only this one.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.230
Use git log to find the ID of the commit that reverted the controls.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.610
This commit has the message Revert controls.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.530
Enter the idea of that commit in this box.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:45.710
Then use git diff to find how many lines were added and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.420
deleted by that commit and enter those numbers here.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.020
Recall that to find the difference between two commits, you use the command git

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.670
diff, the ID of the first commit and then the ID of the second commit.
