00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
So that's Android design in a nutshell.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.190
We hope you've learned a lot.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.890
We started with lesson one.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.940
A crash course in Android
design fundamentals.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.060
&gt;&gt; In lesson two,
we learned about tangible surfaces.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.630
How they establish a clear
visual hierarchy and

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.230
make your UIs immediately
comprehensible.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.100
In lesson three, we learned how to
apply the principles of space, color,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.660
typography and imagery to let
your brand shine through and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870
make your app's content look beautiful.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.050
&gt;&gt; In lesson four, we discussed how
deliberate meaningful motion helps to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.160
tell your app's story and
make it feel alive.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.310
&gt;&gt; And in this lesson, we learned how
to adapt our designs to the different

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.620
screens your users have in their lives.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.020
Now go and
design the next great app for Android.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.980
Using the techniques in this course,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.510
you're sure to build something
delightful and awesome.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.140
We can't wait to see
what you come up with.
