00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.450
So now that we're all set up
with our Play Games libraries,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.910
we want to start adding some
achievements to our game.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.210
And the first thing I'm
actually going to do

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.590
is add in our
built in controller

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.100
to view those achievements.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.730
So I'm going to do that
by creating a button.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.810
Let's put it on screen here.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.390
This is good.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.125
And we will say
view achievements.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.390
And let's go over
into our sizing.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.220
We're going anchor it
to the bottom right.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.524
By the way, Xcode 5 auto layout
is much better than Xcode 4.

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:44.940
If I were to do
this from scratch,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.790
I'd probably be doing that
here instead of these springs

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.846
and struts.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:52.970
Anyway, we're just going
to call this achievements,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.410
a little cleaner.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.220
And now I'm going to go
into my helper editor here,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.210
and I'll set up with an
outlet, control drag.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.480
We'll call it view
achievements button.

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:15.095
One of these days I'm going
to misspell achievements.

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:17.810
It's going to be
really embarrassing.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:29.460
And maybe up here, let's add
in our achievements button

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.550
was pressed action.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.720
All right, with that set up,
let's go and edit this thing.

00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:46.160
The first thing we're
going to do actually

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.320
is within refresh
interface based on sign in,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.690
I'm going to say self dot
view achievements button

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.400
dot hidden equals not signed in.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.680
So that we hide this
view achievements button

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840
if you're not signed in.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.009
Kind of makes sense.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.650
The other thing
I want to do here

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.480
is something that has bugged me
since the last chapter, which

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.020
is in my finished
with auth error

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.790
handler, this refresh
interface based on sign in,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.460
I want to move this outside
the if not error clause.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.140
Because we'll want to refresh
the interface either way,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350
whether there's an error or not.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.835
Trying silent sign in, will it
have finished at this point?

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:33.710
And maybe we'll want to
show the button again

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.630
if things have gone badly.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.770
So anyway, it was bothering me.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.340
I just wanted to get
around to fixing it.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.360
So now let's get something to
happen when the user presses

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.030
this view achievements button.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.750
We're going to create a
GPG achievement controller

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.200
equals GPG achievement
controller alloc init.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.480
We need to set its
achievement delegate to self.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.230
At least that's what
I'm going to do here.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.390
And this achievement
delegate, by the way,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.510
just has one method,
which is achievement view

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.490
controller did finish.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.520
It's the method our
view controller here

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.090
is going to implement in
order to dismiss this view

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.490
controller when the
user is all done.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.030
And then we display it like
we would any other modal view

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.100
controller.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.070
So we're going to
call self present view

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.240
controller, our achievement
controller, animated yes.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.316
And completion in this
case, will just be nil.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.310
Now of course, we're
getting a warning,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.270
because we set our
achievement delegate to self.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.930
But our self is not yet a
GPG achievement delegate.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.770
Luckily, we can fix
that right here.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.510
And they get one other warning
that their required method,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.500
achievement view
controller finish has not

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.800
been implemented.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.590
I really feel like that there's
got to be some key combination

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.060
or something here that I can
click for Xcode to insert

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.030
a stub method for me.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.530
I've not been able to find it.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.270
If it exists, and
you know about it,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.000
please leave it in the comments.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.680
Because gee, it seems like
that would be awfully nice.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.570
However, that said, it's
pretty easy for us to add,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.810
since it does get
auto completed for us.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.630
And basically we're just
going to dismiss view

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.150
controller animated,
yes with completion nil.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.740
And that's all we need to.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.510
These lines of code
have done all the work

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.880
we need to actually show
the achievements view

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.340
controller within our game.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.965
So let's run this
and see what happens.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.800
All right so I'm signed in.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.580
I've got this
achievements button.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.220
I'm going to click it.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.940
And I get this lovely
achievements view controller,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.549
which is empty.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.090
And that's because
we haven't defined

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.800
any achievements for our game.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.380
So I suppose this is correct.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.180
I click the Done button.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.630
It calls my delegate method,
which dismisses that view

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.400
controller, and there you go.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.050
We can now view our
achievements within the game.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.600
So maybe the next
step would actually

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.930
be to create some
achievements, and we

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.780
could do that developer console.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.560
And so we'll tackle
that in the next lesson.
