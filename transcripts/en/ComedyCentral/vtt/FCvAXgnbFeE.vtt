Uh, well, if you want to laugh
that I'm almost dead, uh...

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.110
But I had three encounters.
Three encounters with nature.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.479
Way back in the day, I used
to be a forest ranger,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.582
and I'm up in Northern Canada.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.750
And I'm driving around
in my pickup truck.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:28.621
I got a 3/4 ton pickup truck,
a'ight?

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:33.292
And I'm driving around, I'm
going down an old lumber road,

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.894
an old dirt lumber road.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.262
And I'm just driving along,

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.598
having thoughts in my head
about, you know,

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:42.735
oatmeal and psoriasis
and things like that.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:44.437
And I'm driving along,
and all of a sudden,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.574
I see this big mound of grass,
and I slam on the brakes.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.910
[mimics brakes screeching]

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.312
But it wasn't like a screeching
tire sound,

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:54.580
'cause I was on gravel.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.149
I just told you that, gang.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:00.686
It was more like a--
[mimics skidding on gravel]

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.590
So I stopped my 3/4 ton pickup
truck.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:07.026
Hey.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.428
And I look on the top
of this grassy knoll,

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.598
and there's a full-grown moose.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.467
There's a moose standing
on a grassy knoll,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.303
and I'm thinking, okay,
there's a moose, here's me;

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.273
I'm gonna see how close I can
get to the moose, right?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.541
So he's pulling the grass.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.142
He's like...
[imitates ripping]

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.443

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.890
And I'm thinking, if I imitate
these sounds,

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:39.659
I'll get close to the moose.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.662
So I start pulling the grass
and I pull, chew.

[chomping]

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.399
And I keep getting closer

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.034
and closer and closer.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.503
And then I'm about 20 feet
from this full-grown moose,

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.838
and I'm thinking,
wait a minute,

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:55.041
what's my end game here?

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.245
Do you want to get up to
this moose and scratch it

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.646
behind the ears?

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.048
Do I want to rub its hump?

Do I want to play with that
hairy nut bag

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.485

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.856
and, you know, just fiddle
with its throat bag?

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.358
And before I could think
anymore,

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.894
the moose was like, Who's this
freaky, big-eared,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.830
chinless, freak standing on my
grassy knoll?

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.665
And he charged right at me.

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.334
Charged me!

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.903
And at the last second, just
before he's about to hit me,

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.339
there was a dead tree hanging
over the grassy knoll.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.243
He hit it, the tree shattered,
and he got spooked

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.877
and went the other way.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.880
Now the upside is,
I peed my pants.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.683
I watered the grass,
so there you go.

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:40.353
Now let's smash-cut
to Rwanda.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.222
Hello.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:46.058
We're looking for the legendary
mountain gorillas.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.061
You know the ones that Dian
Fossey saw in the mist?

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:53.132
But it was really like her bong
smoke, like--

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.936
And we're climbing up this
volcano and boom,

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.039
we come across
the mountain gorilla.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:03.409
The mother and the children and
the aunties.

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.910
But where's the big boy, huh?

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:09.448
They told me there was a
500-pound silverback gorilla

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.050
up there on the mountain,
right?

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.052
I'm like, "Where's the big
boy?"

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.587
And all of a sudden, we hear
it.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.556
It's like--
[loud screeching]

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.159
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.395
[loud screeching]

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.763
There he is.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.500
500-pound silverback
opens the bamboo, right?

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:32.071
Just peels it open, presents
himself, postures, right?

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:35.107
Slides down right in front of--
and just standing there

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.909
with his big fuckin' eyebrows.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:37.943
[loud screeching]

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.845
Just staring at all of us.

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:41.914
And I'm thinking,
"This is great."

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:45.284
Till I realized in our group of
eight people,

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:47.486
I'm the only guy with a
brand-new,

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.623
bright, shiny red
baseball hat.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.291
[laughter]

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.428
And so now, two Spanish words
are going through my head.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.198
Olé! Olé!

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.834
And sure enough, just
as I finished that thought,

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:07.206
I heard our guide go,
"He's attacking!"

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:11.477
Here comes this giant 500-pound
silverback gorilla,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.778
just charging at me.

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.113
He's beating his chest.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.448
He's like--
[loud screeching]

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.450
He just hitting
his areolae so hard

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.653
I thought they're gonna fly off
and land on my eyes, right?

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:21.687
Here he comes.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.055
But these mountain gorillas,

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:24.623
they do a thing
called a mock charge.

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:25.991
It's to show dominance.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:27.293
So he wasn't really gonna hit
me,

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.961
but he came
closer to the moose.

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.496
He came, like, four feet in
front of me

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.832
and then went the other way.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.333
And of course, at that point,

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.535
I once again produced
something in my pants.

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:38.738
It was a--

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.239
it was a Cracker Barrel
meatloaf.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:42.408
Uh...

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:45.511
And lastly, let's smash-cut
to the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:48.547
Sir, if you could look away,
sir; your focus is scary.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.582
Uh...

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.352
I'm fishing the Pacific Ocean,
gang.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.854
Going for salmon.

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:56.522
Oh, you ever catch a salmon,
my love, huh?

00:05:56.555 --> 00:06:00.059
When you're not busy rolling
around in the hazelnut fields?

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.833
I'm fishing.
I'm out in a 17-foot boat

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:09.402
fishing for salmon, right?

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.036
I got a bait boy with me.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.605
This guy's like a college kid.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:15.674
He's like Spicoli from "Fast
Times at Ridgemont High."

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.009
Just a stoner dude.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.210
I'm pretty sure when I wasn't
looking,

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:21.280
he was smoking the bait, right?

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:24.717
And we're out there fishing,
and the ocean's nice and calm,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.553
and I look about 50 yards away,
and all of a sudden

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:30.423
I see this circle of bubbles
on the surface of the water.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:33.926
Big circle of bubbles.
And what the hell is that?

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.362
And then all of a sudden,
two giant humpback whales

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.898
just exploded
from under the water.

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.232
Their mouths open;

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.268
they swallowed a whole
school of fish.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:46.272
And I was like, What the hell
was that, stoner bro?

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:50.209
And he was like,
Oh, fuck, man.

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:53.112
He's like, The humpback whales,
that's how they hunt, man.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.114
They go down to the bottom
of the ocean,

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:56.882
they look for a school of fish,

00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:59.718
and then they blow bubbles out
of the asshole on their head.

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.887
Right?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.256
So they swim around the school
of fish

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.991
and they create
a wall of bubbles

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:07.927
and then they come up
and they swallow

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.562
the whole school of fish.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.565
The fish in the wall of bubbles
are afraid to go through

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.899
so they get trapped, right?

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.968
And I'm thinking,
wouldn't that be funny

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:19.138
if I could get those whales
to come over here

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:22.408
and I get a nice little picture
of the whales.

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:26.011
So of course I start doing some
whale calls to attract them.

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:31.684
Right? I'm like...
[high-pitched squeal]

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.587
[imitates whale barking]

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.824
[mimics high-pitched whining]

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.599
Nothing.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.335
So I go back to fishing,
and a few minutes later,

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.103
holy fuck.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.939
I look beside me,
a bubble comes up.

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:55.608
Right beside the boat.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.042
Just one bubble, right?

00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:59.478
There's probably, like,
a sea cucumber fart

00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.946
coming up from the--

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:03.182
So I'm like, there's a bubble.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:05.351
And then suddenly there's
another bubble

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:06.952
and another one and another one

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.120
and all of a sudden I realize,

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:11.891
holy fuck, eh?

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:15.327
They're doing a bubble circle
right under the damn boat.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.962
And I'm like, "What the"--

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.131
And all of a sudden I put
the boat in reverse,

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.833
I pull that sucker backwards,

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:24.136
and I swear to God, just as
I get out of the bubble circle,

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.038
three feet off the front
