people tell me that it's already

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050
people tell me that it's already
 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.779
people tell me that it's already
reducing the impact of implicit bias so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
reducing the impact of implicit bias so
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.529
reducing the impact of implicit bias so
they're already happy with the with what

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
they're already happy with the with what
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.750
they're already happy with the with what
they're seeing so what is implicit bias

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
they're seeing so what is implicit bias
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.890
they're seeing so what is implicit bias
first of all it's important to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
first of all it's important to
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019
first of all it's important to
understand that implicit bias and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
understand that implicit bias and
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880
understand that implicit bias and
explicit bias are two different things

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
explicit bias are two different things
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250
explicit bias are two different things
implicit bias is stuff that you're not

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
implicit bias is stuff that you're not
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440
implicit bias is stuff that you're not
conscious of you're not aware of it it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
conscious of you're not aware of it it's
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880
conscious of you're not aware of it it's
hard for you to control it's probably

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
hard for you to control it's probably
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700
impossible for you to control it's
impossible for you to control right now

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
impossible for you to control right now
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.549
impossible for you to control right now
on demand you might be able to alter it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
on demand you might be able to alter it
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.110
on demand you might be able to alter it
by exposing yourself to different

by exposing yourself to different
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.569
by exposing yourself to different
situations or whatever and changing what

we and machine learning call priors

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
we and machine learning call priors
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.950
we and machine learning call priors
right so changing your experiences so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
right so changing your experiences so
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920
right so changing your experiences so
maybe if you see more women in senior

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
maybe if you see more women in senior
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439
maybe if you see more women in senior
positions you'll become less implicitly

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
positions you'll become less implicitly
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.029
positions you'll become less implicitly
sexist or something like that but anyway

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039
sexist or something like that but anyway
 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.369
sexist or something like that but anyway
explicit bias is like I'm gonna choose

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
explicit bias is like I'm gonna choose
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080
explicit bias is like I'm gonna choose
to only work with women or I'm gonna

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
to only work with women or I'm gonna
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460
to only work with women or I'm gonna
choose only to work with men and I know

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
choose only to work with men and I know
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.640
choose only to work with men and I know
that an unconscious about it so HR

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
that an unconscious about it so HR
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.990

departments are reasonably good at

departments are reasonably good at
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179
departments are reasonably good at
getting people who hopefully they

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
getting people who hopefully they
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.179
getting people who hopefully they
honestly are saying yeah I want to I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
honestly are saying yeah I want to I
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219
honestly are saying yeah I want to I
want I'm not going to be racist or

going to worry about how long somebody's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
going to worry about how long somebody's
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450
going to worry about how long somebody's
name is or what the country of origin of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
name is or what the country of origin of
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.920
name is or what the country of origin of
someone of their ancestors is right but

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
someone of their ancestors is right but
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.780
someone of their ancestors is right but
so hopefully HR people can spot the the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
so hopefully HR people can spot the the
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.280
so hopefully HR people can spot the the
people who sincerely are neutral but at

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
people who sincerely are neutral but at
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080
people who sincerely are neutral but at
least at the explicit level but at the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
least at the explicit level but at the
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.929
least at the explicit level but at the
implicit level there there's a lot of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
implicit level there there's a lot of
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780
implicit level there there's a lot of
evidence that that something else might

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
evidence that that something else might
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.130
evidence that that something else might
be going at again we don't know for sure

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
be going at again we don't know for sure
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020
be going at again we don't know for sure
if it's implicit or explicit but what we

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
if it's implicit or explicit but what we
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.670
if it's implicit or explicit but what we
do know is that in the paper we did in

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
do know is that in the paper we did in

Callahan had this brilliant idea of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
Callahan had this brilliant idea of
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.889
Callahan had this brilliant idea of
looking at the resume data that so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
looking at the resume data that so
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.580
looking at the resume data that so
there's a famous study that showed that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
there's a famous study that showed that
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.859
there's a famous study that showed that
you have identical resumes and the only

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
you have identical resumes and the only
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359
you have identical resumes and the only
thing you do is have more African

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
thing you do is have more African
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.280
thing you do is have more African
American names versus European American

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
American names versus European American
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469
American names versus European American
names and the people with European

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
names and the people with European
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.330
names and the people with European
American names get 50% more

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340
American names get 50% more
 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.720
American names get 50% more
to interview and what nothing else

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730
to interview and what nothing else
 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.580
to interview and what nothing else
changed and so now people are talking

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
changed and so now people are talking
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.740
changed and so now people are talking
about widening their CVS so they just so

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750
about widening their CVS so they just so
 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.110
about widening their CVS so they just so
they get that chance to interview so

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
they get that chance to interview so
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.410
they get that chance to interview so
anyway the this it looks by the measures

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
anyway the this it looks by the measures
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.360
anyway the this it looks by the measures
that we used with with the vector spaces

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
that we used with with the vector spaces
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.089
that we used with with the vector spaces
as if the the data in the implicit bias

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099
as if the the data in the implicit bias
 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.309
as if the the data in the implicit bias
that also explains implicit bias also

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319
that also explains implicit bias also
 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.650
that also explains implicit bias also
explains that those traces on the resume

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660
explains that those traces on the resume
 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.990
explains that those traces on the resume
so does that mean people were looking at

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
so does that mean people were looking at
 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.280
so does that mean people were looking at
it and explicitly saying oh I think

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290
it and explicitly saying oh I think
 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.440
it and explicitly saying oh I think
that's an african-american or were they

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450
that's an african-american or were they
 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.110
that's an african-american or were they
just going through huge stacks of of CDs

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
just going through huge stacks of of CDs
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.270
just going through huge stacks of of CDs
and and some didn't jump out at them in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
and and some didn't jump out at them in
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.160
and and some didn't jump out at them in
the same way that others did because

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170
the same way that others did because
 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.360
the same way that others did because
they're pretty sure when it comes down

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
they're pretty sure when it comes down
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.740
they're pretty sure when it comes down
to like they're all sitting in the room

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
to like they're all sitting in the room
 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.259
to like they're all sitting in the room
together that that that point was okay

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269
together that that that point was okay
 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.050
together that that that point was okay
and so what the AI is doing for them is

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060
and so what the AI is doing for them is
 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.130
and so what the AI is doing for them is
it's it's helping them pick out the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
it's it's helping them pick out the
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.660
it's it's helping them pick out the
characteristics they're looking for and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
characteristics they're looking for and
 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.820
characteristics they're looking for and
ignoring the other characteristics so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
ignoring the other characteristics so
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.500
ignoring the other characteristics so
lets helping its they're helping them to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510
lets helping its they're helping them to
 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300
lets helping its they're helping them to
tack the things that they wanted to be

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
tack the things that they wanted to be
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.680
tack the things that they wanted to be
when they were sitting in the room with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690
when they were sitting in the room with
 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.599
when they were sitting in the room with
multiple eyes looking at something that

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609
multiple eyes looking at something that
 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.699
multiple eyes looking at something that
they were looking at the right starting

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
they were looking at the right starting
 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.500
they were looking at the right starting
spaced place and then they're able to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
spaced place and then they're able to
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.690
spaced place and then they're able to
find they're finding people that were

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
find they're finding people that were
 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.949
find they're finding people that were
falling through the cracks a lot of

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959
falling through the cracks a lot of
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.180
falling through the cracks a lot of
people have troubled there's not enough

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190
people have troubled there's not enough
 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.970
people have troubled there's not enough
good people applying or that they

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980
good people applying or that they
 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.050
good people applying or that they
thought that weren't enough good people

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060
thought that weren't enough good people
 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.849
thought that weren't enough good people
applying but actually they were missing

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859
applying but actually they were missing
 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.349
applying but actually they were missing
people because they didn't see the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359
people because they didn't see the
 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.880
people because they didn't see the
qualifications bearing in the other

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890
qualifications bearing in the other
 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.559
qualifications bearing in the other
stuff when they're leafing through these

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569
stuff when they're leafing through these
 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.680

can't say who it was but an organization

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819
can't say who it was but an organization

special kind of organization they said

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
special kind of organization they said
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.039
special kind of organization they said
that they're going to try to do this and

that they're going to try to do this and
 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.780
that they're going to try to do this and
so I begged them to document it I said

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
so I begged them to document it I said
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.160
so I begged them to document it I said
look you're in a different situation you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
look you're in a different situation you
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.740
look you're in a different situation you
don't have ordinary customers please

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750
don't have ordinary customers please
 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.529
don't have ordinary customers please
please document the results fully and

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539
please document the results fully and
 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.270
please document the results fully and
then publish papers about it so we can

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280
then publish papers about it so we can
 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.310
then publish papers about it so we can
really see what the outcomes are so I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320
really see what the outcomes are so I
 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.870
really see what the outcomes are so I
hope we'll have that data but so far I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880
hope we'll have that data but so far I
 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.159
hope we'll have that data but so far I
can only tell you that people

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169
can only tell you that people
 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.920
can only tell you that people
saying it really is working what are the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
saying it really is working what are the
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.260
saying it really is working what are the
possible shortfalls of that kind of

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
possible shortfalls of that kind of
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.950
possible shortfalls of that kind of
situation well first of all being sure

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960
situation well first of all being sure
 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.140
situation well first of all being sure
that you can you can eliminate bias that

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150
that you can you can eliminate bias that
 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.239
that you can you can eliminate bias that
way no there's all kinds of ways you can

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249
way no there's all kinds of ways you can
 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.890
way no there's all kinds of ways you can
accidentally pick up on things so like

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900
accidentally pick up on things so like
 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600
accidentally pick up on things so like
even if you don't have gender you might

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610
even if you don't have gender you might
 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.519
even if you don't have gender you might
recognize gender from the name for

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529
recognize gender from the name for
 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.480
recognize gender from the name for
example so there's there's ways that

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
example so there's there's ways that
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.159
example so there's there's ways that
machine learning picks up on

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169
machine learning picks up on
 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.519
machine learning picks up on
regularities that are illegal and you

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529
regularities that are illegal and you
 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.170
regularities that are illegal and you
have again you have to do your own

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
have again you have to do your own
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.610
have again you have to do your own
auditing and make sure that that isn't

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620
auditing and make sure that that isn't
 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.459
auditing and make sure that that isn't
happening of course any time you put you

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469
happening of course any time you put you
 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.230
happening of course any time you put you
scan something and make it digital then

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240
scan something and make it digital then
 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.540
scan something and make it digital then
that makes it available to hacking so

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550
that makes it available to hacking so
 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.760
that makes it available to hacking so
you have to be careful about that and I

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770
you have to be careful about that and I
 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.619
you have to be careful about that and I
guess the biggest thing is don't believe

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629
guess the biggest thing is don't believe
 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.110
guess the biggest thing is don't believe
that just because you've automated part

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120
that just because you've automated part
 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.360
that just because you've automated part
of a process you've made it fair you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370
of a process you've made it fair you
 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.950
of a process you've made it fair you
know you have to keep checking just like

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960
know you have to keep checking just like
 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.719
know you have to keep checking just like
anything else you keep you keep going to

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729
anything else you keep you keep going to
 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.939
anything else you keep you keep going to
improve but yeah when you when you put

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949
improve but yeah when you when you put
 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.230
improve but yeah when you when you put
these things in front of you

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240
these things in front of you
 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.689
these things in front of you
and it when you write them down then

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699
and it when you write them down then
 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.399
and it when you write them down then
yeah you have the you have the potential

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409
yeah you have the you have the potential
 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.239
yeah you have the you have the potential
to keep improving

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249
to keep improving
 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.519
to keep improving
I guess there's one other thing which I

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529
I guess there's one other thing which I
 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.409
I guess there's one other thing which I
haven't mentioned which is that once

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419
haven't mentioned which is that once
 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.240
haven't mentioned which is that once
you've automated the process you do open

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250
you've automated the process you do open
 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.089
you've automated the process you do open
the door for somebody who is say an evil

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099
the door for somebody who is say an evil
 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.249
the door for somebody who is say an evil
racist to go in and actually tweak

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259
racist to go in and actually tweak
 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.809
racist to go in and actually tweak
things and make it so that you know you

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819
things and make it so that you know you
 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.260
things and make it so that you know you
get all one race right so so you need to

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270
get all one race right so so you need to
 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.429
get all one race right so so you need to
make sure that there's adequate

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:45.439
make sure that there's adequate
 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.429
make sure that there's adequate
oversight and auditing regular auditing

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439
oversight and auditing regular auditing
 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.339
oversight and auditing regular auditing
because the one of the people worried

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349
because the one of the people worried
 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.469
because the one of the people worried
about accidentally introducing bias and

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479
about accidentally introducing bias and
 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.969
about accidentally introducing bias and
that's you know good we should worry

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979
that's you know good we should worry
 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.010
that's you know good we should worry
about that but we should be really

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020
about that but we should be really
 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.510
about that but we should be really
worried about deliberately introducing

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520
worried about deliberately introducing
 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.309
worried about deliberately introducing
bias that that's the thing that I think

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319
bias that that's the thing that I think
 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.649
bias that that's the thing that I think
again because people think artificial

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659
again because people think artificial
 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.149
again because people think artificial
intelligence is like you know space

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159
intelligence is like you know space
 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.909
intelligence is like you know space
aliens that are kind of or they actually

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919
aliens that are kind of or they actually
 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.139
aliens that are kind of or they actually
it's almost like that sort of the

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:08.149
it's almost like that sort of the
 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:10.809
it's almost like that sort of the
greco-roman or or Nordic gods or

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819
greco-roman or or Nordic gods or
 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.249
greco-roman or or Nordic gods or
something like you know maybe we can

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259
something like you know maybe we can
 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.260
something like you know maybe we can
pray to them correctly and they'll give

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270
pray to them correctly and they'll give
 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.820
pray to them correctly and they'll give
us what we want you know but that but

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
us what we want you know but that but
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.050
us what we want you know but that but
they're capricious and we're not sure

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060
they're capricious and we're not sure
 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.909
they're capricious and we're not sure
you know no it's not like that

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919
you know no it's not like that
 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.740
you know no it's not like that
it's it's it really is something that we

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750
it's it's it really is something that we
 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.740
it's it's it really is something that we
we have an opportunity to try to fix it

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750
we have an opportunity to try to fix it
 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.499
we have an opportunity to try to fix it
and it works in systematic ways but it's

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509
and it works in systematic ways but it's
 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.110
and it works in systematic ways but it's
important to understand that people are

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120
important to understand that people are
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.980
important to understand that people are
writing it and that means that some some

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990
writing it and that means that some some
 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.050
writing it and that means that some some
people will make mistakes some people

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060
people will make mistakes some people
 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.549
people will make mistakes some people
will be sloppy something

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559
will be sloppy something
 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.289
will be sloppy something
we'll do what they seriously think is

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:42.299
we'll do what they seriously think is
 

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:43.939
we'll do what they seriously think is
the best thing but it actually isn't

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949
the best thing but it actually isn't
 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:46.759
the best thing but it actually isn't
legal and some people will go out of

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:46.769
legal and some people will go out of
 

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:48.169
legal and some people will go out of
their way to do bad things because

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:48.179
their way to do bad things because
 

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:50.989
their way to do bad things because
they're just vandals or because that's

they're just vandals or because that's
 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:52.399
they're just vandals or because that's
