00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.050
- The one thing I really like

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.940
about the LearnStorm activities

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.060
is that they introduce students

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.590
to the growth mindset concept,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.820
to neural plasticity,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.300
to the fact that the
brain grows and changes.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.620
And they introduce the
importance of effort.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.810
It's really helpful for teachers

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.410
to call out and recognize students

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.440
when they're putting forth effort.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.470
But it's also really important for them

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.630
not to use effort as a
kinda consolation prize.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.810
To say, it's okay that
you didn't learn anything

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.160
because you worked hard.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.210
The idea is to really
remind students all the time

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.880
that by putting forth effort,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.960
they're really preparing
their brain to grow.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.490
They're really kind of getting

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.260
all their pistons in the brain firing,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
and that even if they don't
master a particular concept yet,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.753
that the effort,

00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:43.670
the intellectual effort they put into it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.740
will eventually pay off

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.730
with them kinda preparing their brain

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.890
to understand the process
that content over time.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.300
And so it's really important
to not just focus on effort

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.470
but to focus on the combination of effort

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.120
and using good strategies

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
to really call attention to the fact that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.010
if you're working really
hard at something,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.840
well, you know, maybe you
should persist for a while

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.673
but if it's really,

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:07.220
if you're really spinning your wheels,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.340
it might be more helpful to step back

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.490
and to think about is there a
different strategy I can use?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310
Is there someone I can talk to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.020
to help me think differently

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.810
about this particular kind of problem

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.740
or this particular concept?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.330
To make sure that the
effort I'm putting in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.210
is actually paying off

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.813
with helping me grow that ability.
