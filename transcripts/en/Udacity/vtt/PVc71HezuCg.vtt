00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.490
So to solve a proportion like this one,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.640
you can use a method
called cross multiplying.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.790
This is a really useful
shortcut to isolate x.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.457
To cross multiply,
you multiply the denominator of one

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:18.034
rate by the numerator of
the other rate and vice versa.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:21.090
And you set those two products
equal to one another.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730
So on one side of my equation,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.490
I'll have 7 days, and
I'd multiply that by 25 pounds.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.357
And I set that equal to
10 pounds times x days.

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:36.260
7 times 25 is 175.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.780
And that is equal to 10 times x.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.200
If I divide both sides by 10,
I am left with x = 175 / 10.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.896
So x = 17.5.
