Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. I want to start with a, with a question that was asked by [inaudible] after the last lecture regarding fractional order kinetics. Uh, you remember that in the reaction of methyl lithium, there was a pre equilibrium between the tetramer and the and the monomer. So the tetramer is dominant, but the monomer is reactive. So remember what that meant was that at an equal, in this pre equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation. So the concentration of monomer to the fourth power is proportional to that of the tetramer. Or if you take the, the fourth routes on each side, it says that the concentration of the, of the, uh, reactive species is one fourth power in the amount of material you actually add, which is the dominant tetramer. But why each, what Aisha pointed out is this seemed to be similar to the case of a radical chain initiator, which also had a fractional order.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Remember, the idea was that the initiator, uh, breaks to give to radicals. Then the radical abstracts a hydrogen to give the radical, which is part of the, uh, cycling mechanism in the, in the radical chain. The propagation steps of the free radical reaction, but ultimately that the machines are destroyed by two radicals getting together in the termination process, either forming xx or x with our or our with our, so at first glance, this doesn't look very similar to the equilibrium on the top. This isn't an equilibrium at all, right? You're not going back to the starting material, you're not getting back to the peroxide. So this one was, was uh, uh, is an example of a steady state instead of an equilibrium. So when the machine gets, when the, the initiation is constantly going on, the machine gets into a steady state of how fast it's going around and disappearing at the same time.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Then then you have the, the amount of termination equals the amount of initiation. So you have a steady amount of this, which is going to determine the rate of the reaction of the machine. And since the termination is proportional to the concentration of radical squared, it could be, it could be the radical could be in the form either of x, Adam or in the form of the are radical. But whatever it is that when two of them get together, that does it. So the radicals concentration squared, how much machine there is squared is proportional to the, to the initiation, to the concentration of this. Okay. So this is, this isn't an equilibrium as it was in the top, but really it's the same deal. The number of machines then is proportional to the square root of the amount of the initiator. Right? And notice that this is the same association equals dissociation implies this relationship.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Termination equals initiation implies this relationship. So really they are the same thing. Even though when she asked me the question, I thought they were completely different. So I've been teaching this for 45 years or something like that. And it never occurred to me that these fundamentally where the same thing, the reason, the reason you have this fractional order kinetics. So this was a simplification and generalization that I Isha came up with and that's what constitutes progress in science is when instead of having to memorize a zillion things, you find out that they're all the same and you just know that one. So congratulations to Asia and keep up the good work, all you people. That's what makes it fun to teach you. After x years of teaching this, I'm still learning. Okay? And I also ask questions. So on the 2009 exam, I asked, uh, uh, consider this chlorination reaction, the one we talked about at the end of last lecture and a certain Bond Association energies. And then you're supposed to figure out various things. But part g of this many part, a question was why should the bond association energies of NCL and RCL be so different when those of Nh and rh are so similar? So NCL is 46, and h is 92, twice as big a RCL and rh are about the same energy. Why is that?

Speaker 1:          04:28          Well, what I expected the answer I expected it was based on this lone pair repulsion. So here on the left we have peroxide and and ethane, they have the same number of electrons, right? And on the right we have NCL and methyl cl, the same number of electrons on the right. Okay? Now if you look at the Bond Association energies, this one is twice as strong as that one. And this one is nearly twice as strong as that one. So what makes the ones on the top so weak when really it's the same number of electrons involved up and down. Okay, well what you notice is that on top you have lone pairs on the atoms that are being bonded, which will repel one another. So the, the Idi expected was that that would weaken the bond. Now is this plausible?

Speaker 1:          05:27          Could the electron repair electron pair repulsion? Explain the difference in Bond Association energies between the top and bottom, what we could look at, how the electrons actually are arranged as we calculate it by quantum mechanics. And of course what it looks like depends on what contour we draw this contour at point double o two uh, electrons per cubic bor radius is not very informative. But if we go in further to higher densities to 0.01 to 0.05, 2.25, now we see something different in these two things you'd noticed. That's what that, uh, in the, in the bottom, the protons that are out here, the Proton on the carbon as opposed to where there is no proton on the oxygen draws these electrons out. Right. And the same thing here, the, the hydrogen that's pulled out of the nitrogen nucleus and put out here to become ch three that draws these electrons out so that they don't repel one another as much.

Speaker 1:          06:30          So, uh, uh, that seems a plausible explanation, although it's not quantitative. Okay. So we would say then that the repulsion between the electrons, which is less in the case where they've been drawn out, might be an important factor in, in stabilizing the ones where the electrons are drawn out. That was the answer I expected on the exam. Cause we had talked about lone pair repulsion, right. So that seems a plausible explanation for weakening. Oh versus cc or NCL versus CCL. But that wasn't the answer I got on a lot of the, some people gave that answer, but a lot of them appealed to then that difference of electronegativity so that CCL has a big difference in electronegativity according to the polling scale of electronegativity. So carbon has 2.55 chlorine 3.16 they're quite different in their electronegativity whereas nitrogen 3.04 is rather similar to the 3.16.

Speaker 1:          07:34          So that was what people had in mind then was there'd be an important resonance structure for CCL. That would be c plus cl minus. And that would be, we know, we associate the existence of resonance structures with stabilization. Uh, now we've seen that we can understand that thing in terms of the, the energies of orbitals that the concept that was involved there. Uh, we, we start with a, with a bond either with nitrogen to chlorine, which would have its electrons. There are carbon to chlorine, which would have its electrons down there. And then if we're going to break the bond, those electrons, if we're going to go to ions like end plus or c plus and cl minus these electron pairs would have to go onto the chlorine and they have to go farther when they're on the nitrogen. So that mismatch and energies aids breaking them Hetero literally for the, uh, for the carbon for case where the carbon is mismatched, you don't have to go up as much.

Speaker 1:          08:36          So it's easier to ionize, but that's not what we're talking about in bond association energy. In Bond Association energy, we're talking about breaking to two free radicals where one goes on, one Adam, one electron goes on the other from the payer. And now as we talked about, uh, early last semester in terms of bond association energy or Homolysis, it's the carbon chlorine bond is stronger, right? So this is putting a slightly more quantitative stuff, uh, ideas to bear on the idea of why, uh, the, you have that difference in bond strength, but the idea of, of electronegativity being associated with bond strength is an interesting one that's worth tracing down a little bit. So I'm going to talk just a little bit today about electronegativity and bond strengths. Uh, the first few, as I've mentioned this last semester in English, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of the word electronegativity was in 1837 and systems of mineralogy by James Dwight Dana.

Speaker 1:          09:44          And we mentioned that James Might, Dana was a professor here at Yale, uh, in the, in the 19th century. Uh, he, uh, lived in this House that, that, uh, you've walked by and which is now a national historical monument. And he lived in the house with his wife, Henrietta Dana. Actually it was Henry at a Silliman. Dana was her, was her maiden name and she was the daughter of Benjamin Solomon whose statue is just down past Nate out there on the, as you see them on the way up I think is, is a snow necklace has gone this week. Okay. So, uh, Dana was well married. Okay. That's just to give you a little local color on the bay, but electronegativity in the sense we use it. Uh, what, what, what puts, what sense with Dana have been involved in electronegativity in 1837, what idea was going around that, where the negativity or positivity of Adams would be important?

Speaker 1:          10:50          Dualism, right? Right. The idea of what held things together, he thought if you could understand what was negative and what was positive, then you could understand minerals in that case. But electronegativity in the sense of organic chemistry or Inorganic Chemistry for that matter was popularized by Linus Pauling beginning with this paper in, uh, in, uh, 1933, uh, or 1932, it was published. Okay? So this is the key passage in that paper. And remember that Pauling was pushing this idea of resonance, that you get stabilization when you can draw different resonance structures. So he's talking about the attitude of the energies of normal covalent bonds. He says there's empirical evidence in support of the postulate that the energies of normal covalent bonds are additive. Now what does he mean by additive? That is that if you have Adam's a and B, you could have a, you could have a baby and a baby and you could have a B. And his idea is that the bond strength and a B should be the average of what you have in Aa and what you have in BB.

Speaker 1:          12:02          So he was a little confusing about that because in some papers he used this concept using the arithmetic mean, but in others he talked about the geometric mean where it was the square root of the product instead of the half the sum. Okay. But at any rate, the idea was that normal covalent bonds should be the average of the whole of the homo nuclear bonds. So he uses them this, this plot where he's measuring the energies of the bonds, Bond Association, energies in unusual units for us electron volts, right? It's you multiply by 23 to get kilocalories per mole. Okay. So here are our HX bonds that are normal, that that is calculated if they were normal there. The average of the HH and the xx for the different halogens as you see fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and item. Okay. But the actual, uh, now, incidentally there's a little problem here because he was using the wrong value for the fluorine, fluorine bond energy, and all of this work.

Speaker 1:          13:08          He thought it was 65 kilocalories from all. Actually it's 38. It's a very, it's a rather weak bond because of all these electron pair repulsions that we talked about. Okay. So his numbers are a little bit skewed, but then he rate that was what he was doing. But now, so this is theoretical all to get these red numbers. He used hh and x ax and just took their average. Okay. Now observed values are this, the bonds are actually stronger than you expect, but they're not all stronger by the same amount, right? So you can look in Paul, and the reason is in Pauling's theory, this residence theory that you can have the polar resonance structure, which makes it more stable and now you can, what this suggests is that there's this difference Delta between what you would expect if it were normal, the average, and what you observed, which is what you have when you have this polar resonance structure.

Speaker 1:          14:05          And what he says here, the greater the ionic character of the bond, the greater will be the value of Delta. Okay? So the need idea now is we could use delta, which is x based on experimental numbers as a way to measure how important resonance is, right? So you could measure resonance stabilization by Delta if you follow, if you adopt his assumptions that normal bonds are the average, right? And now you've measure these and then you get the difference, tells you how important resonance stabilization is. And then you try to see if there's something you can correlate to predict how, how important resonance stabilization should be. All right? So he has this rather complicated table two in the paper, which has observed bond energies, normal bond energies, Delta and the square root of Delta. Okay? Now let's show how that works by taking one particular block here.

Speaker 1:          15:08          So we're comparing oxygen and fluorine, okay? So here on the table we look at oxygen, oxygen, and it's Bond Association. Energy is 1.49 electron volts, okay? Or you can look over here and fluorine. Fluorine is 2.8 so if the bond were normal, the oxygen fluorine bond would be the average of those, right? Which is, although remember actually this is 1.65 it's not 2.8 but put that aside for now. Okay. Now then, if you look at oxygen with fluorine, the Bond Association energy observed as 2.48 now we can compare that, uh, it's, notice it's not the average of 1.49 and 2.8 it's too high, right? So we could calculate what the normal would be, what the average is of o and f, F and then we can take the difference. The difference is 0.33 that's delta. That's how much in his view, the, the olf bond has been stabilized because of the resonance structure.

Speaker 1:          16:22          Okay? Now, is there a way to predict how big that Delta should be? Well, here's the same deal with carbon and fluorine. And notice that the Delta for carbon and fluorine is 2.2 much bigger than between oxygen and fluorine, which was only 0.33 or you could look in a different block and see what it is for carbon and oxygen. It's 1.0 so we know carbon to oxygen, how much it is, we know carbon to flury and how much it is. And we know oxygen to flury how big it is. Is there some relationship among these that we could have? Knowing two of them, we could have predicted the third, well not really because the difference between CNF and the difference minus the difference between CNO is not the difference between ONF. It doesn't work. You can't add up the polarity differences that way. But then he tried something else. He tried taking the square root of Delta. That's the brown numbers here. So this is the square root of those stabilizations. And now you see something interesting that the difference between c, uh, between CEO and CF is the difference between o and F. Pretty close, right? So it's about the square roots are about additive. Now, I don't think he had any good reason to theoretically say say it should be the square root, but he fiddled with the numbers that he noticed that worked.

Speaker 1:          17:57          So the question is, does it work for all the elements? If so, then from something you can predict the others. Okay, so here he has the here's he has those, the square roots of Delta for carbon versus other things. That is, how important is the resonance structure, the square root of the stabilization of the bond. How? How important is that for ch four CN, for CEO, for CF, for CECL, for CBR. And can we use that to establish a scale of how different the polarities are among those different atoms? Okay, so here he has carbon and here's hydrogen on one side, then bromine, chlorine and nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine. On the other side, the distances, there are those numbers we just saw on the previous slide. How important in after taking the square root is that energy difference? That stabilization. Okay, so he did it with carbon.

Speaker 1:          19:00          Now, Eh, so you get some values. But if those values are fundamental, then you should get the same scale. No matter what Adam you use. You don't have to do carbon acts. You could do nitrogen x or oxygen x or anything else acts and you should always get the same scale if the system is going to work. So that's these other horizontal lines. Noticed that in the case of carbon, the difference between carbon and oxygen is one the difference between carbon and fluorine is 1.48 and then the difference between oxygen and fluorine is 0.48 and experimentally, if you measure relative to oxygen, oxygen to flu, Rita's 0.58 not bad. Okay, so here are the others compared to oxygen for the o x bonds. And here they are relative to hydrogen, right? And notice that as you come down with oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, bromine, carbon, they're sort of the same, right?

Speaker 1:          19:58          It's the same order and they're about the same. So this isn't the last word in theory, but it looks like something pretty fundamental. And then here he used relative to both h on one end and f on the other. So he called these things the scale electronegativity. And here he gives the increasing electronegativity, which is just those numbers, the square root of the stabilization of the bond right from the previous slide. And here are the values for hydrogen, phosphorus, iron and sulfur, carbon and so on. And these were the days when they still did handwritten figures in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, which was a long time ago. Okay. And then below that he looks at, it's Matt, I couldn't figure out for a long time what the heck this was. But finally I figured out, he doesn't say in the paper, but

Speaker 2:          20:48          it's a picture of the periodic table, which has been distorted so that it shows every atom at its proper electronegativity. So here are the halogens here, the cow Kaja, nides, nitrogen, phosphorous, carbon and so on. In other words, he's taken the periodic table and he's distorted that like that so that the numbers go from red to yellow as you go from left to right. Okay. So that's where electronegativity and the current sense, the Pauling scale of electro negativity, that's where it came from. Okay. And notice that what it really depends on is what the periodic table depends on is that as you go across here, you have how the nuclear charge is increasing the screened nuclear charge. We talked about that last semester. And as you go down, the number of nodes in the valence shell is increasing. That's what gives the periodic table it's character.

Speaker 2:          21:43          That's what explains electronegativity. Okay. So the idea of this was to push the idea of the, the concept of resonance. Now is it surprising that we find that bond strength correlates with differences in Pauline's electro negativities? Remember that's how the Chi sub P is Pauline's electronegativity values. Remember how we got into this question? We said, why are these polar bonds like NCL unusually weak compared to, to uh, to, uh, to, to bonds that don't have that difference in electro negativity. And we said it was repulsion of electron pairs, but some people said it's electronegativity. Now I asked you, is it surprising here that bond strength correlates with Pauling's electronegativity scale? Does anybody got a, you have an opinion on

Speaker 3:          22:37          that after what I had been saying, I've gone through this pretty fast, so I don't expect expect you to, but I was impressed by the question I got after the last lecture, so I thought I'd give it a try here. Yeah, yeah. No,

Speaker 2:          22:56          because that's where the electro negativities came from in Pawling. He used the bond there member, it's the square root of the, of the, of the bond strength stabilization that he used to get the electronegativity scale. So it's not surprising at all, Nate. You're exactly right that the appalling electronegativity scale was defined by the differences and bond strengths from the averages. Now, uh, in the first issue of nature of this week, this, this year, this year has been proclaimed the international year of chemistry. So you're sitting in the right class here. Uh, so the first issue of nature was celebrating chemistry and they had a bunch of essays and one of them, uh, on pages 26 to 28 was by Phillip Ball and it was called beyond the bond. Have we gone moved beyond bonds now? Can we just use quantum mechanics to talk about things? I remember, this was the question we asked at the end of last semester, right? If Bond, if the history of chemistry hadn't developed the way it did in terms of bonds and we just had quantum mechanics with anybody ever have talked about bonds, if you could just calculate all these numbers and the, a little squib about this, uh, about this article said more than ever before, new techniques show the bond to be a convenient fiction, albeit one that holds the field of chemistry together, finds Phillip Ball.

Speaker 2:          24:26          But one passage in that I thought was particularly timely, he said by the 1960s for all Pauling's salesmanship ammo theory was generally agreed to be more convenient than his resonance theory for most purposes. So when I was a student, resonance theory was a really big thing and molecular orbital theory was just coming on. But it's really different now. Now, molecular orbital theory is what people mostly focus on. And only certain communities tend to talk about resonance, but, but, uh, but elementary teaching tends to lag behind where people are. So resonance is still a big thing in AP courses, I suspect, and so on. But at any rate, it's not surprising really, that it certainly is not surprising that it should correlate with Pauling's scale because that's what he used to define it. Bond strengths. But the idea of, of of polar bonds being, having high bond association energy in terms of what we've talked about first, how far the electrons have to go up when you break the bond to get two free radicals, that's it.

Speaker 2:          25:34          We expect that the energy mismatch, we'll strengthen bonds. So accrued correlation of appalling electronegativity scale plotted vertically with other measures of how tightly electrons are held. The orbital event, orbital energy, for example, how much energy it takes to pull an electron away from an Adam, or how much energy, uh, do you, uh, do you, does it take to pull an electron away from a charged ion? Right. Both of those things are our measures of, of orbital energy. Uh, and that's what's called Mulligan's electronegativity scale, which he published two years later in 1934, the average of ionization potential, an electron affinity. So this, this one, Mulligan was the, was the one of the chief originators of molecular orbital theory, which in the middle of the century was in real competition. It was like a little bit like a radical theory and type theory 100 years earlier, right? There was a lot of competition between them, but, but mulligans theory, which has to do with orbital energy, we can understand and we see that it correlates more or less well with Pauline's electronegativity scale.

Speaker 2:          26:42          So fine. So electronegativity does have something to do with it, but electronegativity really is not sort of a fundamental property. It was measured in terms of these bond stabilizations. Okay. That's a little bit of a, of a sidelight to what we're actually talking about. The Chemistry and physics of Al Keel Haylight is, we're going to talk about now a free radical halogenation introduces a functional group into alkanes normal alkanes don't have a functional group, a unusually high homo or low Lumo. Once you've done a free radical reaction on those, now you have this unusually low Lumo sigma star. So you can be in doing things with it. So what we're going to talk about now having talked about free radical reactions is the ionic chemistry involving that Sigma Star. So we're going to talk about the alcohol Halides, which now we know how to prepare. So these are nuclear affiliate substitution and acidity is much the same thing.

Speaker 2:          27:40          We mentioned this preliminarily last semester, uh, that so there are non bonded interactions and salvation, which is key for ionic reactions. And I just noticed that all the work I did since last night is uh, is not in here cause I've redone that slide. Uh, so the question is, am I going to put that in here or not? It would take about two seconds. Well it'll take about a minute to break here and start again with the most recent version, which I can't, I can't sacrifice all the work I did since last night. I stayed up late so I'm going to save this, uh,

Speaker 4:          28:25          pardon me.

Speaker 2:          28:34          Does by the steak this morning I loaded the PR, the version that was on the web. Okay. I've got that saved now nearly. Oh, it's saving it over the web. That's the problem. I hadn't reckoned on that one. Are there any questions while we're pausing for this?

Speaker 4:          29:07          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          29:09          it just incidentally, how much did you learn about electronegativity in high school? Was this a big focus of your AP course? Yeah. So now you know where it came from, came from Dana down the hill and then Pauling. Okay, there we go. Now.

Speaker 4:          29:28          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:29          Let's see. I want the other version that's here, I think.

Speaker 4:          29:35          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:40          And here we are. So I'm going to do that last slide again cause that's where I noticed things were bad. Uh, so free radical halogenation introduces a functional group, uh, and we're gonna now be looking at that functional group, that chemical and physical properties of alcohol. Hey Lights, which involves sigma star, the functional group we've been able to put in. So we have sn one reactions in which those electrons go on to x in order to break the bond. And we have those in which the new electrons have gone into, into sigma star in order to help the x leave. And that's the sn two reaction. And if the Adam in the middle is h instead of our, then this same thing as acidity, right? So that's why we introduced this concept last semester. But we're going to talk about it in more detail in terms of reaction mechanisms now, okay.

Speaker 2:          30:38          Now in the process, this makes uh, uh, this makes ions right? So we have to go beyond the molecules themselves and thinking about this reaction because non bonded interactions and salvation turns out to be key for ionic reactions. You can't just look at the reacting species. You have to look at the surroundings, which makes everything ever so much more complicated. Okay. Now this is Henri Victorville and you'll uh, who lived as you see in the middle of the 19th century and you know, is that a lot, the first letter of his last name because it said that that's where they are, comes from. It stands for renewal because he did a lot of thermodynamics stuff. This, Oh, PV equals NRT is this man. Now in 1850 he wrote a book, the first elements of chemistry, and there's one passage about chemical affinity here that I think is worth looking at.

Speaker 2:          31:35          He says, for chemical affinity to act freely, substances must be dispersed. Now this was of course writing an 1850 this was before bonds or anything, but they knew you don't just mix solids together, you have to disperse them and you can't just grind them right? Since dispersion by mechanical pulverization is incomplete, the molecules have to touch molecules, not just particles of stuff, touch particles, right? They must be taken into the liquid or gaseous state. Previous chemists expressed this fact by saying corporate known arduous Niecy. So Luta substances do not react unless they're dissolved. So this very, this dissolution, the fact of what's around the things is what's going to be important and understanding reactions. So the theory of organic chemistry became manageable in the first place when people started studying gases, as you remember, because it's often possible to focus on a simple unit with strong interactions.

Speaker 2:          32:36          That's molecules or the individual and bonds within them or the strong interactions with well-defined geometries and energies as we discussed last semester. And you neglect the much more numerous and complex intermolecular interactions with the solvent. Right? But actually we are going to have to consider those because we're interested not just in the gas phase but in solution. So it was essential to go into the gas phase in order to get a toe hold on understanding chemistry in the first place. But if you want to understand real practical chemistry, you have to understand solutions. So these weak intermolecular interactions give organic materials, many of their most valuable properties. Most of the properties of what's important in your, in your bodies are not things that involve making and breaking bonds, but changing non bonded interactions between things. And that's what we're going to be looking at for a little while now.

Speaker 2:          33:31          So non bonded classical energies. Okay, now suppose you have a uh, just cool ohms law charge, charge interaction. That's where we started last semester. That's as you know, the only true source of chemical potential energy. Uh, there's gravity and physics and magnetism. But those are, those are tiny, right? They're nothing compared to cool ohms law. There's the strong force that's for physicist, that's way above what we deal with in chemistry. The cool ohms law is where we live, right? That it's proportional to one over R as we know. And the constant for the proportionality is minus 300 332 kilocalories per mole. When you, when you use angst from units. So this provides a very long range attraction, right? Even when you're, when you're three angst drums apart, the energy is still a hundred kilocalories per mole, right? Actually now where should we start with zero?

Speaker 2:          34:32          We could start with zero when they're infinitely far away and then we use cool ohms law to get the energy, how the energy goes down, or if we're thinking of breaking the bond, we could start at the bond distance and then stress or the distance between two ions and see how much it takes to pull them apart a certain distance, right? So if we start a bond is one and a half, let's take bigger ions. Let's suppose there are two Ostrom's apart. That means they're at a 332 over to the energy is minus 165 okay. If we go to three on extremes, then it's minus 100 so we've gone up and energy by about 100 kilocalories per mole in going from two to three Ostrom's and we have a lot further to go on the way out. This is very different from covalent bonds where when you get to three Ostrom, that's the end of the line.

Speaker 2:          35:23          So covalent bonds are typically a hundred kilocalories per mole, but you get there very quickly, so they're very stiff, right? You break the bond, you, you, as you break the bond, you go up and energy really quickly. Who loan doesn't go up as rapidly, but it goes up very, very far. So it's long range and that's why solve this are so important because they saw another molecule can be rather far away and still influence ions where it wouldn't influence free radicals. Okay? So, uh, eh, but this is media. This is a attenuated by a solvent. If you have a dielectric constant, as it's called in the solvent, that reduces the magnitude of, of the, uh, Coolum big energy or the Coolum Vic forests. Now, how big are these values of, of, uh, epsilon? Right? Here's some values taken from the, from the Jones book, uh, noticed that hexane is a factor of two.

Speaker 2:          36:25          So that'll take things from that. Take that constant from 300 down to one 50, still quite big. But if you go to something like water at 78, that cuts it way down, right? This is about, this is about this, into, this is something like four, right? So it's only four kilocalories per mole rather than 332 kilocalories per mole. If you're operating in water with water all around the islands, right? So that makes an enormous difference how these ions are going to interact, what solvent you're in, and it makes quite a difference. What solvent and notice down to acetone, the solvents might be considered polar. That is, they have pretty big dielectric constants. So they really attenuate the energy of interaction between the ions. But chloroform, ether hexane or not very polar, they don't cut it down very much. Now this has to do with things like the solubility or the melting point of salts like sodium chloride or uh, or Tetra methyl ammonium iodide.

Speaker 2:          37:32          Because notice that these ions are rather small, so the charges are close together, but these ions are big so they're substantially further apart. And that's going to make an enormous difference in when you're starting to pull them apart, right? If you, if you go to twice the distance here, right? You really cut this way down so that, uh, so that cesium, cesium iodide, sodium chloride has a melting point of something like 801 Celsius. But cesium iodide, the same charges, but bigger ions is 200 degrees lower and it's melting point and the solubilities reflect the same thing. It's easier to get the solids apart if you're starting with bigger ions. Okay? So the big interaction is charged, charged, but there are others that are important to charge with dipole. So if you have a molecule that's not charged but has a dissymmetry in the charge, that's within it.

Speaker 2:          38:31          So it has a plus and a minus in, then those can interact and that's proportional to one over r squared so it dies away more rapidly. Right. And if the dipole can orient so that you have to average over different ways, it could be oriented, it would be oriented more likely in the favorable than in the unfavorable way. But that depends on the temperature and if you have that situation, it turns out to be our to the minus forth over temperature because of how much is favored one way or the other. Okay. Then if you go to uh, charged with something that's non polar but could become polar if it's put in the field of another charge. So you put the push the nucleus one way, the electrons the other way and now you get a charge interacting with an induced dipole that that depends on our to the minus three one over r cubed.

Speaker 2:          39:28          Then you can have two dipoles interacting with one another. That's also one over r cubed or you can have to induce things interacting with one another. Have you ever seen that before? Where the, how the electrons are distributed in this one, when they're over here, the ones here tend to be over there. And when these are here, these are here. Where did we encounter that before? Yeah. Correlation energies. Right? Okay. So, uh, that, that turns out to be our to the sixth power. So notice that these others, other than the Coolo, they fall off very, very rapidly and they start very weak, right? So, so there you might think you could neglect them, but there could be a lot of them. That's the problem when there are many solvent molecules around. Okay. Now let's look at some trends in the highlights and whatever textbook you have, you'll find this guy did the, when we talk about different functional groups, we're talking about the alcohol haylight now typically chapters in all the books you look at.

Speaker 2:          40:32          We'll start with something about the physical properties of those compounds and then go onto their chemical properties. So this is a little bit about physical properties of the highlights. So, uh, here we look at the van der walls, radius of the Halogen X. Right? And here we look at the bond distance between x and carbon. And you notice they're almost exactly the same. And we learned something from that, which is that non bonded distances or something like twice bonded distances, right? Because the rate, the radius of an atom is about the same as the distance from the nucleus of the atom is the nucleus of the carbon, right? So the, so that means that the, that the covalent radius is about half the, uh, the van der walls radius. Okay. Now here's the property, the dipole moment, right? How, how polar is the molecule, right? And it's the, the dipole moment

Speaker 1:          41:34          shown here. What do you notice about that as you go fluorine and chlorine and bromine? Iodine. What's the first thing you do

Speaker 3:          41:40          notice about the trend doesn't work for age,

Speaker 1:          41:45          Derek with h? Uh, well I didn't put it, if you have age, it turns out there is no dipole moment because it's with methyl. So h c h three is a symmetrical molecule in the center of the electrons is the same as the center of the Nuclei. So, but what, here's one. The red is a trend as you go, well forget, forget hydrogen because it's, it's not really a halogen. But here, here's radios, the d, The bond distance. What's special about this one? About the yellow, the orange one, Lauren.

Speaker 3:          42:21          Pardon me? It goes up and down. It's not monotonic. What do you learn when you see trends that are not monotonic? There must be two things going on. So what's the other thing here? We're interest

Speaker 1:          42:37          in the Po in how much charge is separated? Here we have a ch three and a halogen. So the dipole moment is how big the charges are and how much they're separated. Right now we already see here how much they're separated. That is what the distance is. But how big is the charge? Right? So if we look here, this is incidentally majored in Dubai units, which if you multiply by a, which is 4.8 times the charge times the separation, now we know the separation. Uh, and we noticed that it's not monotonic and here's the charge. How many electrons have been transferred, right? And that's quite monotonic, right? But what we've seen here is that the dipole moment is the product of two properties. How much charge and how much separated, right? But they're opposing trends. As one goes up, the other goes down and although they're both monotonic, one is nonlinear, more nonlinear than the other, so they don't exactly cancel one another and going up and down and you get weird behavior.

Speaker 1:          43:49          This, this, uh, this when you have conflicting nonlinear trends. Okay, so there were two things going on to give the dipole moment. Now the other, you can see similar kinds of thing in another measure of the size of atoms, which is so called a value. That's how much is axial compared to Ecuadorian in cyclohexane? Axial is more crowded than Ecuadorian is. We talked about this last semester. So if we know how much is it, what the energy differences between axial and equatorial, we have some measure of how big that group is. All right? So it's the axial minus energy equatorial in kilocalories from also that measures size. Now here are the values for the halogens and hydrogen, incidentally, which is defined as zero because you're comparing hydrogen with hydrogen. Okay, so here it is, and again, you see it's not monotonic, it goes up and down.

Speaker 1:          44:47          So there must be two things involved. What are the two things? One of the things is how big the Vanderwall is, radius of the atom is, which clearly gets bigger as you go. Flooring, chlorine, bromine, iodine. But why does this, why does the effect on axial versus equatorial? Go up and down. Why doesn't it just go up? The bond? This is between the carbon and the substituent. Ah, because the bond gets longer as the Adam gets bigger, right? So it's not not a tonic that suggests there's a competition. So here's fluorine. That's what's shown here. And now watch this model is I changed from fluorine to iodine. And what happened? The Adam gets bigger, not shown to scale, but the bond gets longer, right? So you have a larger Vander walls radius, but it stands off further. So it's not so dramatic. The difference. Now compare that with what if the group there is ch three, right?

Speaker 1:          45:44          Because ch three has, has this, uh, effective Vander walls radius. So that's how I decided where to put it on this scale, right? It's got the right Vanderwalt radius, but the bond distance for carbon carbon is much shorter than it is for bromine and iodine or chlorine for that. Or it's about, it's about the same as fluorine, right? Or a little bit bigger. Okay. And now when we put these two things together, in order to get the a value there, there's, we got this big group and it's come in some compared to the halogens. Now you see there's a really wild outlier in this thing because of the, because you now have a big group to ch three and it's short. So it, so even though, even though the radius of, of, of, uh, of methyl is about, is about between bromine denied in its effect on this as much bigger because it sits in closer.

Speaker 1:          46:43          Okay? Now the boiling points of the [inaudible], here's a table. We could have taken it from any book. This particular one is from the Jones tax that chose different al kill groups and the hydrogen fluorine, chlorine, bromine. I'd and what are the boiling points? Now, let's just see if we can understand this. I'm going to go just a little bit further because we had that. We started late with people getting here late and we had that little break in the class. Okay, so let's look at the boiling points. So high, so methane, methane, the one with hydro methyl with hydrogen is very low boiling and then it gets higher and higher and higher. That is the liquid tends to hold together more. Not to go into the gas phase. The molecules are holding together more. Now, the question is why? Why when we replace hydrogen by fluorine, by chlorine, by bromine, by Ayah than does the boiling point Yo up?

Speaker 3:          47:40          What causes the molecules to hold together? It's not covalent bonds. We're talking about non bonding interactions. What is it? That whole, what could make them altogether? We know the fundamental forces. That's what we just, it's cool. It was law as colored by dipoles and things like that. They are here tiresome. Taco hydrogen, hydrogen bonds as an idea now that you're not going to get hydrogen bonds when you don't have hydro

Speaker 1:          48:10          region,

Speaker 3:          48:12          right? So the halogens I stuck on to work for, and the next thing we're going to talk about is hydrogen bonds that that'll come in the next class. Now, any other ideas of what holds them together? Date, I even have polar interactions, right? So you'd have dipoles slid,

Speaker 1:          48:28          interacting even though there are no charges. Okay? So let's look at the dipole moment, which was on that previous table and you see that methane has zero, but fluorine has 1.85 so that's going to allow the molecules to hold together, okay? So raise the boiling point because you could have them lined up this way, right? But that's not just polarity because if we go across here, the polarity went up, but then it goes down again. But the boiling point keeps going up. So there must be something else other than that these dipoles holding together. And that other thing is polarizability how easy it is to shift the electrons in the molecule and how many electrons there are to shift. So you see, if you look at fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and I had an Adams rite fluid. Adam is very not non polarizable. When you bring a charge or a dipole near it, it doesn't distort very much, but chlorine distorts more bromine. And I had in the most, because it has the most electrons, the most weakly held, right. Or if we and ch four is not polar. And also it's not very polarizable. Right. Uh, the hydrocarbon is, is not very polarizable given that it's five Adams of these are just one atom. So, uh, next time we'll start, we'll start at this point and go in to try to understand the boiling point of the alkanes without the halogen on them.
