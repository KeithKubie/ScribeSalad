1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,190
And there's a history to boxing
know that unfortunately, you know,

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:09,930
because I care about the sports for
my whole life. Um, that it's kind of,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,820
yeah, it's got a reputation as being
correct. Yeah. And unfortunately,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,970
fortunately, and unfortunately,
like there's a part,

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,430
the good part where the history goes back
longer, farther than any other sport,

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,940
any other sport. I mean, it was
the first sport in the Olympics,

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,110
it goes back further. And it was
the biggest sport in this country,

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,760
bigger than baseball. At one time
it was that big. I mean, you know,

9
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:39,840
so and now it's, it's not,

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,370
and it, it's too bad because,

11
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,060
and it's too bad that the
kids, that the younger people,

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,630
they don't have the ability
to learn about those fighters.

13
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,420
So special fighters that were
special, they really want,

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,730
and it was special for
different reasons. Like,

15
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,620
like Jackie Robinson was special. We know,

16
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:06,010
we don't have to go into why he was
special, but nobody knows that Joe Lewis,

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,280
who is quiet and everything, but when
he was in the army and there was,

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,660
you know, segregation and
all that crap going on, he,

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,290
he quietly used his position
as heavyweight champ of
the world to make sure that

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,870
when he went to movies and they put him
in the front row and he saw that blacks

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,460
weren't allowed to come in. He said,

22
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,470
I'm not going in there unless
blacks can come in there.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,950
When he went to other sort of events
where the same kind of junk was going on,

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,250
he very quietly but powerfully

25
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,410
integrated things and said, no, I'm
going to make a change here. You, you,

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,700
you're not going to have me and
not have people that look like me,

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,950
you know, kept out. So he, I never,

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,350
people I've read about it because
I like reading about those things,

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,210
about history, um, to see how
we can be better and, and um,

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,410
where we've come from.

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,240
And there were history of
black families, you know,

32
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:13,530
poor black families that would,
would get hope from just saying, Hey,

33
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,130
Luiz did it. They would tell
their kids, Hey Joe, listen,

34
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,950
I don't want to hear this. I don't
want to hear that. You can't do this.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,870
Joe Lewis did it. And so he
was that important. That's all,

36
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,520
that's the only point I'm
making here. He was that

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,610
freaking important that that history and
the history of other fighters like him

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,230
doesn't have to be black fighters,

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,880
but that what they fo what
they did, what they overcame,

40
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,830
where they came from,
who Benny Lennon. Um,

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,900
one of the greatest Jewish fighters of
all time. There was a time when, uh,

42
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,260
and it's still around, unfortunately
there's a lot of antisemitism,

43
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:53,840
but there was a time where, you
know, it was tough being a Jew and,

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,390
and you're growing up and
he get caught on kike on,

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,180
on pronounce it right. I think
it was right. And you get caught.

46
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,980
All those kind of, I don't even
know what the hell that means.

47
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,860
I just know it's a bad
name to call ju. And,

48
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,730
and you had all that stuff going on and
jewels woman thought of being there were

49
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,430
thought of moving towards banking in the,

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,920
they moving towards things
will make them money into that.

51
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,390
Later on they started doing that but
they wouldn't have ghettos and they were

52
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:26,290
trying to pull themselves out. And
so at that era, during that time,

53
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,610
the twenties to thirties the truth was
some of the best fighters because that

54
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,230
was their way of getting out.
But there was [inaudible],

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,330
there was another significance to be
in a Julie's fighter that a lot of the

56
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,044
kids,

57
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,180
they won't be thought of as be in Tufts
or they got picked on and thought of

58
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,180
that they're going to go more
towards academic and other stuff.

59
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,840
So there was a weakness
perceived not true.

60
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,020
None of this stuff is
perceived but cause Mark. Yeah.

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,280
So now all of a sudden Betty
Lennon comes along when a sports,

62
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:05,020
the biggest sport in the country and
he's the best freaking fighter in a game.

63
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,040
And he combed his hair before he got in
a ring and he would come out without it

64
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,990
being messed. And this was,
this guy was, I mean he was,

65
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,070
he was Michael Jordan. I mean before
that stuff, before Michael joined,

66
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:25,180
before air Jordan [inaudible]. I
mean this guy was down only tough.

67
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,410
He was not only a champion,

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,730
which obviously connected
to being tough by itself,

69
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,840
but it was, he was smart.
He was, he was cool.

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,640
He had pazazz,

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,570
he was a man and there
were Jewish families.

72
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,370
You don't hear about these stories,

73
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:47,371
but there were Jewish families I've read
and I've heard from people where say,

74
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,150
Hey, don't let nobody pick on you.

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,620
Benny Leonard is the best fighter
in the world. Jews are tough.

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
We're, we're not just smart. We're tough.

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,310
Benny Leonard shows that.
So that kinda history,

78
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,180
that kind of

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,640
polling of people up
in many different ways,

80
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,650
not just economically out of
poverty, but, but emotionally,

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,310
mentally, because you can
be in poverty mentally.

82
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,810
You can be in the low place mentally.
It doesn't have to be, you know,

83
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,280
financially all the time.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,750
You know where you have holes in your
shoes and you and you're wearing shirts

85
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:36,751
that don't fit now it can be the way you
feel about yourself that is without is

86
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,280
without Prince 30 with with without value.

87
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,040
You have no value for
yourself as a person.

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,220
That's the worst poverty
in the frictional world.

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,810
There's not the lower than that
and Joe Lewis and Benny Leonard,

90
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,910
they were fighters. They
weren't baseball players.

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,890
They pulled people out of those.

92
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,790
They let people know they had
value, that their race had value,

93
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,990
their people had value,

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,320
they had value and that should be known
and you can go anywhere and am glad you

95
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,840
can because I love all sports.

96
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,770
You can go anywhere and you can read about
the greatness of the baseball players

97
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,590
in a greatness of, of course NFL
hasn't been around that long,

98
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,730
but the greatness of those players
and the greatness of the NBA players,

99
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,060
but where do the kids ever get to
read and to hear and to see about the

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,810
greatness of these people,
these fighters? V nowhere,

101
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,640
very little. Very little.
It's not there. Why?

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,630
Because again, I'm not
going to get into craziness,

103
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,290
but the powers that be the, listen,

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,390
it's not marketed properly. I get it.

105
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,780
It doesn't have a commission so it doesn't
take care of itself the way the U of

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:50,781
C,

107
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,980
the greatness about the why the UFC grew
so much as they marketed themselves in

108
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,820
a tremendous way. So there's
nobody, boxing is just there.

109
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,420
It takes care of itself. It exists
because it's man against man.

110
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,380
So it's always going to be
there. But nobody's building it.

111
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,430
Nobody's marketing and Norman's
feeding them monster to make it bigger.

112
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,430
It's a plant that's in the corner of,

113
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:17,840
of of your offers that doesn't
get sun, doesn't get hot,

114
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,500
but it's still there. It's still there.

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,960
And what I'm saying is that

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,170
[inaudible] I didn't want to yell because
now people are probably happy but,

117
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,380
but, but it should be fed a little bit.

118
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,770
It should be watered a
little bit. But you know,

119
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,400
cause of what I just described it

120
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,080
guys like you call that guys like you
guys who have a deep appreciation for the

121
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:47,460
history of the sport guy,

122
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:51,600
guys who have a deep appreciation of
what it meant when Joe Louis beat max

123
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,070
Schmeling guys,

124
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,640
guys who understand what it meant when
sugar Ray Robinson was the best fighter

125
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:00,360
in the world and everybody knew when
he pulled up in a fucking pink Cadillac

126
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,340
with a beautiful suit on

127
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,590
and any any made the elevated,

128
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,640
he elevated people in Harlem
everywhere off. But Harlem, he had,

129
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,990
he owned half a Harlem.

130
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:13,991
He owned restaurants in [inaudible]
stores and barber shops and everything.

131
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:18,080
And, and you wanted to be there because
that's where his sugar Ray Robinson came

132
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,530
from. Yup, it was great. Yeah,

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,410
it's a rich part of history
that really does get ignored.

134
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,750
Let me tell you somewhere I was
Schmeling you brought up, you know,

135
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,160
love of obviously stuff

136
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,090
and that's why it's
nice to talk about which

137
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,130
smelling was a hell of a fighter.

138
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,560
Joe Lewis was the Brown
bomber who was coming up.

139
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,960
He was undefeated and I'm strolling,
had the great quote before the fight.

140
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:45,141
You know,

141
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:49,160
it's kinda like the babe Ruth thing that
they really happen where he pointed out

142
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,940
and then he hit on, you know, those,
those are great stories, but, but where,

143
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,060
what's the real truth behind them? You
know, we don't know. We don't care.

144
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,650
We don't care at a certain point, you
know why? Because they let us feel good.

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,300
They let us dream about possibilities
and we should all have possibilities to

146
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:10,860
dream about. And they make
somebody feel good because,

147
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,160
you know, the babe Ruth one
was connected to a sick kid.

148
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,500
So [inaudible] it's a nice thing.

149
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,110
It's where sports can be better
than just sports than just somebody

150
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,770
participating in it. It can go beyond
that. He agreed stronger than that.

151
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,540
And that's some of the
good stuff about it.

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,800
And so smelling the great story,

153
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,670
he didn't point to, you
know, the, to the fence,

154
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,520
but he said before the fight,

155
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,750
I see something with a, that's my, my, uh,

156
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,090
trying to be an accent
for the German, you know,

157
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,570
but I sound more like
Schultz from Hogan's heroes.

158
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,460
I don't know why every time you try to
do something, like with certain ethnic,

159
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,440
you know, pronunciations, um, you,

160
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,500
you sounded like you go to one of those
sitcoms, you go to one of those places,

161
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,570
you know, and when I say somebody, I
think my kid, I think my son said, uh,

162
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
you know, he had watched one of them, uh,

163
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,320
and I think he said he sounded like
Sergeant Schultz, like from Hogan's,

164
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,740
uh, heroes split. And he
said, I see something.

165
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,380
And what he saw was that Louis
would jab and he would leave.

166
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,790
You should never leave your head on a,

167
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,000
on a right side because if
you leave your head, you know,

168
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:33,300
you move your head to the right side,
you're in a path to the right hand,

169
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,810
you should actually finish on the left
side because then you outside the right

170
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:40,950
hand, you follow. There's
the right man over here.

171
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,660
It can hit you outside.
Right? So he had a habit of,

172
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,860
and he had a great trainer.

173
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,120
He had a habit though at that point
of leaving his head over on the right.

174
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,340
So smelling saw something as he said
that he could hit him with a right hand.

175
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,710
He could time it over the jam.

176
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,840
Now smelling was of the ilk
of the level of the caliber.

177
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,650
It wasn't just about talent. He
could punch it was a good fighter,

178
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,560
but it was a pro. What do I mean by that?

179
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,420
A lot of guys would hesitate
a little bit. Same opening.

180
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,220
They might see it, but it was the
Brown bomber was knocking everyone out.

181
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,920
So they hesitate. They
will. They were afraid.

182
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,430
Normal lot of people afraid of that word.

183
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,720
I mean it's there and
without it, we're not alive.

184
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,970
So he, they, they might
see the same thing,

185
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,830
but they want them at a pro level.

186
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,831
Pro level is a guy that can do what he
has to do and no emotions interfere with

187
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:46,590
doing it. I mean that's my simplest
way of Webster's might not say that,

188
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:50,370
but that's what I would say. So
they might've seen the opening,

189
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,300
but they would hesitate just enough
and it'd be gone the door close.

190
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,670
Cause it's, it's, it's like life. It's
moments capture moment, lose the moment.

191
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,000
And, but this guy was a pro. He,

192
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,740
he didn't let that come in there and
make them hesitate that, that fear,

193
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,860
he controlled it. And if
Goldman was there, bang,

194
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,850
he was going to throw the punch. So he
did and he dropped lose a few times.

195
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,050
And you know,

196
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:21,420
he won that fight and was
around the stop. The man,

197
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,270
I can't remember, maybe, maybe the
ninth, but it was late in the fight,

198
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,520
but he had heard them and you know,

199
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,260
Louis was taking a beating. So

200
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,790
Louis Lee went on, he won
no world title and um,

201
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,780
he'd be Bradick for the title
Cinderella man. Great movie. Yes. Maybe,

202
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,420
you know, he came from welfare
to be in a world champion.

203
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,580
That's the product story without
getting into it too much.

204
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,820
So are you a lose beats sporadic
and had to give a percentage,

205
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,170
you know, tanking and Aaron
might not been around then, but,

206
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,460
but the people that told them what
to do around taught them how to take

207
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,350
advantage of fighters, taught them how,

208
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:13,170
what options were before options
were ever known. You know, eh,

209
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,780
the Vladek I think, I forget his name,

210
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,890
but Braddock's manager basically made
Lewis and his people agree to give him a

211
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,960
percentage of his person for the rest
of his career to get the fight. Yeah.

212
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,190
Yeah. So I mean,

213
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,360
you could obviously research it and
look into how much percentage, Oh,

214
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,890
I don't know. I listened. I could say 10%,

215
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,990
but I don't want to say definitively
because I'm not positive, but,

216
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,970
but there was an understanding
that you know, you,

217
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:48,190
you're not getting a fight otherwise
you won't get the fight now. And listen,

218
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,790
like I said, you know, not great guys,

219
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,190
but King in Iram, uh, they,

220
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,950
they had other guys before them that
taught them some of these moves. Right.

221
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,780
You know, that Von is so nice,

222
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,430
but there's always a history
of good and bad. Sure. Always.

223
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,960
Who's good? Well, this, there's a

224
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,460
shining star promoter out there.
I'll try to think about it.

225
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,470
So we, so they go and they are,

226
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:24,430
he wins the title and of course
the biggest sport in the country.

227
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:29,140
So all the presses there and
there, Joel is the champion,

228
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:33,160
was not yet. Not yet.
What do you mean not yet?

229
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,060
Just one of the title. Not
yet. Not to. I beat that man.

230
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,780
He didn't even have to say his
name not to, I beat that man.

231
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,780
That's how much pride he had. And listen,

232
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,080
he's the real deal because it is mine.

233
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,080
How could I be champion of
a guy knocked me out? Right?

234
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,960
So when that fight took place, I mean,

235
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:58,790
you talk about ha, uh, setting
a stage, you know, the,

236
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,360
nowadays people say, Oh, I'm on a stage.
It's a lot of pressure, you know, Hey,

237
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:06,430
I'm not saying it's not, I'm not saying
it, but a lot of pressure, you know,

238
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:10,330
almost a lot of people look in, a lot
of people, you know, depending on, I,

239
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,510
I learned stuff going on,
you know, and I, you know,

240
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,490
maybe I got a headache,

241
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,970
but Joe Lewis had world
war two on horizon.

242
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,810
The president of the United States
called them up and you had Nazi Germany.

243
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,430
He had a guy named Hitler that that
is saying that he's got, you know,

244
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,010
the master race, it's going
to take over the world.

245
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:42,011
Just starting that stuff for not too far
away from world war II and you got all

246
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:47,621
that stuff permeating in the air
and you've got laws fighting.

247
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,600
A guy who of course, you know,

248
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,960
propaganda was started by the Germans,

249
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,580
if you want almost to me almost invented
that word because you had to propaganda

250
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,580
minister and you had all these terrible
people with Hitler that we're putting

251
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,081
out today.

252
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:06,530
The master race that is there that
you had to judge y'all win situation

253
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,400
Olympics. Yeah.

254
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,580
And now you had the biggest sport in
the biggest country and the champion of

255
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,970
that sport, the heavyweight
chair, Joe Lewis,

256
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,070
and he's fighting the German fighter
shearling the second time now for the

257
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,230
title. And of course you had

258
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,530
Hitler nor his psycho fans
or these people that were,

259
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,590
their job was to promote it, so to speak.

260
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,660
And they come and they're saying,

261
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,140
we will show the world that we're superior
and there's no better way to show it

262
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,790
then in a ring. And so Louis has to,

263
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,240
he's gotten, he's got to carry all
this stuff. I mean take about it.

264
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,330
And he's a black guy in a country that,

265
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,000
that he still can't go
into certain places.

266
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,810
T and he's got to carry the whole,

267
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,020
he's got to carry the whole
country and not let them down.

268
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:14,440
And the president calls, and again, we
don't know if there's a legendary story,

269
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,730
we don't know if it's completely true,
but supposedly the president called him,

270
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,920
said, Joe, you've got a windows
one for the good guys that that's,

271
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,400
that's one of the legends. I don't
know if it's true, but I know that,

272
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm sure he called him,

273
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,490
I'm sure he called them
and Louis has to go into,

274
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,310
it's gotta go into Yankee stadium
outdoors and in times square in New York,

275
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,850
they used to have it set up where they
would do radio because all the fight one

276
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:47,880
radio back then and some
of them on fights, on TV,

277
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:52,020
on select cavalcade sports and all
that stuff. Fight and I fight. But was,

278
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,520
was common along, you know, to stop
coming along. But radio was the thing.

279
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,100
And so in times square you had
the radio speakers outdoors

280
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,103
[inaudible]

281
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,790
you know, playing a fight broadcast in
the fight. So people out on the streets,

282
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,850
they hear the radio and a a, you know,

283
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,870
Joe Lewis is walking into
the ring and you know, and,

284
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,130
and you've got the Yankee stadium,

285
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,270
you've got to place full and you've got
the whole world of everything I just

286
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:26,700
described. The good, the
bad, the evil, the ugly,

287
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,330
everything. It's not a
movie, it's real life.

288
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,030
And you got Joe Lewis and he
gets in that ring in here,

289
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,650
Nile with all this pressure, wood,
wood that, that he's got to save the,

290
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,550
basically the United
States in a world from,

291
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,250
from looking like this, this ugly

292
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,360
scorch and, and, and disease
of the Nazi party is,

293
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,650
is going to take over.

294
00:18:55,651 --> 00:19:00,651
The world is greater than us and he and
he single handily has to prove that.

295
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,600
Okay.

296
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,050
And he, he goes in there and he
annihilates the guy in one round

297
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,060
[inaudible]

298
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,650
with all that stuff hanging over them.

299
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,660
I think that's the greatest single
event in the history of the world.

300
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,170
Pull that fighter, pull that fight
up and put it in the background.

301
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,150
And I think that diet,

302
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,450
when you talk about all the things
that we're here to talk about,

303
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,490
about character, about talent,
about presence, [inaudible],

304
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,250
about resiliency, about, about
caring, about more than yourself,

305
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,560
about selflessness.

306
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,740
Yeah,

307
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,940
about strength.

308
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,840
When you talk about all those things
that we try to say that we care about and

309
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:47,510
that we sometimes look to to be,

310
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,940
and very rarely can we be that

311
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,910
he was all that he was all of
that. And there it is right there.

312
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,660
I mean, how great is that?
And he stalked a guy.

313
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,140
He stalked a guy and his punches was
short and powerful and he was the greatest

314
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,480
finish in the history of heavyweight
boxing because when he hurts you,

315
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,600
you didn't survive. He got rid of you.

316
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:19,290
He put punches together and there was
short and he was always in position.

317
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,410
Look at his legs. He's always
in position. You move forward.

318
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,410
He takes a little step forward
back to give yourself rules.

319
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,510
Punches is absolutely beautiful.

320
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:31,440
If you wanted to teach a young fighter
how to punch correctly, Joe Lewis,

321
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,400
there's no better guy to watch than
cholo you saw. Did you see Joe,

322
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,240
what he did of our go? No a minute ago.

323
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,970
Smelling tried to catch them
with that same right hand.

324
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:45,450
He had knocked him out two years
earlier. Go back. They just missed it,

325
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,130
but he changed. He stepped out.

326
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,000
He changed his distance this
time because Jackie Blackburn,

327
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,950
who's a great fighter, a black
fighter, he was a trainer.

328
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,590
He was a great train and nobody hears
about Jackie Blackburn what a great

329
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,790
fighter he was and what a great trainee
was and how he wasn't allowed to fight

330
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,270
white fighters and he beat
everybody looked at cattle.

331
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,170
Love took instead of laying his head on
the right like he did the first fight,

332
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,080
he changed his range and he
made that right-hand miss.

333
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,360
Look how calm he is. Look how calm
he is. Look how focused he is.

334
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,790
It's beautiful. Watch shortness of
those punches. That's phenomenal.

335
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,770
I love watches legs. Joe. Watch. Watch
how he's always in position. Look at

336
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,060
what did we miss? What didn't
you see? Go back to sidestep. No,

337
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,460
the blinding jab that that sets it up.

338
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,830
We don't see what the
Jeb was just a Dick boy,

339
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,010
just so we can hit it with the
right so you don't see it. Right.

340
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,790
What a beautiful sidestep to right
after he lands a right hand. Beautiful.

341
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,840
Look at that. Well that's why he's the
greatest finish of all time. Watch,

342
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,630
watch, wait. He finishes this guy. What?

343
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,700
He's got to go to the body and the head.

344
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,320
Head to the body right ahead to
the head. Oh, that is so short.

345
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:02,770
And even when he's got the guy hurt,
look at the guy. Look at at phenomenal,

346
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,540
phenomenal.

347
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,440
And he did all of that with everything
we just talked about for the last 20

348
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,710
minutes hanging over him. Yeah.

349
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,600
He's a history that
people don't talk about,

350
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,350
but doesn't that make
you think a little bit,

351
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:20,800
doesn't it make you feel
something about us? Really? Yeah.

352
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:24,160
Well it's one of the reasons why I'm a
giants fan of the sport. Yeah. Thank you.

353
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,540
I mean that that alone is a, in
terms of like historical impact.

354
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,220
I agree with you. It's one of the biggest
moments in all of sports ever in life,

355
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:33,730
in life.
