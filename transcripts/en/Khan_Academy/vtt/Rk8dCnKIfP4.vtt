00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:04.336
Male 1: The whole period
of the American Revolution

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:06.534
and the establishment of the
country, of the government,

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:09.532
can get very muddled in people's minds.

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.280
What I was hoping we
could cover in this video

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.335
is unmuddle that, separate out the events

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.135
and see how they all fit together.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.537
Male 2: Let's start in 1775 because that's

00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:20.866
when the rebellion really
begins. That's when

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.412
you have the Battles of
Lexington and Concord

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:25.869
and Paul Revere riding
to say that the British

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.808
are coming. They started to rebel against

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:31.783
the taxes that Parliament
has but on us. They're

00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:34.467
not quite clear what the
rebellion is all about,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.190
especially those people
who aren't up there in

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.138
Massachusetts where the
rebels are happening.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.952
By 1776, that's when they
write the Declaration

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.773
that says here's what we're doing.

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:45.020
We're fighting a war of independence

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.203
and "let facts be submitted
to a candid world,"

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:50.948
here's why we're doing it.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:54.685
Then you get, you're fighting
the war, it's really not

00:00:54.685 --> 00:01:00.069
until 1781 that we win the
war. Around that period,

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.599
between 1776 and 1781,
they've drafted this thing

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.727
called the Articles of
Confederation. It's sort of

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:12.396
rules by which the States
are going to get together

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:16.013
and govern themselves. But
it doesn't really create

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.663
a new nation. It's
really just a federation

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:20.661
of the separate states.

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.264
Male 1: This is really around this idea

00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:25.359
the Declaration of
Independence is really, look,

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.264
we're already essentially
at war. This is why.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:29.925
This is articulating why we're at war,

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:33.139
what we actually believe in,
but that didn't establish

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.061
a government, it didn't
actually talk about

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.813
what kind of government it would be,

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:38.522
how it would govern
itself, so the Articles

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:40.935
were really this first
attempt at saying, well,

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.549
assuming that we're able to win this war

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.230
of independence, how do we set up?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.659
Male 2: Right. What they were during this

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.416
war of independence
were 13 separate states.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:54.583
They didn't really think
of themselves as one

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:56.454
new nation. Some people did. Ben Franklin

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.922
and others thought we
should really be a union

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.919
of one nation, but when
they get together to do

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.257
the Articles of
Confederation, really starting

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:08.515
right after the Declaration
is signed in 1776,

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:13.255
they finish writing it
in 1777, they write a

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.585
pretty uninspiring document that just says

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:18.917
we're from a whole lot of separate states

00:02:18.917 --> 00:02:22.516
and we're going to get
together a bit and be a union

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.193
of theses States, but
we're not going to give

00:02:24.193 --> 00:02:26.333
ourselves many powers as one government.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.988
Male 1: Yeah, we have
it right here. Actually,

00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:29.888
I'd never seen it before
this conversation.

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:31.194
I've obviously read about it when I was in

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:35.101
history class, but "To
all to whom these presents

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:37.523
"shall come, we the
undersigned Delegates of the

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.249
"States affix to our names send greeting."

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.719
Male 2: Oh, I mean it's like something

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.039
written by a bad template.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.989
Male 1: To whom it may concern! (laughs)

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.392
Male 2: It's not an inspiring document

00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:51.124
and it gives no power
to a central government.

00:02:51.124 --> 00:02:54.034
As you say, it's the
Delegates of the States.

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:56.199
They "affix our names"
to this and it's the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.459
Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.734
between these States.
One of the main things

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:06.326
they fail to do is give
the central government any

00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:10.517
taxation power. So really
it's up to the States

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:14.053
to tax, and then this
Congress that's meeting,

00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:16.477
based on the Articles
of Confederation, tries

00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:19.390
to beg each one of the
States, hey, requisition

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.475
us a little bit of
money so we can continue

00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:22.588
our business.

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:24.564
Male 1: The Federal,
the central government,

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.473
does not directly, there's
no Federal income tax,

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.901
or not any tax of any
kind, not even any kind of

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.105
tax. The States can tax
in whatever way they

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.989
see fit and then they
have to give something.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.641
Male 2: What's kind of
amusing is we win the

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.392
Revolution in the Battle of
Yorktown. That's in 1781.

00:03:40.392 --> 00:03:43.472
A messenger comes riding
into New York where

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:46.395
this Congress has been
meeting, it sort of floats

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.788
from city to city, and
gives them all the details

00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:51.988
and they don't even
have enough money to pay

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:53.658
the messenger. They have to reach in their

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:56.183
pockets to do it. So you
have this sort of poorly

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:59.389
written document called the
Articles of Confederation,

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.257
that seems to make a
confederation of States,

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:05.151
meaning we're going to
gather together but we're

00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:07.322
going to have our own
separate powers and doesn't

00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:10.477
given any taxation
powers. You have a kind of

00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:12.190
messy governance structure.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.325
Male 1: It's obviously
not a perfect analogy,

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:16.481
but if we take analogy
to present-day, it's

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.665
kind of what's happening
in Europe where there's

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.229
these separate nations,
separate States, that

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.561
are trying to form some
type of union, not clear

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.723
who has what power. The
Central European Union

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:29.792
is not directly taxing.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:33.873
Male 2: Precisely. That's
a very good analogy

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.973
to what was happening
because they weren't quite

00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:38.480
clear whether they had a
central currency or not

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.392
back then. They weren't
quite sure what are the

00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:44.121
powers of each of the
States versus the central

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:46.588
government, and that's
been something throughout

00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:49.450
history. Even starting
with the Greek city-states

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.988
where you can have confederations and it's

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:54.535
unclear how much power
you're going to put in the

00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:56.476
central government versus how much power

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:57.987
you're going to leave at the States.

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:00.479
Male 1: Considering that this is not the

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.987
governing document for us now, something

00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:04.657
must have broken to want to replace it.

00:05:04.657 --> 00:05:07.736
Male 2: Well, yes. By
the time you're getting

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:12.391
into 1786, it is totally clear that this

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.396
document isn't working. You have all sorts

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:17.874
of disputes. Like
Maryland and Virginia are

00:05:17.874 --> 00:05:20.797
having this horrible
dispute over navigation

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:24.262
and border rights. They
call an Annapolis Convention

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:28.559
to try to fix that up and they try to get

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.815
the States to come.
Only five of them come.

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:33.056
You have something up
in Massachusetts called

00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:35.789
Shays' Rebellion where there was this

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.273
rebellion of the poor farmers
in western Massachusetts

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:42.147
under a former Revolutionary War officer

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.851
named Daniel Shays. It's
sort of unclear what ...

00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:46.227
Male 1: His name was Shays?

00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:47.725
Male 2: Yeah. S-H-A-Y-S.

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:50.320
Male 1: So it's Shays,
the apostrophe's after ...

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.068
Male: The apostrophe's
after, yeah. Daniel Shays

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:55.870
was his name. He leads
a rebellion and there's

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.143
no central government to
send a force to stop them.

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:02.473
Washington's army has been disbanded.

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.068
So the poor people of
Massachusetts have to try

00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:07.576
to raise a militia to try
to stop Shays' Rebellion,

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.669
but they can't get the
Federal government to

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.605
step in. It was just one
of many, many symptoms

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:17.004
that we were all disintegrating
and falling apart.

00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:20.141
There was no rule of law that governed all

00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:22.940
the colonies, and now all the States.

00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:28.013
What happens is people
like Hamilton, Madison,

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.132
others get together
and say, you know what?

00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:33.170
Congress is meeting, I
think they were meeting

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.541
in New York by then.
We ought to go back to

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:40.344
Philadelphia where this all began in 1776

00:06:40.344 --> 00:06:42.312
with the Declaration of
Independence and we should

00:06:42.312 --> 00:06:46.136
have a Constitutional
Convention. We should

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:51.900
write a whole new constitution
to govern centrally

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.002
this new nation. Most of
the States agreed to come.

00:06:57.002 --> 00:06:59.500
Some of them worried
about the fact that we

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.227
were writing a whole new
constitution, so they

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.667
did not give their delegates
authority to get rid of

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.986
the Articles of
Confederation. So when they

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:10.284
began in that very hot summer of 1787,

00:07:10.284 --> 00:07:12.614
it was kind of unclear whether they were

00:07:12.614 --> 00:07:14.668
going to be able to
write a new constitution

00:07:14.668 --> 00:07:18.199
or just try to amend the old
Articles of Confederation.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.005
Male 1: This makes it
clear that even after

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.569
Shays' Rebellion, even after these border

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.900
disputes between Maryland
and Virginia, it still

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.591
wasn't a done deal. A
lot of States still liked

00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:29.145
their autonomy, liked their independence.

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:30.936
So even going into this,
it wasn't like everyone

00:07:30.936 --> 00:07:32.473
was unanimously saying
hey, we need to give the

00:07:32.473 --> 00:07:33.671
federal government more power.

00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.554
Male 2: And by the way,
what does that sound like?

00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:37.285
It sounds like the debates
we're having today.

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:38.365
Male 1: Exactly! (chuckles)

00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:40.593
Male 2: We still, as a
nation, have always had

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.554
these debates of how much
power should be given

00:07:42.554 --> 00:07:44.827
to the central government,
how much power should

00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:47.146
retain with the States, whether it's on

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:50.375
healthcare or our laws or our taxation.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:53.183
It's a useful tension to have.

00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:55.900
Male 1: Absolutely. Then they are able

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.939
to come up with a solution.

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:03.252
Male 2: It's a very
difficult problem of the

00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:06.676
big States wanting
there to be proportional

00:08:06.676 --> 00:08:09.521
representation in a
new Congress, the small

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.999
States wanting equal votes per State.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:14.141
You finally have Ben
Franklin again, once again

00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:16.815
being the person who
works out the compromise

00:08:16.815 --> 00:08:19.667
to have both a House and
a Senate, equal votes

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.527
per State in the Senate, proportional

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:23.744
representation in the House. They finally

00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:28.196
come together and they
all agree to line up

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:31.508
and sign this new
Constitution that will give

00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:34.254
taxation authority to
the Federal government,

00:08:34.254 --> 00:08:36.608
or to Congress, a new
Congress, a Federal taxation

00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:39.244
authority and, by the
way, that has a Preamble

00:08:39.244 --> 00:08:42.168
that's a whole lot more inspiring than

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:45.072
that Articles of Confederatin
thing-y that said,

00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:48.327
"To all to whom these
presents shall come."

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:49.910
Male 1: (laughing)To whom it may concern!

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.536
Male 2: Let's look at the
Preamble to the constitution.

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:56.533
Male 1: "We the people
of the United States."

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:59.297
That's as opposed to "To
whom it may concern."

00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.604
Male 2: Just look at
those first three words.

00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:04.508
I mean those first three words are totally

00:09:04.508 --> 00:09:07.151
an inspiring thing. It's
never been done before,

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:11.093
which is "We the people"
are getting to create

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.863
this Constitution. It's not
the States getting together

00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:16.404
to do it. It's not the
king devolving authority.

00:09:16.404 --> 00:09:17.945
It's not a Parliament doing it.

00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:21.994
It's "We the people"
gathered together here.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:25.064
We are the ones that are going to ordain,

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:28.218
a nice religious word
down there, "ordain."

00:09:28.218 --> 00:09:32.024
"Do ordain and establish."
It's almost like

00:09:32.024 --> 00:09:35.262
we have the power. It's
not coming from the

00:09:35.262 --> 00:09:38.341
divine right of kings
or God, we the people

00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:42.679
get to ordain and establish
this constitution.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.268
Male 1: We've made previous videos about

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:45.662
the Declaration of Independence.

00:09:45.662 --> 00:09:47.950
The Articles of Confederation in no way

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.074
share any of the spirit or the poetry of

00:09:51.074 --> 00:09:55.578
the Declaration, while this Preamble does.

00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:56.823
It seems almost a continuation of it.

00:09:56.823 --> 00:09:58.689
Male 2: Yeah, let's
read it. "We the people

00:09:58.689 --> 00:10:01.423
"of the United States,
in order to form a more

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:04.224
"perfect union." That's
a very transcendent

00:10:04.224 --> 00:10:06.341
phrase, but it also means, hey,

00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:08.480
the Articles of Confederation,
we weren't really

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.827
unified. We have to
create a united States.

00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:13.239
We have to create a union.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:15.784
Male 1: And the "more perfect," is that a

00:10:15.784 --> 00:10:17.601
direct reference to the
Articles that that was

00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:20.113
a less perfect, or is this something else?

00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:21.532
Male 2: It's not a very
good piece of grammar.

00:10:21.532 --> 00:10:24.419
As you know, things are
either perfect or they're not.

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:27.269
The notion of creating
a more perfect union,

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:30.509
yes, they are making
a nod to the fact that

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:32.945
we have been confederated under

00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:36.322
the Articles of Confederation, but now we

00:10:36.322 --> 00:10:38.739
have to create a more perfect union.

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.693
We have to really hold together.

00:10:40.693 --> 00:10:43.465
Then they decide what's the purpose of

00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:48.469
this Constitution? First
of all, establish justice.

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:51.604
That means there'll be
one common set of laws.

00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:55.338
Ensure domestic tranquility.
This is Shay's Rebellion.

00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:57.106
It's still going on when
they start writing this

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.672
Preamble. Domestic tranquility means that

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:04.081
the federal, the central
government, has a right

00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:08.546
to raise an army and that
in the end, the police

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:12.462
and defense powers don't
reside with just the

00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:14.977
individual States.
There's going to be a more

00:11:14.977 --> 00:11:18.918
perfect union that helps
ensure domestic tranquility

00:11:18.918 --> 00:11:22.777
and provide for the common
defense. What you've

00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:24.721
had is the Continental
Army under Washington

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.347
has been disbanded.
There's no way to raise

00:11:27.347 --> 00:11:30.126
taxes for a central army. Now we're saying

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:33.072
that the union of States,
the United States,

00:11:33.072 --> 00:11:36.012
the federal government,
they're going to raise

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:38.060
the money and provide
for the common defense.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.965
There's another phrase,
"promote the general welfare."

00:11:40.965 --> 00:11:43.258
When people argue about Contitutionalism

00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:44.880
and what gives the Federal government the

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.861
right to do things,
one of those phrases is

00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:50.355
every now and then we have to use the

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:52.797
"general welfare" phrase
and say whether it's

00:11:52.797 --> 00:11:55.539
healthcare or anything
else, maybe there are

00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:58.196
things the central
government does that promote

00:11:58.196 --> 00:12:01.250
the "general welfare." Then we get to the

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.228
inspiring lines, the poetry as opposed to

00:12:04.228 --> 00:12:07.481
"To all whom these presents shall come."

00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:11.311
That's "secure the blessings of liberty to

00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:14.721
"ourselves and our posterity, we do ordain

00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:17.255
"and establish this Constitution of the

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:20.061
"United States of America." We've been

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:21.799
calling ourselves that ever since the

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:24.133
Declaration of Independence,
but now it's in

00:12:24.133 --> 00:12:27.548
all caps and it's
signifying we're one nation,

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:29.624
not just 13 different States.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.695
Male 1: Previously I think
the "U" wasn't capitalized.

00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:33.659
Man 2: Yeah, in some of
the earlier documents

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:35.976
it wasn't and we
certainly were not united.

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:39.591
It's only under this Constitution
do we become, really,

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:42.133
the United States of America.
