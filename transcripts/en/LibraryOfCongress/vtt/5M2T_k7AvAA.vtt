&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.010
&gt;&gt; Carlos Olave: On behalf of the
Hispanic Division I'm very pleased

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.270
to welcome you all to this lecture.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.400
I want to thank Talia
Guzman-Gonzales,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.170 position:56%
our [inaudible] Brazilian specialist
for organizing this event.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.720
And now I'm delighted
to introduce you

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.680
to our researcher, Mariana Joffily.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.140
Professor Joffily holds
a post-doctorate degree

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.420
from the Federal University
of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.190
She has an undergraduate and
PhD degree from the University

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.130
Of San Paolo Brazil
and a master's degree

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.850
from University Paris La Sorbonne.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.340
Professor Joffily is
a [inaudible] scholar.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
She's a professor of the
postgraduate program in history

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.250
in the Department of History at the
State University of Santa Catarina,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.830
Florianopolis, Santa
Catarina, Brazil.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.110
In 2008 she was a lecturer
in the history department

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.390
of the state university
of Santa Catarina.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.120 position:56%
She has also taught history
courses at both the state university

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.640
and the federal university
of Santa Catarina.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.800
And she has authored two books,
both of which the Library

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.630
of Congress holds and a
variety of articles all related

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.240
to her areas of research.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.930
And she has received numerous
grants, honors, and fellowships.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.510
So without further ado I'd like
to welcome Professor Joffily.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.120
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.770
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Good
afternoon, I want to start

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.660
by thanking the Hispanic Division
for the opportunity to be here

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.350
in the person of Georgette Dorn
and also in the person of Carlos.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.490
And I would like to thank
also the extremely kind

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.180
and professional staff of the
Hispanic division and particularly,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.820
I'd like to thank Talia who not
only invited me to give this talk,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.300
but also pushed me to do so.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.820
And of course, I want to thank
each one of you who took the time

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.900
to come here today and I'm very
honored with your presence.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.700
Mario Quintana who was an extremely
graceful Brazilian poet once said I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.970
quote, the past doesn't know
its place it's always present.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.960
I'd like to start by
reflecting on the importance

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.630
that the Brazilian military
dictatorship has in the present

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.000
and I will mention
a very recent event.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
As you know, the Brazilian House
of Representatives voted last month

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.380
for the impeachment of
President Dilma Roussef.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.270
One deputy, Jay [inaudible], whose
political career has been devoted

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.210
to the most conservative causes
dedicated his vote to the commander

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.830
of a torture agency where some
decades ago the president,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.480
a former guerrilla fighter,
was detained and tortured.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.090
This astonishing declaration
outraged many sectors

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.820
of the Brazilian society
and produced a massive wave

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.000
of denunciation before the
federal prosecutor office.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.160
It was an isolated manifestation
as were the public demonstrations

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.520
of a group of people that
went to the streets advocating

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.520
for a military regime to solve the
ongoing Brazilian political crisis.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.840
It gives, however, a sense of
the presence in the public debate

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.290
of the sensible subject of
the military dictatorship.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.480
The National Truth Commission
created by Roussef in 2012 in order

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.310
to investigate the
human rights violations

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.530
that took place during the military
rule also exposed the presence

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.900
of this past that insists
on being present.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.510
The recommendations of the
Truth Commission leave no doubts

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.700
that even though the
country has been living

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.680
under a Democratic
regime since the middle

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.810
of the 80's there are some
significant legacies left

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.520
by the dictatorship.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.840
Among others, the National
Security Law, the militarization

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.870
of the police, and the spread
of torture in police stations.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.500
It is about this past that we
are still trying to overcome

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.450
that I want to talk today.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.030
How to interpret hundreds
of political interrogations.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.250
That was the main challenge I
faced when I started the research

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.250
for my PhD dissertation
that became this book.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.570
At the time my ambition
was to understand the logic

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.410 position:56%
of learning political torture during
the Brazilian military dictatorship

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.900
that took place from 1964 to 1985.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.060
I was less interested in the
perspective of the victims,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.030
although naturally it
was taking into account

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.730
than in the perpetrators.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.250
They didn't document the
methods of torture they applied.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.910
Nor did they explain why they
considered an irreplaceable

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.790
instrument in the fight
against communism or subversion.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.220
Yet for professional
purposes they did register

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.380
in a very methodic
way the interrogations

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.820
of political prisoners,
which were often conducted

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.630
with the use of torture.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.740
The political interrogations
[inaudible] represented an

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.390
available resource.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.200
Since the 60's Brazilian military
officers had been in contact

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.100
with the French theories

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.010
on Revolutionary war developed
during the independence wars

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.220
in Indochina and Algeria,
Indochina and Nigeria.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.170
They were also familiar
with the US doctoring

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.950
of national security formulated
in the context of the Cold War,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.410
as well as with the
counterinsurgency methods using the

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.630
Vietnam War.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.780 position:56%
Both placed information at the heart

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.400
of the struggle against
internal enemy.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.200
Be the ones who fought
for independence

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.810
in a colonized country
the communists

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.950
or even people demanding profound
social and economical changes,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.800
the so-called subversives.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.920
Interrogates were the core of
political repression and represent

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.940 position:56%
in a certain way a condensed view of
the struggle between the repression

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.160
and the political dissidents.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940
But there are treaty
documents to analyze.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.820
I soon realized that in them it was
as much about giving information

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.270
as hiding it behind silence,
lies, and diversions both

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.310
from the will interrogators
and for the detainees.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.540
As one historian puts it, documents

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.810
from the political police
mask as much as they reveal.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.710
It was particularly
troubling to find

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.060
out that the interrogations
did not contain the questions

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.260
or the interrogators' names.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.130
Reading them I had much more
the impression of being immersed

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.830
in the left-wing militant's
universe than in the interrogators.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.290
As for the most part the
interrogations were accounts

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.910
of the detainees and
their comrades' actions.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.970
The feeling that I had at the
time was that I was looking at --

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.060
sorry, the feeling I had at
the time was that I was looking

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.750
at what the document's
finger was pointing

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.460
at when what I actually wanted

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.020
to understand was what
was behind that finger.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.870
Available methodology
co-strategy to reach the universe

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.630
of the repressive agents beyond
reading between the lines was

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.470
to consider the transcription
of the interrogations not

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.360
as an accurate record
of the detainee's words,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.270
but as a conscious act that
had to be taken into account.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.170
A social psychologist has a
precise way of describing this.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:43.990
He claims that public documents are
I quote, simultaneously features

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.950
of the social action and
the social action itself.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.130
Therefore, even though the
only thing we can have access

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.390
to is the document, the record of
the action, we need to keep in mind

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.440
that it has this double dimension.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.900
It is evidence of the action that
generated it and the expression

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.040
of how that action was documented.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.100
The military government when it was
impossible to deny the existence

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.950
of torture utilized
multiple times the argument

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.950
of occasional [inaudible] or of
cruelty of specific individuals.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.300
The same explanation was offered by
the US Embassy as we can now read

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.460
in the documents recently
released by the US authorities

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.560
to the Brazilian Truth Commission.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.980
As the US supported the
military coup provided military

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.950
and police training and was very
close to the Brazilian government.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.250
When the news about the use

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.140
of torture spread abroad
the US Embassy explain it

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.910
in terms of isolated cases.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.040
Nevertheless, during the Brazilian
military dictatorship torture was

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.340
a system.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.980
The link between interrogations

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.060
and torture was established
unsurprisingly by the victims.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.340
Yet, reading the interrogations
we can observe

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.990
that the sessions happened
anytime of the day or of the night.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.030
That they happen even
in military hospitals

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.360
and that sometimes they
were interrupted due

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.090 position:56%
to the detainee's health conditions.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:32.070
Despite the level of mobilization
of the social movements in the 60's

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.330
when the military took power they
did not face any real resistance.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.850 position:56%
Many authors point out that most
clandestine left-wing organizations,

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.560
particularly the ones that
preached guerrilla tactics

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.050
as their main strategy were created

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.230
to compensate the lack
of immediate response.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.440
Right after the coup in 1962, there
was a first wave of repression

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.260
with a massive number of arrests
sometimes followed by torture,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.890
removals from office,
and interventions

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.450
in [inaudible] and public agencies.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.440
However, the accounts
of a more directed

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.870
and sophisticated violence
did not arise

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.790
until the military rule hardened

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:24.100
with the institutional act
number 5 dictated in 1968

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.870
that opened the doors
for much more structured

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.970
and radical political repression.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:35.440
The act concentrated so much
power in the executives' hands

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.400
that some scholars consider
it a coup inside the coup.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.970 position:56%
The formation of military agencies
specialized in political persecution

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.700
with a [inaudible] of specialists
trained in interrogation methods,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.970
including torture, started in 1969.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.570 position:56%
Obviously, torture existed in
Brazil long before the military rule

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:04.370
and the county had experienced a
dictatorship under Getulio Vargas

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.590
that was very harsh on
political activists.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.210
During the military
dictatorship, however,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.000
a repressive apparatus was
built by the Armed Forces

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.570
that until then hadn't been
involved in political repression.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.610
As some clandestine left-wing
groups started to organize actions

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.420
against military dictatorship
the Army created the [inaudible]

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:35.560
in San Paolo in 1969
as an experiment.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.460
It assembled agents from
the different police

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.640
and military forces
specializing itself

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.210
in persecuting political dissidents

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.370
and centralizing the efforts
in political repression.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.650 position:56%
The operation was effective in
obtaining information about how some

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.810
of the left-wing organization
operated

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:00.110
and in destroying some
of their bases.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:05.220
Considered a huge success in
1970 it was institutionalized

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.390
by two new agencies, the Detachment

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:14.130
of Information Operation whose
acronym DIO means it hurts,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.720
responsible for the arrests, the
interrogations, and the analysis

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.870
of the collected information.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:27.360
And the Center of Operation on
Internal Defense COID responsible

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.120
for coordinating the operations.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.730
The two together known as
the [inaudible] were spread

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.860
to the capitals of the
main Brazilian states.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.020
The [inaudible] system was created
from secret directives elaborated

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:49.290 position:56%
by the National Security Council and
approved by the president himself.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:56.210 position:56%
The functioning of these agencies
was based on the dichotomy legality,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.810
which gave them [inaudible]
and flexibility.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.910
With regard to its foundations,
the dichotomy was anchored

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.850
in the solid structure of the Army

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.180
with full support of
the upper ranks.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:15.560 position:56%
The methods employed torture, home
invasion, kidnapping, disappearance,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.000
murder were illegal even within the
logic of authoritative [inaudible]

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.380
by military dictatorship.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.690
Although used with the consent

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:32.420 position:56%
of the hierarchy it was not publicly
admitted because of the damage

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.530
that it would cause to the image
of military and government forces.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.780
The solid logistical support
combined with implicit permission

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.170 position:56%
to act clandestinely and, therefore,

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.720
without accountability
enabled the agency

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.310
to enjoy great freedom of action.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.420
The interrogations reproduced
this by repressive agencies

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:00.200
that combine both the expertise
of the civil police in the art

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.030
of questioning and the
discipline of the military

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.070
under the command of the latter.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.160
The combination of skills was made,
however, under a mutual prejudice.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.360
For the civil the military
lacked experience in a field

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.860
that they had worked in for
many years, weren't prepared

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.370
to perform investigations, and
possessed little [inaudible]

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.480
or political sensitivity.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.920
The military in turn considered the
police in general to be corrupt,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.460
incompetent, dishonest, and lazy.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.080
The army made use of police
officers to take advantage

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.200
of their accumulated expertise,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.910
but also to avoid employing large
amounts of military personnel

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.730
in an attempt to minimize damaging
their image due to the involvement

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.910
of the institution
with internal security.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.760
The framework of the corporation
between the security forces

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.950
and the military was well-defined.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:12.100 position:56%
The police officers bore the cost
of the numerical and symbolic burden

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.120
of the methods employed
by the agency.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.770
The military was in charge
of the decision-making

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.140
and commanding the operations.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.880 position:56%
It is worth mentioning that when
some of the former military officers

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.560
from [inaudible] gave
their testimony

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.650
at the Truth Commission two
or three years ago they said

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.020
that it was only the civic
police that employed torture.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:43.250
Over time the conditions
they work under contributed

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.780 position:56%
to establishing a favorable claimant
for the creation of a team spirit

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.530
in the dichotomy at grandma's
house as the [inaudible]

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.740
of San Paolo was called
by its members.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.380
Safety standards required the
use of civilian [inaudible]

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.350
and forbade military haircuts,
even for the officers.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.420
The operations and activities were
carried out in complete secrecy

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.420
and the use of nicknames
was required.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:17.440
When someone was suspected
of subversive activities he

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.570
or she was arrested and
interrogated under torture.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.020
Once the agents of the
[inaudible] were convinced

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.390
that they had extracted all the
information they could have the

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.670
detainee was sent to another
repressive agency responsible

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.650 position:56%
for the formal criminal persecution.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.020
There an official interrogation
was made and it had

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.240
to match the previously
obtained information.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.730
The interrogations could
happen anytime day or night,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.320
they could last minutes or hours

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.480
and produce one [inaudible]
sentence something like declares

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.800
that had said everything not
having anything else declared

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.870
or a few pages and pages.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.640
The information contained in
the detainees' statements had

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.420
at least three distinct purposes.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.660
The first and most urgent
consisted in locating the enemy.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.580
It was about knowing the militants'
identities, scandal rendezvous

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.040
and the location of their hideouts.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.800
The places where materials
and documents

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.460
of the organization were
kept, where the planning

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.830
of future actions was
made, meetings were held,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.540
and militants were housed.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.300 position:56%
Using this information other
militants were located maintaining a

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.110
chain of false arrests and
allowing the seizure of all sorts

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.660
of materials propaganda,
weapons, ammunition,

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.600
money, and internal documents.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.760
The second objective was
related to knowing the enemy.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.350
Aiming at foreseeing
their next steps

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.750
and intercepting their activities.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.110
The interrogators often inquired
about the organization's structure,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:08.670
the functions associated with each
position, the strategies employed

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.750 position:56%
to obtain funds and weapons, and how

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.490
and by whom the actions
were planned.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:20.700
The third goal concerned legal
punishment, it was important

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.210
to assess how much the
opponents were involved

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.430
with political activities,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.210
how strong their conviction
was laying the basis

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.630
for the judiciary stage

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:36.290
of the political repression
performed by military justice.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.040
The interrogators sought
to distinguish

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.710
between the useful
innocent and the fanatics.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.620
[Inaudible] through former
commander of the [inaudible]

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.220
of Rio de Janeiro describes
these categories as follows.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.120
The first were the [inaudible] whom

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.460
when leaving prison the
parents tried to remove

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.500
from the organization
and they allow it.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.460
The second time the
[inaudible] were according

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:13.080
to him very well-structured,
very resentful and only thought

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.600
about their return, the payback.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.730
When released they returned
to their terrorist group.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:27.470
The first category was considered
recoverable, the second was not.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.200
Political crime in the view

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.660 position:56%
of the repression was different form
common crime in at least two ways.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.440
It was much more disruptive to
the society as the main goal was

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.470
to reverse the social structure and
it was usually committed by people

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.110
with high formal or
political education.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.320
The statement is based on a
very interesting case I found

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.700
of a suspected drug dealer that
was turned over to the [inaudible]

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.740 position:56%
because when the police searched his
home they found a letter that seemed

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.890
to contain coded information
because the suspect had

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.870
in quotes subversive books.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.480
So the suspicion of
subversion was more alarming

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.940
than that of drug trafficking.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:22.560
Another curious case is that of a
man that was dating a young lady.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.190
Her mother did not approve
of their relationship

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.170
because the man was divorced.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.110
She denounced him repeatedly
to the police,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.470
but as he was released every
time she tried to denounce him

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.560
as a subversive knowing that it was
an accusation much more difficult

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.040
to get rid of.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.360
What constituted a challenge
to the military rule was

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.970
that the intelligence
community was not fighting

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.760
against the usual targets
of the police forces.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.840
Poor people, welfare
descendants, migrants,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.940
but against the well-educated
sons and daughters of the middle

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.910
and sometimes upper classes.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:08.210
Torture commonly used as a form
of social control most often

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.190 position:56%
by the police affecting the lower
classes extended this time its scope

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.870
to the political arena.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.330
For torture to be used as a
recurring method it is necessary

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.600
to dehumanize the target
creating a sense of otherness

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.490
that makes the interrogator

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.300
when confronting his victim lose
his usual reactions towards other

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.290
human beings.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.510
When regarding individuals from
the most disadvantaged classes

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.830
to process that creates
a point of view

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:45.310 position:56%
that does not recognize the other as
an equal comes from a long tradition

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.220
of social exclusion whose roots
can be found in the institution

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:54.310
of slavery and the
extermination of native people.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.190
Now surprisingly, currently most
of the victims of police torture

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.550
and executions by the
police are often dissidents.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:05.420
When it comes to individuals
belonging

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.520
to the higher social strata
students, professionals, religious,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.700
military the marginalization
was achieved by the construction

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.210 position:56%
of the subject as a subversive and a
terrorist, the enemy of the nation,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.410
the family, and the Western
and Christian values.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.420
The danger attributed to the
subject seems to be the key

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.410
to understanding what
brought down the immunity

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.970
of the middle class
to torturing Brazil.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.440
The class allegiance in this
case was broken by the fact

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.860
that individuals who enjoyed
privileged social conditions were

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.740
turning against what should
be their own class interests.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.560
In this circumstances
the [inaudible] agreement

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.900
between the middle class and the
elite of the Brazilian society

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.900
to work together to
promote social restraint

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.570
against the disadvantaged sectors
was broken by these individuals

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.010
who decided to fight alongside
the [inaudible] in an attempt

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.350
to subvert the established
power system.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:18.620
Despite of the conditions of
detainment, the dramatic conditions

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.550
of detainment and torture
there was resistance.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.270
The strategies of each
individual before the violence

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.110
of the interrogators varied
greatly depending on the situation

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.790
and the degree of physical
and psychological resistance

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.490
of the political prisoner.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.840 position:56%
Some militants say that it was
important to build a story and stick

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.770
to it, which was extremely
hard as they were teams

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.790
of intelligence analysts that
started the interrogations

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.110
and compared its transcriptions
day-by-day.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.280
It was important to remember the
details of the story told in order

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.230
to hide sensitive information.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.860
Dilma Roussef who was
imprisoned and tortured

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.240
by the [inaudible] described how
this prodigious game was played.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:16.710 position:56%
I quote, the game is never to reveal
to the interrogator what you think.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.870
He cannot know that you think and
he can never think that you want

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.410
to talk after being beaten never.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.680
You better not let him acknowledge

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.270
that he takes information
from you by torture.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.510
You need to have a story.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.810
The bag thing is when your
story collapses for any reason.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:43.750
If he thinks that you lied you lost
it, he found out what the games is.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.990
End of quote.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.200
Unfortunately, it was not just

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.460
about keeping a solid story the
less interrogators knew the greater

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.320
possibilities to fool them.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.140
Inversely, the more
information they accumulated

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.770
from different sources
the harder it was

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.510
to create an explanation
that you'd believe.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.780
Examination of the interrogations
give a glimpse of some

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:14.330
of the strategies the interrogators
found themselves confronted with.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.800
Some examples are I quote
from the interrogations.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.700
Rectifying parts his previous
statements the detainee clarifies

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.330
that you needed many facts in order

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.630
to avoid [inaudible]
elements he had met and up

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.000
until then were not pointed
out in previous statements.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.500
The next example is about
a political detainee

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.130
that I had later the
pleasure to meet in person.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:46.860 position:56%
He was in possession of the keys and
knew the position of the apartment

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.230
where one of the most
wanted left-wing leaders

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.790
at the time was hiding.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.340
He didn't say anything until the
day when the interrogators found

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:02.960
out by another detainee that he
was interested with this task.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.700
Asked why he had not said
anything he answered simply

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.190
because I was not asked about it.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.550
The last example is a
quote from a note written

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.780
by the interrogators themselves

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.680
after having confronted
two detainees.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.690
I quote note, in the face
of the absurd negatives

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.290 position:56%
by the despondent this interrogation
team wants to make clear

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:35.600
that this element is insolent,
incoherent, cynical and untruthful.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.070
And that even in the
phase of evidence

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.040
as to the facts concerning
him denies them

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.240
with the greatest cynicism
and [inaudible].

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.730
End of quote.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.120
The comments of the interrogators
expose their only weakness.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.820
The fact that even under torture
sometimes a detainee refused

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.000
collaborate keeping from them the
information they wanted so badly.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.910
In those cases the
violence of torture was not

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:11.020
in quotes useful boiling down to
pure cruelty and in a scenario

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.490
that was supposed to
be extremely favorable

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.410
to the interrogators
their defeat was immense.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:24.820
A conservative Brazilian
bishop once said I quote,

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.620
you don't get confessions
giving out chocolate candy.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.260
Yet I claim that the use of
torture was not exclusively

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.180 position:56%
about extracting useful information.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:41.050
I came across situations where the
person was not even able to talk

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.250
because of the torture
he had suffered.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.060
In a different case, a
commander asked his subordinates

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.700
to get the detainee
during an interrogation

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.680
because his screams were being
heard in the neighborhood.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.250
There are also complaints
about the use of violence

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.790
without any questions being asked.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.330
One interesting sorry,
one interesting piece

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.860
of evidence regarding this is that
we often read in what were supposed

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.020
to be faithful descriptions

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.700
of the detainees' declarations
expressions typically used

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:24.850 position:56%
by the repressive agents that are
recognizable, recognizably different

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.870
from the vocabulary
of the militants.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.770
Things for example an
interrogation where a student

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.860
of medicine belonging to the
communist party that had taken care

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.490
of a guerrilla fighter is
reported to have said that the help

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.280
that he gave to the and I
quote, infamous terrorist.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.960
Well, it's hard to believe
that he would have in part

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.320
such terms to talk about a comrade.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.110
It is not just about
using certain expressions

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.150
as the interrogator's logic was
sometimes itself appropriated

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.450
by the detainee.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:05.030
We cannot assert whether it was
a strategy to escape torture

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.340
or an expression of sincere regret.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.350
I found some interesting
cases as I quote,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.010
I acknowledge having been a
full for keeping the material

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.510
without knowing what it was.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:23.470
Or I quote, declare that was
totally diluted by his friend.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.970
Or even more striking I
paraphrase, stated that he was glad

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.050
to have been arrested now

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:36.810
because otherwise he could have
committed further to the movement.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.160
Many detainees denounced
that they were forced

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.980
to sign confessions whose content
comprised elements they had

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.280
not expressed.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.490
Regardless to the [inaudible] of
torture as a means to force people

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:55.450
to talk its use was not officially
recognized by the government.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.970
Creating a flagrant ambiguity
between the glorification

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:05.770
of the military government and its
sordid practice of law enforcement.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.490
Carlos [inaudible], the commander
of [inaudible] of San Paolo,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.590
the one recently celebrated
by the deputy's vote

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.880
for the impeachment published
two books about the dichotomy

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.770
and made an inflammatory
speech when forced

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.550
to attend to the Truth Commission.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:27.640
He never not even once
recognized publicly

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.020
that the agency he
ruled employed torture.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.560
This dichotomy between discourse
and practice extended [inaudible]

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.530
of the interrogators both by
hiding an action that did not need

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.160
to be accountable to society
and by the complicity created

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.690
between the repressive
agents and their superiors

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.180
in maintaining illegality.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:56.900 position:56%
A journalist wrote that torture was
a piece of the political game rather

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.310
than an investigative tool.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:05.430 position:56%
He's right in the sense that its use
was a result of a political choice

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.940
and not an act of individuals.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.770
Nonetheless, being considered
a quick and effective means

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.660
of investigation the interrogation
under torture was adopted

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.380
as the main method of
identifying activities labeled

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.030
as political crimes.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.040
This choice was not an
invasion having [inaudible]

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.080
in the inquisitorial practices
of the Brazilian police based

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.760
on the confession extracted by
force from suspected criminals.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.660
This technique produced quick
results with loud financial cost,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.520
although in the long-term it
presents a very high moral

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.790
and political price.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.220
The investigative paradigm
that employs torture

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.510
as its main tool carries a paradox.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.840
While it should be about
investigating facts it helps

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.500
to generate [inaudible]
versions because the collection

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.970
of information in this
context is inseparable

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.560
from the submission of the victim.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.140
The detainee under
torture might say anything

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.520
to escape the pain be
it the truth or what he

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.790
or she supposes the
interrogators want to hear.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.280
The perverse aspect of the
situation lies in the fact

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.430
that to some extent the
burden of denouncing someone

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:34.240
who will probably also be
tortured is carried by the detainee

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.070
for not being able to endure,
although it is a result

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.680
of the brutal means used
by the interrogators.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.070
The logic established

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:48.780
by the interrogators protects
them of our accountability.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.160
If the detainee does
not speak he deserves

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.200
to be beaten to reveal
what he knows.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:01.750
If he provides the information
he's a traitor to his own ideology.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:06.240
The aspect of submission
is repeatedly mentioned

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.770
in the denunciations made
by the political prisoners

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.070
at the military justice trials.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.090
In one of those accounts
a militant explained.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.520
I paraphrase, that in the
[inaudible] he has undergone

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.900
such treatment that his
psychological resilience

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.260
to deny the facts that they wanted

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.300
to impute him was reduced
to nothing.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.500
A similar statement was
made by a sympathizer

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.060
of the left-wing organization.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.220
I quote, she read the
mentioned statement

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.570
and disagree entirely
with its content.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.540
If she signed it, it was because
she was emotionally depressed

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.470
and thereby would have signed
even her death sentence.

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.590
The question that arises

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:00.770
when employing torture beyond
all moral objections is

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.230
that there is no identifal sorry,
identifiable [inaudible] line

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.350
between the refusal
to provide information

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.660
and the actual impossibility
of doing so.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.180
Thus we run through this
fear of extralegal punishment

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.330
where not only do the interrogators
anticipate a possible penalty

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.960
as they elevate it from the
deprivation of liberty to violation

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.140
of the detainee's physical
and psychological integrity.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.710
The punishment function

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.890
of the torture explains
how the transmission

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.640
of information is sometimes
obstructed or frustrated

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.850
by the very physical abuse.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.300
And also why some political
prisoners declare having been

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.660
tortured without even being
asked about their activities.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:59.570
To counteract a possible future
release by the military justice,

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.490
which was conservative
but [inaudible].

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:07.360
For lack of legal proof the
punishment was often granted

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.430
by the dichotomy.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.710
Moreover, beyond the direct
victims of torture the effects

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.530
of such violence were addressed
to the society as a whole

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:22.870
in another function of torture to
inhibit political participation,

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.560
particularly political dissidents.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.240
Inside the intelligence community
the justification for the use

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:36.790 position:56%
of coercive methods was based on its
efficacy and on a perpetual transfer

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.840
of the moral burden to
the left-wing militants.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.020 position:56%
Indeed, when we read the depositions
that repressive agents gave

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.750
to the Truth Commission or their
published interviews we quickly

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:55.140
observe how their discourse
is always viewed on a reaction

00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.050
to what they consider
to be a serious threat.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.730
They do not feel they
bear responsibility

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.640
since they were responding
to an external [inaudible].

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.070
The use of torture went as we
see far beyond the collection

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.400
of information.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.100
It served multiple purposes.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.560
To terrorize all those who
could possibly consider joining

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.740
or even helping the
left-wing organizations,

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.420
to destroy the clandestine
organizations,

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.220
to punish the left-wing activists,

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.790
to make the detainees change
their mind by affirming

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:34.480
through extremely violent
methods the political perspective

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.000
of the military dictatorship.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.610
Though the military authorities
repeatedly claim they were acting

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.770
in defense of liberty and
democracy the society they dreamed

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.680
of was conservative
ordered and authoritarian.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.880
A society where each individual
should limit him or herself

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.320
to his or her assigned role.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.560
The student should worry
about his studies and career,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.980
women should take care
of their families,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.230
workers should work,
priests should pray.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.900
The social and economical
boundaries should be respected

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.460
and the political matters should
be taken care of by the elite.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.960
I want to conclude by Harry
Shue [assumed spelling],

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.350
a professor of politics
and international relations

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.150
at the University of Oxford.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:30.340
Debating the classic ticking
bomb hypothetical case,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.150
the one in which there is a ticking
bomb in a school full of children

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:38.320
and the only way to prevent a
huge disaster is to make the one

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.220
who knows the bomb's
placement confess its location.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.860
Shue argues about the impossibility

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.210
to improvise torture
even to save lives.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:55.630
I quote, successful torturers
must avoid sympathy and empathy

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.500
or they will go too easy.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.280
But they must also avoid anger and
cruelty or they will go too hard

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.200
and merely knock the victim
senseless or drive him

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.640
into a dissociative state
and learning nothing useful

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.720
for the prevention of catastrophe.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.570
Torture is not for amateurs.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.670
Successful torturers
need to be real pros

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.100
and no one becomes a pro overnight.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.610
At a minimum one must
practice, perhaps do research,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.240
be mentored by the
similar experience.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.510
In short, torture needs a
bureaucracy with apprentices

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:41.180
and experts of the kind that
torture in fact, always has.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:46.490
[Inaudible] that was not an
independent consultant torture is

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.830
an institution.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.640
End of quote.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.390
What I wanted to show you
here today was the glimpse

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:57.290
of how the bureaucracy
Harry Shue talks

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.180
about was constituted
and how it operated.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.720
The Brazilian rule established
torture as a state policy.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.770
What required infrastructure,
training,

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.720
logistics, expert legal protection.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:18.910 position:56%
In the transition to democracy the
amnesty law of 1979 granted impunity

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.940
for torturers and for
their superiors.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:27.660
In 2010, the Supreme Court
reaffirmed this impunity rejecting

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.800 position:56%
the order of attorneys of Brazil's
request to interpret the amnesty law

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.110
from the perspective
of the Constitution.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:40.660
We as a society pay a high
cost for these choices

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.810
for impunity is an obstacle to
the punishment of state agents

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.670
that nowadays tortures suspects
from the [inaudible] classes.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:56.270
And I finish quoting
Mario Quintana once more.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:02.290
[Inaudible] we live in the fear
of the future, but it's the past

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.940
that runs over and kills us.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.740
Thanks for your attention.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:14.230
[ Applause ]

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:20.560
&gt;&gt; There is time for some
questions, so jump in.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.450
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you because
I think it's a great speech,

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:36.320 position:56%
have really touched me because
we've seen and we live in a past war

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.850
and that we have the
[inaudible] and that's not true.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:48.190
We are really living under the
fear that the [inaudible] no voice.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:55.170
And I want to thank you to voice
and also ask you if you think

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.320
that all these voices [inaudible].

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:06.830
You are not playing with the
problem, you are not going

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.130
to have problems [inaudible]?

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Wow, I hope not.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.970
Well, we live under a democracy
regime that elected a president

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:17.860
who was imprisoned and tortured.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.100
So if she can be a president
I don't think why I should be

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.610
in jail for saying what I say.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:32.190
So it's true that sometimes we are
a little bit concerned when working

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.610
with this kind of topic

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.550
because there are some
individuals that are still there.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:42.440
And I don't know if you're aware
of it, but recently military

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:48.400
that said many things
about the repressive system

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.210
in Brazil he was murdered
and no one explained how

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.690
and why and it's unexplained.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:06.600
But I don't think that
it's that dangerous I hope.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.650
&gt;&gt; A life is a dungeon.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that's it.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.550
So yeah, I'd rather do
the thing [inaudible]

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.690
than live a free life yeah.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:26.070
&gt;&gt; I would like to thank you
as well, this is really great

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.300
that you're bringing your
story here, especially here.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.530
And linking to it a little bit
what she's saying about the danger

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:43.060 position:56%
of doing these things [inaudible] to
where those [inaudible] to Brazil,

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.360
Latin Americas [inaudible].

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.060
And if you are I don't know
if everybody [inaudible].

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:53.870 position:56%
With the School of the Americas back
in the 60's [inaudible] in Panama

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:58.180
and now it's here in
Georgia and still has

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:03.850
in training military
tactics and territory tactics

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.010
in Fort Benning in
Columbia, Georgia.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:10.680
And we still have people there,
Brazil still have people there

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.560
and many other countries
[inaudible].

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.090
So if you're doing
this relationship,

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:22.980
this connection between,
you know, the US training

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:28.460
that the dictators [inaudible],
how do you [inaudible]

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.760
with the possible [inaudible].

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.820
Because it's still a
problem, it still exists.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.760
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Well
thanks for your question,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.880
you raised a very good point.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.300
Well, I have no fear maybe
because I'm too naive to think

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:51.300
that they are really, you
know, looking for people as me.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.640
But this research was
about the interrogations

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:00.210
and I couldn't find anything
related to the US in this research.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.280
And now I'm here as a Fulbright
scholar and researching

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.610
on the US relationship with the
military dictatorships in Chile,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.930
Brazil and Argentina regarding
the human rights violations.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:20.450
And it's really hard to find
documents on the military training.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.690
Actually I asked officially
to the national archives

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.650
and records administration and they
answered that they have nothing

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.750
about it, which I kind of doubt.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.750
And they said that probably

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.810
in the army's archives
I could find something,

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.830
but they are much more
restricted, you know, to access.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:53.360 position:56%
And I'm working with a college, a
French colleague on another research

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.420
so that's the third one
about the trajectories,

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.200
professional trajectories of
repressive agents in Brazil.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:08.890
And we are observing that they had
many different kinds of training

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:13.260
in the US from the School of
Americas, from Fort Benning,

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:21.050
for many, many places inside the US
to not just -- not only in Panama.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:28.240
But it's much harder to find,
you know, documental proof

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.740
and to know exactly what
they were being taught

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.580 position:56%
and how important was this training.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:41.200
Because of course, we have to think
about the US role, but we also have

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.120
to take into account the experience
we had before and not just

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.400
as Brazilians, but Argentinians and
Chileans and Uruguayans in torture

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.670
and things for that matter.

00:46:53.670 --> 00:47:02.210
And know that it was a kind of,
you know, a -- not a coincidence,

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:07.660
but they went to the same
point from different places.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:12.520
And so we have to take into
account the military training given

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:17.230
by the US, but also that we have
some expertise by ourselves.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.360
So don't make the US like the
big responsible for everything.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.110
You have to balance it.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.580
But I think it's really
important and I think

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:35.290
that the US played an important
role building and giving advice

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:39.770
to these kind to D9, Chile,
to the accord in Brazil.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:46.560 position:56%
We know that some of the US
consoles were [inaudible] frequently

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.970
to the dichotomy and
they knew everything.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:54.010
When we read the documents
sent by the US government

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.530
to the Brazilian Truth
Commission we know

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.740
that the embassy was
informed about many things.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.640
They were able to read
the interrogations.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.120
So they knew when someone
disappeared

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.830
and the family was searching
for someone they already knew

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:12.820
that this person had been
killed under torture.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.540
So it's a responsibility to bear.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:24.980
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for
giving such an illuminating talk.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:30.320
I still don't understand
the connection

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.350
between the Truth Commission
and what's happening today

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.420
with the instability and Brazil.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.450 position:56%
Could you clarify that a little bit?

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.750
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily:
Okay, great question.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:45.780
The Truth Commission in Brazil was
created very late if you compare

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.760
with the other dictator, other
countries that had a dictatorship.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:58.140
So it was -- it started its work
in 2012 and it was very difficult

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:03.740
to the Dilma government
to build these consensus

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.000
on this Truth Commission.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.460
And the military were really
reluctant to accept it.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:16.500
So I would say that the Truth
Commission among other things

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:23.760
for example, having in schools
materials about LGBT education

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:30.210
and the economic policies
and that tried a little bit

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:35.920
to distribute the wealth,
the Brazilian wealth

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.870
and not concentrated so much.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:50.950
So many things contributed to give
these to the right-wing groups

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:59.210 position:56%
and parties this willingness to take
their work party from the government

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:03.100
for now for once because
they are really angry

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.400
about all these politics.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.040
And the Truth Commission I
would say that is a part of it,

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.940
but it's not -- maybe not the
element, but it's one of them.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:16.750
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the great
presentation Mariana.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:21.700
I have a question that stems
from [inaudible] talking

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:27.910
about the bureaucracy that's
needed to have a state

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.490
that tortures [inaudible]
policy for torture.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:42.710
And I'm fascinated by the documents
you used and how you looked

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:48.290
at the time and what
you took from them.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:56.440
And I'm wondering if you
were able to see anything

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:05.300
about in the bureaucracy those
that were being sort of apprenticed

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:10.660 position:56%
and trained for this sort of world
that were underachievers [inaudible]

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:15.060
to look at it, but those that rose
to the top and those that didn't.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:20.860
Do you see that in what you
were able to look at and sort

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:25.190
of the selection of those that
would [inaudible] to that role?

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.500
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Actually
I'm working on these right now

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.540
in this new research because with
these interrogation I didn't really

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.580
have access to the hierarchy.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.230
And that was a main concern of the
Truth Commission to know who was

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.890
above the perpetrators
and to establish exactly

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.920
who was responsible for what.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:53.290
And so it's really recent to
have access to this information

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.650
and I'm trying to understand

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:59.960
with [inaudible] how these people
were selected in which basis

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.670 position:56%
which were the criteria and how much
time they spend on each [inaudible]

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:08.550
and if there was a logic
from going to another agency

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:09.850
to one agency to another.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:11.150
If there are some recognizable
paths and things like that.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.950
So I hope I will have
something to tell you quickly.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:24.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.830
Because actually it is.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.710
I mean they worked a lot on --

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:35.580
I tried to explain that it goes
beyond information, but not to say

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.190
that the information was
not important it was vital.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:43.260
Because for the repressive
agencies of course.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:50.490 position:56%
Because they were able to having
many interrogations for many people,

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:57.360
so they were able to compare
different statements day-by-day

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.620 position:56%
and compare them with other
people's statements, interrogations,

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:09.360
and compare that with the
findings they could perform

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.470
in these hideouts.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:19.550
So an important part of this
information collecting is

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.630
that you put information together

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:24.400
to see what really stands
and what it's a lie.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.720
So it works sort of.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:33.500
But also because it works,
but also because it's a way

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:37.360
to impose a certain
way of seeing things.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.230
So you don't do that to, you know,

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:47.900
you don't do that with former
politicians that are in jail

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.450
because they are corrupt.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:57.880
We don't do that with, you know, so
I don't know maybe someone very new

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.520
in sports, an athlete that made
something wrong and was in jail.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.750
You don't do that to regular
people, you do that against people.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:11.930
So it's not just about information
you do that against people

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.880
that you want to massacre really.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Or systems that you want destroy.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.180
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Yes, yes.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.280
&gt;&gt; Guerilla system and also just --

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.820
it's just part of the artillery
on the repressive government.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.510
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Exactly,
it's a weapon and very useful.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:55:38.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.120
Well there are many
different perspectives,

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.230
so we have former prisoners
who built institutions,

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:51.330
memorial institutions and that try
to keep this past present in a way

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.860
to teach people, to teach
the Brazilian society

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.570
that it's not a good thing
to have a dictatorship.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.020
And you have those as
Cabera [assumed spelling]

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.860
that okay, it's over.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:08.430
It was something back in
the time and let's think --

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:11.250
let's look to the other side.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:17.480
And well, I'd say that it's not
a perspective I like the most

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:26.380 position:56%
because I think actually he changed
his mind about the guerrilla itself.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:33.710
So it's the way he thinks about
the dictatorship is related

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:38.660
to the way he thinks --
reflects on the guerilla now.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:44.540
And one thing that was
very important all these 60

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.940
and 70 years they were
important to --

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:55.680
I think to banish the idea of
revolution of our societies.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:04.630
And it was very, very strong
and very effective to that.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.090
So today when you're thinking
revolution it doesn't make sense,

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.500
it's something that maybe
it was fancy I don't know

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.490
in the 70's, but not now.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.360
It's something that has
been really banished

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.750 position:56%
of our perspective of possibilities.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:25.430
And I think he's a part of it, I
think he really changed his mind

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:29.940
and he has a completely
different perspective,

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.440
political perspective
today currently.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mariana for talking.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.780
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily: Thank you.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.380
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] complete a
survey I would love to have it.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.510
&gt;&gt; Mariana Joffily:
So thank you everyone.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:50.160
