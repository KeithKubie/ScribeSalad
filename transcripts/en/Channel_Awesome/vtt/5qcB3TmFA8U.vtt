00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.280
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't ha-

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.220
What the fuck am I doing?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.260
No, really, what the fuck am I doing?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.940
I'll tell you what I'm doing: Scooby Doo, the douche-horse movie!

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.240
[hip-hop version of the Scooby Doo theme plays]

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.840
Yeah, fuck it. Here's what I think of the movie:

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.320
IT FUCKING SUCKS. The end!

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.280
No no no I wouldn't...do that to you, but, at the same time...

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480
Is this it? I-Is this really life?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.320
No! This isn't life! This isn't anything even representing life! But it's life for me!

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.900
It's pretty pathetic, but...it's all I got!

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.260
I know what you're saying, "Wow that's pretty sad," well you know what, yeah, it IS fucking sad!

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.040
I don't get to go out and hang out with friends, I don't even HAVE any friends!

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.300
I have nobody to contribute anything to, I have nobody to talk to or bounce things off of, you know?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.440
It's not like "Hey, what do you think of that?" "I'll tell you what I think of this," no! It's just me bitching and moaning like I always do!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.760
And some would say "Well that's a pretty sad existence!" well yeah it is a pretty sad existence

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.660
just SITTING HERE AND WATCHING SCOOBY FUCKING DOO!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.140
[becoming hysterical] I mean for God's sakes! I've never done anything!

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.580
I've never done anything to make someone's life better!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.600
Or-or-or-or-or gone and play game with somebody! I would LOVE to play a game with somebody!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.880
Wouldn't it be great? I mean somebody is just like: "Oh hey what'chu doing? Want to play this game with us?"

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.760
"What game?" "Punch-Easy"

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780
I don't know what the fuck people are playing but you know what? It would be nice!

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.460
It would be nice to be invited! I-I have never even gone to a...bar with somebody!

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.480
Hang around with some friends! I haven't even gone to a.. a stripclub!

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.160
Okay, I've gone to a couple of stripclubs but I have never gone with anybody!

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.560
I've never been there- and actually been like-

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.700
-okay not with people, but still! You know what? It'd be nice!

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.160
It'd be nice just ONE DAY to go somewhere, where somebody is just having a good time,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420
and somebody just says: "I don't where-"

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.400
"Hey you know what? That guy was okay! Not great, but he was okay!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.220
Instead of: "Hey, who was that little FUCKSHIT?!"

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.840
Well, I'll TELL you who that FUCKSHIT IS! He is the NOSTALGIA CRITIC, HE REMEMBERS IT SO YOU DON'T FUCKING HAVE TO!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.380
Even though EVERY. FUCKING. DAY HE EXISTS, he WISHES he didn't have to!

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.720
He WISHES he didn't have to do this BULLSHIT to make you WATCH, and get you ratings!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.560
And WHY does it happen?! Why do you keep coming back?! Because YOU'RE FUCKING SICK, AND I'M FUCKING STUPID!

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.460
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS! That's the way it's ALWAYS GONNA BE! THERE IS NO CHANGE!

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.720
THERE IS NO FUTURE! THERE'S NO PAST! The present is a JOKE! Everything is HELL!

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.980
My life is HELL! THIS is the worst THING, a HUMAN BEING, could ever, GO THROUGH!

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.440
[Pure enraged screaming]

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.620
So let's start, uh..

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.140
This is where I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.070
usually show up

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.459
you clips from the trailer because I was too lazy to find any actual clips that are visually interesting for you.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.619
And I of course talk over it. I mean, what's the point in trying to change anything, right?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.500
I am where I am. Nothing's going to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.740
make it any different.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.100
[Sigh]

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.980
It's not like I can just go back in time and alert my young self of the HELL that awaits him.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.800
[Time Warping SFX]

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.940
Alright! Scooby Doo, the Movie. This is gonna be so clever and-

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.800
[Both getting surprised]

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.660
What the hell?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.840
Holy shit!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.780
It's like looking into the future!

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.320
Is that me from the past?

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.740
Oh! Hey, does the internet ever become anything? Or do we still just use it for porn?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.540
It's porn, isn't it?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.960
Wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense. How am I able to talk to my younger self?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.840
I don't know, maybe it has something to do with the fact I'm about to watch the awesome Scooby-Doo movie!

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.220
It's great because I remember Scooby-Doo existed and this movie remembers that Scooby-Doo existed, so it's really tapping into my childhood-...

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.900
What's the word I'm looking for?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.740
Nostalgia?

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.760
Nah, that's not it..

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.920
Well look, younger me, what ever you do, don't watch that piece of crap.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.640
What? But they said it's a satirical hip new look at the characters I know and love!

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.860
But it's not done well! It's just a corporate sellout.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.060
Oh then forget it! I hate corporate sellouts.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.460
They're all narcs, they can all just kiss my ass!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.000
Hey by the way, what's it like making put bazillions of dollars selling your ideas?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.080
Uh.. yeah about that..

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.460
Um, a little word of advice from your future self, uh.. you may not wanna keep making those videos.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.520
What? Why not?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.000
Trust me, they're not as good as you think they are.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.480
Well, what the hell do you know, you stupid close-minded narc?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.320
I'm you, you dumbass!

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560
Yeah? Well, how do I know the corporation's didn't get to you?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.860
How do I know they didn't find you and like brainwash you into talking to your younger self convincing me not to make the greatest movies of all time?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.640
Ugh, look,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.840
I'm not making this up, listen to me. This is totally believable.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.700
You need to stop because Mara Wilson, the little girl from Mrs. Doubtfire is going to find them and blackmail you with them years later.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.340
Dude, that seriously the best you could come up with?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.280
Oh my god, if only you could] see the future so you can understand what's in store for you.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.560
[Time Warping SFX]

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.860
[Both of them are surprised]

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.680
Awesome!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.980
What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What's going on here?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.700
I don't know,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.840
It's like all these different parts in my life are coming together: The past,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.280
present and future! All I wanted to do was just watch the fucking Scooby-Doo movie!

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.080
Wait! I was going to put it on, too.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.200
My memory of Scooby-Doo is so bad, I was going to put it on to see if I can remember it. Heurgh.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.880
But wait, both I and the young me we're gonna watch it, too.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.220
Great, zzzzz-God..

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.540
We're all gonna watch the same movie.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.580
Yeah, so?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.720
And yet somehow it caused a temporal anomaly in time.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.600
Hmm. We best watch this movie together, Critic. Something tells me that all the answers to our questions may be in this peril.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.820
Oh trust me, this film has no answers.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.920
Speak for yourself, narc.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.740
Oh shut up, you pretentious little-

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.880
Hey! Don't make me split myself apart!

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.280
He started it, narc.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.840
Ugh.. let's go ahead and see if we can figure out what's going on. Let's watch the Scooby-Doo movie.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.220
NC: So the film opens with, big shock, a Pop song!

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.280
Past NC: Yeah, but so what? The original had Pop songs, too!

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.320
NC: Yeah! And I'm sure that never dated either. Just like having Sandy Duncan or the Harlem Globetrotters!

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.120
Who?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200
Exactly.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.340
NC: So after listening to,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.260
I don't know, Scoob-Doggy-Dog. We start off with a caper going on.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.880
Daphne: Help me!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.880
Or, rather the end of the caper actually.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.119
Velma: Shockingly, Daphne has been captured again. When the Luna Ghost rounds the corner with Daphne,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.820
Shaggy and Scooby would pop out of the barrel-

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.340
Fred: -then you'll activate the conveyor belt, spilling the battered oil on the floor.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.760
Uh.. Did we fast forward past a few scenes?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.580
Yeah? It's weird, isn't it?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.380
NC: They're giving you a taste of what one of the capers on the show was like,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.280
but you wouldn't really get that, unless you grew up watching the show.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.560
Well, I did and I think it's very clever that they're

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.660
satirizing the original showing that they have a sense of humor! By..

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.500
Making Scooby look like Marmaduke. Seriously, is that supposed to be Scooby-Doo? It barely looks like him!

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.700
Past NC: It looks more like a Gremlin that got microwaved with a bear rug!

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.600
[Shaggy and Scooby both scream in fear]

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.340
Future NC: Not to mention the crappy CGI effects.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.240
Future NC: Tell me, did they really look THAT bad in your time period?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.360
Past NC: Well, not this bad! But hey,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.280
maybe it's a loving send up to the bad animation of the original show!

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.840
NC: Yeah, but the original show had an excuse for why it was bad:

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.440
Each episode had the budget of a ham sandwich and two minutes to put it together. What's this films excuse?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.510
Past NC: Well, it is kind of neat though,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.839
how they're making fun of their roles. Like how Daphne's the Damsel in Distress ,Velma's the smart one, Fred's full of himself. Look!

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.359
They're even mocking the pointless celebrity cameos. Uh I don't think that's mocking a pointless Celebrity cameo

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.060
I think that just is a pointless celebrity cameo. This is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.820
Ecologically friendly actually figure. [hey] look Michael Moore and the Jerry maguire kid come on

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.089
It's a satire of the original show and that automatically makes it funny. Show me something. That's a sad tire. That isn't automatically funny

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.090
I don't know what those are yet?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.220
oh

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.220
Smithers [the] Creepy Janitor

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.880
[well], maybe if they keep it [going] throughout the rest of the film

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.119
But I don't know it seems like they're playing their cards pretty early if the whole film is supposed to satirize the show

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.460
Why aren't they saving these jokes for the rest of the movie? Why are they using them up in the first couple minutes?

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.339
It's spoiling the fun early for fans and confusing newcomers. It's like the Brady bunch movie

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.480
They'll have a ton of jokes like this throughout the entire I quit minute I

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.689
Was Gonna quit in like two seconds. Yeah, I quit

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.219
Well that seemed like a relatively short flick

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.390
good riddance

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:36.239
Well, they never did that in the show yeah even from a dramatic standpoint that seems a little early to throw it wouldn't it make

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.260
More sense that they save this for like the end of the second act or something well hey

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.080
Maybe they get right back together real Saluki

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.120
Talk about dosage

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.830
on purpose

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:03.030
So yeah a mere two years passes by as suddenly the owner of an amusement [park] called Spooky Island

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.810
Context and one by one and fools them all out into coming out to solve the mystery they decided to all go but not after

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.019
[establishing] that each one of them wants to solve the mystery themselves

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.090
I was gonna Solve the mystery of myself for the first time ever [are] you gonna save yourself and you get caught?

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.340
I'm a black belt now. I've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon look

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.620
Okay, I'm a little confused

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.940
I thought in the show they all liked each other did what how come they don't like each other [no] because I?

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.960
Clever no, here's fucking clever

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.730
No, no, no, I'm sorry

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.280
I just got back from the movie theater from seeing the must also will give all time the two towers [and] that had fucking Gaul

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.099
A minute [that] [is] one of the best CG characters of all time?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.210
and yet this

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.749
abomination came out the exact same year

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:05.890
Are you shitting me? For God sakes Roger rabbit was better integrated than him and I'm supposed to know that. He's not really there

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.440
That is a beautiful work heart

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.340
[uh-huh]? Oh, here's a fun little fact for you

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.680
Elsa [Fisher's] in this movie. Elsa Fisher ooo that sweet honey from wedding crashers [whoo]?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.820
[oh], you don't know where yet, but she's one of the most attractive women you'll ever see in your life

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.749
Oh my God. She is such a hobbit you mind me taking a seat there [who] the hell is that?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.089
that s La fisher really her um

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.580
She's okay. I guess no mono. They make her like mother pretties women of all time

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.479
She's like a knockout if you say so no, and she's funny too really really funny, but he's everything [me]

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.030
I

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:52.089
Swear to gosh if he goes really really funny really no really she's funny and attractive

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.379
But this is really great scene where she ties fits onto a bed it puts us. What exact in his bulk

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.719
Do I have to become you it works in context?

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.939
So take a guess with the young lady who befriends scooby and shaggy is named

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:14.799
[no], really yes, the first thing that pops into your mind is probably correct. I'm mary Jane Mary Jane her name is actually

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:22.210
Mary Jane like that is my favorite name. Yeah. Oh, dude. You should totally meet her sister

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.100
pot oh

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.700
And here's another weird one. She just loves

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:36.009
Scooby snacks yeah, what are the odds they're 100% vegetarian and and I love [them] like me

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.969
Too I have never met another [person] who loves boobies Max me neither

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.860
It's like finding the really hot chick who loves playing video games eating hot pockets and living in your mother's house

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.650
Or the one who likes vince vaughn tied to a bed with a aachen is that words in context?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.219
Cause the dog to discontinue any action simply flick it on the nose

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.050
[hey]

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.779
Did that dog just punch someone? Oh yeah scooby performed physical assault?

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.700
Yeah, alan is a part of my childhood feel ravaged. [oh] fuck you, asshole. [oh]

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.439
So they get to the [island] and find out that it was Mr.. Dean who called them there?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.829
Why because not [only] does he have a mystery for them to solve?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.960
But he wanted to see them all back together to relive that nostalgic feel there's that word again

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.999
I don't think you know the proper meaning. Uh I believe somebody is casting a spell

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:47.610
Students. Have you notice any difference between those arriving and those departing they look like Sober well-behaved college kids precisely

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.779
If they didn't before they came in other words a magic spell

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:57.389
Now wait a minute magic spells come on the original Scooby-doo made it very clear that

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:04.170
There's no such thing as supernatural elements in their world just a talking dog who has an appetite [for] six foot sandwiches?

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.319
Oh, thanks for being the voice of reason [no] problem

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.770
so they try to figure out what's been causing all the teenagers on the island to act so strange by looking into one of the

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.770
closed attractions

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.070
[Daphney] exit through the Entrance velma, and I will enter here through the exit there and shaggy and scooby

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.259
Do whatever you guys do I didn't think it was possible

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.549
but this fred actually [has] less of a personality than the

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.990
Original friend fact they probably just picked an actor who could already answer to his name?

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:52.558
Hello, normally. It's the actors chewing the scenery not the scenery chewing the app. Yes

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:56.309
Yeah, that's a good point even the sets have [a] little too much going on

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:02.399
It's hard to make much of it out to appreciate the design and the actors often get lost in it, but it's okay

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.859
It won't just drive from the pointman Slapstick. We have here

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:22.580
Why is this funny in a cartoon and not really here because a cartoon goes out of its way to convince you that it's alive

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:29.150
This film goes out of its way to convince you there's no life in it whatsoever. Wow I guess that does make sense, huh critic

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.170
panic crush

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.880
here honest

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:46.520
What's going on [here] where am I you're my [realm] now predict a world with no past present or future?

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.660
[poor] you [know] old friend

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720
you

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.019
[Roger] did that [Jr.]. I figured out that [oh] guardian angel from immortal. They are

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.259
Swing just go into they [da]

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.739
Wow, so how many angels are here?

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
Just me

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.939
Apparently, [I] was the only one that didn't figure out angels could get murdered

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.300
thermal anomalies not [dead]

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.249
Then on that kind of dude. What good you know in this round I?

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.020
I

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.999
Don't believe you. Oh, and do you have a purgatory where you just go?

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.530
No, well, you saw like an extra knot it yeah

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:54.080
Tell you what why don't I just leave and you just can't enjoy hey guys critics in charge now

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.290
Yes, yes, the credit is in charge of purgatory. That's right

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:02.059
Just like a freakin college job who thinks he knows everything cuz you watch on MSNBC

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:08.150
I comprehend everything about politics, but he's never really done it [this] guy's done. Okay, so how I snapped

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:15.049
I'll tell you what I'll only answer yes, or no questions first time. You've asked one that isn't yes

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.600
No question you can ask anymore

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.479
Why is that? Oh my God you're just wasted. You just wasted you may give it one chance, and you've wasted

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.490
Let's go second. What do you want war on?

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.729
This one be yes or no questions. I wasn't full [deck]

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.820
You know what strip you're on your own. Oh come on

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.540
Give me a hand if all mankind is doing it at least give [me] a hand

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.890
All I can tell you is it as something to do with your review that

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.430
[you]

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.410
Why?

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.660
think of this my way of saying thanks, but

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.629
Guys the end of the world is upon us if we don't do something all mankind is doomed

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.950
[oh], what's the way to I don't know where do we go? I don't know I?

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.540
Was her anything you don't know yes it has something to do with this review

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.849
So we should just keep watching the review. Yes, okay?

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.410
Glad you brought that up who knows what we might [have] been doing if you didn't mention that

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.770
So no man fred come across a video that sort of shows the villains evil plan

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.080
Interaction between young people is polite and casual

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:41.500
Hey, sorry, bro. [I] will crush my bones into dust let's see how the situation should be handled

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.600
Sorry, bro

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.250
No, big whoop [dawg]? Yo, would you catch that new vid [on] the box true dat?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:55.389
I'm up two stairs off on all popular trends word white people making life uncool since the dawn of time

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.400
So they figure Mr.. Bean is the culprit, but there's still an hour left of the movie

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.879
So it seems kind of unlikely, but rather than gather more clues. We have this lovely scene that we're forced to sit through

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.619
You know just for [fun]

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:27.669
Why don't [we] see how much every single gas joke would cost an animator to animate?

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:32.199
It [also] how much could have gone to a charity to stop people from watching this film?

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.439
Oh the good cause this money could have gone, [too]

00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:48.379
Hey

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.379
Your friends did you?

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.330
Know I always get the brain worm hey look well. Let's talk into a guy for a minute

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.339
I guess that means I gotta get together at the end

00:18:57.339 --> 00:19:03.849
[oh], please everybody knows that she's saving herself for Daphne really focusing on a mystery reminds me in the old days

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:14.138
We were quite a crew back then but every family has one not happy to repeat that we do oh, God

00:19:14.929 --> 00:19:16.929
Scrappy-Doo is in this movie. I

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:23.408
Can't remember [who] is he again? Just one of the most annoying shit piles under squirted Kevin when I find him

00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:26.468
I'll give him a good dose up puppy power

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.378
Shut up, oh [God]

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:36.399
[he's] peeing on me and as we all know there's nothing funnier in the early 2000s than a dog at urinates on Cue

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:40.779
Rappy I told you no urinating [on] dad. That's my job

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:43.718
To be fair though they do make him

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:49.838
Intentionally annoying in fact he's actually cast out in just a few seconds honestly. It doesn't make any sense

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:52.449
[I] need scooby is supposed to be his caretaker

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.999
I remember that so casting the kid to the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. Just leaving him to die

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:04.179
That's a pretty big asshole thing to do isn't it I mean that's downright evil for such an innocent character

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:11.648
What a bitch or a male bitch a little egomaniac [had] flipped his lid you don't have a stroke for this job

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:17.888
[Hobby] hell, if that's the case why is [that] scene even in the movie? It's only a couple seconds long

00:20:17.889 --> 00:20:21.429
It's just an annoying bit of nothing. What's the purpose of it?

00:20:22.249 --> 00:20:27.949
Maybe he's the villain what what [oh] the scenes only a couple ekans long?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.429
And they're not writing a good mystery, and it's entirely pointless

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.330
Maybe that's the only point [to] having it just to make him a bad guy

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:45.739
No, no, it'd just be too. Stupid. It makes so little sense right I?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.670
Think maybe we [should] keep watching the review. Yeah, let's keep going oh

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.059
I remember those supernatural elements

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.460
We said just a moment ago were never in the original show well throw over in this one [and] sadly

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.270
It looks like they can only afford one

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:11.450
design for these creatures which I guess is understandable all the money obviously had to go to the

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
scoobies

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.570
There I did my one line for the trailer now. Let's get out of here

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.239
And doesn't meet or does it look like those supernatural beings smoked a few too many Marlboro cigarettes trust me

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:35.000
It's not wise for supernatural beings to be smoking Marlboro cigarettes I convinced an Alien race to take up smoking once and well

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Let's just say it didn't turn out well

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.590
so friggin velma get captured it's up to Daphne Scooby doo shaggy and

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:48.979
Mary Jane to go save them so we can defeat the creatures and save fred and velma well

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.630
That's sort of like my plan. [we'll] just get the heck out of here let the creatures eat friend [Bobo]

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.529
Okay, I never thought. I'd say this, but that was too

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.530
Cowardly honestly shaggy would run away, [but] not at the cost of sacrificing his friends

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.039
It's okay to make fun of the characters, but not when it's out of character

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:13.250
Shaggy will never be that cruel fred and velma always figured out everything my middle name is Judas

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:20.239
But they discovered [that] again through the supernatural powers. They've turned fred into more of a tool than usual man

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:26.510
We got beats like it was the [Liz's] on earth. No. I'm sanji well now. He's just acting like Freddie Prinze Jr.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.800
Fred turns his teen friends against our heroes and tracks them down

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.409
Get the dog. Hey thinking [Ollie], you know

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.729
They escape and find a way into the center of [a] villains lair

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.039
Thank God. I'm so high I can't feel my a broken bones

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.669
shaggy [Tim] finds the souls of all the people who had their

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:08.940
Souls sucked out okay. This is really stupid and he tries to return them [to] the proper bodies

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:15.030
That's one part of the mystery solved the creatures must need our bodies to survive in sunlight

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.880
like a human suit

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.129
Spf one million whatever keeps you talking in that top

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.200
I am totally fine with but some of the bodies get a little mixed up. I couldn't get to my body

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.629
I didn't know where else to go. I grant it I

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:38.220
Can look at myself naked [ah] this movie was intended for [children] right? [I] don't [think] it was meant for anybody

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:44.310
Once they get their bodies back in sync. They sneak into the bad guys evil tomb where Mr. Bean who?

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:51.899
Apparently is captain crunch Chocula is about to [perform] an evil ceremony to steal all the islands souls

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.930
But the team knocks him out and find out who he really is

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.880
oh

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.209
Oh, man, robot actually no believe it or not. It's scrappy

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.990
puppy Power, oh

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
Colder child for the

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.080
lady

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.190
serious

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.660
That's right

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.379
Scrappy was the villain [the] whole time

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:26.230
[how] can something sound so right and you feel so wrong cuz my scrappy-Dappy-doo?

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.749
Have absorbed enough energy to rule the [world] with my all-Powerful

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:40.900
In a much more clever a movie this would actually be hilarious, but here. It's just kind of awkward [it] feels like last-minute

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:47.619
Fanfiction, it's the biggest twist since finding out Martin was the bad [guy] in secret of nimh - a real jaw dropper

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:58.059
Yeah, what is he transforming into Pumbaa? Hello, Timon [I've] come to eat your soul

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:09.159
We also get [the] end of Daphne's incredibly complex story Arc now. Who's the Damsel distress me?

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.140
Straight. I don't even get it was [danny] really captured that

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.959
Often [oh], no. I seem to remember scooby and shaggy being a more peril than her hell

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.419
I don't even scrappy had to be saved more times

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.870
I think it's more she never did anything as opposed to getting captured all the time, but yeah, it's still a little confused

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.480
But hey, they do stop the evil scrappy and his

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:38.049
Satanic powers of hell, [oh] God how could they not make this joke work?

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:44.620
Her look velma hooks up [with] that guy. She shared a sentence with call that one too and so does

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.919
Rather than Daphne that's kind of confusing yeah, were they a thing in the original show

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.909
I don't know young me uh kind of sort of not really

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:05.080
People always like to hint at it like maybe they had a thing going, but they never actually shared any chemistry on the show

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.460
[oh] then the movie in the shuttle has something in common. [yeah], we're in the film

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:16.240
Did they ever indicate they have a romantic interest and now you're telling me that technically it didn't even exist in the show

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.459
I mean does any of this satisfy any audience. What's so fucking ever?

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.520
I mean Scooby-doo is the ultimate nostalgic dream it existed long ago it exists today

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.270
It will probably continue to exist in the future whatever it is

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:38.229
There is just some sort of weird awkward simple charm to the original that is apparently trying to carry through

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:44.620
But does it work in this fucking piece of shit? Oh now? Well I know

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:52.510
For whatever reason Scooby-doo continues to keep going there's tons of reincarnations. There's tons of different versions

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:58.199
There's kind of different takes, but most of them keep what is essentially the sCooby-doo formula character?

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:04.830
Except for fucking this if it want to be a satire fine if [it] wanted to be [a] homage fine

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.110
But this is just a cluttered

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.990
Unfocused mess the effects are horrible the jokes fall flat and the characters aren't

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.990
Identifiable unless you watch the show and even then they're not that loyal to them

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:25.350
They're mostly just cardboard cutouts are stereotypes of the original characters and even then they're not really half the time

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.159
stereotypes of the original character, they're just stereotypes of

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:36.120
Stereotypes, it's Incredible not [only] how much this movie misses the point and the ideas of the original show

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:43.679
But how many different moods and Angles it's trying to attack him with and how many events don't work and worst of all making?

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.580
scrappy do the

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.039
Villains now from my point of [view] I don't remember watching the show at all

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.850
So inserting him as the bacchae makes no sense as a film on its own

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.380
Yeah, and from my standpoint

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.550
It made no sense because I know the characters and the characters would never do this

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:05.640
Scrappy-Doo will never be Evil Scooby-doo whenever abandoned him on the side of the street and the series [would] never be this

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.810
Mean-spirited yeah, and from my point of view it doesn't make sense because it wasn't fully developed from a comedic standpoint

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.990
Why because the movie doesn't know if it wants to be?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.699
Mean-spirited light-hearted or both, but whatever it's trying to be

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.899
it doesn't work it just [straight-up] fails, and it's straight of

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.830
Sucks this movie can cock my ass

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:36.779
Much left, but temporal anomoly is taking its toll well

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:42.449
Yeah, it's gonna wipe us out dan. We could never figure out the answers. [oh] God how could something so horrible

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:50.279
Wait a minute. That's it something so horrible something, so horrible, we all sat through the horrible movie

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:57.480
What what do you mean the past present future [it] never managed to please anybody think about it

00:28:57.509 --> 00:29:03.358
It doesn't mean up to the nostalgic memories of the past the current judgments of the present or the fresh thoughts of the future

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:09.779
It fails on all accounts, and it's destroying us all well when we do that

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:14.219
the only thing we can do we have to destroy it in every time period

00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:24.859
Gnarrk

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200
This is it no turning back

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.720
Goodbye critic Anna laughs, but as we all know all good things must come to it

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:42.770
Well see Roger [will] see hey scooby-doo. Where are you? I'll tell you where

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.630
gee

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.290
What happened? Did it work? Are they only in the only okay?

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:04.229
[the] [old] me the [young] me next you'll be worrying about your goldfish

00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:09.209
Come on. You know. I hate them a while ago. Yes, you save humanity

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.179

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.950
Awesome, bro. Yeah, [all] the world you owe me. Haha

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.579

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.120
Guess I've known good to celebrate with

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:32.490
Maybe this time you can do things a little different, but roger there's something. I don't understand. It's something I've never understood about film

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.290
If a movie is so bad, and everybody hates it

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.749
Then why is it still [a] big hit? Why do so many people keep watching?

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.260
Well, yeah, oh

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.120
I won't

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.350
But I will tell you there is much that awaits you

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.739
Possibly Beyond your wildest dreams come on terrified in your worst nightmare

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.419
