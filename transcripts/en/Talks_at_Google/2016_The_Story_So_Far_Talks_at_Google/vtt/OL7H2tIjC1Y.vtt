 HEROES"]

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:43.739
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Please help me

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.340
welcome to the stage artist
and composer Ozark Henry

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.630
and acclaimed mixing and
audio engineer Ronald Prent.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.130
Thank you much for
joining us today.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.510
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.620
RONALD PRENT: Alright, welcome.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.280
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So it was very cool

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.020
for me to be able to sit here
and look out at the faces,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.690
and see the people really
engaging with that experience.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.210
If you could describe
for us what exactly

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.917
was that they just sat through?

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:14.750
OZARK HENRY: Well,
especially for the people

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.970
in the middle, because
they are the ones who

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.010
are sitting within our set up.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.150
They've experienced immersive
sound, immersive meaning

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.560
generating a 3D image
that blurs the lines

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.350
between the digital
and physical.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.670
Or to say it in a
simpler way, when

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.610
I'm performing
with an orchestra,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.290
I am always amid the orchestra.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.840
I'm not in front
of the orchestra,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.090
meaning that I'm always
surrounded by sound.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.090
I'm immersed in sound.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.320
And immersive sound gives
you that same experience

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.290
in recorded music.

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do
you agree with that?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.922
Is there more to it?

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.130
RONALD PRENT: Most certainly.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.730
No, it is a new way of having
the listener experience

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.200
the creative process
of an artist that

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.030
wants to communicate his
music in a different way.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.970
And in stereo, it's fine,
and on an iPod, it's fine.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.360
On headphones, it's fine.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.260
But this, you actually
put inside the music

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.860
that the guy
created, or the girl,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.470
and you live the
emotional experience,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.090
which is so much
bigger and so much more

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.434
involved with yourself than
just listening to two speakers.

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.850
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So you
said something very interesting

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.308
that I'm going to
key off of, which

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:37.190
is to bring the listener
along with the process.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.650
This particular audio sample
that everyone just heard

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.470
comes off of your
album, "Paramount."

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.230
OZARK HENRY: Yes.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.732
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Which is the
chicken and the egg question.

00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:47.440
Which came first?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.570
The idea for the album?

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.910
You were involved with the
National Orchestra of Belgium,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.980
via invitation.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.427
How did that cascade into
creating all of this?

00:05:57.427 --> 00:05:59.010
OZARK HENRY: Well,
the thing is that I

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.330
was invited by the National
Orchestra of Belgium

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.070
to curate my work using their
fantastic 90 piece orchestra.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.730
And knowing that my dad
is a classical composer,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.390
that's the music and the sound
that I was brought up with.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.240
For me, it was an opportunity
to really full circle.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.390
I wanted to explore and
to score every color,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.020
every dynamic I could get
from such a big orchestra.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.370
And of course,
being a producer, I

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.980
wanted to record,
record it in a way that

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.510
hasn't been done
before, not thinking

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.190
at that time about
immersive sound,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.610
because I didn't
even know it existed.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.040
But I wanted to have
a really big canvas,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.860
because that is very important
to put a 90 piece orchestra.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.800
And I wanted to do
something about the space.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.740
I wanted to share that
special emotion you have

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.860
when being immersed
by that big sound

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.137
when performing with them.

00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:08.470
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So in
trying to tackle that problem,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.500
somewhere along the
lines, you began

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.670
to work with the Auro-3D chaps?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.390
OZARK HENRY: Well,
it was step by step.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.510
The first thing I had
to question myself

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.370
is, what is the canvas?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.504
I have some footage too.

00:07:23.504 --> 00:07:25.920
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah, a
very good way to explain this.

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:29.770
OZARK HENRY: A
good way to explain

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.640
this is, what is a canvas,
and asking yourself,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.570
does size matter in music?

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.730
This is Pablo
Picasso's "Guernica,"

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.030
a painting he made
in 1937 expressing

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.860
the horror he witnessed
in events that

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.610
would lead up to World War II.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.590
People who have had
the opportunity to see

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.710
this in real life, it's huge.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.010
It's 3 and 1/2 meters high.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.460
It's almost 8 meters
wide, so it wouldn't even

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.460
never fit in this room.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.160
Why is it so big?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.060
Because of what the
content is saying to you.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.660
it says, there's a war coming.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.910
It's a monster, and
it's unstoppable.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.650
I think with music
being an art form,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.830
as painting is an
art form, one has

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.620
to always question
what canvas will

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.000
I use when starting
a certain work?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.980
I was sure that working with
a 90 piece orchestra having

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:33.150
the richest instrument
possible in color and dynamic,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.059
I needed to have a
really big canvas.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.080
Luckily, I have a big
canvas, the canvas

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.450
that I normally work in.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.140
And that is my canvas.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.860
The white circle
represents my canvas.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.330
The size of the
circle represents

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.010
the quality of my canvas.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.970
And within that canvas, I have
placed a 90 piece orchestra.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.300
The size of the pictogram
just represents the quality,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.650
the dynamic, the direction,
everything such a big orchestra

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.460
has to offer.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.900
So from my research,
I did understand

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.220
that the good thing is that
my canvas is big enough.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.700
But I know that
this is not going

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.849
to help me to feel that special
thing, being immersed by sound.

00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:19.390
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's like
you can watch a high definition

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.950
film, but you're still on
this side of the screen.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.908
OZARK HENRY: Yes, you're
always in front of it.

00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:25.270
You're not in the music.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.960
And of course, knowing
Ronald, and knowing

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:37.230
that he's the expert in surround
music mixing, engineering,

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.260
recording--

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.170
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: How
early in the process

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.450
did you become involved
in the project?

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.330
RONALD PRENT: Very early.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.280
I mean, the idea got settled,
and I wanted to do it.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.090
And Piet called me up.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.500
Pietr [? Robert ?] came
to visit us, and he said,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.480
I'm going to do this.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.200
And he told me what
he just told you guys.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.630
And I said, oh,
that's a big canvas,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.994
but there's a new
technology called Auro-3D

00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:06.110
that uses 9 or 10 speakers.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.630
You can choose
which configuration.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.290
Which will allow us to
actually represent your canvas

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.790
in a three dimensional
world, and put you

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.760
inside or among the
orchestra, and therefore

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.670
give the listener a completely
different experience

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.170
of your musical ideas.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.140
And from that moment
on, he said, OK.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.055
I want to do this.

00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:35.000
So we did the whole
process of the recording,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.300
the mixing, the producing.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.249
Everything was done
with this in mind.

00:10:38.249 --> 00:10:39.290
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Cool.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.790
Cool.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.770
Even to the point of how
much consideration do

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.250
you have to put where
you're placing a microphone,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.520
the orientation of that.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.717
I know we were talking before
about the easy trap of, oh,

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.300
I'll just take a
flute and put it over

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.360
here, and take a clarinet
and put it over there.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.550
But that doesn't really
serve the purpose.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.508
RONALD PRENT: It doesn't
serve the purpose, no.

00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:02.167
You want you want to put
the people in a space,

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:04.000
whether it's virtual
or real doesn't matter.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.910
You want to put them in
a space to experience

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.800
the emotional content of
the music more than just

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.880
with headphones or two speakers.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.725
And the orchestra is miked in a
traditional way with the Decca

00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:21.460
Tree in a very classical way.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.030
Then it's miked in
a second way, which

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.870
is more pointed to the
instruments, more pop like.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.280
And it's done in a
three dimensional way,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.680
so there's three
different stages

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.360
in which I've recorded
it parallel when

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.130
they did live performances.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.920
But you also look where do
you record your orchestra?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.170
Do you do it in the concert
hall, in the studio?

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.320
We ended up doing it
in the rehearsal space

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.230
of the orchestra.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.440
We went to see the
orchestra before we

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.560
started doing our planning.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.206
And that was so powerful.

00:11:51.206 --> 00:11:52.580
And I walked around
the orchestra

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.580
while they were rehearsing.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.242
And I said to Piet,
I said, I don't

00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.200
think you have to think
about anything anymore.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.533
We're going to do in this space.

00:11:59.533 --> 00:12:01.740
I know it's not meant
to be recorded here.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.970
It's a rehearsal space.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:07.050
But the power of the orchestra,
you'll never get it in a studio

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.270
or in a classical
performance space.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.500
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And that
seems to make sense too.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.380
One would think that the
rehearsal space of an orchestra

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.560
is designed in a way to
where they are the ones who

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.620
are hearing it the best.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.110
RONALD PRENT: Absolutely.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So if you are then

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.793
approaching it to
record it in the way

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:25.370
that they would hear it,
it's accomplishing the goals

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.850
that you're laying out.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.620
There's a great documentary
that is available

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.260
online about the
creation of the album,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.810
and I think we want to
show a snippet of that.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.790
And the documentary is
also in the surround,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.530
so you guys will be
able to experience

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.100
a little bit different,
something a little different

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.590
than music.

MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That's a little insight

00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:07.260
into the recording
process and how the way

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.230
it was recorded
lead into the mixing

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.540
and everything like that.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.610
RONALD PRENT: Yeah.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.010
If you could hear me speak
Dutch, it's my native language.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.050
I don't know if
everybody could read it,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.840
but really quickly,
what I did was

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.840
I used three ways of
recording the orchestra.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.540
One is the very classical
way, a classical approach

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.780
with Decca Tree in the
front with three microphones

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.620
and some support microphones.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.460
And the second
way is really pop,

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.820
where each instrument
has its own microphone

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.660
so I can control balance.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.050
And then the third way
was I put five microphones

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.550
in a square inside
the orchestra.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.210
And those are projected
in the top loudspeakers

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.060
here, which gave
me the possibility

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.020
to dynamically enhance the
excitement or the arrangement

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.890
of the orchestra.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.080
There will be parts in songs
that you play where, basically,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.890
it sounds like a little
chamber orchestra,

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.590
although it's a big orchestra.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.250
And it's only
either in the front

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.000
or in the bottom
layer of speakers.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.090
And when the orchestra really
gets loud and powerful,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.130
then I add the speakers
as progressive mixing.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.730
In classical, you
wouldn't do that,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.230
or you wouldn't be
allowed to do it,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.380
because it changes the
perspective of the orchestra.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.450
Here, its use is
an extra dimension

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.350
to the excitement of the music.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.310
And you can make it small,
and you can make it direct.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.020
You can make it distant
and very romantic,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.490
or you can make it
powerfully loud.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.130
Those were the three
layers that we created.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.380
Didn't know if it was
going to work before.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.950
We recorded it that way because
the room would let us do that.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.090
And then in mixing,
after we did three songs,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.570
we went in the other
studio in a mastering room,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.350
and listened to it
on a bigger system.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.210
And it was really like,
oh, wow, it works.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.140
That's an exciting
moment, because it really

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.450
gives such a different
dimension to his music.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.170
OZARK HENRY: This is also
something we have to clear out.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.849
You were working, and
we couldn't check in 9.1

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:12.829
while you were working.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.762
You had to imagine things.

00:17:14.762 --> 00:17:17.000
RONALD PRENT: We were
boyscouting at the time.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.800
So you do three processes.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.410
You do stereo, 5.1 and
9.1 at the same time.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.339
So you have to choose
what you listen to.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.184
Because it's not always possible
to listen to all three forms.

00:17:27.184 --> 00:17:28.351
It's switchable.

00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:30.850
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Difficult
to burn the CD and go play it.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.433
RONALD PRENT: Yeah,
you can't do that.

00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:36.750
So I choose to work in 5.1 and
not listen to the top speakers.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.650
And then when I
was finished, I'd

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.410
take the files into
the other studio,

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.474
play it on a real 9.1 set.

00:17:42.474 --> 00:17:43.890
Otherwise, it got
too complicated.

00:17:46.468 --> 00:17:49.200
Now we're a year
further down the line.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.540
Now there are consoles
developed that can actually

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.790
allow you to do that.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.370
So, like technology, it
evolves so fast every year.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.090
Then when we did it, we
couldn't, but now we can.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.540
And it's only a year later.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.280
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
You made a touch point

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.650
about the emotional experience.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.640
And that made me think
about touching on the fact

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.962
that that song that we
heard in the beginning

00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:12.045
might have some emotional
connections because it's

00:18:12.045 --> 00:18:15.480
the recently the late David
Bowie who created that.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.430
And he works in a
very unique way.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.902
Not anybody can just go along
and cover a David Bowie song.

00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.360
OZARK HENRY: Which
is a good thing.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.520
I'm a big Bowie fan, so it's
good to have his approval when

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.444
you do a cover version.

00:18:28.444 --> 00:18:30.110
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
How did you approach

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.620
David Bowie to say we have this
idea, we want your blessing?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.610
And even to the
point where you were

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:41.010
changing some of the lyrics
and really dismantling

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.320
and recombining them somehow.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.570
OZARK HENRY: Well, I have a
little history with Bowie.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.980
When I released my
first album in 1996,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.430
he spoke out openly that he was
a really big fan of that album.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.720
I met him later
on at times that I

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.290
wasn't at all successful
with what I was doing.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.340
And he gave me the
confidence and the courage

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.440
to keep on doing
what I was doing.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.120
And at the time that I could
do a project like this,

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.200
I made that version of "Heroes,"
which I did send to him,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.520
explaining that the way
I edited lyrics changed

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.830
the content completely
from what it originally

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.490
was talking about.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.500
But it was reflecting
this project specifically

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.430
in the sense that a
90 piece orchestra has

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.440
40 different nationalities.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.030
We were doing
something that I never

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.620
had done before, that was
way bigger than anything

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.870
that I've done before.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.070
And that meant that I
had to trust everyone.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.660
And the title of the album
is "Paramount is Harmony.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.430
Respect Each Individual."

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.700
I think this was possible
because everybody

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.990
was involved in the orchestra.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.460
Engineering, recording,
everybody in the studio,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.490
everybody involved,
the people I work with,

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.200
my management-- everybody made
it possible, because we had

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.890
the courage to believe in
something and just go for it,

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.350
even if we didn't have
any blueprint in knowing

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.920
that we would succeed.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.170
And that's where the song
stands for, I think, the way

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.410
it's been edited.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.820
And David really liked it.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.500
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah I was going

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.200
to ask if he was
able to hear it.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.970
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, he never
heard it in immersive sound.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.874
He just heard a stereo demo
that I made, unfortunately.

00:20:24.874 --> 00:20:26.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: To
dig a little bit deeper

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:31.740
into the immersive sound
portion, that's the buzz phrase

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.270
that we're focusing on.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.620
All of us are
probably old enough

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.650
to have gone through
many iterations now

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.810
of audio technology,
from tapes to CDs

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.060
to the short lived minidisc.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.520
Does this fall into a technology
in the recording and studio

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.270
world?

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.420
Is it a medium that is going
to be moving to take over?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.570
Is it a playback device?

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.000
I mean, you have like high
fidelity in the Pono device,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.830
or FLAC audio files.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.250
Where does this fit in
that large environment?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.300
OZARK HENRY: I think, first
of all, it's a technology.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.680
I mean, it's a medium.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.850
It allows an artist to
have a way bigger canvas,

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.470
actually, the canvas
one would always

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.780
dream of, to express everything
that is possible with music.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.030
This is, I think, beyond styles.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.240
This is even probably
beyond music.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.140
I think it can express
way more, because it

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.690
is the natural way of
listening to things,

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:35.670
the way we experience
sound day to day.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.470
And it gives back
what has been lost,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.470
I think, throughout the
technology and the way

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.670
it's been commercialized.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.430
That is, the original work.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:56.660
And to explain, going
back to the Picasso,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.580
if that were a piece
of music, and you

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.890
were to see the original
work, and it would be a song,

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.697
and it comes out as a
piece of music today,

00:22:05.697 --> 00:22:08.030
and you would be interested
in it, and you would buy it,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.590
you would download it,
or you would stream it.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.090
Then you would have this.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.230
So imagine you're
Pablo Picasso, and you

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.860
want to express like the
horror leading to events

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.250
that will start a World War.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.510
This is hardly noticeable.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.370
I think it's paying no
respect or no tribute

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.470
to what an artist had intended.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.100
And I think an MP3
is a great thing,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.720
because it allows you to
carry music with you on a very

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.620
small device.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.720
But is that the purpose of the
one who is making the music?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.740
Is that the purpose
of the artist?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.780
Making something that you can
put in a really small device?

00:22:51.054 --> 00:22:52.470
And then, of course,
there's a lot

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.010
of people criticizing
the way I presented,

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.310
saying but it's music.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.080
You can zoom into it.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.830
But if you zoom into it,
of course, it's deformed.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.650
Going back to what
I said before,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.760
it's all about respecting
the original work.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.900
My interest as an artist
is using technologies

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.090
that allow me to offer
an experience which

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.620
is way beyond anything
that one can offer now,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.000
but also to share it.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.300
Because I think the biggest
challenge, after all,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.640
was for us not to make this
album using immersive sound,

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.340
but the hardest thing is
just to communicate it

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.960
and to get it
towards an audience.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.250
Although it's quite easy to
do, because these sound files

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.570
may have been big
files some time ago,

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.010
but they're not today.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.657
If you can stream a film, then
for sure, you can stream this.

00:23:47.657 --> 00:23:49.240
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, maybe that's

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.490
a bigger question about
technology, to back up.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.550
Because it's clear.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.350
Everyone here probably
has a smartphone

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.720
in their pocket with catalogs
upon catalogs of music.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.770
OZARK HENRY: Even I do.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.050
And I think it's great.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.466
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
How do you get

00:24:05.466 --> 00:24:08.460
around the ubiquity of that,
though, to present them?

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.560
How do you first explain
even what they're missing,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.260
and then also translate this
experience to those devices?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.489
I mean, it's easy for us to set
up here with this great speaker

00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:21.155
system that these
guys have put in here,

00:24:21.155 --> 00:24:22.988
but obviously you can't
walk down the street

00:24:22.988 --> 00:24:25.170
with this rig around you.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.570
How do you get
that to the pocket?

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.287
OZARK HENRY: Well, the thing is
that for now it's just trying

00:24:30.287 --> 00:24:31.370
to communicate what it is.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.500
The only way to do it
is to experience it.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.930
RONALD PRENT: But
there are developments

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.340
in the new technology.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.510
For now, we use a pure
audio Blu-ray technology

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.980
to be able to play it with
or without video in 9.1.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.250
But sooner, it also will
be possible to stream

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.210
this in 9.1 lossless.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.330
And in late spring,
on Android devices

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.810
we'll be able to play back
from Android devices in 9.1

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.800
and stream it.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.258
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And we have
some of the representatives

00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:05.067
from Auro-3D here.

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:06.900
They were the ones who
brought in the system

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.276
and set it all up.

00:25:08.276 --> 00:25:09.650
And in our
conversations, they've

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.560
mentioned things like, yes,
we have these big playback

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.070
systems that can do the 9.1
set up, or even larger set ups,

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.786
but also encoders that work in
stereo left and right for that.

00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:25.160
So you don't have to go out
and retrofit your entire home

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.237
theater system to
be able to reap

00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:28.570
the benefits of this technology.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.260
So that's great.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.470
We've seen game changers before.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.040
The CD changed the
musical landscape.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.260
And then we've also seen
failed game changers,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.189
like who has a minidisc player?

00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:44.730
I actually do have
a minidisc player.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.367
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, me too.

00:25:46.367 --> 00:25:48.200
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's a great technology,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.091
but it didn't stick.

00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.634
And you said you
were doing this.

00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:53.425
We're working toward
the streaming element,

00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:56.720
but right now it's Blu-ray.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.820
What if it turns out that
Blu-ray doesn't stick?

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.840
OZARK HENRY: But I think
the Blu-ray doesn't.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.440
Everything will become you can
stream it, you can download it.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.680
I think the idea to put all your
effort in a carrier is weird.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.820
It's like having a phone
with a bad receiver.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.610
And the only effort you do is
to make it smaller and smaller

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.030
instead of working
on a better receiver.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.000
I think the technology
is out there.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.420
You can make this wonderful.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.680
You have a great canvas
to make wonderful music.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.810
And if the platforms make
it available, which is,

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:36.890
I think, just saying a yes
or a go, then there we are.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.430
And then of course, you have the
choice to build up your system.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.010
There's a lot of people
already having a 5.1 system.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.630
When making this
album, of course,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.110
we started-- because it was our
dream to have the 9.1 set up.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.960
And then Ronald made
versions in 5.1 and stereo.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.240
So you can downsize.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.840
And of course, we also have
an MP3 version of this album.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.220
So it's out there
in many formats.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.380
The question is not what
could be the best carrier

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.010
to hold all those formats.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.510
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That seems to be

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.620
a common thread across
many artistic media lately,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.990
is getting away from the
sticking point of the medium,

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.220
and finding a way to get
back to the actual creation,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.607
the actual experience.

00:27:20.607 --> 00:27:22.690
RONALD PRENT: And up the
quality for the listener.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.820
Bigger canvas.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.500
OZARK HENRY: I think if
we would talk about wine,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.277
we would never have
this discussion.

00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:33.860
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It wouldn't matter

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.139
what bottle it would come in.

00:27:35.139 --> 00:27:36.180
You'd focus on the taste.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.638
OZARK HENRY: No,
I mean if we would

00:27:37.638 --> 00:27:40.290
downsize the quality that much.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:45.050
I'm a wine lover, so for
me, this makes sense.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.510
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
touched on the home theater

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.090
applications, which, of
course, you think 5.1 surround,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.365
you think home theater or
movie theater applications.

00:27:52.365 --> 00:27:55.910
so that's film and now music,
and being able to present

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.070
it that way, but there's more.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.964
You were talking about
maybe sports applications

00:28:00.964 --> 00:28:01.630
in various ways.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.650
And then your great
upcoming project as well.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.420
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, well
I'm a goodwill ambassador

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.400
in the fight against
human trafficking.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.190
And I want to make an
immersive sound experience that

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.950
can travel from music festival
to music festival that

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.950
gives people an
experience of like three

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.980
minutes, an experience
of how it feels

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.460
to have your identity taken
away and to have control

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.030
of your life taken away.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.600
Why?

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.224
Because a lot of
people don't know what

00:28:33.224 --> 00:28:35.480
human trafficking is about.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.980
They don't know
what it stands for,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:43.380
and therefore they don't
recognize when it happens.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.160
That's also the case
mainly for victims.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.140
They don't realize that they are
victims of human trafficking.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.060
And if you realize that
human trafficking is

00:28:53.060 --> 00:29:01.700
as lucrative as the whole
industry around drugs or arms,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.450
then you know it's a
big thing in itself,

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.250
and it's something we have
to do something about it.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.250
It shames us all, and
every country in the world

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.070
is affected by it.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.950
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Even
just discussing it before,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.290
the idea, the concept of being
inside of a shipping container

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.220
and being exposed to the
sound experiences in a three

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.050
dimensional way, it
gives me anxiety.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.730
It makes me feel
uncomfortable even

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.990
thinking about the concept.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.160
So I hope that you can find what
you need to fully realize that.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.001
And I hope that in the
future we can find--

00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:37.250
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, and I
hope it will have its effect,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.690
and that people think about
it and realize that it's not

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.932
as invisible as we think.

00:29:44.932 --> 00:29:47.390
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Have you
done a lot of-- and maybe this

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.200
is actually a question
better for you in the studio

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.470
environment, a lot of
discussion with this technology

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.928
and with this
approach to recording

00:29:53.928 --> 00:29:55.290
music with other artists?

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.650
And what sort of
feedback are you

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.450
getting from other musicians?

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:05.810
RONALD PRENT: We've done not
recording a project like Piet's

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.830
from the beginning,
but at the moment,

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:11.240
we also do a lot of
back catalog when

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.590
there's interesting material.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.710
We did Tiesto "Elements
of Life" album.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.550
That's 10 years old this year.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.330
We did "Dead" in 9.1, which
is original dance music.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.310
And it's amazing that stuff
that's done 10 years ago,

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.620
and you get only the
way they work in steps--

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.370
in groups of instruments.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.600
Like you could still do
with immersive sound to make

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.350
a different experience
in the dance.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.430
And I've just recently
done a project

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.360
with a guy called [? Press. ?]
He's a DJ out of London,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.970
and that's EDM music.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.790
And that's a brand new album
that comes out in two months.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.370
And we've done a
9.1 version of it.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.670
And it's for them, it's drugs.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.260
I did three tracks for tryout.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:57.760
He came.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.670
He sat there.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.610
He sat the whole day and
listened to these three tracks

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.570
and went out of his mind.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.860
He said, this is possible?

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.360
I said, yes.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.050
This is possible
with all your music.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:13.880
And then the other eight tracks
that I had to mix got remixed.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.050
He went back to London,
and I got new versions.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.110
Because he knew
what was possible.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.260
He went along, and
because for them it's

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.545
a permanent creative process
of creating and then mixing,

00:31:25.545 --> 00:31:28.220
it's very close together.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.430
And in 9.1, that's a bit
more difficult, that process

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.360
for him.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.160
Because he cannot change
everything every 10 seconds.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.080
But they do, and they come
up with great ideas what

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.580
to do with beats and how to use
the speakers in an arrangement.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.820
To not put something in
the top, because it's

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.720
nice to put it there.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.790
It's because it has a function
in music, and even in EDM.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:54.440
I tell you, it's not what I play
at home, but it's great to mix.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.250
It's really fun to be in,
because there's no limitations.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.210
You have this big space, where
you can put all kinds of sounds

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.400
in and create a vibe
for five minutes.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.120
And so you see that when you
bring artists into that process

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.180
early or even later, they start
rethinking their whole-- oh,

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.020
now I can do this.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:16.680
Now I can do this.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.971
Now I can have this excitement.

00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:20.970
Now I can have this dark mood.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.460
And it's much easier
for them to produce it,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.880
because in stereo you have this
little, small window that you

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.710
have to look through, and have
to cramp everything in there,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.670
and they want
everything in there.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.820
So it sometimes
becomes a flat thing

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.230
that we then make loud so
everybody thinks it's exciting.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.140
Whereas if you give
them this whole space,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.370
it doesn't have to be loud.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.540
Because it's loud because
of the space that there is.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.190
So you don't need
all the processing

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.980
that we now in today's
world use to make everything

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.500
brutally loud so they
think we listen to it.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.640
And it's really this small.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.160
It's like his canvas.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.147
It's a small window
that you look through.

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.230
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We're
going to leave some time

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.415
available for questions
and answers from you

00:33:07.415 --> 00:33:08.290
guys in the audience.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.640
We do have the mic set up
in the aisles for that.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.419
But we did promise you
a listening experience.

00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:15.710
So I think we'll bring up a
little bit of house lights,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.530
because we want to encourage
you guys to be mobile.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.750
Experience it in the
box, outside of the box.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.487
Let some people change up sides.

00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:24.320
But you guys brought
some listening samples.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.920
So maybe you want to set that
up and explain the audio.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.200
RONALD PRENT: Piet?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.783
OZARK HENRY: I think
first we're going

00:33:30.783 --> 00:33:33.395
to listen to a song called
"Love is Free to Interfere."

00:33:33.395 --> 00:33:37.700
And they're going to
switch from stereo to 9.1.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.020
So to give you an idea in
what way the dimension changes

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.000
and also the positioning of
where the instruments are

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.458
completely changes.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.350
OZARK HENRY: So as you can hear,
it's a different dimension.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.558
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's
amazing how different it is.

00:37:21.558 --> 00:37:23.630
I mean, even just
sitting here on stage,

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.130
the change between the 9.1
mixes and the stereo mixes

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.300
is so vast.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.330
And we're technically
on the outside

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.886
of the box and the system, but--

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:37.260
RONALD PRENT: And again, if
you compared with a painting,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.640
it's just looking at a
different angle of the painting.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.440
Even if you're not
inside the circle,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.751
and it's just a different
way of looking at the light.

00:37:44.751 --> 00:37:46.750
OZARK HENRY: And as long
as you're in this space

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.580
and you move, it's like
going to a concert.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.580
You're always in
that experience.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.850
You're always in that
moment, and that's

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:55.990
what's so cool about it.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Every
bit, turning the head,

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.950
turning your body,
it changes everything

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.825
about the experience.

00:38:01.825 --> 00:38:02.450
It's very cool.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.930
I think we have one
more good sample that we

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.170
can play in the full 9.1.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.308
And then we'll move
on to questions.

MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: That is
something unlike anything I've

ever experienced before.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.299
So you definitely
nailed it there.

00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:45.590
I think we do want to open
it up to audience questions.

And we have a few
minutes for that.

00:42:51.076 --> 00:42:52.950
We would be remiss if
we didn't take a moment

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:58.153
to thank Nico from Auro-3D and
[INAUDIBLE], who came to set

00:42:58.153 --> 00:43:00.966
all this wonderful stuff up.

00:43:00.966 --> 00:43:03.050

around a bit after.

able to field that.

But why don't we
start over here?

00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:07.900
Go ahead.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:08.723
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:43:08.723 --> 00:43:09.970
Thank you for the experience.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:10.940
It was great.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.720
I was wondering, was
there any thought

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.338
put into adding a layer
in the center speaker?

00:43:15.338 --> 00:43:17.974
And if not, what was
the reason for that?

00:43:17.974 --> 00:43:19.140
RONALD PRENT: Adding a what?

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.015
AUDIENCE: The front and
center speaker, there

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:22.520
was no layer added to that one.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.061
I was wondering whether there
was any thought put in to that.

00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:27.370
Was there any specific
reason for that or not?

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.987
RONALD PRENT: No,
it was intentional.

00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:32.320
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: There are
arrangements of the system

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.110
where you use a voice of God.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.651
RONALD PRENT: There
is an arrangement

00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:39.470
of the system in 10.1, where
there is a center top speaker.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.232
But the music format
in Auro-3D is 9.1,

00:43:42.232 --> 00:43:45.905
the way it's set up here.

00:43:45.905 --> 00:43:49.865
So there is an 11.1 for cinema,
and there's a 13.1 also.

00:43:49.865 --> 00:43:52.670
But for music, they
have chosen the 9.1,

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:56.810
because that is commonly
easiest to integrate into a home

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.784
system.

00:43:57.784 --> 00:43:58.450
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.220
RONALD PRENT: At the moment.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.851
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Please, go ahead.

00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:03.140
AUDIENCE: I think you might
have just answered my question,

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.020
but I was going to
ask how you chose

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.440
9.1 when it seems
like adding more

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.220
and more speakers in
an ever denser array

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.321
would just be even better.

00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:15.820
RONALD PRENT: But
more speakers also

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.800
can give more problems in
timing between the speakers.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.460
5.1 is an established
format, and the added four

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:28.870
high speakers or the 5 if you
use the center top speaker,

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:33.330
give you enough space to use
them as discrete sources.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:39.070
So it's not mapped encoding like
there is Dolby or DTS, where

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.020
you have grids where
you map your speakers

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.320
in certain places.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.310
But that gives timing issues.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.000
This is a discrete
system in that sense,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.060
and like I said,
easier to integrate

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.252
into the home than
more speakers.

00:44:53.252 --> 00:44:54.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: OK.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.360
AUDIENCE: We were talking
about this earlier.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.870
I've worked in a few sound
reinforcement situations, where

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.330
it's like an
auditorium like this,

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.450
but it's 10 times the size.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.270
It hold two or three
thousand people.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.800
And that configuration
was set up

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.510
with pockets of stereo
in different places

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.450
with various delays.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.920
Is there too much
going on in 9.1

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.500
to do something like that in a
similar situation, where you'd

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.870
have pockets of
9.1 so that people

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:25.660
can experience in their
pocket of the auditorium?

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.535
Or does that take away
from the experience

00:45:27.535 --> 00:45:28.910
like we were doing
earlier, where

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.118
we were walking around in it?

00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:32.370
RONALD PRENT: That would
take away from that.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.920
We haven't done any
experience like that.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.440
In the past, we did it
for a group of 150 people.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.890
And it's still a circle.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:43.750
It's still containable.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.110
If you go outside
that, for instance, we

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.280
were talking only about clubs.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.470
What could we do there?

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:54.410
You have to then work
with PA-related systems,

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.340
where you have to
use the timing.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.470
But if you do it with clusters,
in the experiments that we have

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.320
done with Meyer
Sound, it's still

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.770
you have to contain the
circle to have the experience.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:09.660
If you start adding
extra 9.1 clusters of it,

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.910
then the experience goes away.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.190
It becomes almost stereo.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:17.270
But it is doable, but it's
not done on a big scale yet.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.125
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:19.125 --> 00:46:21.000
AUDIENCE: My technical
question was answered,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.980
so I have a question
for Piet, actually.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.700
So you mentioned before in
the beginning of your career

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.530
that you were struggling more.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.920
And I'm also from
Belgium, so I guess

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.277
I know a little bit of
the back story and so on.

00:46:32.277 --> 00:46:34.610
And it struck me that compared
to other Belgian artists,

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:38.170
you, even if you were struggling
in the first few albums,

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.480
you always were at the
same time building out

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.170
a more international career
than some of the others.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.340
But more in the shadows,
whereas other Belgian bands,

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.170
they got write-ups in the press
about their American tour,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.920
even if nobody showed up, but
they made a big deal out of it.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.740
And now you're a UN ambassador.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.070
And you've covered David
Bowie, and he tells you

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.400
what he thinks of it and so on.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.850
Was that a deliberate
choice to stay away

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.110
from Belgium in
some sense, and work

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.260
on an international career?

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.136
Or is that just how--

00:47:04.136 --> 00:47:05.635
OZARK HENRY: No,
not really, no, no.

00:47:05.635 --> 00:47:06.920
I just go where I'm invited.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.600
So it just took me by surprise.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.800
Because as you know, there's
a French part of Belgium

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.700
and a Flemish part of Belgium.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.750
I think you're probably
from the Flemish Part

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:21.375
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:23.680
OZARK HENRY:
Because I was really

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.770
going good in the French
part starting out, and being

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:27.500
quite famous.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:32.609
But that was the funny thing
about such a small country,

00:47:32.609 --> 00:47:35.150
that apparently what happens on
the other side, nobody knows.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.358
AUDIENCE: Yeah, nobody knows.

00:47:36.358 --> 00:47:37.615
It's true.

00:47:37.615 --> 00:47:40.590
Anyway, it's great to hear a
song like "Godspeed," that's

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.440

long in this completely

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.500

question about a maybe

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.790
competing audio technology.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.290

of it, but it's

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.950
where you record from
the full 3D environment

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:59.110
with two microphones that are
the distance of the human ears.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.392
And it creates the
same kind of 3d thing,

00:48:01.392 --> 00:48:03.600
and then you have to play
it back through headphones.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.920
Can you compare and contrast
that technology and this one?

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.160
And if you could remember
the name of that one,

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.540
that'd be really nice.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.915
RONALD PRENT:
There were several.

00:48:11.915 --> 00:48:13.248
But binaural--

00:48:13.248 --> 00:48:15.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's the on.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.976
RONALD PRENT: Technology.

00:48:16.976 --> 00:48:20.230
But it gives you the feel
that you're very isolated

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.139
in your headphones.

00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:22.680
That's why some
people didn't like it

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.600
and other people like it.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.800
This, you cannot
compare the two.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.927
The experience is
completely different.

00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:31.010
AUDIENCE: So in this one,
you can move around more

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.330
in the space, and it changes.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.538
RONALD PRENT: Here, you can
move around in the space,

00:48:34.538 --> 00:48:38.780
and it's like looking through
a picture at a different angle.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.110
There in the center, you have
the most beautiful experience.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.690
But if you're
sitting on the side,

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:48.530
you are looking at a different
angle of the same picture

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.427
and have a similar experience.

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.760
You hear the same things, but
you hear them differently.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.220
But they still
relate to each other.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.832
And in binaural in a
headphone is only you.

00:48:58.832 --> 00:49:00.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's
sort of a fixed point.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.415
RONALD PRENT: It's
a fixed point, yeah.

00:49:02.415 --> 00:49:05.480
And it's happens inside
your head, not around you.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.390
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
if there's any work being done

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.720
in live applications of this.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.971
For example, in TV, they
do editing on the fly

00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:18.220
all the time, switch from
one camera to another camera

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.290
and so forth.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.140
I can almost imagine
having a live concert

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.460
with a group of sound
engineers who are also

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.240
part of the performers as
well, and they're actually

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.330
mixing and moving
different sounds

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.040
to different parts of the stage.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.640
RONALD PRENT: We can
when we mix it in post.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.790
We could do it.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:39.680
I haven't done it yet.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.270
It's not required.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.430
I know they're working on
a broadcast application.

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:49.470
I'm imagining a
sports event in 9.1.

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.525
I've heard a sports
event in 9.1.

00:49:52.525 --> 00:49:55.020
And it's made a picture.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.944
It's amazing.

00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:57.610
You might like football
all of a sudden.

00:50:00.825 --> 00:50:02.670
And the same goes
for live concerts.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.090
If you can do them
in 9.1, then it

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.620
is a totally
different experience.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.220
5.1 is exciting, but
this is a different life.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.900
But currently, there are not
applications available for that

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.780
at the moment.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.860
AUDIENCE: I could just
see the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.050
becoming a performer as well.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.799
RONALD PRENT: Yeah,
you become part of it.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.050
AUDIENCE: So you
used the analogy

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:29.160
that in stereo, you make
the music louder to make

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.410
it feel like you're present.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.320
And with the more speakers,
it doesn't have to be as loud.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.450
Well, this was plenty loud.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:39.020
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, I mean
this is also a piece of music

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.110
where the orchestra
gets at the highest

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.010
and most dynamic points.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.010
So that's what you feel.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.980
If it would be in
a venue, you also

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.570
feel that it's almost too much.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.600
So that's a very natural--

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.210
AUDIENCE: So what
I was wondering

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:59.050
was if you could comment on
the possibility of making music

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.000
that as present but not as loud.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.881
Probably because many of
us are facing problems

00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:06.380
with our hearing,
because we've been

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.064
listening to our headphones
on loud for a while.

00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:10.980
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, and
also listening to music

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.452
in a very bad quality that
has no natural dynamic.

00:51:13.452 --> 00:51:15.160
If you're listening
to music, the dynamic

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.940
is always at its height,
which is very unnatural.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.140
If an object falls
on the ground,

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:28.100
like on a concrete floor, it
makes a very hard and loud

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.650
sound, but it's just an instant.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:32.420
It's not constantly.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.430
If you put your
little earphones in,

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:39.270
it's like that thing banging
the ground but for hours.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.950
It's normal that you go deaf.

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:43.800
You will never have
this with the system.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.610
The moment that it goes
loud, it's a dynamic.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:47.470
It's an instant.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:48.580
It's not all of the time.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.000
It's a natural dynamic.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.040
Natural dynamic doesn't
damage your ears.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.040
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It
speaks to a conversation.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.530
OZARK HENRY: I think it's
true, what I'm saying.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.300
Even like from a
medical point of view,

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.620
this is the way not to go deaf.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.370
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's been a long time.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.450
OZARK HENRY: Even if
you would put it louder,

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.870
but you don't have to,
because the quality at source

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.400
is also more interesting.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.610
Music is louder because
we have a poor quality,

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.741
and we try to boost
what's not there.

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:20.810
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's
been an ongoing conversation

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.110
in the audio engineering
world for sure.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.080
You get into conversation
about compression,

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.720
and how much you're just
squeezing everything in

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.999
to take up all the space
that you have available.

00:52:29.999 --> 00:52:31.290
RONALD PRENT: The loudness war.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:32.956
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, it's basically

00:52:32.956 --> 00:52:35.340
someone leaning on your ear
drum for 3 and 1/2 minute.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.560
RONALD PRENT: Yeah, it
turns into big noise.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.393
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Then breathe, come back.

00:52:38.393 --> 00:52:40.856
OZARK HENRY: Yeah, just putting
your finger straight in.

00:52:40.856 --> 00:52:42.630
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Go ahead.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.970
AUDIENCE: So I've tinkered
with ambisonics in the past.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:48.860
And I'm wondering how your
technology compares to that.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.450
So with ambisonics, you
have your sound source

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.200
somewhere in a certain location.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.360
And then you have an
immediate mathematical mapping

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.160
from the sound source
and the location

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.970
to the individual
signals for the speakers.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:04.000
Now, the way you set up
your mics in the recording,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.530
I don't think you have such
straight forward mappings.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.280
So I'm wondering how this works.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.500
RONALD PRENT: No, it is
basically just great mixing.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:16.330
I've chosen for three different
sorts of microphoning.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:19.060
And then I've sat
down on a console

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.320
and panned them
where I want them.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.091
And it's all discrete
audio, so just

00:53:24.091 --> 00:53:25.340
discrete channels, no mapping.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.240
It's where I put when
I mix it, where we

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.910
decide we want to hear a sound.

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:30.850
That's where it goes.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:33.560
That's where it stays
in the creative process.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.790
And afterwards, it
doesn't get mapped.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.770
Of course, it has to be encoded
to be played back from a disk,

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.210
but it's linear.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:43.910
There's no software
involved that tells you

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:47.007
where the sound has to go.

00:53:47.007 --> 00:53:47.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.250
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I think we
have time for probably two more

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.750
questions.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:51.560
So we'll take one more
here and one there.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:51.850
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:53.850
I'd like to say thank you
very much for bringing

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:56.240
this beautiful, immersive
sound experience to us.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.110
It's not easy to be able to
experience this, especially

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:00.950
the media as well.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:04.480
A lot of the questions
here were answered with,

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.310
we chose 9.1 to add a
layer on top of 5.1,

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:10.360
because it's the most direct
for bringing to the home.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.270
It's a sad truth,
however, a lot of homes

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.920
don't have proper
sound dampening, right?

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.320
Sound damping.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.310
In that situation, is it more
difficult to listen to and damp

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.900
for a 9.1 system versus a 5.1?

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.210
And what are the effects
of no damping at all,

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.120
or poor damping?

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.720
Is it more exacerbated?

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.260
Or does the height
layer actually

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.400
help a less properly
damped system?

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.260
RONALD PRENT: In my
own home experience,

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.690
it actually helps to
have a bigger experience

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.430
where you have the speakers.

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.805
At home, you don't
necessarily need big speakers.

00:54:47.805 --> 00:54:50.540
Auro does also demos
in a little cubicle

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.810
with nine little speakers.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.410
And it works also, you could
do it with these speakers.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:02.000
At home, even if it's
very reverb in your room,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.890
with the top speakers, you
actually get a better picture

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.820
than with just 5.1.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.520
It's my experience at home.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:12.910
I did put a carpet on the floor
at the end to make it better,

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:18.062
but I have this little
speaker, and it works.

00:55:18.062 --> 00:55:19.520
You don't need big
speakers to have

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.680
a powerful, immersive
experience, whereas sometimes

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.460
in the high end
systems, you end up

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.570
with bigger speakers to
have a good representation

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:31.450
of the music.

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:32.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.908
RONALD PRENT: You're welcome.

00:55:33.908 --> 00:55:36.150
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
OK, last one.

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:39.335
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming
here, and a simple question.

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:45.910
For ages, all the creators
have had this subconscious bias

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.700
where everything
they're creating

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:54.040
is for the front platforms only.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.665
Now with technologies
and immersive

00:55:56.665 --> 00:56:01.880
sound being created in a
way where you could place

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.480
a listener in the
center of the platform

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.540
instead of putting in front
of them or opposing them,

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:09.110
do you see the
creative processes

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:14.240
themselves changing or evolving
so that, say, the composer is

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.380
going to say, OK, for this one,
I'm going place my cello number

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.442
two and three in this
corner, and my triangles

00:56:22.442 --> 00:56:25.480
at a little height or
something like that?

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.700
OZARK HENRY: I think if
it makes sense to the work

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.620
that you're writing, sure.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.202
Sure, because you would do so.

00:56:34.202 --> 00:56:38.790
The interesting thing is that
it becomes the same thing

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.490
as almost performing.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:42.530
If you perform, you'll
also choose a certain set

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.280
up that is reacting to the room.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.860
If the room has a
different sound,

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.140
then you will also place
the instruments sometimes

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.310
in a different way, because
some groups become too loud,

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.510
and you want to control
that, because it's not

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:59.890
amplified the way we play.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:01.410
So it's exactly the same thing.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.450
You have a space, and
within that space,

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.140
you want something to happen.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.090
And the way you put
things in that space

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:12.785
is totally your choice,
and it's your freedom.

00:57:12.785 --> 00:57:14.160
And that's what's
so interesting.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.250
Because all of a sudden,
that frame is gone,

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:20.480
and you have a full
room to work in.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.280
And it feels that
everybody who's listening

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.700
is also participating.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.510
And the fact that
you realize that

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.346
makes you more ambitious
about what you're doing.

00:57:29.346 --> 00:57:30.470
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:31.840
Thank you.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.340
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do you find
yourself in a creative place

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:34.990
again now?

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:36.304
I mean, I know that you're out.

00:57:36.304 --> 00:57:37.970
You're talking about
the record, talking

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.600
about sharing this
experience with people

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.070
of what you've made.

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:46.860
How much are the wheels
turning for the next thing?

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.000
OZARK HENRY: I'm writing.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.180
I'm ready to go.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.704
I've got way too much material,
which is always the case.

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:56.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And for
the few people out there

00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:00.930
who are waiting for maybe a
Word reunion for the next album

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.150
to come out and be
9.1 and hip hop?

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.367
Would you go back
to your beginnings?

00:58:07.367 --> 00:58:08.450
OZARK HENRY: I don't know.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.442
I don't know.

00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:11.900
What I'm doing now is something
that I haven't done before.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:17.530
Without saying much about it,
it has become more world music.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:21.710
And I'm still looking
for people to help me out

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:26.810
on financing my 9.1
version, to be honest.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:31.080
Doing all this is something
that I support myself.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.380
I don't get any
support from a label.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:38.670
I love it, but it's not like
a commercially great idea

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:41.884
to invest in for now.

00:58:41.884 --> 00:58:43.300
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, we thank

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.920
you very much for taking
the time to come and join us

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.410
at Google today.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:46.010
OZARK HENRY: Cheers.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.610
Thank you.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.626
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's an honor.

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:51.160
OZARK HENRY: Thank you.
