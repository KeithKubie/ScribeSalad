You might think your hair and eye color are
permanent, but in reality, they could change

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.110
at ANY TIME.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:13.120
And it definitely already changed once.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.760
Greetings programs, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.580
Many babies are born with blue eyes, and then
their eyes change color as their genes continue

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.580
to develop.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.840
Hair color is the same way, sometimes, babies
are born with very light colored hair which

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.109
gradually darkens.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.270
We got a few questions on this, so we did
the digging!

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.070
The colored part of the eye is the iris, it
controls how much light is let into the eyeball

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.570
and it's color is determined by melanin, just
like skin and hair.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.440
Darker colors absorb more light, and lighter
colors reflect more.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.040
Eye color is determined by a few different
genetic factors, the most important being

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.130
OCA2.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.700
OCA2 produced melanocytes, or melanin producing
cells.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.850
Melanin is the protein that creates skin,
eye, and hair color.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.800
More melanin means darker eyes, hair, or skin.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.549
The COLOR of the melanin in the eyes is determined
by three OTHER[a] genes, EYCL1, 2 and 3.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.459
Together, they account for brown/green/blue
but not hazel or grey eyes, science is still

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:12.079
working on how we get those.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.540
All blue-eyed people can trace their ancestry
back to a single human born between 6 and

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.950
10,000 years ago.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.259
Due to a genetic mutation, a human was born
with a tiny switch right before the OCA2 gene,

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.319
that limits the expression of the melanin,
kind of like diluting the stream of the protein.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.509
Individuals with albinism or Albinos have
the OCA2 gene completely shut off -- so their

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.100
skin, eyes, and hair have no melanin at all!

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.960
With this in mind, let's apply it to babies.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.229
When we're born, our genetics are decided,
but the body hasn't necessarily acted on all

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.600
the genes in your DNA.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.169
When it comes to eye color, the melanin controlled
by the OCA2 gene is diluted and thus we all

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:54.770
have blue eyes.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.640
For those with that blue-eye gene mutation
they eyes stay blue.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.709
But for the vast majority of us, once we're
born the OCA2 gene kicks into gear, creating

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.619
melanocytes to make proteins and the eyes
turn a different color, somewhere between

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.230
9 months and two years after birth.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.120
A medium amount of the melanin makes eyes
green or hazel, a large amount makes them

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120
brown.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.190
With regard to hair, the melanin builds up
the same as in eyes, creating a dark color.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.120
As babies age, their melanin levels increase
and their hair will darken.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.209
Hair colors can change well into puberty,
as some genes aren't "switched on" until the

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.799
hormones flood the body in adolescence.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.290
Eventually, usually in the 30s, human hair
stops producing melanin and begins to turn

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.290
grey.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.080
Basically, it stops adding color to the hair.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.989
Gray hair tends to occur earlier in Caucasians
and later in Asians.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.349
It's important to point out, that not ALL
babies are born with blue eyes.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.049
This mainly occurs with Caucasian babies,
maybe because of the lower levels of overall

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.260
melanin due to the lighter skin tone.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.249
Babies of Asian, African and Hispanic genetic
heritages will likely be born with dark eyes

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.249
that stay dark.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.840
Funnily enough, 10-15 percent of Caucasians
report their eye color continued to change

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.609
into adulthood, so it's possible your peepers
are still not settled!

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.640
What's your favorite eye color?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.090
