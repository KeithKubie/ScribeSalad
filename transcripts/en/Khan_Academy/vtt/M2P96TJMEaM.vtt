00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.430
- [Instructor] Miriam was
testing her null hypothesis

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.100
that the population mean of some data set

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.560
is equal to 18 versus her
alternative hypothesis

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.870
is that the mean is less than 18

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.520
with a sample of seven observations.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.530
Her test statistic, I
can never say that right,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.990
was t is equal to negative 1.9.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.550
Assume that the conditions
for inference were met.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.820
What is the approximate p
value for Miriam's test?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.270
So, pause this video and see if you

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.290
can figure this out on your own.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.790
Alright, what I always like
to remind ourselves what's

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.810
going on here before I go ahead
and calculate the p value.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.700
There's some data set,
some population here

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.840
and the null hypothesis is
that the true mean is 18,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.320
the alternative is that it's less than 18.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.000
To test that null hypothesis,
Miriam takes a sample,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
sample size is equal to seven.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.320
From that, she would
calculate her sample mean

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.200
and her sample standard deviation,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.830
and from that, she would
calculate this t statistic.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.420
The way she would do that or if they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.220
didn't tell us ahead
of time what that was.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.490
We would say the t statistic
is equal to her sample mean,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.050
minus the assumed mean
from the null hypothesis,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.380
that's what we have over here, divided by

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.830
and this is a mouthful, our approximation

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.220
of the standard error of the mean.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.840
The way we get that approximation,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.950
we take our sample standard deviation

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.560
and divide it by the square
root of our sample size.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.270
Well, they've calculated
this ahead of time for us.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.370
This is equal to negative 1.9.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.750
So, if we think about a t distribution,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.170
I'll try to hand draw a rough
t distribution really fast,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.750
and if this is the mean
of the t distribution,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.040
what we are curious about,
because our alternative

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.280
hypothesis is that the
mean is less than 18.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.770
What we care about is,
what is the probability

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.520
of getting a t value that
is more than 1.9 below

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.860
the mean so this right
over here, negative 1.9.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.090
It's this area, right there.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.930
I'm gonna do this with a TI-84,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.310
at least an emulator of a TI-84.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.460
All we have to do is, we
would go to 2nd distribution

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.030
and then I would use the t cumulative

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600
distribution function so let's go there,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.300
that's the number six
right there, click enter.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.190
My lower bound...

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.100
Yeah, I essentially wanted
it to be negative infinity

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.050
and we can just call
that negative infinity.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.440
It's an approximation of negative

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.130
infinity, very, very low number.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.710
Our upper bound would be
negative 1.9, negative 1.9.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.810
And then our degrees of freedom,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.600
that's our sample size minus one.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.950
Our sample size is seven so our

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.620
degrees of freedom would be six.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.500
There we have it.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.500
This would be, our p value
would be approximately 0.053.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.320
Our p value would be approximately 0.053.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.000
Then what Miriam would do is,
would compare this p value

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.040
to her preset significance
level, to alpha.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.700
If this is below alpha,
then she would reject

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.860
her null hypothesis, which
would suggest the alternative.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.440
If this is above alpha, then she would

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.980
fail to reject her null hypothesis.
