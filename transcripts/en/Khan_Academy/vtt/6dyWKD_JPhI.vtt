00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.410
The graph below contains
the rectangle ABCP.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.600
Draw the image of ABCP under a
dilation whose center is at P

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.950
and a scale factor is 1 and 2/3.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.880
What are the lengths of
the side AB and its image?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.010
So we're going to do a
dilation centered at P.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.720
So if we're centering
a dilation at P

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.440
and its scale
factor is 1 and 2/3,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.120
that means once we
perform the dilation,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.440
every point is going to be 1 and
2/3 times as far away from P.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.520
Well P is 0 away from
P, so its image is still

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.260
going to be at P. So let's put
that point right over there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.205
Now point C is going
to be 1 and 2/3 times

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.580
as far as it is right now.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.180
So let's see, right
now it is 6 away.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.550
It's at negative 3.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.320
And P, its x-coordinate is the
same, but in the y direction,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.080
P is at 3.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.320
C is at negative 3.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.640
So it's 6 less.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.730
We want to be 1 and
2/3 times as far away.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.170
So what's 1 and 2/3 of 6?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.940
Well, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so
it's going to be 6 plus 4.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.830
You're going to be 10 away.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.870
So 3 minus 10, that
gets us to negative 7.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.070
So that gets us
right over there.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.500
Now point A, right
now it is 3 more

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.260
in the horizontal direction
than point P's x-coordinate.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.920
So we want to go
1 and 2/3 as far.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.670
So what is 1 and 2/3 times 3?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.480
Well that's going to be 3 plus
2/3 of 3, which is another 2.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.976
So that's going to be 5.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.600
So we're going to
get right over there.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.650
Then we could complete
the rectangle.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.710
And notice point B is
now 1 and 2/3 times

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.890
as far in the
horizontal direction.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.650
It was 3 away in the
horizontal direction,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.920
now it is 5 away from
P's x-coordinate.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.080
And in the vertical
direction, in the y direction,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.350
it was 6 below P's y-coordinate.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.430
Now it is 1 and
2/3 times as far.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.060
It is 10 below P's y-coordinate.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.750
So then let's answer
these questions.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
The length of segment AB--
well, we already saw that.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.380
That is, we're going
from 3 to negative 3.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.310
That is 6 units long.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.227
And its image, well
it's 1 and 2/3 as long.

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:28.060
We see it over here.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.850
We're going from
3 to negative 7.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.220
3 minus negative 7 is 10.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.940
It is 10 units long.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.930
We got it right.
