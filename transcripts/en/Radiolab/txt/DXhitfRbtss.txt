Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey Robert. Yes. Woken from a long desperate slumber. Robert Krulwich opens his left eye then his right alerted to the presence.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Hey Robert. Oh, right here. Okay. That's you. I have a thing I want, I would like to share with you and then, um, by extension the people out there. What would you like to share? Something you've been mulling. Yeah, so I recently completed a, a sort of a mini series, a in conjunction with a film that's now out in the world called boy erased for a project that we called unraced. If people can hear it like yeah, put it out for episodes. It's out there in the world, in the wild on iTunes, Spotify, all the places and uh, uh, I want to play one of the four today cause I think it's, it's just I think [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:44          I think in all honesty, I should probably say I've heard them as it happens. Yes. Here's the things that sort of like that sort of, I found sort of just about the third one at this. That's our first one. Here's a really important moment in American history, I guess you'd have to say in American cultural history. Yeah. And uh, it almost feels like a single individual walks into one room and says something startling to a group of very important people because of an accidental moment that he just happened to be over here talking a scholarly conversation. So by a crazy quilt of serendipity, enormous changes. Now, now this may be oversimplifying it and I'm sure there's a lot else going on. Deeper and shallow. We're rhythms, but the changes come almost by accident because someone misses a train. Yeah, yeah. That's a, that's a pretty good, you go, there you go. Okay. Uh, so can we play it? Yeah, let's play it.

Speaker 2:          01:46          This is unraced a new podcast that reveals the hidden history of conversion therapy in America. I'm Jad Abumrad. This is episode three. Let's start this episode by talking about one of the great successes in psychology.

Speaker 3:          02:01          If you are living with a mental health problem, it can be hard to know which way to turn or what to do to feel better. It's called CBT cognitive behavioral therapy. You hear about it sometimes in the news, uh, around, uh, treatments for PTSD. Like suppose a soldier is triggered by a loud sound. Well, what the therapists will sometimes do is take that same sound, play it for the person over and over, but under less and less stressful circumstances until gradually over time the sound gets less stressful. CVT focuses on goals and focuses mostly on the present day and things that are affecting you and your life. Now these kind of techniques can help people with gambling addiction, stop gambling. People who smoke, stop smoking. It is a hugely important wave in psychotherapy. It's often called the second wave. Freud was the first. This is the second. What follows is a story about one of the Grand Poobah because of this second wave in a grand awakening that he had, it kind of blew up the world

Speaker 4:          03:06          too.

Speaker 3:          03:07          Okay. Maybe that's overstating it, but no, no, no. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          03:12          Start, start from all you know about Jerry. So Jerry is a god. So

Speaker 3:          03:15          case in point, this guy, this is David Tesler, we bumped into him digging through some archives at the association for behavior. And cognitive therapy, central office. My colleague Shima Oli, I and him were hunting around for some tapes while they were, you sort of offhandedly mentioned that like yeah, Jerry. Oh, he's, he's trained practically everybody in the field.

Speaker 5:          03:33          We, we have this thing called, um, there's this river tree and it basically plots the several different people from whom almost every single contemporary psychologist came from. Cherry is one of the six because how many people own their careers to him?

Speaker 3:          03:58          You might call him one of the six cardinal bishops of contemporary psychology.

Speaker 5:          04:03          Hi. And My name is Sigmund Freud. Yeah. Yes. Gerald G. E R A. L D middle initial C, last name Davidson d a V. I s o n Professor of psychology at the University of Southern California. [inaudible]. Jerry grew up in the 1940s, Orthodox Jewish household playing stick ball in the streets of Boston at a time when the streets were pretty empty because of the war that was a good little boy and didn't get into trouble. And um, since he was kind of a quiet kid, wasn't a particularly cheerful child, I would say analytical, watchful. Anyhow, Jerry eventually finds himself one day working in a ham factory.

Speaker 3:          04:48          Pardon me?

Speaker 5:          04:51          Yeah. And a ham. They say like Hammon like ham and eggs. Wow, okay. Kind of a weird place for a Jewish kid to be. But there he was. So I had a job in the graveyard shift at the start, like at midnight and go until 8:00 AM one day he is at the ham factory or maybe on his way to the ham factory board. What was there to do? So I always, I was reading, somehow I settled on Freud's introductory lectures at Clark University, well that he gave and the early 20th century.

Speaker 3:          05:22          So he's reading Freud and the ham factory reading Freud's lectures and something about it hooks him, but also

Speaker 5:          05:29          horrifies it. This book made a profound impact on me.

Speaker 6:          05:33          I stopped at [inaudible], we moved to [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:48          okay, so this is Freud that you're hearing right now. Uh, don't know what the hell he's saying. Apparently this is the only recording of him that exists.

Speaker 6:          05:54          Well, um, concert.

Speaker 2:          05:56          He's talking about unconscious and kind of make that word out. And Jerry says, uh, the whole idea that you can like peel back the layers of a human psyche. It was absolutely

Speaker 7:          06:08          almost voyeuristically fascinating.

Speaker 2:          06:11          The same time he says, I felt like some of the things Freud was saying, which is kind of weird. How can foist say, if you dream of a

Speaker 8:          06:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:25          train going into a tunnel

Speaker 8:          06:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:31          you're really dreaming of having sex with your mother. Anyhow, something about the book both intrigued and enraged him enough that he goes to Stanford and then Stonybrook and to make a long story short ends up standing at exactly the right place where many streams converge to create the first real up ending of Freud, the behavioral therapy revolution. Previously it had been all about dreams and the subconscious. Now it was scientific that was about experiments. And you know, the basic question, how do you sit with a suffering human being and help them?

Speaker 7:          07:14          How do you make someone happier, less anxious, less suppressed?

Speaker 2:          07:20          Do you remember the first patients you started seeing?

Speaker 7:          07:22          Yeah, the so called [inaudible], you know the Avis y. A. V. I. S. It's another acronym called young, young. I went the ace stand for able or attractive, but they gave this patient, it's the patient.

Speaker 2:          07:42          We're living it up for you. Oh, it is. Okay. It is a term psychotherapies that described the [inaudible] young, attractive, verbal, intelligent and successful. That's it. You got it. So you know, early on he says he saw a lot of people who were um, your classic art variety neurotics, which is not a very complimentary term, but he says that is what they used to call them. But the whole reason we're telling you this story is that in that initial batch of patients, Jerry says, he began to see like fairly frequently these young men walk in. They were mostly young men who complained that they were sexually attracted to other men and they really wish they weren't. That's right. He says he can't remember how many exactly walked in. Maybe somewhere between four and a dozen.

Speaker 7:          08:27          I'm trying to think of there were, they all came and, and I supervise some cases in the training clinic at Brook. They all came because they weren't happy and they wanted to change. They wanted you to turn them from gay to straight. Yeah. Yeah. And not wanting to, you know, impose my heterosexual values on them. Some would say my heterosexist values on them. I would check it out with them.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Can you tell me a little bit about what

Speaker 1:          08:56          living situation is like your social life and whatnot and brands? Nancy got an apartment off campus I live with by myself

Speaker 5:          09:05          and in fact the film myself last year where I really played myself, I wasn't acting, but we did have a graduate student play the role of a troubled homosexual young man who wanted to change. You'll see in that film a pretty reasonable rendition.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Have you ever previously been to any therapists? No. In a thought. I'm going to you. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:29          Gary says that the film that he made, which you're hearing is sort of a composite of all the cases that he saw of this kind. And what you see in the film is hymns in a suit. Sitting in one chair a couple of feet away from him as a young man with big seventies hair,

Speaker 5:          09:42          not the same age kind of having trouble. And the guy explains that. He did. He did. He's having trouble concentrating.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Yeah. I, uh, I'm having a trouble getting down to work.

Speaker 9:          09:54          It turned out that he was recently frightened by an intensification of his lungs, standing attraction to men.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Gary says initially he had no idea what to do with these cases. They were anxious, very depressed. These were folks who, the kind of people who could, you know, commit suicide. He says he felt like you just had to help. That's what I was taught. That's what I was taught. And so in the film,

Speaker 5:          10:24          can't get into it. You don't, after maybe, I don't know, 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Well, I'd like to outline for you. Wait, I can procedure.

Speaker 8:          10:35          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:40          Now before we actually get into that procedure, uh, just a little bit of context isn't necessarily,

Speaker 6:          10:45          oh, I know that inside now I am sick. I'm not sick. Just sexually I'm sick in a lot of ways.

Speaker 2:          10:51          It's time. Jerry was not the only therapist in the situation. There were a lot of therapists all around the country trying to quote, help their gay patients

Speaker 6:          10:58          say, [inaudible] isn't back health. Anything that we can do to prevent future generation wrong suffering. This reflection must be

Speaker 2:          11:10          the overall approach. Certainly did not start with me. There were other people who were doing what was called behavior therapy with gaze. Most of it was a version.

Speaker 8:          11:23          Terrible change comes from poverty. The ordinance so strong, which was applying electric shocks when they saw pictures of same sex, you know, people,

Speaker 2:          11:34          um, or making them nauseated

Speaker 8:          11:40          with objections. You vomit again and again, all over everything.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Jerry, your members, one of the leading aversion therapists coming to Stoneybrook where he was training at the time to give a lecture and the Guy Shows 16 films of how it was done.

Speaker 10:         11:57          [inaudible] the screen,

Speaker 2:          11:58          the film showed researchers hooking up gay men, two electrodes to their fingers or their forearms. Show them pictures of men. Naked Man.

Speaker 10:         12:06          Okay, did you get your shot?

Speaker 2:          12:09          And then they would shock them, hurting them and flicking physical pain. They then show them another slide of a naked gay man. Do it again.

Speaker 10:         12:18          [inaudible] Hey,

Speaker 2:          12:20          this bothered me. Uh, just personally, this hat does this. It bought the idea of an, of intentionally inflicting physical pain. On other people. I just worried about it. It was cringeworthy. Interestingly, Jerry doesn't fall. The researchers who administered those shocks picture that they were like dentists before novacane in a pulling a tooth. I am old enough to remember what going to the dentist was like to get a filling or getting a tooth pulled, uh, before there was novacane find the right analogy though. I mean, if your tooth hurts, you need to have it pulled out. You don't need to have homosexuality pulled out if you may not think so. But if, if you're gay and the 1960

Speaker 11:         13:08          ultra Americans, I repelled by the mere notion of homosexuality,

Speaker 2:          13:11          your being haunted and discriminated against.

Speaker 11:         13:13          The CBS News survey shows that two out of three Americans look upon homosexuals. We've discussed discomfort or fear

Speaker 2:          13:21          being told that you're an evil person and you're disgusting. These people need help. And so what Feldman was trying to do Belvin was leading a version therapist. He was the guy that showed that film. He was doing the best that he could given what was available knowledge. You didn't, they were just trying to help the patient.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:39          yeah, yeah. That's why I don't demonize him in any case, as Jerry is sitting there in the back of the room watching this guy film and show this film of people being tortured.

Speaker 1:          13:51          Okay?

Speaker 2:          13:52          He says he just kept thinking cheese. Do we have to do it this way? But people were saying, well, but it works. And that's what the literature was telling us. But I was thinking, well, are there other ways to do it? And so what Jerry decided to do was take the basic idea of aversion therapy and flip it.

Speaker 1:          14:12          So what am I supposed to do now? And I'm supposed to argue. Well, um, I'd like you to follow me if you can. I don't want to say now,

Speaker 2:          14:21          and this is what you see in the film. He basically tells the patient, um, here's what I want you to do. Grab a copy of Playboy magazine.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Okay? A, you can probably get hold of a copy of playboy. Don't too much trouble. The new standards. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          14:34          go to the newsstand, get a copy. Playboy was what I thought of as a source of material of attractive women. Then he says, when you get back home, get yourself aroused or whatever you're accustomed to, think about a man thinking about his body,

Speaker 1:          14:46          you start masturbating with you, a homosexual image. Now there comes a point, you know, the inevitable point at that point of inevitability, switch over to the female picture. Have you had your climax? Okay. And, uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          15:07          misca idea was instead of shocking people in to hating their gay thoughts, he would gently encourage them to take their positive gay thoughts and map them onto a different [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         15:15          body. I fact, I think the technical term was orgasmic reorientation.

Speaker 3:          15:22          And in the video, apparently it seems to work in the video. A Jerry checks in with him about 10 times and the guy tells him, at first it was really hard for him to finish the deed while looking at female pictures. But then it got easier and easier until finally, after about 10 of these sessions,

Speaker 1:          15:40          I really feel like I'm really getting into it now. Uh, but happened was, um, every time I masturbated, I found now that I could go straight through without any trouble, you know, with uh, do you like, do you like what's happening? I think the thing I like most is I now see some direction, I feel myself moving towards something as opposed to not knowing which way I was going to go. And I think that's a good too.

Speaker 3:          16:07          Okay. Setting aside for a moment, the question of whether this therapy actually worked. Uh, I think you can guess the answer to that and it is not the point of the story. What happens next is that this therapy takes on an entirely surprising and consequential life of its own. And that's after the break. I'm Jen. I'm Rod unraced on radio lab. Yes. Continue in just a moment. This is Katie from big sky, Montana.

Speaker 2:          18:07          Hello Radio lab listeners. Are you hungry for an extra helping of science? Oh, of course you are. Have we got a podcast for you from wny c studios and the team behind the popular youtube series sideshow. It's sideshow Tangency, a new podcast where four friends, Sarah Riley, Sam Schultz, Stephan Chin, and me. Hank Green tried to outsmart and outwit each other, but usually we just get excited and talk about all the awesome science we're learning about. We also compete for who has found the coolest, weirdest, funniest scientific research on our weekly topic, which could be eggs or mucus or flight or the science of snow, ice and dragons. But one more thing. We also go on a lot of tangents, like if we've got something fun and kind of related to say about death metal or cartoons or the smell of space. It's size. Show tangents, subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 2:          19:01          Um, dad, I have him. Ron. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Yeah. And were listening to a story, a from a theory that I produced called erased. And let's get back now to the story of Dr. Jerry Davidson and the gay cure. It is in 1966 67 Jerry has pioneered this new kind of conversion therapy called orgasmic reorientation. He's made a video about it. Shortly after making this video, Jerry found himself reading the very magazine implicated in his therapy, naturally reading it just for the articles as they say, as they say. And I was reading the playboy forum, that's the section in the magazine where readers write letters, talk about stuff, voice concerns. And in the forum, this would have been around 1966 or 67. Um, there were people writing in trouble by their homosexuality. Here's when we found, when I was in the hospital, the doctor told me they were very few cures for cases like mine and I should try to adjust my condition. Well being a card carrying behavior therapist, I wrote a letter

Speaker 13:         20:06          [inaudible] playboy, crazy, isn't it? And I said, actually there are new procedures for helping gay men become less gay. It comes from behavior therapy and I don't know what else are about. Well they, they, they printed it.

Speaker 3:          20:25          What ensued in the playboy forum over the course of many issues, many years in fact was a vigorous back and forth. Jerry's letter prompts a series of other letters, some positive, some negative, uh, one in particular, which calls out a version therapy as this cruel thing, which then causes one of the world's leading aversion therapists. The guy by the name of David Bartalow to jump in and defend himself. He writes, our procedures are not torturous, are the inquisition rather methods derived from experimental laboratories and carefully applied to consenting human beings to relieve some suffering. That letter prompts a famous gay activist, Frank Caminie, to jump in with his own response. He writes, I find the August playboy forum letter if David H. Barlow offensive and illustrative not only of the failures of psychology and psychiatry and their approach to homosexuality,

Speaker 2:          21:16          but also of the dangers of human engineering. Here's the weird fact, Kim and his letter was titled, Gay is good, and just a few years later, post stone.

Speaker 14:         21:25          Well, Yay. Good. That phrase, Yay is proud.

Speaker 3:          21:35          The slogan of the entire gay rights movement, and this was maybe the first time that that phrase was used

Speaker 15:         21:42          in the pages of playboy. Everyone raves about how interactive the Internet is. People forget how Interactive Playboy magazine was.

Speaker 2:          21:56          Okay, so this is a little bit of a digression, but I think it's one so worth taking. That's James Peterson.

Speaker 15:         22:02          I was senior staff writer slash senior editor for Playboy magazine.

Speaker 2:          22:10          He worked at playboy from 1973 to 2003 he's sort of the institutional memory of the old playboy last man standing kind of there. Right. James reminded me actually, truth is, I never even knew this to begin with, a that Hugh Hefner's intent with playboy wasn't just to show naked ladies. He had a whole philosophy did he actually spelled out in great detail?

Speaker 15:         22:32          I call it the term paper that changed America

Speaker 8:          22:39          [inaudible] when, uh, Hefner was an undergraduate, the first Kinsey report on male sexuality,

Speaker 10:         22:45          it came out less. The research had been cops in [inaudible], 10 of the people have go off at random

Speaker 8:          22:51          and it was a bolt from the blue. It's changed Hefner's life. It came out, I think 1948 and it described the range of male sexuality without judgment. Kinsey described males on a range of one to five from strictly heterosexual to strictly homosexual, but in the middle where something like 35% of American men had had a homosexual experience in their adolescence or early adulthood. So the straight jacket was released

Speaker 3:          23:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         23:34          and what struck Hefner,

Speaker 10:         23:36          this to me is the value of a of Kenzie. The indicated for the first time, statistically the great disparity was this dissonance that existed between our

Speaker 2:          23:45          beliefs and the, uh, the actual actions of society between sex laws versus what people were actually do. This is one good reason for questioning some of the old morality. And so, uh, when Hefner started playboy along with the magazine and, uh, the playmates and along with all of the, uh, televised parties from the playboy mansion, we're glad you're here too. Along with all that James says, he wrote this constant stream of essays, monthly installments, one essay a month for two years, like really long essays on capitalism, religion, essays on the history of sex. Collectively it became known as the playboy philosophy. Uh, the philosophy really I think, uh, is an anti puritanism and James says behind the scenes, through the

Speaker 15:         24:37          playboy foundation, we were funding court cases in advanced gay rights, abortion rights, birth control rights.

Speaker 2:          24:44          And James says the playboy forum was part of that whole initiative. Right after he finished that two years sort of chain of essays, Hefner then created that space in the front of the magazine

Speaker 15:         24:57          for uh, people who had nowhere else to go

Speaker 2:          25:01          turn. And it was in that space where you had some of the first open discussions of homosexuality in America ever.

Speaker 15:         25:10          And I said, you know, it's, you look back, the sexual revolution happened on the news stand

Speaker 2:          25:17          testing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. Back to Jerry's story

Speaker 16:         25:25          recording of a workshop by General and see Davison. October six, 1972, New York Hilton,

Speaker 2:          25:32          a playboy letter, episode aside, Jerry continued to push his playboy therapy and in fact, he says among therapists, technique kind of started to blow up and a, in 72, he ends up getting invited to give a workshop.

Speaker 16:         25:46          I want to you really convention present to you some ideas and data and whatnot. From our point of view as we have been working with homosexuals,

Speaker 2:          25:57          we're going to skip over the actual specifics of that workshop. Well, I think it's clear that we have solved all the problems that field has because what's more consequential? Thank you. This was enjoyable for me is what happens after the panel. Jerry is a hanging out waiting for the room to clear. And this young, uh, young man walks up to him chubby. He was a little Chubby, bought my age. Jerry was 33 at the time. Very pleasant, very friendly, lot of smiles. I don't recall if he had any, a beard. He came up to me and introduced himself as a graduate student at Rutgers and he said, you know, I heard your talk. I thought it was interesting. Uh, I'm actually giving a talk myself the next day. Uh, you mind if I hand out some flyers for it? And I said,

Speaker 5:          26:44          I don't mind at all. Of course, the decision was made to attack what we call the gatekeepers of American attitudes.

Speaker 2:          26:55          This is Charles Silverstein. He was that young therapist to training with the flyer. Unbeknownst to Jerry, he was gay and was part of a growing movement of activists that were targeting people like Jerry [inaudible] on this thing that the behaviors had a different point of view, unlike the Friday and Weirdos. They were scientists, I would say [inaudible] them up and he says the public trusted the behavior therapists. They had a lot of sway over public opinion. So if they could convince Jerry and his colleagues that homosexuality was not something that needs to be cured, maybe the public would go along. But the question was, how do you do that? How do you make the case

Speaker 5:          27:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          27:38          this was around the time when gay activists would start zapping meetings where they'd basically go to a conference where therapists are meeting storm, uh, an event, grab the mic and

Speaker 5:          27:49          we want to deal with people. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          27:57          Charlie's sense was that this Gonzo approach was not going to convince the people that needed convincing like Jerry. And so when he approached Jerry after that,

Speaker 5:          28:06          did a workshop, very polite and friendly, simply handed him a flyer, said, hey man, a few folks are doing a thing. Come by. Tracy has, he just had a sense whose heart was in the right place. And so he thought, maybe I'll take a different approach with this guy. And I looked, I remember looking at the Flyer and seeing, oh, it's those radical gay activists, all of these troublemakers. I mean, I've been called in my career, been called a Nazi and a fascist. And so I remember looking at the flyer saying to myself, well, there's no way I'm going to go to this. So he shoved the flyer in his pocket. Yeah, I wasn't interested in it. Went off to the next panel [inaudible] some stuff the following day, final day of the conference, Sunday morning checked out of the hotel and I was on my way to leave for Penn station to go back out to Stonybrook.

Speaker 5:          28:52          And he says, on his way out, he kept bumping into colleagues who were like, Hey, great workshop, love your playboy therapy thing. And so he'd stop and he'd chat. And um, at one point I looked at my watch and you realized, dammit, I could not make it down to Penn station, is going to miss the train. And I thought, oh, the next train doesn't leave. You know, three hours later suddenly had some time to kill and for whatever reason the thought pops into his head, oh, the kid from Rutgers with a flyer, maybe I'll go that I pulled out the, the flyer he gave me, I hadn't thrown it away and I found the room and I went to the room and it was a madhouse. So the room was electric in the sense that it was absolutely packed. Charlie and two other gay therapists were on stage.

Speaker 2:          29:42          There were maybe a few hundred people in the audience, although it may seem incredible to you if they had never heard a gay person speak as convention, I mean they'd maybe seen gay people interrupt the convention, but never take part. So in my Hollywood imagination of this moment, people are shouting, they're waving. No, no, no, no, no. Charlie says this time he worked very hard to keep it professional, respectful. Okay, so it's so it's, it's cordial but fierce. I was at the top of my form when it came time for him to speak. Charlie says he took aim at that idea. He'd heard people like Jerry repeat over and over again. I only work with people who want to change. So what's the, what's the big deal? That idea? Here's what he said that day we asked him to read the remarks. It's a discussion of male homosexual

Speaker 17:         30:31          to suggest that a person comes voluntarily to change for sexual orientation is to ignore the powerful environmental stress oppression, if you will, that has been telling him for years that he should change to grow up in the family where the word homosexual was whispered to play in the playground and he had the words Faggot and queer. Did you go to church and hear of sin and then to college and here of illness and finally to the Counseling Center that promises to cure is hardly to create an environment of freedom and voluntary choice. What brings them into the counseling center is guilt. Shame and the loneliness that comes from their secret. If you really wish to help them freely choose, I suggest you first desensitize them to their guilt after that. Listen truth, but not before. I don't know anymore than you what would happen, but I think that choice would be more voluntary and free than it is at precedent. Yes, those are my words.

Speaker 2:          31:47          Do you remember how those were to you all? It affected me very deeply. Affected me very deeply. Jerry says he went to Penn station. Was Charlie's speech into the counseling sentence? It is guilt. Shame echoing in his mind. Five 25 lead modeling like seven Tang says he got on the train back to stony brook sat there staring out the window at the scenery thinking, thank you. Sorry. I was running through the whole talk action in my head and to feel comfortable with this sexual violence after the event with him and he says, by the time he got to Stoneybrook, he felt something changed in him.

Speaker 7:          32:38          I went to school the following day. I know I began to talk to people about what I had just heard at the convention and how it's gotten me to thinking.

Speaker 3:          32:48          He says he was teaching a series of undergraduate classes at that time and he would get up in front of those classes and for the first time think, what if some of these students are in the closet

Speaker 7:          32:59          talking to people, mulling things over, talking to students. I began to think what I've been doing was absolutely wrong.

Speaker 3:          33:10          Meanwhile, his film on the playboy therapy was still making the rounds still gaining convert.

Speaker 7:          33:15          Oh yeah. People love the film.

Speaker 8:          33:17          Okay.

Speaker 7:          33:18          The film had been out for a year already and by the time the film began to be shown, I was already wishing that it wasn't being shown that I had no control over it.

Speaker 3:          33:29          1973 a couple of months after that convention, Jerry gets nominated as the president of the a B t the gigantic organization that had thrown the conference. He just attended. He becomes one of the youngest presidents ever and the following year he was due to give the presidential address. This is where things come to a head. The conference that year was held in Chicago. It came at a time of great fervor and foment. He says in the days and months leading up to the conference,

Speaker 7:          33:59          people on the radical left were calling us fascist and Nattiez and they were publishing circulars where their home addresses someone publish your home address. Absolutely. We had to, I was president of the Association at the time. I remember we all had walkie-talkies and we hired plain clothes people in Chicago police because we were that afraid of, um, violence.

Speaker 18:         34:26          Set the scene when you give the speech. How big is the room? Big, big run. Big Ballroom. Couple hundred people. Thousand. These are all therapists? Yeah. And how are you feeling before the speech? Very nervous. Terrifying. But he says before the talk, he'd actually met Charlie at a diner and told them about the speech he was to make. I remember him saying, do you know that your reputation may suffer? Because you have to remember that in those days, if you said something positive about homosexual, people would suspect you. People may think that you're gay. Oh, he must be gay. That's what he's saying. He warned me. He warned me.

Speaker 8:          35:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 19:         35:10          colleagues and my friends. I want to make plain, if not perfectly clear that I am speaking only for myself on an ethical issue that impinges importantly on our therapy enterprise.

Speaker 3:          35:24          Jerry began the talk by telling the audience,

Speaker 19:         35:26          I wish today to voice some concerns I have been wrestling with for over three years. That he's troubled surrounding the way behavior therapists and for that matter, all other therapists have approaching homosexuality

Speaker 2:          35:39          that he, like a lot of the therapists in the audience have been approached by clients, gay men mostly who want their help, our up to be made straight. People who relate to us that they are troubled by their homosexual behavior or feelings with any asks. Uh, Silverstein's question, what does it actually mean to help these people as Silverstein put it at the a B t

Speaker 19:         36:01          convention two years ago in a discussion of male homosexuality. And let me court again to suggest that a person comes voluntarily to change his sexual orientation is to, is to ignore the powerful environmental stress oppression, if you will, oppression. If you will, that has been telling him for years that he should change to grow up in a family where the word homosexual was wisdom play and he quoted you in that speech. Yeah. What was Ellie? I was quite pleased. Continuing the quote from Silverstein. What brings them into the counseling center is guilt, shame and the loneliness that comes from their secret. In other words, Silverstein suggests that we miss go back in the causal network and ask ourselves as determinists what are they determinants of the client asserting to you that he or she wants to change.

Speaker 2:          36:50          Jerry then delivers the simple point, which is that the problem that these people are asking us to solve

Speaker 8:          36:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          37:00          it's a problem we created

Speaker 3:          37:03          that we labeled as a problem

Speaker 19:         37:06          and so even if we could effect certain changes, there is still the more important question of whether we should, I believe we should not

Speaker 3:          37:22          to us now or to many of us. Now that may sound like kind of as simple, easy, obvious thing to say,

Speaker 20:         37:31          but that was an extraordinary statement. You see, everybody else was arguing that the attempts to change sexual orientation ended in failure. That was not what he did. He did something quite different. He said in that speech, it makes no difference how successful the treatment is. It is immoral.

Speaker 2:          37:59          Charlie says he was the first person to say that

Speaker 20:         38:01          to ever say that trying to change sexual orientation was an immoral thing to do.

Speaker 8:          38:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          38:10          and that's not a trivial thing. I mean you could see this moment

Speaker 18:         38:13          in a way as one of them

Speaker 2:          38:16          early tremors in a tectonic shift

Speaker 18:         38:19          in not just therapy but all of science

Speaker 8:          38:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         38:24          like science to that point. It concerns itself with objectivity. That was all that mattered. We stand apart from the world and we examine it as it is objectively, but that from this moment forward would start to be questioned all over the place. Even in places like mental illness, you know, you look at history, you see that some diseases come and go. Why would that be what people would

Speaker 3:          38:49          begin to argue that even mental illnesses or social constructs created by the society, by the people who study them. What Jerry was doing here.

Speaker 8:          39:01          Um,

Speaker 18:         39:01          he was shifting the language. He was saying, forget objectivity, forget bullshit. Empiricism. Let's talk about ethics. Let's talk about morality. We shouldn't do this. Not because it doesn't work, which it doesn't, but because it's wrong.

Speaker 7:          39:23          I hope and I recommend that we continue to devote the necessary energy to the important challenges. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          39:38          You right about that moment. Like as you were talking about how like the air felt in that moment. You, you right. Friends commented afterwards. That one gets that kind of silence when everyone in a room full of a thousand people stops

Speaker 7:          39:51          breathing at the same time. Yeah, yeah, exactly right. I remember that. I just remember that, you know, like what are they going to do? What I say this? And it turned out that what they were doing was holding their breath.

Speaker 8:          40:09          [inaudible] they do eventually [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          40:14          but afterwards Jerry says, ah, at the reception, uh, he walked in and it was like parting the Red seas. Nobody wanted to talk to him.

Speaker 7:          40:22          They're all looking at me and I remember one person, I will not name him, he came over to me and shook my hand. Then he bent over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. Well, it didn't you like that? Oh, like he's making a point to say you must be gay because he said those things. Yeah. Yeah. And I said, I said screw you.

Speaker 3:          40:44          So it took awhile to get the peeps onboard, but they did start to come around and get on the right side of history. And it's not a straight line by any means, but there is a line that you can draw between Charlie's words coming out of Jerry's mouth and the epically huge decision that these psychiatric community as a whole would make to remove homosexuality as a mental illness from the DSM. That big Bible of mental illnesses. Jerry speech happened right at that beginning point when science was just starting to wash its hands of the whole idea of a gay cure. And what's interesting, I find just as one final thought, you could read this entire story as a, as a sort of prelude, psychotherapists were basically ready to say that

Speaker 2:          41:34          homosexuality was not an illness by about 1986 that is precisely the time when the Christian community walked in and grabbed the baton, the scientific communities were accepting homosexuality and they were saying that it's not a disorder anymore. They were removing it from the DSM three which is why we need to do what we're doing because Christians have to fight the battle. Christians have to fight this battle of homosexual sin because the professional counseling community won't do it anymore. So it was very explicit in your mindset. Oh yeah. To that. That story is a story that we eat here in the next episode of Honor Arrays, which I think we might also play on radio lab. Well, I hope so because all of a sudden instead of talking to data and instead of talking to jeans or instead of talking to chemicals, now you're talking to either God or your parents or your teachers or your society or depressors that are all around you, and it gets really, really lonely and really, really tough.

Speaker 2:          42:37          Yeah. This episode of radio lab was drawn from unraced, the untold history of conversion therapy in America. It's a series I worked on with folks, features, stitcher and limited house in conjunction with a feature film boy erased. Special thanks. Go out to Shimo, the [inaudible], uh, cat, Aaron, Michael Assessor, Allis Quinland, David Craig, Garret Conley, and all the folks that anonymous content for their support of unraced. If you want to hear the whole series, which I hope you, you will a, you can find unraced and all the usual podcast places. I'm Jad Abumrad. I want to put Krulwich. Thanks for listening and happy Thanksgiving. Yeah.
