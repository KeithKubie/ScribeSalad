get up so we're still looking we're

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
get up so we're still looking we're
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.610
get up so we're still looking we're
still looking at a tie here so one of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
still looking at a tie here so one of
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.499
still looking at a tie here so one of
the things which I wanted to mention was

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
the things which I wanted to mention was
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.210
the things which I wanted to mention was
once we've got the settings screen up

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
once we've got the settings screen up
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.610
once we've got the settings screen up
you've got a very custom settings

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
you've got a very custom settings
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.280
you've got a very custom settings
interface here and I can see why it's

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
interface here and I can see why it's
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.870
interface here and I can see why it's
it's relatively sort of custom

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
it's relatively sort of custom
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.310
it's relatively sort of custom
information but it's definitely

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
information but it's definitely
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930
information but it's definitely
presented in a way that you wouldn't

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940
presented in a way that you wouldn't
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.650
presented in a way that you wouldn't
expect yeah you wouldn't expect this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
expect yeah you wouldn't expect this
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060
expect yeah you wouldn't expect this
when you hit the Settings button so one

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
when you hit the Settings button so one
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650
when you hit the Settings button so one
thing to consider is to see whether you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
thing to consider is to see whether you
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910
thing to consider is to see whether you
can sort of provide the same

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
can sort of provide the same
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.550
can sort of provide the same
functionality but within sort of the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
functionality but within sort of the
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.850
functionality but within sort of the
more standard settings hierarchy see

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860
 
 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.100
 
hangover from like our one of our

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
hangover from like our one of our
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.100
hangover from like our one of our
earliest earliest versions and I think

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
earliest earliest versions and I think
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.000
earliest earliest versions and I think
it was one of those things we never

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
it was one of those things we never
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.029
it was one of those things we never
really changed or upgraded into how the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
really changed or upgraded into how the
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369
really changed or upgraded into how the
more standard way of doing things so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
more standard way of doing things so
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.400
more standard way of doing things so
shun certain yeah it's definitely on our

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
shun certain yeah it's definitely on our
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.729
shun certain yeah it's definitely on our
road map of things to fix up excellent

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
road map of things to fix up excellent
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.549
road map of things to fix up excellent
excellent so I think you know just so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
excellent so I think you know just so
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.779
excellent so I think you know just so
looking at the app in general I think

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
looking at the app in general I think
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.670
looking at the app in general I think
the biggest way that you're going to be

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
the biggest way that you're going to be
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.009
the biggest way that you're going to be
able to oh look they sort there's a good

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
able to oh look they sort there's a good
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859
able to oh look they sort there's a good
button so let me let me ask you what the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
button so let me let me ask you what the
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.810
button so let me let me ask you what the
quit button does which button quit if

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
quit button does which button quit if
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969
quit button does which button quit if
you go settings there's a quick menu

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
you go settings there's a quick menu
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.390
you go settings there's a quick menu
option the quit button basically tells

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
option the quit button basically tells
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260
option the quit button basically tells
the app to stop you know trying like so

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
the app to stop you know trying like so
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359
the app to stop you know trying like so
it's going to stop all the services and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
it's going to stop all the services and
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.530
it's going to stop all the services and
things like that to basically exit out

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540
things like that to basically exit out
 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.539
things like that to basically exit out
yeah and so this is as opposed that you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
yeah and so this is as opposed that you
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.969
yeah and so this is as opposed that you
could have it playing and go and hit the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
could have it playing and go and hit the
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800
could have it playing and go and hit the
home button moon and it'd be kind of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
home button moon and it'd be kind of
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719
home button moon and it'd be kind of
like scanned or easy to Claire where

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
like scanned or easy to Claire where
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450
like scanned or easy to Claire where
we'd still be playing the other thing we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
we'd still be playing the other thing we
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609
we'd still be playing the other thing we
wanted to give the user a quick button

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
wanted to give the user a quick button
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.139
wanted to give the user a quick button
so they could make sure you know is all

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
so they could make sure you know is all
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.170
so they could make sure you know is all
shut down okay so that's that's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
shut down okay so that's that's
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.969
shut down okay so that's that's
reasonable what you might find is a is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
reasonable what you might find is a is
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880
reasonable what you might find is a is
actually a better alternative I see that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
actually a better alternative I see that
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069
actually a better alternative I see that
once you've got the once you've you've

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
once you've got the once you've you've
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870
once you've got the once you've you've
got something playing you have an

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
got something playing you have an
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.819
got something playing you have an
ongoing notification which is absolutely

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
ongoing notification which is absolutely
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.709
ongoing notification which is absolutely
the right thing to do what you might

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
the right thing to do what you might
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.929
the right thing to do what you might
want to consider is modifying this so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
want to consider is modifying this so
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880
want to consider is modifying this so
that the user can pause directly from

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
that the user can pause directly from
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010
that the user can pause directly from
that so your behavior here should be

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
that so your behavior here should be
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.240
that so your behavior here should be
pretty much the same as you would expect

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
pretty much the same as you would expect
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.490
pretty much the same as you would expect
from say google music or Spotify or

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
from say google music or Spotify or
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.780
from say google music or Spotify or
anything like that which is going to be

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
anything like that which is going to be
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.550
anything like that which is going to be
playing music

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
playing music
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.339
playing music
or any kind of audio in the background

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
or any kind of audio in the background
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.470
or any kind of audio in the background
the reality is that quit button it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
the reality is that quit button it's
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.680
the reality is that quit button it's
kind of meaningless you should always

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690
kind of meaningless you should always
 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.479
kind of meaningless you should always
assume that any app is going to be able

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489
assume that any app is going to be able
 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.460
assume that any app is going to be able
to intelligently continue in the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
to intelligently continue in the
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.199
to intelligently continue in the
background or get killed in the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
background or get killed in the
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.610
background or get killed in the
background without the user having to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
background without the user having to
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.520
background without the user having to
sort of explicitly exit you know it's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
sort of explicitly exit you know it's
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.050
sort of explicitly exit you know it's
one of my hot button topics this whole

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
one of my hot button topics this whole
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.150
one of my hot button topics this whole
notion of having an exit button it's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
notion of having an exit button it's
 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.070
notion of having an exit button it's
kind of confusing to users because it's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080
kind of confusing to users because it's
 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
kind of confusing to users because it's
not a standard Android paradigm and it's

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090
not a standard Android paradigm and it's
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.509
not a standard Android paradigm and it's
it's definitely ambiguous what does it

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519
it's definitely ambiguous what does it
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.880
it's definitely ambiguous what does it
mean what exactly does it do so in this

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
mean what exactly does it do so in this
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.160
mean what exactly does it do so in this
instance I think you'd be better off

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
instance I think you'd be better off
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.630
instance I think you'd be better off
implementing it in the same way as music

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
implementing it in the same way as music
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.120
implementing it in the same way as music
so that when you hit pause effectively

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
so that when you hit pause effectively
 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.789
so that when you hit pause effectively
the app is is stopped so if you if you

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799
the app is is stopped so if you if you
 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:52.780
the app is is stopped so if you if you
do have something on going in the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
do have something on going in the
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220
do have something on going in the
background you just bring down your

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
background you just bring down your
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.050
background you just bring down your
notification hit the stop button or the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
notification hit the stop button or the
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.720
notification hit the stop button or the
pause button and that effectively does

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
pause button and that effectively does
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.979
pause button and that effectively does
the same thing as the the quit button

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
the same thing as the the quit button
 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.350
the same thing as the the quit button
would do without necessarily the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360
would do without necessarily the
 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.080
would do without necessarily the
explicit stop calls to the services and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
explicit stop calls to the services and
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.720
explicit stop calls to the services and
activities yeah so other than that I'd

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730
activities yeah so other than that I'd
 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.110
activities yeah so other than that I'd
say that the stop and actually so other

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
say that the stop and actually so other
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.430
say that the stop and actually so other
than that let's say the biggest thing

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
than that let's say the biggest thing
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.050
than that let's say the biggest thing
that you can do to really give this app

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
that you can do to really give this app
 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180
that you can do to really give this app
which is already quite useful a little

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190
which is already quite useful a little
 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.280
which is already quite useful a little
bit more polish is just look at the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290
bit more polish is just look at the
 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.680
bit more polish is just look at the
design guides on the developer site and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690
design guides on the developer site and
 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.539
design guides on the developer site and
see if there are ways that you can sort

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549
see if there are ways that you can sort
 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.490
see if there are ways that you can sort
of easily implement a bunch of those so

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
of easily implement a bunch of those so
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.140
of easily implement a bunch of those so
things like the action bar things like

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
things like the action bar things like
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.250
things like the action bar things like
the viewpager you know to try and make

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
the viewpager you know to try and make
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.140
the viewpager you know to try and make
something which just looks and feels a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
something which just looks and feels a
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.370
something which just looks and feels a
little bit more modern a little bit more

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
little bit more modern a little bit more
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.170
little bit more modern a little bit more
in touch with the sort of current

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180
in touch with the sort of current
 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.509
in touch with the sort of current
android style guides and i think that'll

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519
android style guides and i think that'll
 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.000
android style guides and i think that'll
have a really big impact so they are

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
have a really big impact so they are
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.069
have a really big impact so they are
these like our target platform right now

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079
these like our target platform right now
 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.009
these like our target platform right now
is uh is the sdk eight 2.2 froyo and so

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019
is uh is the sdk eight 2.2 froyo and so
 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.840
is uh is the sdk eight 2.2 froyo and so
like how many of the like because i

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
like how many of the like because i
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.759
like how many of the like because i
thought as the action bar is this

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769
thought as the action bar is this
 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.080
thought as the action bar is this
introduced later right it was that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090
introduced later right it was that
 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.960
introduced later right it was that
either honeycomb or ICS i think right

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
either honeycomb or ICS i think right
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.430
either honeycomb or ICS i think right
yeah honey cone was the first place that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440
yeah honey cone was the first place that
 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.800
yeah honey cone was the first place that
was seen but yeah I cs4 for phones

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810
was seen but yeah I cs4 for phones
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.490
was seen but yeah I cs4 for phones
definitely so i guess like in that

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
definitely so i guess like in that
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.400
definitely so i guess like in that
regard like would you recommend like

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410
regard like would you recommend like
 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.890
regard like would you recommend like
trying to you know implement these

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900
trying to you know implement these
 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.300
trying to you know implement these
features for future you know platforms

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
features for future you know platforms
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.819
features for future you know platforms
as far as like ice cream sandwiches and

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829
as far as like ice cream sandwiches and
 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.009
as far as like ice cream sandwiches and
then like reflect to reflect to get the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019
then like reflect to reflect to get the
 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.170
then like reflect to reflect to get the
functionality or would you just or is

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180
functionality or would you just or is
 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.600
functionality or would you just or is
there a better way to do it and still

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610
there a better way to do it and still
 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.360
there a better way to do it and still
kind of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370
kind of
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.290
kind of
have that 2.2 base yeah so I guess I

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300
have that 2.2 base yeah so I guess I
 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.120
have that 2.2 base yeah so I guess I
will do both so for the for the newest

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130
will do both so for the for the newest
 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.170
will do both so for the for the newest
releases for the Ice Cream Sandwich

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180
releases for the Ice Cream Sandwich
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.240
releases for the Ice Cream Sandwich
phones them then you can just use the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
phones them then you can just use the
 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.129
phones them then you can just use the
the native components like the action

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139
the native components like the action
 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.290
the native components like the action
bar to get that effect we've actually

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300
bar to get that effect we've actually
 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.120
bar to get that effect we've actually
been promoting the same sort of general

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130
been promoting the same sort of general
 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.300
been promoting the same sort of general
sort of UI design for a while so there's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310
sort of UI design for a while so there's
 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.070
sort of UI design for a while so there's
a lot of I mean the action bar it's just

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080
a lot of I mean the action bar it's just
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.870
a lot of I mean the action bar it's just
one piece but it's sort of the overall

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880
one piece but it's sort of the overall
 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.370
one piece but it's sort of the overall
look and feel sort of the way it's all

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380
look and feel sort of the way it's all
 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.219
look and feel sort of the way it's all
put together you know if you follow the

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229
put together you know if you follow the
 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.170
put together you know if you follow the
ICS guidelines you'll end up with

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
ICS guidelines you'll end up with
 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.790
ICS guidelines you'll end up with
something which still looks really good

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
something which still looks really good
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.010
something which still looks really good
it has great usability going all the way

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
it has great usability going all the way
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.110
it has great usability going all the way
back to Freya the only thing you'll have

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
back to Freya the only thing you'll have
 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.659
back to Freya the only thing you'll have
to do yourself is to create basically an

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669
to do yourself is to create basically an
 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.610
to do yourself is to create basically an
action bar or use a third-party tool

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
action bar or use a third-party tool
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.529
action bar or use a third-party tool
like action Russia I like to simulate

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539
like action Russia I like to simulate
 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.600
like action Russia I like to simulate
the same sort of behavior but

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610
the same sort of behavior but
 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.680
the same sort of behavior but
fundamentally it's actually not that

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690
fundamentally it's actually not that
 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.350
fundamentally it's actually not that
hard you're just talking about a set of

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360
hard you're just talking about a set of
 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.080
hard you're just talking about a set of
use along the top which has the you know

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090
use along the top which has the you know
 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.550
use along the top which has the you know
the app title on the left navigation

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560
the app title on the left navigation
 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.590
the app title on the left navigation
over on that side and any actions on the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600
over on that side and any actions on the
 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.730
over on that side and any actions on the
right hand side so you can actually

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740
right hand side so you can actually
 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.620
right hand side so you can actually
implement something which looks and

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
implement something which looks and
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.120
implement something which looks and
behaves they're very similar to an

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130
behaves they're very similar to an
 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.960
behaves they're very similar to an
action bar without too much extra work

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970
action bar without too much extra work
 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.550
action bar without too much extra work
so you know in the in this example you

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560
so you know in the in this example you
 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.840
so you know in the in this example you
would be doing that it would just be

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
would be doing that it would just be
 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.339
would be doing that it would just be
helping to move some of these controls

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349
helping to move some of these controls
 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.950
helping to move some of these controls
into a more predictable place so these

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960
into a more predictable place so these
 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.170
into a more predictable place so these
actions would end up on the top and

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
actions would end up on the top and
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.440
actions would end up on the top and
everything else would drop down slightly

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450
everything else would drop down slightly
 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.690
everything else would drop down slightly
exactly how these these controls would

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700
exactly how these these controls would
 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.060
exactly how these these controls would
be implanted i think is kind of a more

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070
be implanted i think is kind of a more
 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.129
be implanted i think is kind of a more
challenging a UI question is something

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139
challenging a UI question is something
 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.420
challenging a UI question is something
that I think maybe Roman would have a

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
that I think maybe Roman would have a
 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.360
that I think maybe Roman would have a
more opinion on but again you know

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370
more opinion on but again you know
 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.610
more opinion on but again you know
looking at similar apps like podcasting

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620
looking at similar apps like podcasting
 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.680
looking at similar apps like podcasting
apps or music apps and seeing how they

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690
apps or music apps and seeing how they
 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.110
apps or music apps and seeing how they
do the relatives split of information

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120
do the relatives split of information
 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.540
do the relatives split of information
that they could be really informative ok

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550
that they could be really informative ok
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.350
that they could be really informative ok
so right oh I'm loathe to interrupt any

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360
so right oh I'm loathe to interrupt any
 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.650
so right oh I'm loathe to interrupt any
action bar conversation but I did want

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660
action bar conversation but I did want
 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.620
action bar conversation but I did want
to point out we have when on on

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630
to point out we have when on on
 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.040

ninja ok so it would be right if we

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630
ninja ok so it would be right if we
 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.050
ninja ok so it would be right if we
could spare him a little time as well I

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060
could spare him a little time as well I
 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.390

don't wear 140 cool let's uh let's split

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400
don't wear 140 cool let's uh let's split
 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.070
don't wear 140 cool let's uh let's split
across so that's I think that's pretty

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080
across so that's I think that's pretty
 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.870
across so that's I think that's pretty
much the cave of what we were gonna say

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880

you should be able to utilize it and
 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.060

the value of it is since it's more of a

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650
the value of it is since it's more of a

a look at perfect so again this so this

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:15.880
a look at perfect so again this so this
 

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.120
a look at perfect so again this so this
is this is a point which we've made in

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.130
is this is a point which we've made in
 

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.280
is this is a point which we've made in
the past about apps which start up and

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.290
the past about apps which start up and
 

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.280
the past about apps which start up and
straight away asked you to rate the app

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:22.290
straight away asked you to rate the app
 

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.290
straight away asked you to rate the app
so i have started this a couple of times

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.300
so i have started this a couple of times
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.790
so i have started this a couple of times
so it's possible that it didn't do this

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800
so it's possible that it didn't do this
 

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.440
so it's possible that it didn't do this
the first time but I have a vague

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:28.450
the first time but I have a vague
 

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.840
the first time but I have a vague
recollection that it did so this is this

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:30.850
recollection that it did so this is this
 

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.850
recollection that it did so this is this
is kind of tricky because I can't really

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:32.860
is kind of tricky because I can't really
 

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.980
is kind of tricky because I can't really
write an app that I haven't used yet so

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:34.990
write an app that I haven't used yet so
 

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.860
write an app that I haven't used yet so

you know for the for the fact that it
 

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.890
you know for the for the fact that it
interrupts my flow it makes me have to

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:01.900

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200
something like this so it might actually
 

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.860
something like this so it might actually
make it worse to pop something up like

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:16.870
make it worse to pop something up like
 

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.810
make it worse to pop something up like
this so that's something thing about to

the screen where it's not interrupting
 

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.410
the screen where it's not interrupting
your workflow it's not an old st is all

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:34.420
your workflow it's not an old st is all
 

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.830
your workflow it's not an old st is all
right we'll move on all right so looking

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:37.840
right we'll move on all right so looking
 

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.650
right we'll move on all right so looking
at the app itself you've gone with the

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:40.660
at the app itself you've gone with the
 

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.870
at the app itself you've gone with the
the effect where you've got yeah sort of

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
the effect where you've got yeah sort of
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.950
the effect where you've got yeah sort of
a real-world sort of wood type look here

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:45.960
a real-world sort of wood type look here
 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.780
a real-world sort of wood type look here
which is he's interesting it certainly

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:48.790
which is he's interesting it certainly
 

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.080
which is he's interesting it certainly
gives it a strong visual aspect there's

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.090
gives it a strong visual aspect there's
 

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.310
gives it a strong visual aspect there's
a couple of things to tell when I sort

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320
a couple of things to tell when I sort
 

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.440
a couple of things to tell when I sort
of point off right off the bat looking

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.450
of point off right off the bat looking
 

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.900
of point off right off the bat looking
at this the first sort of feeling I get

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:00.910
at this the first sort of feeling I get
 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.120
at this the first sort of feeling I get
is it doesn't quite feel like it's an

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.130
is it doesn't quite feel like it's an
 

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.490
is it doesn't quite feel like it's an
android app you've got these tabs along

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:05.500
android app you've got these tabs along
 

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.730
android app you've got these tabs along
the bottom you've got sort of this very

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:08.740
the bottom you've got sort of this very
 

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.770
the bottom you've got sort of this very
iphone looking button style along the

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:10.780
iphone looking button style along the
 

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.060
iphone looking button style along the
top and and on both sides so it kind of

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.070
top and and on both sides so it kind of
 

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.770
top and and on both sides so it kind of
has like it's obviously it's got its own

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:16.780
has like it's obviously it's got its own
 

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.690
has like it's obviously it's got its own
unique you why but it feels like it's

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:18.700
unique you why but it feels like it's
 

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.030
unique you why but it feels like it's
its own unique you I but tailored more

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040
its own unique you I but tailored more
 

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.460
its own unique you I but tailored more
towards an iphone user so as an Android

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:23.470
towards an iphone user so as an Android
 

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.040
towards an iphone user so as an Android
user I feel a little like all wait this

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.050
user I feel a little like all wait this
 

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.030
user I feel a little like all wait this
doesn't quite look the way I would

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040
doesn't quite look the way I would
 

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.300
doesn't quite look the way I would
expect okay yeah so was that it was that

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.310
expect okay yeah so was that it was that
 

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.130
expect okay yeah so was that it was that
a conscious choice I mean is this is

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:32.140
a conscious choice I mean is this is
 

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.170
a conscious choice I mean is this is
this an iphone port or did you develop

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:34.180
this an iphone port or did you develop
 

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.120
this an iphone port or did you develop
from scratch with this sort of actually

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.130
from scratch with this sort of actually
 

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.070
from scratch with this sort of actually
i derived from scratch yeah android

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:38.080
i derived from scratch yeah android
 

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.050
i derived from scratch yeah android
first and an iphone but i think it's

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.060
first and an iphone but i think it's
 

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.080
first and an iphone but i think it's
because the reason why i used that bar

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.090
because the reason why i used that bar
 

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.540
because the reason why i used that bar
is because i think it's more clear it's

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:45.550
is because i think it's more clear it's
 

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.170
is because i think it's more clear it's
a more straightforward yeah but do you

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:49.180
a more straightforward yeah but do you
 

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.030
a more straightforward yeah but do you
have any suggestions like if i want to

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040
have any suggestions like if i want to
 

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.990
have any suggestions like if i want to
change into Android UI absolutely so we

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000
change into Android UI absolutely so we
 

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.430
change into Android UI absolutely so we
we cover a lot of the sort of

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440
we cover a lot of the sort of
 

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.690
we cover a lot of the sort of
suggestions i'm going to make in the

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:57.700
suggestions i'm going to make in the
 

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.180
suggestions i'm going to make in the
design site or the design guidelines on

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.190
design site or the design guidelines on
 

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.910
design site or the design guidelines on
developer.android.com a couple of the

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920
developer.android.com a couple of the
 

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.070
developer.android.com a couple of the
key ones there is that generally tabs

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.080
key ones there is that generally tabs
 

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.260
key ones there is that generally tabs
for android belong up the top rather

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:07.270
for android belong up the top rather
 

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.330
for android belong up the top rather
than along the bottom is whether that's

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:09.340
than along the bottom is whether that's
 

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.520
than along the bottom is whether that's
tabs or some other kind of navigation

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:11.530
tabs or some other kind of navigation
 

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.050
tabs or some other kind of navigation
like a spin around an action bar

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.060
like a spin around an action bar
 

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.030
like a spin around an action bar
something like that we generally have

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040
something like that we generally have
 

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.130
something like that we generally have
that of the top

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140
that of the top
 

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.650
that of the top
towards the left I still wanted cheats

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660
towards the left I still wanted cheats
 

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.560
towards the left I still wanted cheats
the top bar or the action bar so that I

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:21.570
the top bar or the action bar so that I
 

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.910
the top bar or the action bar so that I
can ask to have more like actions can be

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920
can ask to have more like actions can be
 

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.820
can ask to have more like actions can be
performed on the same page chump so

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:28.830
performed on the same page chump so
 

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.260
performed on the same page chump so
again so you can you can totally do that

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.270
again so you can you can totally do that
 

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.270
again so you can you can totally do that
so again having the the events button so

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.280
so again having the the events button so
 

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.290
so again having the the events button so
that's kind of interesting so that whole

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300
that's kind of interesting so that whole
 

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.440
that's kind of interesting so that whole
workflow is is kind of weird so what we

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.450
workflow is is kind of weird so what we
 

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.120
workflow is is kind of weird so what we
would generally expect on Android is the

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.130
would generally expect on Android is the
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.980
would generally expect on Android is the
top left is going to be some sort of

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:42.990
top left is going to be some sort of
 

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.700
top left is going to be some sort of
Home icon a logo something like that and

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:46.710
Home icon a logo something like that and
 

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.380
Home icon a logo something like that and
generally speaking pressing it is going

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:48.390
generally speaking pressing it is going
 

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.910
generally speaking pressing it is going
to take you back to the main screen of

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920
to take you back to the main screen of
 

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.370
to take you back to the main screen of
your application so in your case it

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380
your application so in your case it
 

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.460
your application so in your case it
would be here I would not expect the top

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.470
would be here I would not expect the top
 

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.030
would be here I would not expect the top
left to do anything the fact that here

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040
left to do anything the fact that here
 

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.500
left to do anything the fact that here
so you've got you can choose between

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:00.510
so you've got you can choose between
 

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.390
so you've got you can choose between
different events presumably events which

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:02.400
different events presumably events which
 

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.390
different events presumably events which
you can then add expenses too yeah so

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:05.400
you can then add expenses too yeah so
 

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.950
you can then add expenses too yeah so
again like the the fact that you've got

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:06.960
again like the the fact that you've got
 

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.390
again like the the fact that you've got
new event as an option on a on a button

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:11.400
new event as an option on a on a button
 

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.220
new event as an option on a on a button
list is confusing to me because this is

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:13.230
list is confusing to me because this is
 

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.770
list is confusing to me because this is
an action but presented as a selection

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:15.780
an action but presented as a selection
 

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.980
an action but presented as a selection
so it's not really the way it should be

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:18.990
so it's not really the way it should be
 

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.810
so it's not really the way it should be
presented like anything which is going

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820
presented like anything which is going
 

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.160
presented like anything which is going
to create something new should be

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.170
to create something new should be
 

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.290
to create something new should be
implemented as a button or something

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300
implemented as a button or something
 

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.720
implemented as a button or something
like that which implies a user action

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
like that which implies a user action
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.280
like that which implies a user action
which is going to result in another

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:28.290
which is going to result in another
 

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.070
which is going to result in another
screen reason so I would yeah I would

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:31.080
screen reason so I would yeah I would
 

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.660
screen reason so I would yeah I would
probably move that out of there cee-ment

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:37.670
 
 

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.360
 
give the spelling okay so then it's gone

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:41.370
give the spelling okay so then it's gone
 

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.860
give the spelling okay so then it's gone
into that and so so what you've done

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:42.870
into that and so so what you've done
 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.690
into that and so so what you've done
here with the navigation is reasonable

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700
here with the navigation is reasonable
 

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.330
here with the navigation is reasonable
but here what I would expect is that

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:46.340
but here what I would expect is that
 

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.850
but here what I would expect is that
this would then become an icon with an

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860
this would then become an icon with an
 

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.770
this would then become an icon with an
UP button so the pressing this would

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:51.780
UP button so the pressing this would
 

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.380
UP button so the pressing this would
take me back to the previous screen the

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.390
take me back to the previous screen the
 

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.610
take me back to the previous screen the
the main story if there is a main screen

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:57.620
the main story if there is a main screen
 

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.900
the main story if there is a main screen
and so here where you've got the

00:13:59.900 --> 00:13:59.910
and so here where you've got the
 

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.070
and so here where you've got the
selection what you would do is have

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:01.080
selection what you would do is have
 

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.440
selection what you would do is have
these potentially as a spinner if you

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:03.450
these potentially as a spinner if you
 

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.540
these potentially as a spinner if you
have a look at the gmail app that's a

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:05.550
have a look at the gmail app that's a
 

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.980
have a look at the gmail app that's a
really good example of something which

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:06.990
really good example of something which
 

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.990
really good example of something which
allows you to choose between sort of

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000
allows you to choose between sort of
 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.370
allows you to choose between sort of
these different inboxes or different

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380
these different inboxes or different
 

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.440
these different inboxes or different
labels so i would definitely check that

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.450
labels so i would definitely check that
 

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.200
labels so i would definitely check that
out the plus here that's that's

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.210
out the plus here that's that's
 

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.430
out the plus here that's that's
perfectly reasonable with the ability to

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440
perfectly reasonable with the ability to
 

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.170
perfectly reasonable with the ability to
create that new receipt council save

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.180
create that new receipt council save
 

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.840
create that new receipt council save
this this is fine one

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:25.850
this this is fine one
 

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.220
this this is fine one
comments I would make I'm not one

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.230
comments I would make I'm not one
 

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.720
comments I would make I'm not one
hundred percent sure myself of the right

out which side the confirmed versus

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:34.459
out which side the confirmed versus

cancel buttons should be so it's worth

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:36.500
cancel buttons should be so it's worth
 

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.139
cancel buttons should be so it's worth
just confirming that you've got them in

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:38.149
just confirming that you've got them in
 

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:41.620
just confirming that you've got them in
the right place back button does what it

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.630
the right place back button does what it
 

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.689
the right place back button does what it
should do so that's all fine so I mean I

00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:43.699
should do so that's all fine so I mean I
 

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:45.220
should do so that's all fine so I mean I
really I think you can get a long way

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:45.230
really I think you can get a long way
 

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.960
really I think you can get a long way
here just by modifying the navigation

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:46.970
here just by modifying the navigation
 

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.850
here just by modifying the navigation
structure and switching the tab so that

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:48.860
structure and switching the tab so that
 

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.430
structure and switching the tab so that
there along the top beneath your beneath

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440
there along the top beneath your beneath
 

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.350
there along the top beneath your beneath
your action bar rather foggy bottom is

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360
your action bar rather foggy bottom is
 

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.050
your action bar rather foggy bottom is
it and similarly with sort of some of

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.060
it and similarly with sort of some of
 

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.480
it and similarly with sort of some of
your icons again so particularly the

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.490
your icons again so particularly the
 

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.790
your icons again so particularly the
Settings icon looks a little like an

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800
Settings icon looks a little like an
 

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.389
Settings icon looks a little like an
iPhone Settings button yeah and so

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399
iPhone Settings button yeah and so
 

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:09.090
iPhone Settings button yeah and so
that's that's all fine again with this

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.100
that's that's all fine again with this
 

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.160
that's that's all fine again with this
that's interesting later so so one of

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.170
that's interesting later so so one of
 

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.329
that's interesting later so so one of
the things which I would point out here

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:16.339
the things which I would point out here
 

00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:17.769
the things which I would point out here
as well in terms of navigation so

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:17.779
as well in terms of navigation so
 

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:19.420
as well in terms of navigation so
obviously these are tabs and so you're

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:19.430
obviously these are tabs and so you're
 

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.960
obviously these are tabs and so you're
right in that pressing back on a tab

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:21.970
right in that pressing back on a tab
 

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.460
right in that pressing back on a tab
shouldn't go to the previous tab it

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:24.470
shouldn't go to the previous tab it
 

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.860
shouldn't go to the previous tab it
should exit the app right that being

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:26.870
should exit the app right that being
 

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.600
should exit the app right that being
said those settings is not something I

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:28.610
said those settings is not something I
 

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.970
said those settings is not something I
would expect to be in a tab so from an

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:30.980
would expect to be in a tab so from an
 

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.499
would expect to be in a tab so from an
Android perspective I expect to change

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:32.509
Android perspective I expect to change
 

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:34.030
Android perspective I expect to change
my settings and then hit back to go back

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040
my settings and then hit back to go back
 

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.639
my settings and then hit back to go back
into the application so i would consider

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:36.649
into the application so i would consider
 

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.769
into the application so i would consider
sort of modifying your settings screen

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:38.779
sort of modifying your settings screen
 

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:40.960
sort of modifying your settings screen
so that's using and more standard either

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:40.970
so that's using and more standard either
 

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.759
so that's using and more standard either
the standard settings framework or at

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:42.769
the standard settings framework or at
 

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:44.230
the standard settings framework or at
least behaving in a way that mimics the

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240
least behaving in a way that mimics the
 

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.079
least behaving in a way that mimics the
standard settings framework okay of it I

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:47.089
standard settings framework okay of it I
 

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:49.660
standard settings framework okay of it I
notice also that you've got a menu

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:49.670
notice also that you've got a menu
 

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.110
notice also that you've got a menu
button so you're not targeting API level

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120
button so you're not targeting API level
 

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.730
button so you're not targeting API level
14 or 15 no so it's not doing anything

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:56.740
14 or 15 no so it's not doing anything
 

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.429
14 or 15 no so it's not doing anything
so which actually turns it into a menu

00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:00.439
so which actually turns it into a menu
 

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:01.780
so which actually turns it into a menu
button of shame because you've got the

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:01.790
button of shame because you've got the
 

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.040
button of shame because you've got the
menu button here but it doesn't you

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.050
menu button here but it doesn't you
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.660
menu button here but it doesn't you
don't need it you don't you don't have

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:04.670
don't need it you don't you don't have
 

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.120
don't need it you don't you don't have
an existing menu sort of hierarchy that

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.130
an existing menu sort of hierarchy that
 

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.620
an existing menu sort of hierarchy that
you need to implement on the new version

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:08.630
you need to implement on the new version
 

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.210
you need to implement on the new version
so you can you can get rid of that

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.220
so you can you can get rid of that
 

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.009
so you can you can get rid of that
simply by changing a tire but version of

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:12.019
simply by changing a tire but version of
 

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.379
simply by changing a tire but version of
the SDK everything else will continue to

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:14.389
the SDK everything else will continue to
 

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:15.999
the SDK everything else will continue to
work the way that it has done but the

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:16.009
work the way that it has done but the
 

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.740
work the way that it has done but the
little menu button will disappear which

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:17.750
little menu button will disappear which
 

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.519
little menu button will disappear which
is a bug that was a big one let's see I

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:21.529
is a bug that was a big one let's see I
 

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:23.590
is a bug that was a big one let's see I
don't think we're rapidly running out of

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600
don't think we're rapidly running out of
 

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.470
don't think we're rapidly running out of
time so I don't think we really have

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480
time so I don't think we really have
 

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.090
time so I don't think we really have
have time to go into sort of the

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.100
have time to go into sort of the
 

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.329
have time to go into sort of the
functionality in too much detail to do I

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:31.339
functionality in too much detail to do I
 

00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:32.290
functionality in too much detail to do I
think you may have had a chance to look

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:32.300
think you may have had a chance to look
 

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.370
think you may have had a chance to look
at this last week is there anything

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.380
at this last week is there anything
 

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.650
at this last week is there anything
short and sharp we can

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660
short and sharp we can
 

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.430
short and sharp we can
just from a tablet point of view first

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440
just from a tablet point of view first
 

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.950
just from a tablet point of view first
of all it doesn't go to landscape mode

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:42.960
of all it doesn't go to landscape mode
 

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.170
of all it doesn't go to landscape mode
yes tablet interview is essentially very

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.180
yes tablet interview is essentially very
 

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.080
yes tablet interview is essentially very
big he's just very big phone view I go

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.090
big he's just very big phone view I go
 

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.300
big he's just very big phone view I go
to the tab love you yeah the job doesn't

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:51.310
to the tab love you yeah the job doesn't
 

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:56.520
to the tab love you yeah the job doesn't
ride out so uh thing I suggest is just

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.530
ride out so uh thing I suggest is just
 

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.920
ride out so uh thing I suggest is just
to use fragments and maybe make you know

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:58.930
to use fragments and maybe make you know
 

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.350
to use fragments and maybe make you know
this screen here when you add a new

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360
this screen here when you add a new
 

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.230
this screen here when you add a new
receipt you know one side of the screen

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240
receipt you know one side of the screen
 

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.350
receipt you know one side of the screen
of you of all the events and then you

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360
of you of all the events and then you
 

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.970
of you of all the events and then you
select the event and on the other side

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:11.980
select the event and on the other side
 

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.559
select the event and on the other side
of the screen would be you know the

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:13.569
of the screen would be you know the
 

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.809
of the screen would be you know the
receipts for those events yeah absalom

00:17:15.809 --> 00:17:15.819
receipts for those events yeah absalom
 

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.939
receipts for those events yeah absalom
so that be you know a little ice nicer

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:17.949
so that be you know a little ice nicer
 

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:19.439
so that be you know a little ice nicer
for the tablets because right now it's

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:19.449
for the tablets because right now it's
 

00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:20.670
for the tablets because right now it's
just you know a lot of wasted space

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:20.680
just you know a lot of wasted space
 

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.300
just you know a lot of wasted space
right here you see just a bunch of wood

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.310
right here you see just a bunch of wood
 

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.120
right here you see just a bunch of wood
it's not so much yes well yeah yeah

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.130
it's not so much yes well yeah yeah
 

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.530
it's not so much yes well yeah yeah
that's a really good tip I mean a lot of

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:28.540
that's a really good tip I mean a lot of
 

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.270
that's a really good tip I mean a lot of
the times with you or you know any time

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280
the times with you or you know any time
 

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.440
the times with you or you know any time
you've got sort of two levels of

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.450
you've got sort of two levels of
 

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.420
you've got sort of two levels of
navigation which you effectively do here

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:33.430
navigation which you effectively do here
 

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.880
navigation which you effectively do here
you've got the three tabs + the the

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:35.890
you've got the three tabs + the the
 

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.790
you've got the three tabs + the the
events to choose that's report time it's

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:38.800
events to choose that's report time it's
 

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.430
events to choose that's report time it's
interesting yeah so you've either got

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440
interesting yeah so you've either got
 

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.750
interesting yeah so you've either got
the tabs and then you've got different

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760
the tabs and then you've got different
 

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.460
the tabs and then you've got different
events the different report types and

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:44.470
events the different report types and
 

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.990
events the different report types and
all of those things so on a tablet you

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000
all of those things so on a tablet you
