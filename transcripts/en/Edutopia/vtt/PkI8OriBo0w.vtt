00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.196
&gt;&gt;Jamy: It's all about time.

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:16.806
Good teachers know that
they need to differentiate.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:19.716
It's just something that we
have to do, but finding the time

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:22.036
and carving that time
out of the day to meet

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:23.976
with those small groups can
be very, very difficult.

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.256
&gt;&gt;Jamy: So to have it
actually built into our day

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.816
where there's a set
time for half an hour

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:35.956
to pull those small
groups, it's wonderful.

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:43.516
&gt;&gt;So I know that it's working
and I know that there's

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.636
so much growth going
on in this class.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:49.386
We're seeing huge gains, gains
that we wouldn't normally see

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:55.136
with just a whole group
lesson once a day.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.336
&gt;&gt;Cole: Teachers kept coming
to me and saying, "Cole,

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.386
we need to have time to be
able to work with these kids

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.196
in small groups, but
I have classrooms

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:02.676
of thirty-two to thirty-seven.

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:03.866
How do we do that?

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.526
&gt;&gt;Cole: We put our heads
together, we started looking

00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:07.706
at the schedule and
providing opportunities

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:11.996
where kids were going to other
places while leaving some

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.996
to do some response
to intervention

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:16.196
or small group differentiation
with.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:21.076
We have our fourth,
fifth and sixth graders

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:23.476
who have the opportunity to,
if they did their homework,

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.716
they were doing well,
they got to choose.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.156
This is where the I
Choose comes from.

00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:29.636
They got to choose
between going to PE

00:01:29.636 --> 00:01:32.886
or computer lab or
library or music.

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:42.946
Now where the teacher
had the I Choose,

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:45.706
they get to take a small group
in which she's identified

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:49.396
or he's identified as needing a
specific skill, then being able

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:53.406
to work with those students
during that last 30 minutes,

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:55.956
where they have specific
skills that we're trying

00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:58.586
to progress monitor, benchmark
and move them forward with.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:04.506
&gt;&gt;Jamy: So in my classroom,
the kids at the end

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:06.656
of our math lesson have
formative assessment

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.276
and it's usually four questions,

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:11.296
and it covers the concepts
that we did that day.

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:15.906
And I grade them very quickly
and I'm able to determine

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.626
who understood what we were
doing that day and who didn't.

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:23.086
So the kids that got usually
an eighty percent or higher,

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.316
they go to their I
Choose for that day.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.556
The kids that didn't
will stay here with me.

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:31.906
&gt;&gt;Alyssa: We do a
pretest and sometimes

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:35.636
if you get one wrong,
she helps you on it.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:37.506
&gt;&gt;Jamy: Okay, so
I'm here to help.

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:42.006
We're going to play
some blackjack.

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:45.786
And we usually just go over
the same lesson over again.

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:48.386
I take out the manipulatives,
we play games.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.066
It's visual for them
and kinesthetic.

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.826
&gt;&gt;Alyssa: Last time 'round I
didn't get the decimals right.

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:09.056
She helped us on the homework
part and she taught us how

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:12.136
to do the decimals
in an easier way.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:18.906
&gt;&gt;Cole: The teacher I Choose
is actually a great time

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:21.966
to close those skill gaps
and make them proficient

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:24.456
and make them successful,
which makes everyone happy.

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:30.386
The ebb and flow of I Choose
changes every single day based

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:34.606
upon not only the performance,
but how they did in class

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:37.926
and what the teacher feels
is best for the child.

00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:44.116
We even have kids in
fifth and sixth grade

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:47.656
who take their half an hour and
their I Choose is going to help

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.586
out first graders
in the RTI process,

00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:51.726
whether that's doing
flash cards to help them

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:56.116
with their sight words or letter
names or whatever it may be.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.676
The teachers are happy because
they were the push for it.

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:02.756
They were the ones
that wanted the time.

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:05.116
We were able to find
it for them.

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:07.276
What we're hearing from kids
is they absolutely love it.

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.656
Byproduct is, they're paying
attention more in class,

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:12.056
they're pushing themselves
to make sure that they get

00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:13.476
to choose where they want to go.

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:15.146
Those kids that are struggling,

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:18.216
we're able to now create
proficiency, move them forward.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:20.286
That's what lets us
know it's working.
