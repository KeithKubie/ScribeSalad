00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:12.942
“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.”

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:16.286
So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:20.358
in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur.

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:22.195
Writing in the 15th century,

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:27.031
Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be.

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:31.664
King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.714
along with his retinue of knights,

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:34.714
Guinevere,

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:35.921
the Round Table,

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:36.800
Camelot,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.634
and of course, Excalibur.

00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:44.013
But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them?

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:48.695
King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages,

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:54.252
but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time:

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:57.190
the Saxon invasions of Britain.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.223
After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE,

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.613
Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:09.149
quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.689
The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.416
through several centuries of turmoil.

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:18.063
There are hardly any written records 
from this time,

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:21.697
so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history.

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:26.162
However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:31.118
One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur,

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:34.345
though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:37.717
It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur,

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:42.024
was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur.

00:01:42.024 --> 00:01:43.578
That’s not much to go on,

00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:45.566
but whoever this Arthur was,

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.817
he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:54.405
Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.164
Despite this uncertainty,

00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:00.016
references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:01.791
hundreds of years later.

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:08.997
In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions.

00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:11.173
Using Celtic and Latin sources,

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.719
he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.289
titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain."

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.868
The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:24.641
History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account.

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.857
Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions,

00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:30.597
he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:34.736
to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records.

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:37.191
A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur,

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.538
and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places.

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:43.672
But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds

00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:47.181
with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.703
Geoffrey blended them all:

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.640
A magical sword called Caledfwlch

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.762
and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material,

00:02:55.762 --> 00:03:00.973
so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus,

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.575
the Latin translation of Caledfwlch.

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:06.906
Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin,

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:10.845
based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story.

00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:14.005
If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader,

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:19.195
but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.832
Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for,

00:03:21.832 --> 00:03:24.239
and was soon translated from Latin
into French

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.375
by the poet Wace around 1155 CE.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.117
Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword,

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:32.818
castle,

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:34.102
and wizard:

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:35.994
the Round Table.

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:38.224
He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:41.656
so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed,

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:45.713
and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table.

00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:51.059
After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes,

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:55.776
wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame.

00:03:55.776 --> 00:04:00.960
He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.706
and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures.

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.245
He conceived Arthur,

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.322
Lancelot,

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.753
and Guinevere’s love triangle.

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:14.568
In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail.

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:21.063
Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology.

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.675
He lived in the middle of the Crusades,

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:28.170
and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.716
casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion.

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:34.887
Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages

00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:37.033
followed from Chrétien’s work.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:41.008
In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot,

00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:44.736
and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur.

00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:45.997
In the 15th century,

00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:50.473
Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur,

00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:53.643
the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur.

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:57.751
In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem,

00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.362
his story has transformed over 
and over

00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:04.633
to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences.

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:08.229
And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.027
Whether or not the man ever lived,

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:10.853
loved,

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:11.531
reigned,

00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.679
or adventured,

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.296
it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.
