1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,340
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:07,920
Just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm just checking in on you. I'm
just checking in here. Sorry,

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm just checking in on you to
seeing how you of weeks ago.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,610
A little half hour checking in.
How you doing? How you doing? Okay.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,940
Fed fucking tastic. You know it's funny,

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,040
I'm always a day late and
a dollar short to shit,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,170
so I fucking got a youtube page now.
Um, we're doing all this animation.

9
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm fucking hiring people to do stuff.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,150
Try to get this fucking thing going so
someday I won't even have to leave my

11
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,910
house. All I gotta do is just sit here,

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
ramble on about crazy shit as I slip
into fucking senility and I'll still be

13
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,090
able to eat my apple sauce.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,710
I'll still be able to pay for some
fucking applesauce. All right?

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,790
That is what, that, that is what
the old age is all about. Okay?

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,580
You don't leave your house, but
checks is still coming in. Okay?

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,220
You got a cupboard full of fucking
applesauce. Once you open them,

18
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:06,240
you put them in the fridge. You know,
even though it hurts your teeth, right?

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,730
Cause you got fucking nerve involvement
and all you fucking, I get teeth, right?

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,940
You go back to eating the same shit
you used to eat as a baby. It's just,

21
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,750
it's like apple sauce is Gerber
food for fucking old people, right?

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,220
So you got that. What else do you have?

23
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,740
You mixed a little Manet's in there and
either you don't have to fucking Choo.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,370
Um, so I'm getting the youtube
page going and, and you know what?

25
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:29,070
These fucking constant youtube do know if,

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,610
I can't even tell you they got this
thing where they decide if what the fuck

27
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,970
happened on your thing is,
is a little too offensive.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,840
Like they fucking decide and then
you don't get any of the ad money.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,600
And I'm like, but the ads still
there, who gets the money?

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,900
Youtube keeps it fucking unbelievable.

31
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,860
I'll tell you right fucking now the
number one commandment broken it.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm telling you, it's stealing. And
this more stealing that goes on,

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,940
on the legal side of business fee,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,720
everybody's always make going fucking
Scorsese. He's always doing that,

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,720
you know, whatever that fucking song is.

36
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,140
I could go from rags to riches.
That's what the hell it is, right?

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,550
All that good fellas. Shit, fuck you
pay me. Fuck you pay me all of that.

38
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,610
Like that doesn't exist
in the legal world.

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,640
It's even fucking worst and it's more
overt that it's just straight up fucking

40
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,250
stealing. So I don't know what I'm
going to do with the youtube page.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,270
I'm actually thinking, what am I,

42
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,120
why don't I just move it to
my fucking website? Right.

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,370
I'll reach out to fucking Matt Miller
high life. You want to fucking, uh,

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,050
you want to fucking just be on all
my videos and I'll just do it on my,

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,270
my page and I can do say whatever the
fuck I want and not worry about somebody

46
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,280
taking my fucking
retirement applesauce money.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
It's not like I'm making
any fucking money anyways.

48
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,460
You got to have like a billion hits,
I think to make $7. Well, you know,

49
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,180
you got to cure rate as
they're talking to you here.

50
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,300
Like a cash machine going off in
the fucking background, whatever.

51
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,400
Who gives a shit. All right. You know
what? I am actually in a great mood here.

52
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,510
I am in a great mood. And, um,
despite that highway robbery,

53
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,340
youtube, she called it your
tube to your fucking bullshit.

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,290
You're keeping all the
fucking money, your cons, um,

55
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,940
who gives a shit right at the end of
the fucking day? Well, obviously you do,

56
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,650
Bill, you wouldn't have brought
it up. I don't fucking mind. Just,

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,020
just fuck me over. Why
can't you just fuck me over?

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,590
Why can't you just come out and just say,
listen, we're going to fuck you over.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,670
Why do you to lie?

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,590
Why do you got to sit there and
act like you're not going to do it?

61
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,630
And then you turn around and you
do it. That's what upsets me.

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,040
It's not that you're doing it.

63
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,260
Okay.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,940
So you said you weren't going
to do it. Alright, anyways, uh,

65
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Brad Marshawn suspended for two games
for stab and Jake Dodgen in the balls.

66
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,930
So he got one game for each balls, each
ball that he fucking stabbed him. And,

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,830
and uh, it makes sense. I know a lot of
people like, why didn't Sidney Crosby?

68
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,780
Cause what Sidney did don't you see as
he turned his fucking stick sideways and

69
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,910
he gave him a little tap, a
little tap of the ball back,

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,020
like the same level that when you know
the doctor, you go to get a physical,

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,430
he as you cross your legs and you know
he hits you and your knee goes up. Right?

72
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:13,190
Just like that. He was just
testing the guy's reflexes.

73
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,220
So he gets no suspension
or a penalty, you know,

74
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,860
plus he has those big pouty lips
and everybody feels bad for him.

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,940
That's the genius to Sidney Crosby.
Sidney Crosby has a look on his face,

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,510
you know, like right before you make
your girlfriend cry and then you're like,

77
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,090
oh my God, she's going to cry. So
you just abandon your argument.

78
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:31,780
Like that's what his face looks like.
So I think that's why he's able,

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,040
that's why he's able to get away with
what he gets away with. Plus, you know,

80
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,280
he's a superstar and he makes everybody
a ton of money. So Brad Marshawn,

81
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,090
you know, you live by the sword, you die
by the sword. I remember branded press,

82
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:47,360
fucking stabbed them in the nuts, uh,

83
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,970
when we will play in Vancouver
a couple of years ago.

84
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,240
And then what's funny is still listen
to Jack Edwards when he sees Marshawn,

85
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:56,280
he's such a fucking homer.
He's just sitting to go, oh,

86
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,430
look at all that is
blatantly out of the rules.

87
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,310
That is a delicious video
for the boys in New York.

88
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,460
Hope you enjoy your day off.

89
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,040
You're talking about
definitely a suspension and a,

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,700
and then marsh shun wave, you
know, fucking just, I mean,

91
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,630
he uppercutted this dude's nuts.
His stick was not on the flat side.

92
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,340
Like he was giving it
a backhand or you know,

93
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,290
he did an upper cut with the stick
to the guy's Tatun ball area. And,

94
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,750
um, like, you know,

95
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,840
when your wife tells you to shovel the
driveway and you're already pissed at

96
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:27,170
you,

97
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,010
you know how hard you throw those first
two fucking scoops of snow over your

98
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,890
shoulder. That's how hard he hit
this guy in the fucking nuts.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,560
And I gotta tell you as a Bruins
Fan, I thought I was like, oh my God,

100
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,560
he just fucked us over cause he
just got kicked out of the game.

101
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:46,670
I think it was still zero to zero
against the Tampa Bay lightning.

102
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,290
And we were waiting to, um, you know,
see if we were gonna make the playoffs.

103
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,110
I'm like, Oh my God, you just got to give
right at the end of the first period.

104
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm like, he's going to get kicked
out. That's going to fucking know,

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,590
give Tampa a little jumping.
They'll their, their game.

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,090
They're going to win this fucking game.

107
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,640
He's going to be out for the rest of the
season. And, uh, and then we're gonna,

108
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,370
you know, I catastrophize in my
head, what if we fucking, you know,

109
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,810
don't make the playoffs
because of that playoff.

110
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,230
But fortunately we ended up winning I
think four to one and four to nothing.

111
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,700
And, um, if we beat Ottawa tonight,

112
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,280
we can actually, uh, you know,
we at the very least, uh, are,

113
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,480
are going to be a wild card.
But I mean I don't, obviously,

114
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,350
I don't feel like playing
fucking the capitols right now.

115
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,940
They looking like world beaters, but
um, eventually you will have to play it,

116
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,560
but it'd be nice to maybe have a
chance to win a playoff series.

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,860
We'll see how we do though. You
never know goaltenders can get,

118
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,840
they get hot at the right time in here.

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,980
There's no telling how far you could
go in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,470
Um, I feel like for me, I just feel that,

121
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,610
um, that's actually become
part of my vocabulary now.

122
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,240
Cause every time Nia watches
those fucking reality shows,

123
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:03,650
people just go for me or Tinky I just
feel, and now I've done it so much,

124
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:07,340
now I'm doing it. So I am officially
bill Kardashians right now. All right.

125
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm not thinking about
transitioning. I'm not going to die.

126
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,490
What's left of my fucking, I got my,
got my head shaved now by my beard.

127
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:17,390
I'm not gonna dry dyed
fucking jet black, you know,

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
but like at Kardashians I did
marry an African American,

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
so I feel like I'm halfway there.

130
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:28,400
I think I could actually say that I'm
one of their cousins. I don't know. Oh,

131
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:33,080
I see a Photoshop coming
anyways, um, to get back to,

132
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,340
uh, to the hockey. Um, and so yeah,

133
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,250
so we're in the playoffs for the
first time in three fucking years,

134
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,850
so it's great to be in there and
hopefully we'll be Ottawa tonight. And uh,

135
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,550
I bet Marshawn cost himself a little
bit of fucking money there. You know,

136
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:50,720
I would think in his contract that he
gets a bonus if he gets 40 goals and the

137
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,590
man was sitting on 39, we're
going to play Ottawa tonight.

138
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,930
Forget about the rest of the game that
he could have played in Tampa playing

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,750
Ottawa tonight. And according
to the puck off podcast,

140
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,400
hosted by Joe Barnick on the all things
comedy network, he said that, uh,

141
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,330
auto has got a lot of injuries in
their defense. Who knows? Who knows?

142
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,860
So I guess what you take away from all
of that is that if you're in the NHL,

143
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,470
if you're going to fucking
hit somebody's ball bag,

144
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,520
you do it with the flat side of the
stick. All right? You get yourself,

145
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,290
you know, some collagen injections
in the ellipse like a Kardashians.

146
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,740
I don't know. Maybe they did. It
didn't, I dunno. Um, you know,

147
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,040
so you look like you're about ready to
cry like Cindy Crosby and you will not

148
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
get suspended. All right.

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,740
But I guess you heard Crosby does
and they fucking slashed somebody.

150
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,910
You almost took the end of his fucking,

151
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,300
like the guys that ended the guy's
finger was hanging off. You know,

152
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,510
I'm going to go out on a limb and say
that guy, he's going to have a uh,

153
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,680
there's not really like any of the
goons anymore. These to have like that.

154
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:53,681
That's like players like Crosby's just
have like security like back in the day

155
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,410
in like the 80s, like the fucking
tough guys back in the 80s, where like

156
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,900
they did everything but just have like
blue blazers on in ear pieces standing

157
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,180
next to the goal scores. If
you went anywhere near them,

158
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,120
they'd fucking murder you. And
I'm, I'm trying to think of who,

159
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,020
who the penguins have penguins
never really had a goon.

160
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,510
They had a bunch of fucking knee breakers.
They were really into like, well,

161
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,760
we're not going to fight you.
We're just gonna end your career,

162
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,900
blow out your fucking knee boards,
you and that type of shit. Filthy,

163
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,350
filthy fucking franchise. But you know,
the penguin is a dirty bird, isn't it?

164
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,060
Sort of the pigeon of
the Antarctic, isn't it?

165
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,060
Did you guys hear their buildings
on luxury condos down there?

166
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,850
Luxury condos in Antarctica? You
know, people in Silicone Valley,

167
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,470
they don't know where
else to spend their money.

168
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,940
They already bought up San Francisco.

169
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,440
They're starting to come down here to
la and a for a summer place because San

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,160
Francisco so fucking cold. Um, that the
next thing that they're going to do,

171
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,050
they're gonna be down in
Antarctica. You can look it up.

172
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:57,051
It's true luxury condos in
Antarctica and a la to Antartica.

173
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,770
They're going to have the first direct
flight in July. All of that is true.

174
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:06,270
I'm not making this up at all because
I have a half hour to a to fill up here

175
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,450
and I'm only 10 minutes in. I would
never do that to you guys. Um, all right,

176
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,390
let's talk about, oh, Billy
beef. K Care. All right.

177
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,080
Fucking Dad Bod Magoo who uh,

178
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:20,430
after his European run last Selma
is up to a fucking 190 pounds.

179
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,270
And then I kinda started working
out, getting ready for my special.

180
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,020
I got down to like a buck
78 finished the special.

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,140
And are they really specials anymore now
that there's one coming out every week?

182
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,270
It was just sort of
bill talks for an hour,

183
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,060
I think since my special
came out in January,

184
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,670
there's been 97 other hour long specials.

185
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:45,900
I think there's been out one
out every day. Um, anyways,

186
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,290
so I uh, I got down to a buck 78,

187
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,830
79 ish and uh, and then
I was just like, oh,

188
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,500
right now I'm waiting to
become a dad. You know,

189
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,440
my wife was in the third trimester,
so I'm going to try meth.

190
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,710
I'm going to fucking blame her a
little bit, even though I don't,

191
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,000
I was just drinking too much everything.

192
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,970
So I got up to like a backup
to like a buck 85 buck 86.

193
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,480
So now last week I got
myself down to 180 pounds.

194
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,540
This week I wanted to lose at
least two pounds. All right.

195
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,210
The way in is tomorrow, but uh, I'll
just start doing them on Thursday.

196
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:19,080
So I wanted to get down to one 78
maybe one 77 got on the scale today.

197
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,410
One 77.6.

198
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,770
All right, so I am,

199
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,640
I got one day on a film coming up.
Oh, aren't you fancy, Bill? Yes, I am.

200
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,390
I got one day at a film. So
ultimately, you know, I need to be,

201
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,190
to not get too much shit on Twitter
about being a big Booz headed fucking

202
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,510
baldheaded red cunt, you know,
which always fucking happens.

203
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:48,210
All these fucking actresses fucking
bitch moaning and complaining like the

204
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:53,210
Internet has only mean to them. I swear
to God, fucking self-involved lunatics,

205
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,210
right? Um, I gotta get
down to like my fight once,

206
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,270
usually about a buck 72 on camera. If
I walk around a buck 75, you know, um,

207
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,560
if you just see me coming down
the street, I look radiant. Okay.

208
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:08,800
You're gonna look at me like Jesus.
Bill, are you expecting book at that?

209
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:12,730
Look on your face. I'm fucking
with you. But I got to get,

210
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,640
but on camera I gotta be
down to a buck 72. All right.

211
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:19,840
And every fucking actor knows what
fucking wait, you gotta be at c, you know,

212
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,750
and you'll all get all,

213
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,330
you just gauge it on social media feedback
cause you're just going to get a ton

214
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,530
of shit. The second you
go, a little power dude,

215
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,960
you look like Vince Vaughn in the end
of the fucking a, the breakup. You know,

216
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,900
that was my favorite part of that
fucking movie. I love that fucking movie.

217
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,700
I loved how Vince did the fucking,

218
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,070
he had the a not in a relationship
fucking, you know, out there crushing ass.

219
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,720
And then when he was in the relationship,
he had that extra 10 to 15, you know,

220
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,910
the Netflix, wait, let's
sit here and you know,

221
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,420
make some Mac and cheese
and play footsie. Um,

222
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,020
I don't wanna ruin the end of the movie,
but that's one of the best, you know.

223
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,530
And that was a chick flick too,
cause it was about a relationship.

224
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:03,010
And that's one of my favorite things
about it was it played out in a real way.

225
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:07,990
Right down to the, you know, when he's
not in a relationship, he's fucking,

226
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,050
you know, he's at his
fighting weight. You know,

227
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm trying to attract somebody
to fuck me again. Okay.

228
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:18,970
You were a layup so I had
my layup extra 15 on right.

229
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,340
That's what I'm trying to lose right
now. Little Billy layup weight.

230
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,410
So I'm down to one 77.6 so next week
the official way in is on Friday,

231
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,330
but I'll do them on
Thursday just to give a,

232
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,510
just add a little excitement in your
life because I'm so self involved and I

233
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,700
feel like you guys actually
give a shit. So do it with me.

234
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,610
Lose two pounds this week
at least if not three.

235
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,610
So I want to be down to about a buck 74
a by Friday next week and then we shoot

236
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,400
the following week. So I could
actually be down to one 73 you know,

237
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:50,320
if I puke behind a dumpster, you
know, take the old fucking, you know,

238
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,060
you know what route, I
guess you can't even see.

239
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,850
You can't even say bulemia without
people freaking out unless you're like,

240
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:59,050
it's one of the worst of the those. You
can't even use it as a comedy reference.

241
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,890
Are you allowed to, are you allowed to
say, you know, use that as a reference.

242
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,130
Like I'll go, I'll go if
I have to, if I have to,

243
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:11,131
I will make myself fucking Yak for fucking
a day to get down to the buck 72 to

244
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,890
deliver my line and a half on this movie.

245
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,380
Bill Burger King of the line in a half.

246
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,530
If you've got a line in a half that
you need to fucking be delivered by a

247
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,950
tertiary character. Did I use that
word correctly? I am your fucking man.

248
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,400
I will show up on time in
shape, ready to fucking work.

249
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:34,360
I'll show up at my fighting weight
of one 72 I will deliver that line.

250
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,610
I'll even give you a look. All right.

251
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,400
He gave me like a special and special
appearance by bill borough and the opening

252
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:45,070
credits, whatever the fuck that is
called, I will actually throw in,

253
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,170
I'll give you, I'll give
you the rock, you know,

254
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,360
with one of my invisible eyebrows that
you can't really see. Um, yeah. Anyway,

255
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,520
so I'm going to get down to that.

256
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,770
I'm going to get down to
hopefully like a book, whatever.

257
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
Okay.

258
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
72 whatever. Look at me. I
sound like the fucking Raymond,

259
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,340
but that's the only way to do it.

260
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,270
And then eventually I'd like to
get down to one, a buck 68. Okay.

261
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,070
And then not do what I always do
to be like, oh, I'm a buck 68,

262
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,770
you know, who wants some fucking cookies?

263
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,610
Let's get a fucking 12 pack,
you know? And then I just,

264
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:19,450
I slowly but surely go
right back up and uh, and I,

265
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,200
I have to make a lifestyle
change. I just feel like for me,

266
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm going to be a lot happier if I cut
out gluten and I still don't know what

267
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,194
gluten is.

268
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,100
Okay.

269
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,130
It's some sort of chemical
that's in wheat, I believe.

270
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,030
And evidently it's not good for you,
even though wheat is is from the earth,

271
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,050
but you know there are poisonous plants
or is gluten like some shit that some

272
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:46,910
fucking nerds made for psychopaths that
have food companies that adds to the

273
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,060
density or some shit and somehow they
make more money. Is that what it is?

274
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,890
But always looking to do that shit.

275
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,400
Okay.

276
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,150
You know what I mean? You can't fucking
satisfying these fucking lunatic.

277
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,180
These fucking guys did. The men
at the top of these corporations,

278
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,070
you know what they like? They
like a bunch of fucking broads,

279
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,700
you know what I mean? Like no matter
what they have, they never fucking happy.

280
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,241
You know,

281
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:09,420
you got straight hair now you want
curly hair and now you want short hair.

282
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,460
You know they ain't want to wear a crop
top that you want to fucking, you know,

283
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:17,280
have clam digger zone. I, I don't, I
don't know what the fuck is she doing?

284
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,600
Can you just put on a fucking pair of
sweatpants and just sit down for five

285
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:23,130
fucking minutes? You know, hard.

286
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:25,630
My wife would be laughing at this shit
right now because I'm the one who I,

287
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:26,464
I fucking

288
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,920
the coat look like this is supposed to
be my relaxed energy right now and I'm

289
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:35,330
still talking to fast. Whenever I listened
back to my podcast, I'm like, why?

290
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,020
Why do I talk so fast? I thought I
w I thought I talked a lot slower.

291
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,660
I need to have like
cocktail party energy now.

292
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,050
Even at cocktail party, you gotta yell.
You got to yell over people, right?

293
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,400
Okay.

294
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,040
I Dunno. Cocktail party,
just call it what it is.

295
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,800
We're getting away from our kids to get
shit faced for a few hours. All right?

296
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,050
And somebody's going to try
to dominate the conversation.

297
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,480
Somebody is going to
fucking bring up politics.

298
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,830
Someone's going to get too drunk.

299
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,530
Then there's going to be a fucking
argument and there's got to be apologies

300
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:12,120
afterwards. Why doesn't everybody just
pick a fucking corner of the room? Okay.

301
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,350
Stare at the carpet and just

302
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,010
start drinking. Okay. That's it.

303
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,780
Why else would we here is
this some swingers party?
We going to trade off here?

304
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:24,740
Like what? What is going
on? I don't, Maggie,

305
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,970
I don't give a shit about your
worldview. You don't hold public office.

306
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:32,240
You do not have access to top
secret documents in the Pentagon.

307
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,210
So at the end of the day,
what am I doing here?

308
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,200
And I really listening to like a nurse
trying to tell me how to fix a car.

309
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,580
Isn't that kind of the same thing?

310
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,140
Would you like to hear what I think
about fucking the Middle East?

311
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,800
Cos You wouldn't lie right
there. Finish your fucking drink.

312
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,640
Um, anyways. Uh, what else is going on
this weekend? Oh, I'm going to be in,

313
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm going to be in San
Antonio, but not one show.

314
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,270
Two shows at the majestic theater.
Oh my God. It's so majestic.

315
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,800
They added a second show.

316
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm going to be doing some morning radio
tomorrow to hype that second show, um,

317
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,530
doing that one show. I'm doing
two shows like Brad Marshawn.

318
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,170
I'm not going to fucking
stab you in one ball.

319
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm stabbing into not going
to get suspended for one game.

320
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,380
You're suspended for it. I'm
gonna do one show for every game.

321
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,950
Brad Marshawn was suspended. Okay.

322
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:33,090
Was unfairly targeted because he in a,

323
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,590
in a moment of emotion, he used the
shoveling, the snow fucking technique,

324
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,060
and he did not have the Sidney Crosby
pouty lips for when he went to the board

325
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,630
in New York. I think that's what
Crosby does. You know, he just,

326
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,070
he doesn't even have to go to New York.

327
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:52,950
They just fucking put him on Skype and
he just sits there like, hi guys. Oh,

328
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm sorry. You know, I was
just having a bad period.

329
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,520
Oh, isn't it amazing how much I could
talk without even know what the fuck? Um,

330
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,190
I ain't know what I'm
talking about here. Um, Hey,

331
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,890
do you guys want to know how to
change a shitty diaper properly?

332
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,580
Are there any parents out there? Here's
one to grow on. Here's one of my,

333
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,730
here's a tip for you. All
right? What happens is,

334
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,800
is when you have a little base,

335
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,010
say the word, say the God damn
fucking Raj, I'm going to be out. Uh,

336
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,320
if you have a baby, um,

337
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,100
and you're breastfeeding it as
opposed to giving it formula,

338
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,750
I'm staying away from that shit. I just,

339
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,610
I don't like that fucking name
formula at that fucking name alone.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,880
I'm not giving my baby formula. You know,

341
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,940
I would just picture like one of those
Frankenstein movies with the graduated

342
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,330
syndrome cylinder and the dry dry ice
smoke coming out of the top of it.

343
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,600
So anyways, so they bait. Yeah,
they got a liquid diet going on.

344
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:01,860
So when you know, when the fucking
backdoor comes off the hinges,

345
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:05,490
as they say, uh, you
know, this is the deal.

346
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:08,160
The second you hear the fucking,

347
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,700
you know the rumblings in the grumblings,

348
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,140
what you gotta do is you gotta
get your kid not horizontal.

349
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,770
You got to have them upright. All right?

350
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,160
Now this is the problem when you
take them down to the changing table,

351
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,960
when you lay them back down again,
okay? And you take an off the one Z,

352
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:28,620
you got to elevate him a little
bit. You know, as they say,

353
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:31,440
shit runs down hill. Okay?

354
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,230
So what you want to do is you want
to use gravity as a favor. This,

355
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,820
it's a two person job.

356
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,540
If you're going to save that
fucking onesy all right?

357
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,370
Which you got to do is you have to have
the baby fucking standing up on the

358
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,860
change in table. All right?

359
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,790
The other person on does the onesy lifts
the onesy up over the fucking diaper,

360
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,180
and then you'd take the diaper off like
you'd taken the transmission out of a

361
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:59,860
car that's up on a lift. All right? Then
you use gravity. Everything drops down.

362
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,360
I'm trying to be as not graphic
as humanly possible. Okay?

363
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,650
Then you know, then you
begin the fucking, uh,

364
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,630
the restoration

365
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,620
because I'm telling you right now,
if you're home alone, all right?

366
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,360
And you lay that kid down,
then one shit runs downhill.

367
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,850
Now what's on the One z?
You got to take it off.

368
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:28,780
You got to go over the kid's fucking
head and now you got shit on the fucking,

369
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,230
I'm sorry. And this is what it is. I
don't want to put shit on the kid's head.

370
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,643
Okay?

371
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,060
I'll tell you it's a rough one. You know,
so fortunately if that fucking app is,

372
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,370
is somebody else around, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to get that graphic,

373
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:45,100
but you know, people who are parents of
telling you just one person holds it up,

374
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,780
the undo the ones, he, you dropped the
diaper out like a fucking trans mission,

375
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,800
you know, do a little cleanup.
Then you fucking set the kid down,

376
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,560
then you finish the fucking
clean up, Bam. A new diaper.

377
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,640
Actually you don't even do that.

378
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,180
Usually we just bring her into the fucking
shower and start all over again with

379
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:04,410
a brand new squeaky clean
fucking kid. And there you go.

380
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,880
There's a little percent. That's my first
per unsolicited parental advice. Okay.

381
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,690
I just felt like for me, I just
felt like it needed to be sad.

382
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,953
Okay.

383
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,850
Is anybody watching that
reality show? Black ink? Uh,

384
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,410
my wife watches it all the time.

385
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,240
There is a woman on there that makes
my temper look like a fucking summer

386
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,074
breeze.

387
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,030
Good Lord that she lose her fucking shit.

388
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,550
It's like she's possessed. Um,

389
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,250
I actually just said literally have to
walk around a little, but I, you know,

390
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,830
I keep forgetting this
show. I started the watch,

391
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:44,310
I watched the first three episodes and
I absolutely fucking loved it and I

392
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:49,050
tweeted about it. It was a cartoon from
Japan, I guess they're called anime,

393
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,340
which I did know that,

394
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,660
but I didn't realize it was
such a divisive thing to
say that you like to show

395
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,820
that was anime. I feel like is animated
like the Emo of fucking cartoons.

396
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,680
Like I tweeted that, I liked
this show called one punch man.

397
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,760
All right. And the fucking
responses that I got, I got, dude,

398
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,870
are you fucking drunk? Oh
my God, you're in the enemy.

399
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,980
And then other people just like
this is like the create it. However,

400
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,960
I just like to show,

401
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,040
I've watched enough for the same type of
shit and I was scrolling through and I

402
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,010
was like, what the fuck is this show?
And I looked and it had five stars,

403
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,420
four and a half, five stars,

404
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,780
which is why I really hope Netflix
doesn't go to thumbs up, thumbs down.

405
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:38,590
Like I said, because it's so
fucking, you know, stubbing your toe,

406
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:42,460
thumbs down, Adolf Hitler, thumbs
down. I mean the thumbs down is,

407
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,860
this is a big gap between
Hitler and the, you know,

408
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,580
stubborn your fucking toe. Um, anyway,

409
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,190
so I put this thing on and
what I loved about the show,

410
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:54,970
um,

411
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,520
aside from the fact that I really thought
it was funny that you actually kind of

412
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,370
got like a sense of what young people

413
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,110
feel like in Japan as far as their view
of going into the corporate world was

414
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:11,111
very similar to the empty feeling unless
you're a fucking sociopath over here.

415
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:16,430
I find like a very like common thread to
that and to basically give the overall

416
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:20,260
thing the superhero in it. He's not a
suit. He doesn't want to be a superhero.

417
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,680
All right.

418
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,620
Any fucking trained really hard cause
he wanted to be the strongest guy in the

419
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:28,370
world. And in his training he lost
all his hair, which is hilarious.

420
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:29,990
And he's really self conscious about it.

421
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,660
But he ended up developing
like this punch.

422
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,510
And no matter what monster he runs into,

423
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:37,190
he doesn't give a shit
whether they kill him.

424
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:42,020
He's just completely devoid of
any like passion or emotion.

425
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,030
Like what happens to you when you get
shoved into a fucking cubicle and a,

426
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:51,290
and he's got this one punch and he just
fucking can punch so hard that no matter

427
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,350
how fucking Badass the
monster is, he gives him one,

428
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,600
somebody said they should have called
the show, the right they have Fred,

429
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,090
he gives him the fucking
Brian in the fucking,

430
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,400
in the face is Eddie Murphy
says in the face, um,

431
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,470
and their fucking head explodes
and the monsters that he fights,

432
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,280
you also get more of an insight
into where people's heads are at,

433
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,430
uh, in Japan. And it was like, you know,
one of the monsters you fought with,

434
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:21,140
some giant virus sent here by
the Earth to get rid of the,

435
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,460
all the humans cause of what
we'd done to the planet.

436
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:24,780
So there's an environmental thing.

437
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,820
Then my favorite one was
this guy who was crab man.

438
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,790
He was half like up top and he was all
a crab. And then the bottom, he was,

439
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,790
he was half a guy and he
was in, but the bottom half,

440
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,990
he's in his bare feet and tidy
whities and the guy's like,

441
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:44,410
oh, I ate so much crab meat
that I became a fucking crab.

442
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:49,120
And to me he represented the
upper 1% corporate guys, you know,

443
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,960
on some power lunch. Just eaten all the
fucking Sushi and just take, take, take,

444
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:56,320
take, take, nothing spiritual about
them. So he gave him the all right there,

445
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:56,890
Fred.

446
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,690
And then he fought this fucking lady and
she had command of all the mosquitoes

447
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,080
and she'd stick the mosquitoes
on everybody suck all
the blood out of you and

448
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,480
all your fucking energy. And
then it would make her stronger.

449
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,920
And to me it's like, oh, this is a gold
digging blood sucking whore. Right.

450
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,980
And then once she got it to do it to
all the animals and everybody there,

451
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,660
she didn't need them mosquitoes anymore.

452
00:26:16,661 --> 00:26:18,730
She told all the mosquitoes
to go fuck themselves.

453
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:23,320
And I'm like slash this is also somebody
who becomes successful and forgets

454
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:26,200
where they come from. And they look
at everybody where they used to be.

455
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,730
It's like a Bunch of Fucking pee ons,

456
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,210
a bunch of little insignificant
little mosquitoes. Right?

457
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,530
It's a lot of levels to it.

458
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:36,340
Or he just get fucking high and watch
this bald headed dude fucking punch half a

459
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,970
crab in the head and wants
you to explode. I enjoyed it.

460
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:42,671
Right.

461
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:46,950
Let's do a fucking advertising here

L to the motherfucking y, f. T.

492
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,030
You know about Lyft, right?

493
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,500
It's the app that gets you a ride in
minutes on demand 24 seven for less than

494
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,600
the cost of a cab. Please include all
of the falling points during your week.

495
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,330
Well, if it takes too long, I'm not. If
you tried Lyft, you know what I mean?

496
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,210
With Lyft, you got, you
just download the app,

497
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:57,120
ProQuest a driver and they show up in
three and a half minutes. On average.

498
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:59,340
That's really fast. You know,

499
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,340
unless there's a fucking guy chasing
you with an ax and that's probably takes

500
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,174
forever.

501
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,050
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

502
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,870
including criminal and DMV
background checks. You know,

503
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:14,100
you'll get around quickly and safely
other than that other one, ah,

504
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,740
that rhymes with mover Lyft drive.
Drivers are rated after every ride,

505
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,970
so the only the best stick around.

506
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,880
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude.

507
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,990
With Lyft, you can tip in the app, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

508
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,591
I mean,

509
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:32,730
nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect
five star rating from the passenger yet

510
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,420
it's just a better all around
experience. Bigger isn't always better.

511
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,480
Lyft isn't the biggest
riding ride sharing app,

512
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,950
but it's the fastest growing
and the highest rate of one.

513
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,490
I'm talking about quality
over quantity. Thanks to Lyft,

514
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,430
you got an easy way to avoid drunk
driving. You never have to bum a ride.

515
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,690
You never have to worry about parking.

516
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:52,270
A lot of people are actually getting
rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

517
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,190
get around. And you know
what? I don't blame them.

518

You don't walk like anyone else.

527

Top block anyone out or
asleep like anyone else.

528
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,280
So why is your mattress one
size fits all? I don't know,

529
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,030
cause there's an average height of a
human being because it truly customized

530
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:47,470
mattress will cost you five to 10,000
bucks. Ooh, I didn't know that until now.

531
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Go to Hellickson Helix, sleep.com.

there's a fucking robot that looks like
you walking around blowing Donald Trump

536
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,420
and eventually they get rid
of you. But in the meantime,

537
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:10,150
you're sleeping on the most comfortable
mattress you've ever slept on.

Report a 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality.

540
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,730
How do you tell how to eat? I guess
when you wake up in the morning,

541
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,990
how much better you feel and for cuffs,
customers, you know what happens is,

542
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:24,370
is when you're sleeping, right?
When you're going to do the survey,

543
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,900
that robot that they made,

544
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,720
a you comes in and fucking jerk shoe off
while you sleep and you wake up like,

545
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,290
oh my God, I'm so fucking relaxed. And
then once you give the approval rating,

546
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,910
that robot leaves. That's it. That's
how they do it. And for couples,

547
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,710
they customize each side of the mattress.

548
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,610

So it's important to know
where your food comes from.

00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,020
You'll cookie or grade your 12. Raul,

562
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,740
how are treasured hog dollar cookies
or track rockers who don't go to this?

563
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,950
We will not cover you on a pucker
money. Um, this is my experience.

564
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,290
Every time I read it, I want
to try it. I've never done it.

565
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,390
They sent me a gift card.
I'd used the gift card,

566
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,650
but I don't like going on the
Internet trying to figure out shit.

567
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,060
I put it on my wife's desk.

568
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:44,120
I'm hoping at some point she's going to
come across it and that she will get it.

569
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,090
And at some point some chemo will
show up wrapped in a blue apron.

570
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,530
That's my experience.

571
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,550
Additional points featured as
desired feature as desired. Oh,

572
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,540
do I like this? I get, I get,

573
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,800
I get to choices here for less
than $10 per person, per meal.

574
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,510

That's why they have to
call me. You have to pause.

598
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,840
That's old school advertising. You can't
say blue apron. A better way to cook.

599
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:19,570
You gotta be like Blue Apron.
A better way to cook. Okay,

600
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,190
bill on this take on this tape.

601
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,970
Did you discover the word blue
apron as as a like, like, Ooh,

602
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:27,370
I didn't know that was
there. Yeah, I can do that.

603
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,570
Can I give you three different reads?
Yeah, that would be great. Okay,

604
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,463
here we go.

605
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,360
Okay.

606
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,020
Blue Apron. A better way to cook

607
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,690
blue apron. A better way to cook

608
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,900
blue apron. A better way to cook.

609
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,810
I was at Philly. Got It. Okay.
We'll see you next week. Alright,

610
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,730
thank you. Yeah. Hang on a second. Um,

611
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,620
anyways, let me get back to, sorry,

612
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,500
I was just giving you guys a little
behind the scenes on voiceovers.

613
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,900
Did you like that? Did you feel
like you were there? All right,

614
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,780
let me wrap this up. This
weekend I'm for the first time,

615
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:12,350
I think I'm going to watch an entire
MotoGP race. I believe it's in Argentina.

616
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,760
It's somewhere down south.

617
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,570
[inaudible] I'm all shook up no
further south than that. Good coach.

618
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,870
Go a little samba action.

619
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,753
Yeah.

620
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,720
Who the fuck I'm getting texts
from right now? Oh my God,

621
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,390
I don't remember that person in
a minute. All right. Anyways,

622
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,700
MotoGP and then the Chinese
Grand Prix. Um, this is,

623
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:37,080
this is a very great weekend before
the, the NFL and NBA playoffs.

624
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,530
If you would like to watch
some alternative sports
sports that are not as big as

625
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:45,540
the big four here in the United States
of American. Who? Who's kidding,

626
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,810
who are country matters the most?

627
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,740
Therefore our sports matter the most.

628
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,603
All right.

629
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,890
People know our star
athletes around the world.

630
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,360
Nobody knows people in the
premier league. You know,

631
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,240
the only reason why we knew
that one fled Beckham guys,

632
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,150
cause they made a movie about it and
he was fucking one of the spice girls.

633
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,390
All right? If he wasn't fucking
some chicken, a girl band,

634
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,500
nobody knew who that guy was. Okay.

635
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,060
We mattered the most. All right, let's,

636
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,340
let's try to have a little
more empathy as Americans here.

637
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:22,560
Let's watch some fucking great
sports from around the world.

638
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,840
MotoGP if you want to watch a bunch of
lunatics driving about 180 miles an hour

639
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,160
right next to each other,
taking turns fucking maniacs.

640
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,220
And he also the technology and that
sports, you know, like those suits. Now,

641
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,300
I don't know how they figured it out,

642
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:39,780
but they figure out that the riders
fallen off the bike and before he hits the

643
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,450
payment pavement, ideally
like the, the, the,

644
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,830
the suit that they wear has like an
air bag that just fucking immediately

645
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,750
inflates and protects all the vitals
in theory. You know, obviously,

646
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,500
I dunno if you fucking slam into a wall.
I don't know what happens then. But,

647
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,910
um, and then the Chinese
Grand Prix, the second race,

648
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,310
the second of 20 races,
there's only 20 races.

649
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,000
It's very easy to watch this and continue
to watch all the other sports that you

650
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:10,650
love. He can tape it, you can just fucking
watch it. And uh, the Ferrari's one,

651
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:15,180
the first one was Sebastian Vettel I
believe. And uh, you know, I'm sorry.

652
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:19,070
I'm sure fucking I'm the fluxes name. Uh,

653
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,650
Lewis Hamilton is not
happy about that shit. Um,

654
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,870
and I was actually going to go to that
tt race this year and the Isle of Man and

655
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:28,680
ended up fucking falling apart.
So, um, I got to go next year.

656
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,410
I got to go next year before they
make it fucking safe. I have to go.

657
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,910
And if you've never seen that race,

658
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,090
more people have died than
years that they've had it. Um,

659
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,460
the balls these people have,

660
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,220
it's like fucking real
life mad max type shit,

661
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,910
except there's still running water and
all that stuff. Um, anyways. All right,

662
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,330
let me talk about my glutes. Give me a,

663
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,360
this is something I realized
as I'm rehabbing all these
injuries and my body is

664
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:57,750
that through years of sitting
on planes and sitting on cars,

665
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:02,010
like I fucking, I have like
no glute muscles whatsoever.

666
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,920
Like beyond the usual fucking
white guy, no ass type of shit.

667
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:08,040
It's just like my fucking thighs
do all the work. So I've been,

668
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,000
I've been doing these squats where
you kind of push from your heels.

669
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,120
And when I'm coming down and I'm trying
to have most of my weight on my squat,

670
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,960
all my squats on my heels with my
torso, like straight up and down,

671
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:22,290
not leaning forward to counterbalance
the lack of glute muscle that I have,

672
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,020
I start to come down
into a seating position.

673
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:27,720
I have to do it like over my workout
bench. Cause if I just tried to go,

674
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,360
you know, mainly depending on my glutes,

675
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,770
I will literally fall down the
like the first 30 degrees I'm okay.

676
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,280
And then I just fall

677
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,250
down to the bench. So I
gotta get that going. Um,

678
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,090
so that's what I've been doing.

679
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,160
I just went on and I looked
up the top 10 glued things,

680
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,770
don't do an alternative leg lunges.

681
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,220
I got an exercise ball up against the
wall that it put on my back and I go all

682
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:55,780
the way down to a deep squat pushing
up through my heels. Then I do the one,

683
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,390
um, where you lay on your back,

684
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,590
your feet are planted on the ground
and then you, you lift your hips up,

685
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,040
you know, with the glutes that way,
it's almost like you're, you're,

686
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,670
you're sort of thrusting up as
if you were fucking somebody,

687
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,900
you know what I mean? But way up,

688
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,740
like they were lighter than air and
you could actually possibly do that.

689
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,410
So I do those and then I do the
alternative fucking leg lunches.

690
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,860
That's what I'm doing so
far. So hopefully, I dunno,

691
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,920
I had no idea my body was so god
damn fucked up. But evidently it is.

692
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:28,810
But I am one 77.674 excited
about that and a deal with me.

693
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,960
Everybody come on, the summer's coming
up, lose a couple pounds a week with me.

694
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:34,900
Cut out the chips, the cookies.
Just fucking drink waters,

695
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,020
sign up for that blue
apron shit. You know,

696
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,770
have a robot come and deliver it to
your house. Be done eating by five,

697
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:44,350
six o'clock at night. And even
if you get home later, just,

698
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,130
I always try to go like fucking at least
12 hours without eating when I'm trying

699
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:51,070
to lose weight for like the last day.
Like if I finish eating around seven,

700
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:53,920
I'm not going to have breakfast
till like fucking nine. Um,

701
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,780
if you do have a day job,
just have like, I don't know,

702
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,680
have like a lighter breakfast
to something like that. I,

703
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:59,980
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

704
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,100
All I can tell you is what works for
me. All right. That's the podcast. Uh,

705
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,590
have a great weekend. You can check
out some of the outline. You know,

706
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:07,360
what else is on this
weekend? The fucking man.

707
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,740
I'm the one golf tournament that
I really try to watch every year.

708
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:15,730
It starts today. So just, um, you know,

709
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,290
if you don't wanna watch the last couple
of fucking games of hockey, you know,

710
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,820
I know baseball is going in that
type of stuff, but, uh, I dunno,

711
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,220
this racing stuff is pretty fucking
God. Damn cool. All right. That's it.

712
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:26,560
Go fuck yourselves. We'll see on Monday.

713
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,710
So first he is completely addicted to
skating now and he wants to get better at

714
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,360
it and I'm,

715
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,190
so we're fucking in Edmonton the next
morning we got to drive down to Calgary

716
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,980
and Forrest, he's going like this
gotta be a place here to skate.

717
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:46,970
So we find out they have, uh, they
have a skating rink at the mall.

718
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,970
And not only is it a mall, it's one of
the most giant malls in North America.

719
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:56,180
America. Yeah. West Edmonton
Mall rivaling. Uh, what's
that one in Minnesota.

720
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,180
Mall of America. Mall of
America. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So,

721
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,090
which I've been to that one
too. So we go to that one.

722
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:04,430
We're walking through there
with our fucking skates,

723
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,510
two middle aged guys walking through
this thing with fucking skates. And, uh,

724
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,890
we walk in, there's like this giant
pirate ship. I mean like, yeah,

725
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:15,290
you could sail the fucking ocean
with this fucking thing. Yeah.

726
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:18,350
It was a fuck alone special.
And I look on the other side,

727
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,890
it was really deep water and they took
all this time to make it look like there

728
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:25,400
was a ship rapping. Jesus Christ. I
mean like you could fucking, you know,

729
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,310
it was monstrous man. Like Shaq could
drown in this water if he didn't.

730
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,900
That's how fucking deep it was. Huge.

731
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,540
And then we look on the other
side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like,

732
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:33,920
is that a sea lion?

733
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,360
They had sea lions at this
thing and they're like thrown
it fish and shit. Fish.

734
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,860
And it was catching a train or was don't,

735
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,550
it wasn't like people just walking
by throwing shit from the food court.

736
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:46,200
It was a trainer throwing it. And um,

737
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,520
so we're just walking through the
mall, walking through the mall.

738
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:53,230
Endless fuck them all. They had a
water park there. Yeah, it was insane.

739
00:41:53,231 --> 00:41:56,120
I didn't look at any stores. I was too
distracted by the shit in the middle.

740
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,910
And then we finally get all
the way to the ice ice palace.

741
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,910
They called the Ice Palace and we got
all excited and were the only people with

742
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,570
skates just walking through holding a
fucking dumb skates and we get all the way

743
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:08,320
to the other side versus
all excited like, dude, I'm,

744
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm telling you I'm going to get better
at this. You wait, I was getting,

745
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,730
I was ready this summer. He's already
talking, Shit, don't call it right now.

746
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,250
I'm going to be fucking skating
backwards. You're going to be like,

747
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:20,600
what the fuck happened? [inaudible]
yeah, right. And then we show up and uh,

748
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,050
there's a big judo tournament where the
ice rink is and they'd fucking put all

749
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,870
this floor flooring all over
it. I was in denial. I'm like,

750
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,990
maybe this isn't their rank.
They might acknowledge this dude.

751
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:34,490
It says ice palace fall. This is
it. They covered it up. This is it.

752
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,550
I got upset though at the mall,
man, member number, that girl, man,

753
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,760
that really bothered me. We were walking
through the food court and you know,

754
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,900
we had a gyro. Great Gyro and yeah, yeah,

755
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,570
a great gyro at this place called
Jimmy the Greek, the one complaint.

756
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:51,290
And you agreed a little too much white
sauce and it was pasty. Yeah, it wasn't.

757
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,930
Yeah, it was a little pasty. You should
have got one scoop. You went to one,

758
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,460
one scoop lesson, a little hot sauce
and it would have been fuck it.

759
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,790
He got excited. It would have been
epic. Yeah. Well you got excited.

760
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,750
So then I said to bill, you know, I like
a little dessert after I eat. You know,

761
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:05,340
I like a little candy bar. I like a
little, you know, so I love sugar in tank.

762
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,700
Yeah. So, so I go bill man, it was
it frozen yogurt place. I go, yeah,

763
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,010
pink barriers. I'm just going to go
with frozen yogurt. See? All right,

764
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,750
so we're walking light the picture,

765
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:20,760
so to middle aged men with skates and
I'm like, you keep saying I'm middle age.

766
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:21,580
Do you want a middle age?

767
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580
I'm 30 I just turned 35 35 times
two 70 most guys fucking drop.

768
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,000
Well I call, I call like I call
middle it. Yeah. All right. What,

769
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,670
what would you call it? No, I got, I
guess you're right. I guess, you know,

770
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,900
I always just, when I thought of it
as a kid, I always felt, you know,

771
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,720
it was no, I don't know. I just
remember, dude, I, it's, I dunno,

772
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,460
we'll just say 40 forties but I,
you know, bought e's for to people.

773
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:47,680
Do people live long, man, dude,

774
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,820
I'm fucking be 46 46 times two
is 92 you're going to really,

775
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,840
I can't really sit there
and say, I'm middle age.

776
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,900
Tell you the way I'm eating
and smoking. Yeah, no,

777
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,440
no. So, so we walked through
and we were like, where is that?

778
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:05,320
Where was that frozen yogurt place?
Let's go to that frozen yogurt place.

779
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,360
So we too, we see two young
women walk by and we figure, Hey,

780
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,940
I looked at him and I'm like,
these, these, these ladies,

781
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,100
they're going to know where they're
going to know where a pink berry is.

782
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,020
So we walk up and you go first. You say
to the friend, you go, hey, you got,

783
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,270
you guys know her. Oh that good. That
good looking too, by the way. Yeah.

784
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,130
I've got good looking girls and
you go up first, you go, hey,

785
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:27,500
you guys know where the frozen yogurt
places and like she did like a double take

786
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,070
. Like she did a double take, so fucking
rude, right? And she was like, what?

787
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,980
And then I looked at the other one
and I go, yeah, like a pink berry.

788
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:38,610
And she kind of just like gives a shake
off. Like how would I know? Like why?

789
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,150
And she fucking did. This is what she
did. She did the classic pretty girl,

790
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,870
you're clearly just asking me this
because you want to talk to me thing.

791
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,890
And I'm like, no bitch, I want some
fucking yogurt. Okay, I want fucking,

792
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:53,850
I want fucking treat. You know, I just
had lunch and it really bothered me,

793
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:55,830
dude. And we were walking
around and I wanted to find her.

794
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,020
I wanted to find past this again.
They did the loop on the fight.

795
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,520
I didn't know that, but I said to
bill when we got to the car, I go,

796
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:03,060
I wanted to find it. Cause I
would've just went up there and go,

797
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:05,760
you know something. I found it. And
you're a mean jerk and then you go,

798
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,310
why would you do that? You're
a mean jerk. That's terrible.

799
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,510
What am I gonna call her a cunt?

800
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,810
Well, don't call her anything if you're
going to go with me and jerk. I mean,

801
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,460
you know, I hate that you're, you're
on that pretty good state. Your main,

802
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,390
but you're a jerk if you want to stay
clean. But if you go, you're a mean jerk.

803
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,660
No, you're not. You're not. You're not
pretty inside. You're not pretty. Inside.

804
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:28,090
Doesn't give a fuck. She's
still hot girl at the mall.

805
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,040
Paul put yourself in her fucking pumps.

806
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,013
All right?

807
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,940
With two fucking jackets standing there
with ice skates when there's a judo

808
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:38,080
tournament down the way,

809
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,680
asking if they know where the
fuck the ice cream store is.

810
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,540
They looked at us the way they were
supposed to. I, you know what, dude?

811
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,620
I like a sweetheart. I don't
care how you [inaudible]

812
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,830
love to hear them tell the story and they
come and then there's just creepy guy

813
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:57,480
comes up like that's the way
they're going to hear it. Paul.

814
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,630
Paul. Do you ever watch those
fucking prison shows? Which ones?

815
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:01,950
Like the scared straight? No,

816
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:05,280
not those ones where they talk about the
worst prisons in the country and that

817
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:07,160
type of shit. Oh yeah.
I seen a couple of them.

818
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,060
And you just sit there watching it going,

819
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:13,560
how the fuck would I go in there and
not get raped? What would my game plan?

820
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,810
He gets scared watching
it in your bedroom, right?

821
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,440
Women have to walk out of
the house worried about that.

822
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,100
That somebody is gonna
do. Just imagine if our,

823
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,690
I did. I had a winter hat on with a puffy
ball on top of it. Holding Ice Skates,

824
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,620
asking for yogurt. If anything, she
probably thought I was fucking gay.

825
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,700
[inaudible] you don't
look gay, Paul. I know,

826
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:38,330
but you're not asking that question
that your beards to terrorists.

827
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,880
You need to get a little more
metro-sexual. I going to do that. We was,

828
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,070
we had sweatpants on though. We were
a mess. Everybody in the fucking girl.

829
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,720
Yeah, that's what you love my beard.

830
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:51,800
My beard actually fucking says everybody
on the fucking ground. No, but dude,

831
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:56,630
I don't like the pretty girl who can't
be approached with a question because Oh,

832
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,120
this guy's hitting on me. It's, it's
awful. And he knows something that got,

833
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,290
especially the blonde one who went
like shook her head like what?

834
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,370
She's going to be a nightmare. She's a
fucking nightmare for some future guy.

835
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:10,580
I'm telling you, she's a nightmare.
She's already selfish. It's over.

836
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,370
What if she just knows what
she wants and we're not at

837
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,620
fault. Well

838
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,550
this is the thing dude,

839
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,760
you actually aloud like how old do you
think they were would probably 2122 yeah.

840
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,220
You let at 2122 year old.

841
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,060
I met girl at my age, not even a one way.

842
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,240
She shook it all that and let it ruin
like the two we're driving down to

843
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:35,520
Calgary. Yeah, she ruins,

844
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,740
we got the rocky mountains on the right
hand side of the car and you're just

845
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,810
still calling. You're calling
her a cunt the whole way down

846
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,730
and father the shit out of me. It was
like, why are you, why would you ask me?

847
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:50,230
How would I know? Dude. You realize how
funny that is that they did that to us?

848
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,800
Like what? Like yeah, they
really made us feel like shit.

849
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:55,450
That's fucking hilarious.
If you look at it,

850
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:58,660
it bothered and the whole time it's
cause you wanted to get frozen yogurt.

851
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,010
That how funny would it be if
we chased him down and I went,

852
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,240
you got frozen yogurt with
sugar-free gummy bears on it.

853
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,940
It was still all natural,
no organic gummy bears.

854
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:09,460
How great would it be if we chased him
down and I just walked up to her and I

855
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,220
go, you know something,
you hurt my feelings.

856
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,900
It just fucking broke down.
You know, you hurt my feelings.

857
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,800
It just want a yogurt. By the
way, from people listening here,

858
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:24,070
this is last week, you know,
you know, just trying to kill,

859
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,670
just trying to make jokes to not go out
of your mind being on tour this fucking

860
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,430
long. Yeah. As we were doing the danger
fields, everything. Oh, I'll tell you,

861
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:32,110
I've got a friend of mine
loves yogurt, you know,

862
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:36,850
so we were doing that and once
that went away, that got old.

863
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,460
Somewhere along the line.
You started doing it,

864
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,690
you started saying really sentimental
shit to me and then pretending like you

865
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,140
were crying and then that just became
like the running joke and then you started

866
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,320
laughing and then you were just
like, you got to do that onstage.

867
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,170
Do that cry and think. So now we'll
just go up and like if we'll be like,

868
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:56,560
hey man, I'm tired, but too,
you know what? Hang on, hang on.

869
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:57,790
What you on the road has been great.

870
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,940
You're the only one I
could have done it with

871
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,410
and then bill would come and
tag it. That's the best thing.

872
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:07,510
Bill would come and tag hour to do it. Oh,

873
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,220
I was hoping you were going to
say that, but go to, it's been,

874
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,230
it's been fucking wonderful for my anger.

875
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,740
I'm going to try to do that when I get
home. Just pretend like I'm crying, man.

876
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,020
It's fucking hilarious. So two stories.

877
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:23,710
We go in to eat and we have this
Filipino waiter, right? By the way,

878
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,710
I like to play the Games where I sorta
hell, where are we? Was that Edmonton?

879
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,350
Was that Calgary? That was
Edmonton. Yeah. Was Edmondson.

880
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,590
So I like to do this thing where
sometimes I like to fuck with people,

881
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:34,210
so I'll just get on a phone
and I'll be like, Bill,

882
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:37,810
go along with it and we'll be in
an elevator and I'll go, what? No,

883
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,180
that's horse shit. And like bill just
be like, what happened? So like I said,

884
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:43,300
like he had a parole officer called
and he said, and bill goes, oh,

885
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,910
they worked it up. And
then instantly Burgos yeah,

886
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:47,470
but what about that
video tape? I go, no, no.

887
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:49,450
They said it's in submissive and like,

888
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,400
and like the guy there was
just a stranger there. Right.

889
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,760
Sometimes I break out
laughing, so bill calls it,

890
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:58,510
he gets a little emotional guy. So we
turn this crying thing, we do it to like,

891
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:03,100
this is big. Great, right? We turn it,
we turn that into doing it in public.

892
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,700
So we have this Filipino waiter,
right. And the whole guy guy was great.

893
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:10,720
He was talking to us and at the end
I just go, he goes, here's your bill.

894
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,110
And I go, I just want to say so.
And I kept a dead straight face.

895
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,640
Like you've been a great waiter, man.

896
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,640
And I put my hand on his fucking
arm and I got you. You know what?

897
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,530
You're bringing the waters and bill just
looks at and goes. He gets a little,

898
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,720
he gets a little emotional, you
know what I mean? I know, but it's,

899
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:28,430
it means a lot. Guy Didn't
know what that I had no,

900
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,940
cause he was so fucking polite. Eddie
was actually from the Philippines,

901
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,840
so he's [inaudible] jumped
right in perfectly to my friend.

902
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:39,600
He gets a little emotional, but not
Billy. He'd been the waters dude who,

903
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,140
he was freaked out though. Oh,
that's the new game on the road.

904
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:45,020
You had the best one. I got to say, the
best one was at the airport yesterday.

905
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,950
We got to the airport yesterday and
bill starts busting my balls about my

906
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:53,000
laundry and he goes, Versie fucking
16 days and you're carrying, you know,

907
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:56,720
dirty socks and underwear. And I
go, dude, I go, I bought new ones.

908
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,270
You know the dirty ones
are tied up tight in a,

909
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:04,070
in a plastic bag and bill just goes,
just secure emotions. And Dude,

910
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:05,930
I fucking could not walk.

911
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:11,350
I couldn't walk and I had to stop pulling
my fucking the bag I'd checked cause

912
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,840
we were laughing so hard. [inaudible]
work Stowe, it makes, it makes,

913
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,020
it's fucking great. It's driving
a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah.

914
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:21,110
That's the ones that we will because
women don't want to see a guy getting

915
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,710
emotional like that. It's just, well no,
because once somebody cries it's over.

916
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,400
You know,

917
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,370
like when I go out afterwards and I'm
taking pictures with people and stuff,

918
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:30,380
I always come back. I was just
saying, I got to tell you, you know,

919
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,410
I've seen a lot of people do that,
you know, doing the picture thing,

920
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:34,610
but you gotta be one of the best

921
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,210
wives. She's going, would
you stop fucking doing that?

922
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,150
Our lives are going to go nuts cause
you know, the first thing I want,

923
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:47,900
I see stays and you see your wife. We're
just going to go. It's been so long.

924
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,630
I miss you so much. No, you got it.
You got to set it up with talking,

925
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:53,030
like you said, to start off
normal, what you're going to say.

926
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:56,780
Something really sentimental to them. So
they're almost crying and then you cry,

927
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,660
which ruins their crime. And I swear to
God, you get slugged in the shoulder,

928
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,110
which is all you really want. Oh Shit.
20 minutes in. I'll tell you Paul,

929
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:06,620
you know, time really flies with
you on the pool. It's been so fun.

930
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,110
This is probably only funny to
us, but I don't give a shit.

931
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,220
Try it with your friends. Oh fuck that.
If people gain, if the game is called,

932
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,710
he gets emotional and
just walk into a bar.

933
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,060
Just have one of your friends
started hitting on a woman and then,

934
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,040
and then the other friend's
got to go along. Yeah.

935
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,840
And then just starts welling up and
then the other guy goes, I'm sorry.

936
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:29,510
He just gets emotional and you just got
to let the other person deal with it.

937
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:30,380
Dude,

938
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,550
you'll want at the fucking airport where
you walked up to that lady at the car,

939
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,700
the little fucking I sell gum, whatever
the hell it is. And she said, excuse me,

940
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,940
do you have the, I have the, what are
the biggest night I broke out here I go,

941
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:41,800
hey man, how you doing?

942
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:44,480
What are the biggest condoms you got
and what's the biggest size condoms you

943
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:44,630
have?

944
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:47,060
I turned around and walked the one you
turned around and walked away and I'm

945
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:50,630
just staring at her and I'm biting my
tongue as hard as I can to not laugh.

946
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,090
And then I just burst out
laughing and she said, what?

947
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:56,990
And then when you went to repeat it,
you try to point to it and I lost it.

948
00:52:56,991 --> 00:53:00,890
You lost it and had to walk away.
Paula punchdrunk out here. You don't,

949
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:05,090
one of my favorite things in this business
was opie from the opion Anthony show

950
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,930
was he had this thing that he would do
when guys would start crying when they

951
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:12,620
would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. It
was fun. And his timing was perfect.

952
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,650
Every time someone would be
talking like retiring from a sport,

953
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,350
like when Mike Schmidt
retired, which is, you know,

954
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,760
it's very difficult to watch.
He was like, you know, you know,

955
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,320
he just was ending as like 38 years ago,

956
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,890
a little boy began a journey to play the
wonderful game of baseball and that the

957
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,010
oop would always go, oh boy.

958
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:36,330
Yeah,

959
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:40,840
what am I favorite? And it always,
oh boy, it always meant right.

960
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,630
Nobody wants to see a man just completely,

961
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,070
you know what it is. I can watch a guy
cry if something terrible is happening.

962
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:54,150
Just don't try to talk while you're
crying. No. That's the thing.

963
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,110
The talking and then bursting out into
cross. Let your shoulders go. Yeah,

964
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,540
let me shut fucking crying, but
don't foe for the love of God a man.

965
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,000
You got to try and manage the cry in
private. Yeah, you do that in the shower.

966
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,940
You do it in the shower. Like when
my son was born, everyone's like,

967
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,860
did you cry yet? And I'm like,
no, what are you talking about?

968
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,060
And then when my son was born,

969
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,630
it all hit me later and I went home to
go get stuff from my wife in the hospital

970
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,240
and I sat on the couch and I
didn't like weep. But I just,

971
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,023
okay,

972
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,030
I didn't weep, but I got emotional.

973
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:26,160
But love just fixing you sitting on the
couch by yourself and just used to go.

974
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,393
That's stupid.

975
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,800
It's just completely unexpected to
use your thing from your podcast. Oh,

976
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,400
that's unexplored. Z effect.

977
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,490
Unacceptable dude on a
completely [inaudible] right.
Don't talk into it. Right.

978
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,780
Yeah. The talk into it. That's, that's
what the funny thing about crying is,

979
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,880
you know? Yeah. You know,
you always do this to me.

980
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,360
You know you always do this to me and
I'm trying my best and it's over. Yeah,

981
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:57,350
it's fucking over. Whenever my friends
die, I've had so many of fucker died.

982
00:54:57,351 --> 00:55:01,250
I just cry in the shower. Yes. Right
though I asked the girl, we asked a girl.

983
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:01,700
Right,

984
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,590
because you don't feel like you're crying
cause there's all that water on your

985
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,424
face anyways.

986
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,283
Okay.

987
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,050
No, we asked the girl, we go, what would
you do if your dude started crying?

988
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,270
Like if it wasn't, if nobody died,
if a dude and you were just arguing,

989
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,170
you just had a bad day and he just had
a bad day and you got into and he broke

990
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:19,080
down and cry and she goes,
yeah, no, over, over, over,

991
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,650
get the fuck away from me. Yeah. You
know what's funny? There's some women,

992
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:25,140
they think that they want to see
that part of you. They don't.

993
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,070
What that is to them is that's
their total conquest. Yeah.

994
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,790
You know when you bang a girl in the ass,
you just like, yeah, I got this shit.

995
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:37,590
I'm fucking with you. Their
version was that Jesus built,

996
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,730
no, fuck we do. Their version of that is,

997
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:46,080
is if they can get you to be so vulnerable
around them that you cry and then

998
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,870
it's one of those things. It's always
like when the crowd screams out of joke,

999
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:49,441
they already heard,

1000
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:52,190
they think they want to hear it again
and then you tell it's like, Huh. Yeah.

1001
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,710
It wasn't as good. No. It's the same
thing as that. Yeah. You said something,

1002
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:58,260
you said something about
like if a burglar comes in,

1003
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,870
if you cry in front of a
woman, all in her mind is like,

1004
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:03,630
what if the Burger comes in at this
fucking guy? Yeah, no, it's over.

1005
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,800
You can't cry. You Strip a
woman a security if you cry
in front of her. I think,

1006
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,380
I don't think I've cried. I think
my wife's on that. That's a great,

1007
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:13,270
that's what it is. Yeah. You Strip her
of her security cause she's like, oh,

1008
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:15,670
I got this fucking,
yeah, this funny crisis.

1009
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,350
This baby sleeping next to you every
night, you know? Yeah. It's, it's over.

1010
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,270
You know what I mean? I know you just,

1011
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,040
you might as well just have
a pullover sweater, you know,

1012
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,360
walking around and then she mocks
you. What are you going to cry, bitch?

1013
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,450
Yeah, you saw me?

1014
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,120
Yeah, it's fucking over,
dude. You can't have that.

1015
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,750
Have you ever cried alone listening
to a song or like, not cried,

1016
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,070
but have you ever been like, oh no,

1017
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,850
I've completely broken down and I've
told her three cars just weeping

1018
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:49,390
uncontrollably. Have I? Yeah,

1019
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,530
totally cry. No, no, I definitely
teared up. Listen, as an, as an artist,

1020
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,950
at some point you're going to have
to go to those emotions. You need to,

1021
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:03,490
you need to be, you need to meet
too with your instrument. I have, I,

1022
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,270
what was the once like I had
this weird thing where, um,

1023
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,670
I stopped crying at some point.

1024
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:14,290
I don't know when I stopped crying
and got mad more when I got hurt in my

1025
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,150
brother, beat the shit out of me. Um,

1026
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,650
you know that most of the crying I be
just like at the end of it. But I wasn't,

1027
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:25,090
but I wasn't crying and then I didn't cry

1028
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,330
ever. One time my brother
is bigger than me.

1029
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:35,440
My little brother was bigger than me.
Right. Big Dog like, and I remember he,

1030
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,370
I said, I said, if you fucking take my
clothes again, if you take my clothes,

1031
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,830
like he did it every day he would go
into my room, he would take my belt,

1032
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,530
he would take my clothes and I'd come
home and I guess in a boy band and I need

1033
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:48,310
to go, I need to go out. Right.
And I go, mom, if he does it again,

1034
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm fucking hitting him. Her and
my mom be like, oh, you know,

1035
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,450
and one time I need really needed a shirt
and I'm fucking throwing shit through

1036
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:56,200
the house.

1037
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,890
And he gets out of his friend's car and
he starts walking up and he's got it on

1038
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,830
and I fucking snapped.

1039
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,170
And my grandmother was there and I jumped
on him and I started punching him and

1040
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,550
he stood up. He just goes,

1041
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,190
what you made your older brother
crying on? My younger brother. Oh,

1042
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,120
he's bigger than me. But
he didn't know what to do.

1043
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,640
He got so upset that he just got,
and he looked around and he just,

1044
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,850
he was so angry that something
needed to come out. And he just goes,

1045
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,850
what did you feel bad?
And you start laughing.

1046
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,790
I kind of just walked away and you
know, we laughed about it afterwards,

1047
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,670
but to now, now he's a, he's a
fuck. He's a big kid. But you know,

1048
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:36,760
my mom had the opposite. I got a little
brother, man, he's an animal, you know?

1049
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,470
Nope. My mom says she went to,

1050
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,130
she went to a funeral once and everybody
was there and everybody was crying and

1051
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:45,840
she was overwhelmed with emotion that
they had to fucking drag her out.

1052
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,690
She said she had them all.

1053
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,850
One of the most embarrassing things
happened to her where she said she

1054
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:52,450
uncontrollably laughed because they
said that that can happen sometimes.

1055
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:53,320
So she's sitting there,

1056
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,660
she's sitting there and everybody's
crying and like she went up and she could

1057
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:02,920
not stop laughing and like she and I
said, why? Like? And she was like, Paul,

1058
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,240
I just don't know. She goes,

1059
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,660
I could not stop laughing and
I had to walk me out and like,

1060
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,140
and she just is your mom? Yes.

1061
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,940
She said because the emotions
or soundbites that they
said that that can happen

1062
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,150
sometimes where it just, you just
like, she didn't know what to do.

1063
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,510
So instead of just breaking down, she
went the other way and just couldn't,

1064
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:24,200
couldn't control herself. Like humans
will protect you and a really like,

1065
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,900
that's what they don't get sometimes
when comics make fucking horrific jokes

1066
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,560
about some bad event. Make good jokes.
Yeah. It's about a horrific event.

1067
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:34,010
So they go that so fucking me, it's
a defense mechanism. It's my mom.

1068
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,160
My mom is a sweetheart who felt bad and
her emotions just went the other way.

1069
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,710
And she goes, Paul, I felt so
bad. I couldn't control myself.

1070
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,130
I couldn't control myself. I hate to
say this cause somebody lost somebody.

1071
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:48,100
But there was, if there was video
of that, oh my God. Oh I'm so,

1072
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,150
I was saying, so I stumbled
around, I don't know,

1073
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,830
10 or 11 I didn't cry for years.
Years and years and years.

1074
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:57,890
And I didn't, I didn't cry until
a friend of mine killed himself.

1075
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,730
And even then I was sad and
it's just, Oh, I went, ah,

1076
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,850
I was in the bathroom once
again. Yeah. And it was in there.

1077
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,000
And I remember I started to cry and
then I started thinking like, wow,

1078
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,410
I'm crying. I haven't
cried in a long time.

1079
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:13,400
And then I stopped cause I got out of it
cause I stopped thinking about the dude

1080
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,720
kill himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10
years without a cry and then I had one,

1081
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:23,090
what was it over yogurt. Gummy bears?

1082
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,310
No. Uh, I think yeah,
might have been almost,

1083
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,390
it might've been one of
my son was born, you know,

1084
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,020
it might've been my second one. That's
acceptable. I guess it's acceptable.

1085
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,750
I got it other than when I went down
the pool, cause I go down to the pool,

1086
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,680
I'm down there to me it's fucking Jay law
head who's been killing it in front of

1087
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:46,570
me and a the lovely Nia and her cousins
and we're hang all right cousin.

1088
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:49,540
I mean we're hanging out down the
pool and they're doing the usual shit.

1089
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,990
You know, if you're a redhead
and you go down to the pool,

1090
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,610
like you just asked for it.
People that all, you know,

1091
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,420
look how white you are. You
know? Like I never noticed.

1092
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:03,430
It's like I'm fucking around myself.

1093
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,890
I've been around myself since the sixties
the late sixties I know how white I am

1094
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:12,880
and if I ever forget how white I am,
there's always somebody that remind me.

1095
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:19,340
Sorry, I don't know if you've noticed
your skin tone. What am I meditating?

1096
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:23,650
Floating up on my body. All right,
so these people up with go, come on.

1097
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,000
Come on in the pool and like,
I don't want to go in the pool.

1098
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,660
I don't want to go in the fucking
pool. You know? They're like, why? No,

1099
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:32,620
why don't you want to go in the
pool? You know, why? Cause a fucking,

1100
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:33,683
okay,

1101
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:39,060
look, look at these people. Look at
them, look at them. And you're gay.

1102
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:42,260
You're getting your, you know,
would you take a bath with aught,

1103
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,420
with any one of the
people that you see here?

1104
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,890
These fucking just messes of human beings.

1105
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,510
There's not enough chlorine in a fucking
pool to kill whatever the fuck they're

1106
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:56,120
dragging in the pool, you know? And
so I finally end up going to the pool.

1107
01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:00,190
Then everybody made fun of how white
my fucking alabaster chest was at.

1108
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:05,330
Then I had to stay in the shade of
the fucking, uh, the lifeguards chair,

1109
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,420
you know, you know,

1110
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:14,420
I had a show to do, I'm being a
professional, I can't come up stage later,

1111
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,250
half in the bag, looking
like, oh, lobster, right?

1112
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:23,860
I got to do my little song and dance
later on that night. So anyway,

1113
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:27,030
so I ended up getting in the fucking
pool against my, what I wanted to do,

1114
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,410
you know, and then I get out of the pool.

1115
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:35,780
First of all, for my age, I
am in absolutely phenomenal.

1116
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:39,230
Top shelf shape. Alright.

1117
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,420
I gotta tell you the, the
fucking, just the touch stuff.

1118
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:49,421
Fuck the humanity that I
saw poolside in Las Vegas,

1119
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,430
the fucking humanity

1120
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:55,990
keyword manatee.

1121
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,470
Yeah.

1122
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:03,960
Not The skip step on a Jim Gaffigan.

1123
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,710
I just realized he used to use that
reference and I'm pretty sure he used it.

1124
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,590
I can't remember how the fuck he used it,

1125
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:15,000
but if he used it to
describe a fat Pale Torso,

1126
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,340
not really pale, but whatever,
whatever the fucking shit.

1127
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:19,770
I saw the side of that.
He was dead on that.

1128
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,020
Oh my God.

1129
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,990
Is there anything worse than seeing
a tattoo come of age? You know,

1130
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,850
Jesus Christ, if you get
a tattoo, you better.

1131
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,110
You better just make the mental decision
that you're going to P90x for the rest

1132
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:39,210
of your fucking life because
when you don't do it,

1133
01:03:39,211 --> 01:03:42,270
I saw this guy down at
the pool. All right.

1134
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,790
He had like not only the worst
tattoos you've ever seen in your life,

1135
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,510
like the worst placement,
you know what I mean?

1136
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,870
Like you get one like or the side of
your arm up by your shoulder that looks

1137
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:59,720
good, right on the bicep. That
looks good. You know, CIOs,

1138
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,010
somebody got gets one
right over their voice box.

1139
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,190
Like I don't give a fuck what
you have surrounding that.

1140
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:08,820
That leads into that part of
the, of of the work or the piece,

1141
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:13,800
whatever they call it. It looks fucking
horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific,

1142
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,280
horrific. So this fucking jerk off.

1143
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,810
He has basically the exact sort of
like tribal thing that the rock has,

1144
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,360
except he doesn't look tribal. He
looks like an accountant, you know,

1145
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,510
and he doesn't work out.

1146
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,800
So just imagine if the
rock was his pasty as I was

1147
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,120
and it never worked down in his life,

1148
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:42,630
but it has that saved tattoo that
starts at the elbow, goes up the arm,

1149
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:45,360
over the shoulder and
covers one whole peck.

1150
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,280
But the way this guy had it done was
it didn't cover his whole packet,

1151
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:53,910
came swinging in and went right
above his, his man nipple.

1152
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,210
So now all of the, all of
that is like colored in.

1153
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:01,560
So because of the pasting
that's of his torso,

1154
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,800
your eye is just drawn
to his right nipple.

1155
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,620
Is he standing in the fucking pool?

1156
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,760
My neck was sore from shaking
my head at people. It was,

1157
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,730
it was absolutely fucking
horrific. Right? So anyways,

1158
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:24,970
um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back
up to the hotel room. Right? You know,

1159
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,890
you gotta make sure that I'm all shipshape
from my goddamn show and I put on the

1160
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:33,430
news and what are they ended
up doing a story about,

1161
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:38,260
they start doing a story
about the amount of, uh,

1162
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,670
fecal matter found in public pools

1163
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:48,780
right after I just got out of
a goddamned pool. You know,

1164
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:51,960
and I know what people always think,
oh, stay away from where the kids are.

1165
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,470
Stay away from the Kitty Pool
Rights. Stay away from that.

1166
01:05:55,471 --> 01:05:57,720
They always blame the fucking
kids. Will I, you know,

1167
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:01,470
something that after seeing
what I saw poolside, you know,

1168
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,440
there weren't a lot of kids
in there, but I guarantee you

1169
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,640
somebody got a cola. I know this
is fucking disgusting, but people,

1170
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,160
you're basically bathing, you
don't see even more fucked up is,

1171
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:17,280
is Vegas is just like, you know,
people fly in from all over the world.

1172
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,090
You're taking a fucking
aids bath, you know,

1173
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:24,450
with a shot of fucking a, what the
hell was that shit that came out,

1174
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:26,820
but it killed people so fast
that it just burned out.

1175
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,470
Everybody just ran into the woods.
The fuck was that shit called

1176
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,330
Ah, Christ. I can't remember a bola.

1177
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,520
That's it with a shot
of a bola or whatever.

1178
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:44,640
Food poisoning. I don't know what
it is. A salmon, Ella shower,

1179
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,850
whatever the fuck you want to call
it. I'm done with public pools.

1180
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:51,090
The only pool that I will ever
swimming again is my pool.

1181
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:55,290
If I ever get one or the pool of some
hot chip that I want to fucking bang,

1182
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,470
cause I have Nias permission. That's
the only way it's going to go down.

1183
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,220
Other than that, you know, I'll
just go. I'll just go take a bath.

1184
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,480
That way I'm out of the sun, you know,
I'll take a couple of vitamin E pills,

1185
01:07:11,481 --> 01:07:14,960
whatever the fuck it is you get from
the sun. Other than skin cancer,

1186
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,273
I'm done with it.

1187
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,480
You know what America needs to implement
after years and years of calling the

1188
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,040
French people smelly. You know?

1189
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,970
That's Kinda like the thing when we went
over to France and save their ass for

1190
01:07:28,971 --> 01:07:32,990
the second time last century. Oh wait,
did we do it once? We did it one time,

1191
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,710
right? I can't fucking
remember. So anyways,

1192
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,350
we've always made fun of the
French fathers. They smell.

1193
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:43,370
If you've ever watched a bugs bunny
growing up, man, you saw pepe Le Pew.

1194
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,040
If you noticed he had a
French accent, you know,

1195
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,040
that's the kind of shit you couldn't
get away with today because of political

1196
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:52,700
correctness. I guess they were basically
saying that you know that they stunk.

1197
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:58,030
But I'll tell you one thing that the
French have when it comes to hygiene over

1198
01:07:58,761 --> 01:08:03,620
Americans. All right? Is
the big day. All right?

1199
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,100
I can guarantee you, if I ever go
swimming in a public pool again,

1200
01:08:07,101 --> 01:08:08,060
it's going to be at France.

1201
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,980
Unless there's a bunch of Americans
or I know I've been over to England.

1202
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,540
I never saw the day over there, you know?

1203
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,510
But they is basically a carwash
for your asshole. And, uh,

1204
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,720
you know, it leaves you feeling refreshed,

1205
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,560
puts a fucking smile on your
face. And evidently in France,

1206
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,050
she's so fucking happy. You
forget to put on deodorant,

1207
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,990
but I'll tell you right now, you can jump
in that pool. I bet they're not dead,

1208
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,720
but they're not talking about
that shit over there right.
