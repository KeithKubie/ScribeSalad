00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.460
The ancient Greeks were emphatic that philosophy was not just

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.560
an elaborate abstract exercise.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.680
It was, they felt, a deeply useful skill

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040
that should be learned and practiced by all,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.280
in order to help us to live and die well.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.980
No one believed this more than Plato.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.460
Who was passionate in his defense of philosophy

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580
as a kind of therapy for the soul.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.060
One of the most forceful stories he told on behalf of the utility of philosophy

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.600
Was what has become known as "The Allegory of the Cave".

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.760
It is perhaps the most famous allegory in philosophy.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.520
This was a story that was intended, as he wrote,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.260
to compare "[t]he effect of education and the lack of it on our nature."

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.960
At the start of Book 7 of his masterpiece, "The Republic",

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.780
Plato tells us about some people living imprisoned in a cave

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.460
They've always lived there and don't know anything of the outside world.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.440
There is no natural light in this cave, the walls are damp and dark

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.120
All the inhabitants can see comes from the shadows of things thrown up on the wall by a light of a fire

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.380
The cave dwellers get fascinated by these reflections of animals, plants and people

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
Moreover, they assume that these shadows are real and that if you pay a lot of attention to them

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.860
you'll understand and succeed in life

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.160
And they don't, of course, realize that they are looking at mere phantoms

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.020
They chat about shadowy things enthusiastically

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.240
and take great pride in their sophistication and wisdom

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.960
Then one day, quite by chance, someone discovers a way out of the cave

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.580
out into the open air

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.840
At first, it's simply overwhelming. He is dazzled by the brilliant sunshine

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.940
In which everything is, for the first time, properly illuminated

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.880
Gradually his eyes adjust and he encounters the true forms

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.300
of all those things which he had formerly know only as shadows

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.300
He sees actual flowers, the colors of birds, the nuances in the bark of trees

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.060
He observes stars and grasps the vastness and sublime nature of the universe

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.840
As Plato puts it in solemn terms:

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.100
Out of compassion, this newly enlightened man

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.700
decides to leave the sunlit upper world and makes his way back into the cave

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.500
to try to help out his companions who are still mired in confusion and error

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.940
Because he's become used to the bright upper world, he can hardly see anything underground

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
He stumbles along the damp wet corridors and gets confused

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.760
He seems to the others totally unimpressive

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.760
When he in turn is unimpressed by them and insists on explaining what the sun is

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160
or what a real tree is like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.460
The cave dwellers get sarcastic, then very angry and eventually plot to kill him

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.800
The story of the cave is an allegory of the life of all enlightened people

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.400
The cave dwellers are humans before philosophy

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.520
The sun is the light of reason

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.160
The alienation of the returned philosopher is what all truth tellers can expect

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.280
when they take their knowledge back to people who have not devoted themselves to thinking

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.720
For Plato, we are all for much of our lives in shadow

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.700
Many of the things we get excited about, like fame, the perfect partner, a high status job

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.700
are infinetly less real than we suppose

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.540
they are for the most part phantoms projected by our culture onto the walls of our fragile and flawed minds

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.880
but because everyone around us is insisting that they are genuine

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.280
we are taken in from a young age

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.020
It's not our fault individually

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.280
No one chooses to be in the cave

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.240
That's just where we happen to begin

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.040
We're all starting from a very difficult place

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.540
If, like the man in Plato's story, you bluntly tell people they're wrong

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.620
You get nowhere, you cause deep offense and may endanger your own life

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.500
Athens had, after all, recently put Socrates, Plato's friend, to death

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.880
Plato knew from close experience just what the cave dwellers might do to those who claim to know the sun

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.700
The solution, Plato says, is a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.480
By which he understood the method of inquiry pioneered by Socrates and known to us as the "Socratic Method"

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.480
It's a very gentle process. You don't lecture or harang or force someone to read a particular book

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.340
You just start with a general declaration of intellectual modesty no one knows very much

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.680
It's always good to insist: "wisdom starts with owning up to ignorance"

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.300
Confess that you don't know exactly what the government should do, what wars meant to achieve or how good relationships work

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.260
You then get the other person to say what they think and gradually together you investigate the answers

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.100
Most likely the other person will be confident or rather painfully overconfident

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.200
They may tell you it's all quite simple really and everyone knows the answer already

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.560
You must be supremely patient with this kind of bravado

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.600
If they go off topic, you must cheerfully double back

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.880
You must take a lot of time and be ready to have chats over many days

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.660
This method of talking is founded on a lovely confidence that with the right encouragement

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.300
people can eventually work out things for themselves and detect errors in their own reasoning

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.180
If you carefully and quietly draw their attention to tricky points

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.820
and don't cast blame or ever get annoyed

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.540
You'll never teach anyone anything by making them feel stupid

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.620
Even if they are,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.460
at first

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.140
We have all started in that cave

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.280
but it is Plato's deepest insight that we don't have to stay there

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.720
And the road out is called, quite simply, philosophy

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.460
This is the sun whose light we can follow and by whose rays

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.340
the proper nature of things can become clear

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.580
