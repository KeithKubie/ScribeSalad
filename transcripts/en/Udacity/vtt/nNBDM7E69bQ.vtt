Passport is the main account
management system for Georgia Tech.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.730
To access Passport,
we go to passport.gatech.edu.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.260
It can also be accessed
through Buzzport.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.540
Once there, log in.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.470
Once you're in,
you'll see the Passport home screen.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.890
There are a number of
things you can do here.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.790
You can change your Georgia Tech
password, set up password hints, and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.820
set up your e-mail alias.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.220
You can modify your directory entry and
nicknames.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.110
And provide emergency
contact information.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.620
&gt;&gt; Note that your Georgia Tech password
automatically expires every four months.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.510
So you'll definitely need to
come back here occasionally.
