00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.650
SPEAKER 1: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.530
Welcome.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.120
So we are very happy
to have Mathew here,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.710
along with his mother
Jane, and his former

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.970
adversary-turned-friend, Sam,
for this really special talk

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.050
on an important topic.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.010
So, today, you will hear
Mathew's story about coming out

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.290
at 16, his five-year experience
with conversion therapy,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.010
and his journey of
finding peace afterwards.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.390
So, today, along
with his mother,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.160
Mathew is a national
advocate for banning

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.050
these destructive practices, and
is a full-time advisory member

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740
of the Born Perfect
Campaign with the National

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.950
Center for Lesbian Rights.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.320
So please join me in
welcoming Matt to the stage.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.550
Mathew.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.562
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.914
MATHEW SHURKA: Thank you.

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:52.902
SPEAKER 1: Ah, sorry.

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:55.372
[LAUGHS]

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:56.360
MATHEW SHURKA: Hi.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.135
Thank you, [? Cat, ?]
for that introduction.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.084
And happy pride, everyone.

00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:02.580
[CHUCKLES]

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.714
Yes.

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:05.130
That deserves a
round of applause.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
So I had a difficult
time figuring out

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000
how I was going
to give this talk,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
because when you go through
conversion therapy for five

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.712
years, and are moved
around the country in four

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.420
different states,
having psychotherapists

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.670
trying to cure me of my
homosexuality, a lot happens.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.670
And it's not just
the impact on myself,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.070
but on the impact of
all the lives around me,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.080
especially my
family, my friends.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.657
And the impact that I
have until this very day.

00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:39.990
So I figured I'm going to
start with what happened right

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.810
before I entered
conversion therapy

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.670
and how did I get there.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.730
So I grew up in
Great Neck, New York.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.020
If anyone knows where that
is, it's, like, awesome.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.990
OK, great, you're
like my neighbor.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.460
And it's 30 minutes from here.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.110
So I'm a local to
New York, for anyone

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.590
who doesn't know where that is.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.860
And when I was in high school,
I was fooling around with boys.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.100
I started maybe
in seventh grade.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.150
I thought it was awesome.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.390
I didn't have any shame
or any guilt about it.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.890
And I didn't have
any reason to have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260
any shame or guilt about it.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.340
But when I got into high
school, that totally

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.911
shifted what that meant to me.

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.910
I noticed that all the
seniors and upperclassmen

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.440
were bigger, taller, hairier.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.940
And I was like, oh, my
god, these guys are men.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.700
And it scared me, because
all they were doing

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300
was competing for all
the freshman girls.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.670
And I did not relate
to that at all.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.690
And so I was like, how
am I going to fit in?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.130
I don't have that many friends.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.440
And all I wanted to do was
get accepted and fit in.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.090
And I knew that I
had this stomach

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.140
pit feeling that I'm gay.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.270
And I don't know
what to do about it.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.770
And I just became a
person who was in denial.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.760
And so [INAUDIBLE]
the first pictures.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.966
These are my parents.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.570
And it's a funny picture.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.190
That's my parents on vacations.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.250
And my parents-- my
father's Middle Eastern.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.190
My mom's American.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.050
And Great Neck is a really
Jewish, conservative, Middle

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.450
Eastern community.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.550
And my father built--
when he settled there

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.050
about a year before I was born,
my father built his dream home.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.910
And it's this pretty
outlandish house.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.530
It's really
architecturally beautiful,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.970
and really inspired me for
architectural design as well.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.660
And it really began
to play in my role

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.810
of hiding my sexuality as well.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.434
And my freshman year of high
school, I became the party guy.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:40.600
What started off as, like,
just having a few friends

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.040
over on a Saturday night
turned into 10 friends.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.830
And 10 to 20, 50, and I was
well over 100 teenagers all

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.460
partying at my house.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.830
And I became popular.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.840
I thought I was
in the "in crowd."

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.020
I felt accepted.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.790
I felt like, OK,
this is working.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.770
But I really had no personal
connection to anyone.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.280
My two best friends
were two guys

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.696
that lived right
near me, who went

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.200
to a different high school.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.700
And those were the two guys I
hung out with on the weekends.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.670
So I was already living
like multiple lives.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.413
And as I began these parties,
I was lying to my parents.

00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:21.829
My parents were really outgoing,
so on any Saturday night,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.480
they'd be out till 3:00,
4:00 in the morning.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.021
So I had enough time to have a
party and to get everyone out,

00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.690
and I would be fine.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.290
I got caught a few times,
but more or less it worked.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.490
And so I'm creating
a reputation,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.320
I'm creating a persona for
who I am in high school.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.110
And there's two guys who are
in the grade above me, Sam

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.490
and Steven.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.084
And now, they had a reputation
of being troublemakers.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.250
You know, if they're ever
going to be at your house,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.390
they have the possibility
of trashing your house.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.300
And it's not really someone you
wanted be on their bad side.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.955
So I didn't really know them,
so it didn't really bother me.

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:56.580
I was like, OK, if
I ever have a party,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.080
they're just not
going to be there.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.504
And I'll be fine.

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:01.170
But as my parties got
bigger and bigger,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.378
it was more than just my
grade, the whole high school

00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:04.440
would come to my parties.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.640
And I blatantly made sure that
these two guys were not there.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.980
So you can imagine this
made them very angry.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.620
And it started like a couple
years of turmoil between us.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.545
There was a few
moments of aggravation.

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:19.420
They had tried coming
to my house at a party,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.480
I kicked them out.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.290
They tried throwing
a party in my house.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.590
I stopped it.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.150
And it became like
popularity war between us.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.920
And all I cared about
was no one finding out

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.190
that I might be gay.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.320
That's the only thing
that was on my mind.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.447
And as this continued, I'm
now a junior in high school,

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:42.030
and it was the first
Friday of school.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.640
So Sam and Steven
are now seniors,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.210
and that's a really big deal.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.690
You know, senioritis.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.970
And it was the first Friday.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.860
My parents had-- we had
a maid, a live-in maid.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.930
And I had a junior's
license, so I just

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.060
drove with her everywhere,
because I could drive.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.370
And so it was after school.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.120
I'm driving, and I
pull up to a stop sign,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.350
and I see Sam and Steven
crossing the crosswalk.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.280
And Steven starts yelling at me,
hey, man, oh, look who it is.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.510
It's Matt Shurka.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.680
Why don't you hit me
with your car, bro?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.850
And I'm, like,
this is ridiculous.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.500
These guys have been
fighting with me.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.510
It's a new school year.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.470
And here we go again.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.080
And I roll down my window, and
as I passed them, I yelled out,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.310
that's right, you
fucking faggots.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.010
And I drove off.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.180
I had lost myself
in that persona

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.830
of making sure that no one
knew what I was dealing with.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.090
I was hooking up
with guys secretly.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.030
And I became the guy at
school who wanted to fit in.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.290
So, "bro," "fag,"
"that's so gay,"

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.200
were all a part
of my vocabulary.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.080
And I thought it was
really, really smart,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.430
because then I would just blend
in and no one would notice.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.970
An hour after I called
Sam and Steven faggots,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.300
I was in the ER.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.680
And I got a blow to the face,
followed to the barbershop.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.550
And when I was in
the hospital, my nose

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.390
was about a half inch
to the right of my face.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.180
My nose had six separate
breaks, and a gash from my nose

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.010
up to my eyebrow.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.030
And let's see, so this
is actually the house.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.490
So I don't ever--
I don't usually

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.820
show a picture of my house, but
its so you get the idea, like,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.760
I had hundreds of
teenagers partying here

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.910
without my parents knowing.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.560
This is the inside.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.930
You know, so I was
getting away with a lot.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.752
And the day-- during
while I was healing,

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:36.460
this is the process
of what happened as I

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.510
was healing from the fight.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.210
So this is me in
my bedroom at home.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.990
And this is the Monday of
my first day back at school.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.294
And I thought I was so tough.

00:07:48.294 --> 00:07:50.210
I was like, I don't care,
I'm going to school.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.083
And I walk through the
hallways like that.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.100
Yeah, I healed.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.430
I was fine.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.570
And my nose got better.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.450
That's me as a senior.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.460
No plastic surgery.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.560
It was totally cool.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.809
That was a rumor that everyone
started in high school,

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:10.490
that oh, Matt got a nose job.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.400
But yeah, so-- but
what really happened

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.240
that day was that I couldn't
help but think that I got

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.764
ambushed by all the senior guys.

00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:25.680
And I knew that I was
gay and it meant so much

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.900
to my masculinity.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.590
You know, if they
knew that I was gay,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.179
my fear is what would
have happened then.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.642
And it scared me.

00:08:35.642 --> 00:08:37.100
So for two months
after that fight,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.140
I was cutting school
almost every single day.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.850
My parents could not understand
what I was acting out about.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.130
And my father had a
conversation of me,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.550
really pressing for me to share
what is going on in your life.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.850
And I told him I think I'm gay.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.810
I've been seeing other guys at
school, the other closeted guys

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.420
at school.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.864
I know I've been with
girls, but I just really

00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:00.780
don't know what to do.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.050
I know this is what I like.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.490
And my dad was so awesome.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.950
My dad said, you know, I
love you no matter what.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.750
I'm always going to
be there for you.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.830
And I thought I was
golden after that.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.860
So literally the very next
day, my father freaked out.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.070
He had his own
little panic of what

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.930
it meant to have a gay son.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.950
And he started searching in the
New York area for therapists.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.860
And he came across a
conversion therapist

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.970
who told him, well, there is
no such thing as homosexuality.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.970
And it's all part
of childhood trauma.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.270
Everyone is born
innately heterosexual.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.050
And because your son is still
young and still inexperienced

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.460
sexually, you'll start to see
his heterosexuality come back

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.430
in six weeks.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.540
My dad was thrilled.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.030
He found an opportunity
of a lifetime.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.490
And so out of my fear of
ever getting hurt again,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.860
trusting my father,
and his love for me,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.854
I began conversion therapy.

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.770
It was five years I was
in conversion therapy,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.728
so obviously, the six
weeks didn't really work.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:07.460
And just to really say what
conversion therapy was like.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.090
So you have to blame someone
in conversion therapy.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.960
If you're not born gay,
it came from somewhere.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.870
So I had a really
fortunate upbringing.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.540
I had no trauma.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.810
My parents were great.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.900
They loved me.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.403
They spoiled me, if anything.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.440
But I had to look for it.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.440
I'm the only son,
so the first guess

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.636
was I have too much
female in my life.

00:10:29.636 --> 00:10:32.260
So what I had to do was I had to
spend as much time as possible

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.135
with the other guys at
school, so I can learn

00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:35.680
about masculinity,
learn what it's

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.540
like to relate to other guys.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.130
Simultaneously, I had to
avoid women at all costs.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.230
These are the first steps
of curing homosexuality.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.100
I met my first boyfriend
this way, by the way.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.519
And unfortunately, though,
what that included was

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.810
I actually didn't speak to
my mother and my two sisters

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.250
for three years.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.870
Now what does that
actually mean?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.245
My mother was never going to
actually physically separate

00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:03.200
from me, so we lived
in the same house,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.510
and I didn't talk to
her for three years.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.010
So I would wake
up in the morning,

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.370
mom would make me breakfast.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.810
I come down, eat breakfast,
I'd walk right out the door.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.940
And that's what life was like.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.650
My mom-- both my
parents, I would say,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.650
were naive about it, about
what is homosexuality

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.620
and what to do and are
following the guidance

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.980
of a state-licensed therapist.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.050
And I was the one who actually
became the police officer

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.420
in my own home.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.170
When my mom started to see
that this is actually crazy,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.670
there can't be any
therapy out there

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.530
that separates a
child and its mother,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.990
she would actually try and talk
to me and tell me, I love you,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.920
however you are.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.400
If you're gay or not, it's OK.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.950
And I would throw
a tantrum at her.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.269
You know, how dare you.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:46.560
Because I looked at her as
a cause of my homosexuality.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.934
And now she's
ruining the therapy

00:11:47.934 --> 00:11:50.130
that I think is-- if I had
to save my life in order

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.560
to become straight.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.390
So as much as my
own mother tried,

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.390
I was the one making sure
that she was not going

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.340
to get close to me at all.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.720
So the years went on,
I became more popular.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.570
I actually now was
getting training

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.460
by my conversion therapists,
based on stereotypes

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.760
of how to be a guy.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.980
I did very well at it.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.770
However, my depression grew.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.950
My grades failed.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.510
I was almost-- I was pretty
much a straight-A student

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.260
before my conversion
therapy, and I almost

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.343
failed out of high school.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.576
And there was a period,
probably after my senior year

00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:31.330
where I contemplated my possible
suicide for about two years.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.789
Thought about when, where, how.

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:34.580
I even shared it with
a friend, like, oh, I

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.210
had this dream, just to see
what their reaction would be.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.380
And they laughed it off.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.963
No one really could
take it seriously.

00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:42.060
But it was something
that was real,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.200
because I knew I wasn't
becoming more straight.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.550
As I became more of a man,
my interest in men only grew.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.850
I knew exactly what I
wanted and what I liked.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.180
And so the years went on.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.760
I attempted to have
my first boyfriend.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.570
I told my conversion therapist
and my father every detail.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.590
And actually, my first boyfriend
disappeared and broke up

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.260
with me.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.090
Not knowing why, and
I later found out

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.840
that my father had met with
him and threatened him.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.780
And it was a friend
of mine growing up.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.800
When that happened, I
was just losing trust

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.900
in everyone around me.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.270
I felt conspired against.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.580
I didn't trust the therapist.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.400
I found that he was lying to me.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.450
My own mother and sisters
knew why my boyfriend had

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.200
disappeared, but I
wasn't talking to them,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.390
so it's not like they were
going to tell me anyway.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.910
And I moved.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.660
I moved to Los Angeles
to get away from it all.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.620
And for the next couple
years, I was in and out

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.640
of therapy, conversion therapy.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.030
And there was a pattern
that I was picking up on,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.060
which was every
conversion therapist I

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.330
met had the same story.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.960
They were gay themselves.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.170
They cured themselves.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.472
And that's how they became one.

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:48.680
So I was like, wait a second.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.250
Have I actually ever
met someone who's

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.950
converted to heterosexuality?

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.710
And I never met a single
person till this day.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.330
I've met men who were
in conversion therapy,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.210
married, and had children.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.600
And they say, yeah, I still
have my attractions to men.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.790
I just don't do
anything about it.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.020
And they literally
treat their attractions

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.770
to other men like alcoholism.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.440
It's there, notice it,
don't do anything about it.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.240
And that's when I really
started to question everything

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.880
around me.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.720
The very thing that
I believed in so much

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.120
and was really
trying to make work.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.210
And I finally had enough.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.490
And at the age of 21, estranged
from my father that point,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.430
I haven't spoken to my mother
in three years nor my sisters,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.810
I left conversion therapy
and moved back to New York.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.620
I became a server
here at a restaurant

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.870
in SoHo called Balthazar, and
it was a great experience.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.990
I had a boss that was gay.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.920
I had clientele who were out.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.680
You know, executives.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.150
And it was really
just inspiring to see

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.920
people living their life,
successful in whatever they're

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.490
doing.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.710
And whatever their
sexual orientation is

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.700
had made no difference
to their life.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.580
So after that, I was able to
actually see a psychotherapist

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.490
for the first time.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.448
I had actually never seen
one, an actual person

00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:09.920
who does therapy.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.990
And it's a-- [LAUGHS] and
it took a lot of trust.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.600
It was a new experience for me.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.300
I also did a program
called Landmark,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.880
which is a global personal and
professional training company.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.790
And I got so inspired
from there by mentors,

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.480
and I started to
look at my own life.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.427
How my whole life I
was trying to fit in.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.260
And I noticed that the
conversion therapists

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.370
who were treating me were trying
to fit in, in their own life.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.350
And my father who I hadn't
spoken to in five years

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.510
was trying to be a great dad.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.420
Now I didn't believe
that for a long time.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.010
And I went and spoke to him.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.362
So it was in 2012.

00:15:44.362 --> 00:15:45.820
I hadn't seen my
dad in five years.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.230
My father moved back to
Israel where he's from.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.380
And I had a
conversation with him.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.110
And I said to my dad,
I want to see you.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.102
It's been five years.

00:15:57.102 --> 00:15:58.060
Can I come and see you?

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.230
I'm going to fly to Israel.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.680
And I flew there.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.340
I was only there for three days.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.961
And I was with my
whole family there.

00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:05.710
Everyone is there.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.150
And we had dinner together.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.390
And I made a gay
joke at the table.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.280
Everyone laughs except my dad.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.080
And my dad said to me, you
know, let's take a walk.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.141
And he looked--
and he said to me--

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.390
we walked away from the table.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.800
And he said to me, so, whatever
happened to your conversion

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.860
therapy?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.550
Are you gay?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.050
Are you not?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.090
It sounds like
you're openly gay.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.777
And I said, yeah, dad.

00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:30.110
I've met some really great
people, some really inspiring

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.400
people, and this is who I am.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.080
I am openly gay.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.760
And my dad started this
rant-- which he always says,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.519
I probably have it memorized--
how I can't be gay,

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.060
I don't understand
what the world is,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.885
and I'm going to hurt myself.

00:16:43.885 --> 00:16:46.260
And my automatic reaction
would be to like fight with him

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.390
verbally to stop this.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.230
But I just listen.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.537
And it was for the first
time, through all my work

00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:54.120
and all my healing,
I was able to hear

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.770
how scared my father was.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.230
My dad was terrified.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.940
I'm his only son, he had no
idea what to do about this.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.910
And I stopped him after 10
minutes of him rambling on.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.024
And I said, dad, there is
nothing to worry about.

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:12.190
Now, I've never actually
looked at my dad in the eye

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.236
and said there's
nothing to worry about.

00:17:14.236 --> 00:17:16.319
I don't know if anyone
really tells their parents,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.901
guys, it's OK, mom and dad.

00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:21.109
And he looked at me, he's
like, how can you say that?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.317
How can you say not to worry?

00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:25.550
And I was, like, dad, I know
exactly what the world is.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.020
I know exactly who I am.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.660
And my promise to you is
I will take care of myself

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.897
as it comes.

00:17:31.897 --> 00:17:33.480
There's really nothing
to worry about.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.930
Look around.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.320
We're here together for the
first time in five years.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.530
Is there anything
wrong happening?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.240
And my father said, OK.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.716
Now what happened in that
moment was I got my father back,

00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:47.090
and I recognized
that I was never

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.370
going to-- I was never going
to sacrifice my relationship

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.605
with my father ever again.

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:53.980
Now this doesn't
mean my father's

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.490
going to march on Fifth
Avenue during gay pride.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.224
That's the last thing
he's going to do.

00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:00.390
But what started, what
opened up was a conversation.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.827
And my dad is someone I
talk to almost every day.

00:18:02.827 --> 00:18:05.160
And when he has questions or
things he doesn't-- that he

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.470
can't work out for himself
about me being openly gay,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.200
we talk about it.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.070
And that's just
how it looks like.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.200
And it's great.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.570
The next person I
wanted to reach out

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.700
to make peace to, or start a
conversation [INAUDIBLE] what

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.080
is going to happen
was one therapist

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.080
who treated me for three years.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.700
And this man was
living in Los Angeles.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.380
And I didn't know what
he was going to say,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.970
so I sent an email.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.669
And said to him,
hey, I would love

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:35.210
to share a conversation with
you and share my accomplishments

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.420
since we last met.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.430
Would you be interested?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.330
He didn't answer
the email, he just

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.650
called me 15 minutes later.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.620
And I had a heart attack.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.220
And I didn't pick up the call.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.340
He called again, maybe
another 30 minutes later.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.770
I'm, like, just get on the call.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.660
I started this.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:57.206
And it was just like,
hi, how are you?

00:18:57.206 --> 00:18:59.080
And I shared with him
all my accomplishments.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.510
I shared with him
how I came out,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.310
how I told my dad not to worry,
that life's going to be OK.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.180
And I told him that I'm
going to become a gay rights

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.580
advocate, because I made a
YouTube video that just went

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.363
viral, and I just got invited to
speak at Creating Change, which

00:19:13.363 --> 00:19:16.550
is a national LGBT conference.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.380
And he said, wow.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.850
He said, you know, you're
one of-- he started to share,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.970
you're one of 13 guys I
treated who I never cured.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.530
I said, OK.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.282
So does that mean you're
not practicing anymore?

00:19:29.282 --> 00:19:30.740
And he started to
share with me how

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.780
he was in a really
bad place in his life.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.990
He spent all his money going
to school, getting a PhD.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.692
And the last thing he thought
he was doing was hurting people.

00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:43.400
And he says, I don't
actually really know

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.090
the full damage of what I did.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.200
And he has a wife and two
kids, and people won't even

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.190
hire me right now.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.935
And I don't even
know what to do.

00:19:52.935 --> 00:19:55.060
What was interesting was
the tables sort of turned.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.380
I now was the
therapist, in a way.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.810
And he was like the
patient seeking help.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.020
And I just really got
the humanity in him.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.830
And we started to talk every
week and just became friendly.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.380
And I shared with him that I
know I'm going to be speaking.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.977
I'm going to be
sharing our story.

00:20:12.977 --> 00:20:14.810
My years with you, I
really cared about you.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.020
I believe there was
some of the best time.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.520
I didn't realize the harm that
was happening to me because I

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.620
believed in the therapy.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.450
And I said, do I
get your-- will I

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.120
have your blessing to go speak
nationally about this issue?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.400
And he said, of course.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.600
And please tell me
everything that happens.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.020
We started to become friendlier.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.960
And as time went by, a lot
was going on in the country.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.030
Conversion therapy
became a national topic.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.570
It almost pretty much
did not exist before.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.950
And there was a big
lawsuit that started.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.230
I was invited to be a part
of against a few conversion

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.850
therapists, some
that had treated me.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.300
And I declined to
be a part of it.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.590
And instead, I asked
this particular therapist

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.590
if he would join
me in an interview.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.560
We get to share
our story together.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.710
Former patient,
former therapist.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.460
And we created an
article-- I believe it's

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.780
the next slide-- this article.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.517
And it says, "True Colors,
Getting Over the Gay Cure."

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.600
And we sat side by side--
it was the first time we

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.970
saw each other in five years--
and we talked about, together,

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.800
what conversion therapy
was like for both of us.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.590
And I just recognized
the impact of this versus

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.490
if he was behind a bench
and I was suing him.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.915
And I was actually
standing for him.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.040
I wanted him to get the
life that he wanted to live

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.050
and what he was-- why
did he go to school?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.300
Why did he become a therapist?

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.510
I became interested in
what he wanted in his life.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.280
And we got to create this
incredible article together.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.840
So as time went on, I
am now a advisory member

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.029
to a campaign called-- it's
a hashtag-- #BornPerfect.

00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:43.570
It was created by
the National Center

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.630
for Lesbian Rights
in San Francisco.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.510
And our goal is by
2019 we will end

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.020
conversion therapy nationwide.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.240
Our advocacy has continued.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.420
So far, conversion therapy has
been outlawed in six US states

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.640
for minors only.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.560
And we have federal legislation
right now pending in Congress.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.230
Considering that this movement
has only started in two years,

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.590
our progress has
been outstanding.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.570
And we really believe that
by 2019, conversion therapy

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.632
will be outlawed.

00:22:12.632 --> 00:22:13.840
This is just another article.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.680
This is me when I--
in "Time" magazine, I

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.260
wrote an op-ed for "Time."

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.020
And that's when I was
speaking in Albany.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.657
I got really-- it's punked.

00:22:22.657 --> 00:22:25.240
I put my-- I don't know how my
hands got in the air like that,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.200
actually.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.970
It's a conversion
therapy. [LAUGHS]

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:35.050
So what I want to do next
is-- my mother is here.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.890
My mother is awesome,
and I cherish my mother.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.490
Everyone who's a survivor
of conversion therapy--

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.460
we call them
survivors-- it really

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.590
is something that you survive.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.450
Because the LGBT suicide
rate is very high.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:56.060
It's about five times higher
than straight individuals.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.002
If you're in conversion
therapy, you're

00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.710
eight times more likely
to commit suicide

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:04.110
on top of the LGBT rate.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.060
And there are stories
like Leelah Alcorn who

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.660
made national news last
year-- a teenager who

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.580
was in conversion therapy.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.770
It's happening every day.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.226
It's phone calls
I get every day.

00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:14.850
It's Facebook messages
I get every day.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.850
It's emails I get every day.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:17.910
Help, what can I do?

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.260
I'm in this country.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.550
I'm in this state.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.160
We just had a teenage
girl who would

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.970
be removed from a conversion
therapy facility in Texas

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.304
yesterday.

00:23:28.304 --> 00:23:30.220
So this is like a real
thing that's happening.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.350
And it's being
spoken about more.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.095
So my mom didn't go
through conversion therapy,

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:37.220
but she went through a
horrific experience with me.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.530
And what she survived
was the advice

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.072
that my conversion
therapist gave me.

00:23:41.072 --> 00:23:42.571
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:45.000
to have my mom, who's here,
she's going to come on stage.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.291
And I'm going to have her
share a little bit about what

00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:48.730
her experience is like as a mom.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.140
And ask her some
questions as well.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.661
So please-- Jane is her name--

00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:54.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.000
--come on stage.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.090
Why don't you sit here?

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.590
Yes.

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:11.960
It's not every day
I get to interview

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.011
my mom like this, so welcome.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:25.060
So I didn't even-- I never-- I
never actually came out to you.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.530
I only came out to dad.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.440
And I began conversion therapy.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.210
Why don't you-- what
was that like when

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.060
dad said to you that I was going
to be in conversion therapy?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.810
What were your thoughts
about it at first,

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.350
and when did you realize that
this is not something you

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.600
thought maybe was best for me.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.030
Or you share what that was like.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.880
JANE SHURKA: I felt
that you had issues.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.100
I never felt that you were
gay when you were growing up.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.590
And I said, OK, you have issues.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.400
OK, he tells me you're gay.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.730
That's the issue.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.200
OK, that's fine.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.706
And my attitude was
that he's telling me

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:02.080
he's going to conversion
therapy because he told me

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.640
you were confused.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.984
You felt confused.

00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:10.320
So I said, me not knowing about
being gay, I said he's confused

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.550
and he wants help.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.540
So I'll go for it.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.160
Let him try to get a
conversion therapist

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.906
and help you to be straight,
if that's what you wanted.

00:25:19.906 --> 00:25:22.110
MATHEW SHURKA: Sure.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.449
And then what happened next?

00:25:23.449 --> 00:25:24.907
What happened in
the coming months?

00:25:24.907 --> 00:25:30.070
JANE SHURKA: OK, so he searched
for a conversion therapist.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.880
He was telling me the
conversion therapist is--

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.860
said you're-- there's no
such thing as being gay.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.660
And I believe that
you're born gay.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.750
That was my belief.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.290
That's the only
knowledge that I did

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.670
have, is that I felt
that you were born gay.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.297
But didn't know
anything else about it.

00:25:45.297 --> 00:25:47.630
And when he said, six weeks
you're going to be straight,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.280
I said, OK.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.245
I think that's OK.

00:25:50.245 --> 00:25:51.870
MATHEW SHURKA: Sounds
like a good deal.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.494
JANE SHURKA: I-- you
know, sounds good.

00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:56.980
I said, he's going to-- your
father was very upset by it,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.170
and I said OK.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.890
If it's going to
help you, I agree.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:01.640
MATHEW SHURKA: OK.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.730
As you know, I said
earlier that you

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.930
were trying to-- you wanted me
to recognize that it was OK.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.900
And I was furious every
time you did that.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.660
JANE SHURKA: Look,
before the six weeks,

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.465
I knew that you were gay.

00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:21.874
I started to
understand what is gay.

00:26:21.874 --> 00:26:23.730
MATHEW SHURKA: Speak
into the microphone.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.880
Speak into the microphone.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.990
JANE SHURKA: I understood-- now,
I started really looking at you

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.830
and seeing this is not working.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:36.460
MATHEW SHURKA: I
don't know-- OK.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.810
I don't want to know the
evidence of that, but--

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.384
JANE SHURKA: I understood,
as a mom knows her child,

00:26:42.384 --> 00:26:45.950
and understands things, and I
understood that you were gay.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.550
And I wanted you to
accept yourself as gay.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.680
The treatment was crazy.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.980
I felt it was crazy.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.465
But, I said, I don't
want to give up, either.

00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:59.310
It was six weeks into treatment.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.740
I say, you have to keep trying,
maybe we have to work this out.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.950
But I just saw as time went
on, that this is not working.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.030
And it's not helpful.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.830
MATHEW SHURKA: What about--
we talk about six weeks,

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.970
and I was in it for five years.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.600
What happened
between you and dad?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.640
You and dad, you got divorced.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.989
And I know that was
something separate.

00:27:21.989 --> 00:27:24.030
But did you think, you
know, it really started it

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.470
when conversion therapy started.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.095
I know you and dad
had your own things,

00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:31.200
but you guys had a
huge difference--

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.760
you and dad had a huge
difference about what

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.530
was happening to me.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.900
We were a really close family.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.640
We grew up as a family
having Shabbat dinners, which

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.970
is something we do
as a Jewish family.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.701
There's like 30 of
us every Friday.

00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:47.200
And yet, I was
coming home every day

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.813
not talking to Melanie
and Nancy, my two sisters.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.450
Where did you think
it was all going?

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.950
I remember when--
yeah, where did you

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.140
think that was all going?

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.500
JANE SHURKA: First of all, I
was going through a divorce

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.208
with your father.

00:28:03.208 --> 00:28:04.550
Nothing to do with you.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.540
So I had a lot of
emotional issues myself.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.730
And I went to therapy to
help me get my act together.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.570
And through that time
with therapy for myself,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.816
I saw that this is
not good for you.

00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:20.190
And that you're
not talking to me

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.250
and I try to
communicate with you.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.850
I was praying every day for you
to come out and be yourself.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.710
Because it was just a
terrible place for you.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.350
I was sitting there,
realizing people

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.890
take for granted when they
wake up every day that they-- I

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.199
don't think about my sexuality.

00:28:35.199 --> 00:28:36.240
I never thought about it.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.960
I wake up, I know who I am.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.360
You were arguing with
yourself every day.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.660
And I just can't imagine
being in that situation.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.635
And I saw you, that this
is not the way to be.

00:28:47.635 --> 00:28:50.790
That you have to accept
yourself the way you are.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.731
And it just-- with the
conversion therapist

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.480
helping you all the
time and telling you--

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.430
this man who has a
license-- is telling you,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.850
maybe he knows better than I do.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.870
I I'm realizing he doesn't.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.340
And he has a license and
we're respecting the fact

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.400
that he has more
knowledge than I have,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.830
that he's more
educated than I am.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.577
MATHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:29:11.577 --> 00:29:13.660
You doubted yourself based
on his own credentials.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.690
JANE SHURKA: Yes.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:15.510
Yes.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.468
MATHEW SHURKA: I going
to ask one last question

00:29:17.468 --> 00:29:19.110
and then move on.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.500
When you saw my You-- so,
my first-- I never even

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.384
had a YouTube account,
and I made one,

00:29:23.384 --> 00:29:25.300
and it was the first
time I ever made a video.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.008
I made it for the It
Gets Better project,

00:29:27.008 --> 00:29:30.500
which is for anti-bullying
of LGBT teens.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.627
And the video, it went viral.

00:29:33.627 --> 00:29:35.210
It's not like it has
millions of hits,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.690
but it went viral
within 24 hours

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.210
and it ended up on the
cover, the gay voices

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.160
of "The Huffington
Post" website.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.260
And that's really where
my advocacy began.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.760
What was your reaction
when you saw the video?

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.695
JANE SHURKA: I cried.

00:29:49.695 --> 00:29:53.780
I cried from-- I said, thank
god that you-- this is--

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.520
you're not going back.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.650
You cannot deny you
are gay anymore.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.870
Thousands of people
are looking at this.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.400
And it was a monumental
moment for me,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.670
for us, to finally
accept yourself.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.020
I was proud of you.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.377
I was so happy that you
finally came to terms,

00:30:11.377 --> 00:30:13.460
because now we're going
to go in a good direction.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.720
Now we're going to be
in the right place.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.920
MATHEW SHURKA: Yeah, I didn't
expect that video to end up

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.380
on the news, but, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.140
JANE SHURKA: It was all over.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.590
MATHEW SHURKA: But it--
yes, I wasn't going back.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.631
JANE SHURKA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:23.730
MATHEW SHURKA: OK.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.100
JANE SHURKA: I'd just like to
say why I'm here as a parent.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.560
That I want to help other
parents-- because there's

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.700
other parents in this world, in
this life, that thinks the way

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.340
I thought.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.110
They're ignorant,
they don't understand,

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.120
and I think it's so important
to accept your child.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.770
When he tells you that
I'm gay, he's gay.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.310
Not making any excuses, he
doesn't-- he's not confused.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.330
He is gay, and you should
help him find himself

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.430
in that direction.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.039
And when you do that, you
will have-- your child--

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:57.330
I wouldn't-- you wouldn't
lose your child to five years

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.580
of conversion therapy.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.080
He lost very formative years
in his life for that therapy.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.040
Thank god he didn't
lose it altogether.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.990
But I think it's so
important, me, as a parent,

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.110
to put out there to all the
other parents in this world,

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.610
that you should
accept your children

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.230
and love them and accept
them the way they are.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.470
MATHEW SHURKA: Thank you.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.803
You can sit-- you can sit there.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.630
Thanks, mom.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.780
I almost debated
about bringing her.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.160
But that was so great.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.980
And the fact that
we started-- my mom

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.050
advocated me only last
year the first time.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.150
And I never even considered
that could be possible

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.230
that I would advocate
publicly with my mom.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.020
So just, thank you
for being so open.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.860
And this was such a personal
experience for our family.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.630
So I shared with you how I
reached out to my father.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.600
My father is-- he and
I are very close today.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.790
He lives in Israel.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.057
I reached out to my
conversion therapist.

00:32:04.057 --> 00:32:05.890
He's no longer practicing
conversion therapy

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.860
and he's moving on in his life.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.950
The last person I
reached out to was Sam.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:17.870
Sam was the high school student
who ended up breaking my nose.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:23.640
And I considered, like,
why was I calling him?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.550
And I wanted to call
because I was apologizing

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.190
for calling him a faggot.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.980
And that I was so lost, and
so-- I was only concerned

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.420
about myself, about no
one ever finding out,

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.076
I wasn't even considering
what my actions

00:32:40.076 --> 00:32:41.200
were doing to other people.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.590
And so Sam joined us today.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.380
Sam has become a friend of mine.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.670
And he flew in just to be here,
he flew in from Los Angeles.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.170
This is the first time we're
ever speaking together.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.720
We've had numerous phone calls.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.260
We met-- the first time
we met was in 2013.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.080
And I discovered
an incredible man.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.780
And he's flourishing
in his career

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.730
and he's living a great life.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.360
So it's a privilege
that he joined us

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.750
today and can be here.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.950
So I'm going to write Sam
to come onto the stage.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.726
And I'm going to
ask him questions.

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:17.507
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.545
Welcome.

00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:25.420
SAM MINER: Thank you.

00:33:27.564 --> 00:33:29.230
MATHEW SHURKA: Thank
you for being here.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.610
This is so exciting for me,
and I know we spoke, for us.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.170
So I guess the
first question I'm

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:42.107
going to ask you is what
were you like in high school?

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.860
SAM MINER: Well, I felt I was a
popular person in high school,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.980
not like your jock
or class president.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.440
I didn't do good in school
and I didn't play sports,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.510
but me and all my
friends, we were just

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.260
focused about who could
have the biggest party, who

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.600
could do the most drugs, who
could hook up with the best

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.900
girls, and who could dominate
in fights and things like that,

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.010
and just trying to build
a reputation around more

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.889
destructive things at the time.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.050
MATHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.196
I mean, yeah.

00:34:14.196 --> 00:34:15.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.630
Yeah, I thought that-- I
had a reputation for you.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.600
Yeah, I had no
relationship to you.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.290
Of course, I knew who
you were, I knew of you.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.969
You're Sam and-- yeah
otherwise, I actually never

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.045
knew you personally.

00:34:33.045 --> 00:34:35.420
So this is who you were in
high school, and so who was I?

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.300
Who was Matt Shurka?

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.790
You know, I know you moved
from a private Jewish school

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.070
and came to our school.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.530
Who was I when-- I don't know
if we ever recall when we first

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:45.250
met, but, yeah.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.800
Who was I to you?

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.080
SAM MINER: So Matt
was this rich kid,

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.929
who would throw these crazy
parties in his insane house.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.720
And they would grow bigger
and bigger every single year.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.920
And it was the only party
we weren't invited to.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.430
So obviously, this
made us pretty angry.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.560
And finally, there was an
event in school called Battle.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.190
And it's battle of the classes.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.565
MATHEW SHURKA: They call it
War for high school students.

00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:15.000
SAM MINER: And usually one
person has like an open house

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.280
party where everybody in the
entire school is invited.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.410
So me and my friends,
we thought we would go

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.700
and tons of cars outside,
like the whole street,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.734
maybe like 100 cars.

00:35:25.734 --> 00:35:28.150
And people just standing outside
and waiting for the party

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.730
to start.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.880
So me, Steven, a few
of our other friends,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.664
we get up to the front door.

00:35:34.664 --> 00:35:37.080
And I don't know why you weren't
so busy that you actually

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.650
opened the door, but
Matt opens the door,

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.540
and is just like--
doesn't say anything,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.950
he's just like, you guys
aren't allowed in here.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.130
And I was so furious, I
remember I just reached

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.900
in and just tried to hit him.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.980
And somebody pulled him back,
and then they shut the door.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.500
And we just left.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.370
So that was my
experience with you,

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.270
and it was just-- I couldn't
understand why we wouldn't

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.560
be invited to your parties.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.895
I mean, I thought that
there was something wrong--

00:36:08.895 --> 00:36:10.770
you thought there's
something wrong with us--

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.603
MATHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:36:11.603 --> 00:36:13.570
SAM MINER: --that we
couldn't come and enjoy.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:19.566
MATHEW SHURKA: Yeah, it's
interesting when you hear that.

00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:21.190
That was all before,
but this is, like,

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.370
what was leading to the
actual time I got hit.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.780
And yeah, I just wanted--
it's so interesting

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.770
to hear-- when I heard you
say that and I called you

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.700
a couple years ago, I just
wanted to make sure that I was

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.899
getting along with
everyone, and you not being

00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:39.940
in my home was like, OK,
just trying to make sure

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.010
they're not there.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.770
You know, it never
even crossed my mind

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.080
that, like, our whole high
school's going to be there

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.450
and I'm not there.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:47.920
What's going on?

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.788
I was so preoccupied with that.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.480
So it was a year later
when you were a senior

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.340
and I was a junior.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.540
And we actually got into our-- I
guess we're calling it a fight.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.520
I guess, if you want to share
what that was like for you?

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.230
And more so, what
it meant to you.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.102
Like what the impact
was of the fight.

00:37:11.102 --> 00:37:12.810
If you want to give
a little bit of both.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.360
SAM MINER: Sure.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.940
So at that time, I had already
got in a lot of trouble,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.010
and I'd been arrested
a number of times.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.190
And I wanted to start my
senior year and turn a new leaf

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:27.910
and just avoid trouble,
arrest at all costs.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.902
And it was the third day
of school on a Friday,

00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:31.860
and everybody was excited,
obviously, to leave.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.656
It was the excitement
of your senior year.

00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:35.280
And we were-- all
our friends were just

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.650
going to get together
and go have fun.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.050
So we stepped off
school property,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.300
and immediately we
see Matt to our left.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.410
My friend, Steven, who's much
more of a loudmouth than I am,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:49.580
started yelling at
Matt some things.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.760
And I remember Matt just
looking at us with disgust,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.580
like for some reason,
he just hated us.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.000
And then as he's driving by,
he rolls down his window,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.050
he says what he said,
and we follow him.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.990
We follow him to the barbershop.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.490
And I'm staying
across the street.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.030
I'm just thinking, I don't
want to be involved in this,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.710
I don't want to get in trouble.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.001
I don't want to get in trouble.

00:38:11.001 --> 00:38:12.800
I don't want to get in trouble.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.290
But Steven runs
across the street

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.500
and runs into the
barbershop, and I'm like-- me

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.541
and Steven have been
through everything together.

00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:21.480
We felt-- we always
would rile each other up,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.630
because we always
felt the same way.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.550
We always felt we were
outcast, troublemakers,

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.814
and couldn't get along
in a regular society

00:38:26.814 --> 00:38:27.480
that we were in.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.680
So the second I approached
the door to the barbershop,

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.640
I just hear yelling,
Matt and Steven.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.740
And I see Matt come at
me, my first instinct

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.430
was just to throw punches.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.530
So I hit Matt.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.860
I hear a big bang.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.760
And then I see Matt's eyes
roll to the back of his head,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760
and I see his nose split open.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.690
I see the bone.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.860
I see a little bit of blood.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.660
And then I see him
drop to his knees.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.900
And it was the scariest
moment of my life.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.570
I thought I saw a ghost.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.634
And I thought that day
that I killed somebody.

00:39:00.634 --> 00:39:02.550
And I thought that I've
already been arrested,

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.175
I've already been in
trouble, I'm never

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.530
going to get through this.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.112
I just ruined the
rest of my life.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:10.570
We went so far as after that,
we went to my friend's house,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.350
and I told Steven to
hit me multiple times

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.825
so he could claim self-defense.

00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:15.700
And that didn't work.

00:39:18.645 --> 00:39:21.020
MATHEW SHURKA: Well, thank
you for sharing that so openly

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.990
and being vulnerable.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.690
Yeah, I mean, that
was the last day

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.620
you attended our high school.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.477
You know, that was a Friday
and Monday you weren't there.

00:39:32.477 --> 00:39:34.310
One of the things I
said to you on the phone

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.748
was-- when I called you and
apologized, I'm like, you know,

00:39:37.748 --> 00:39:40.569
Sam, I didn't know
who you were before.

00:39:40.569 --> 00:39:42.860
I didn't know who you-- I
don't know who you are today.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.790
I know nothing
about you, actually.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.120
We were never friends.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.910
And yet, I said to you,
you were the single person

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.660
who's had the greatest impact
in my life till this very day.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.860
And I don't know who you are.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.360
And I said, I don't
know what it was

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.990
like that you didn't
graduate with us, your class,

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.490
you didn't go to prom, you
weren't a part of any of that.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.531
I heard rumors that maybe
you were in jail, maybe

00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:03.720
you were not.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.460
And I said things like had
so many options of what

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.840
I could have done that day.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.381
I didn't have to
roll down the window

00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:14.700
and yell out the word "faggot."

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.860
I could have just
kept to myself.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.050
I couldn't even-- our whole--
all of our friends took sides,

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.440
parents in our
community took sides.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.120
It was like such
a massive impact

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.720
to what happened that day.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.592
And taking it-- just
to stop being worried

00:40:34.592 --> 00:40:36.550
about if I'm gay or not
and people finding out,

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.930
and considering
other people, I said,

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.312
I could have actually been
there for you as friends.

00:40:42.312 --> 00:40:44.020
And we could have
actually resolved this.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.186
But what ended up happening
was our friends ended up

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:49.917
fighting with all of each other
as well as the years went on.

00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:51.500
And I know I took
on that perspective,

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.620
and I wanted it-- I took
on the idea of being

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.349
responsible in every
aspect that, yeah, I

00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:58.890
went through conversion therapy
and I'm a gay rights advocate

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.690
today, but I was a
person who used the word

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.450
"faggot" towards
others, not really

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.922
considering what that meant.

00:41:06.922 --> 00:41:08.630
And I don't know--
because of that fight,

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.421
I don't know-- it was
because of that fight

00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:12.280
that actually I came out.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.680
I was a person in denial.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.640
And when that fight happened,
it was like the moment

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.970
where I can't hide this anymore.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:21.939
I'm scared.

00:41:21.939 --> 00:41:23.480
The fact that there's
a group of guys

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.100
that are able that do that, is
like, what am I actually going

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.990
to do with my life.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.840
And so it's funny how
things work out in life

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.360
is that it was because of
that fight that I came out.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.110
Yes, I had to go to
the conversion therapy

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.200
and get to where I was, but I
might have been in the closet

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.450
for years, knowing the
community we come from.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.699
My first boyfriend
is still closeted.

00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:48.115
You know, and he
was my boyfriend.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:57.510
And yes, I look back at it like
it was a huge moment for me.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.827
And I want to ask, I got to
hear a little bit about where

00:42:00.827 --> 00:42:01.910
your life went afterwards.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.350
And so what did
happen afterwards?

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.050
And where did that
take you today?

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.190
And who are you today?

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.560
SAM MINER: Well, just
that moment in the fight,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.444
it was-- I already wanted to
avoid trouble at all costs.

00:42:13.444 --> 00:42:15.110
It was also a big
turning moment for me,

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.690
because I just had
this sense that I

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.540
had to make a massive
change in my life

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.270
and redirect all my energies.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.190
And that meant a major overhaul.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.560
Like changing who I was, really.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.530
My friends were what
I did every day.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:36.580
So where I went-- I was sent to
this therapeutic troubled teen

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.810
program in the wilderness.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.465
It was either that or jail.

00:42:39.465 --> 00:42:41.340
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah,
this was a court order.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.200
SAM MINER: A court order.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:50.940
And so there, unexpectedly,
I had a moment to be free.

00:42:53.835 --> 00:42:55.582
This was a place
where you literally

00:42:55.582 --> 00:42:56.540
live in the wilderness.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.510
You live off the land.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.930
You make your own fires,
not with a lighter,

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.610
with like local materials.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.730
You only eat rice,
lentils, just basic things.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.180
And you are surrounded
by strangers.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.100
And all these people
that you get to know,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.980
you realize that they're all
just fighting for attention.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.650
And I had the time to
reflect that everything

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:20.570
that I was doing
was to gain the love

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.230
and appreciation
of others, and just

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.290
build my personal confidence
in the society that I was in.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.770
So I had a moment
to take a step back,

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.420
and to sort of think
about how I wanted

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.470
to direct my energies into
something more positive.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.470
And really I was
able to have the time

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.400
to make those personal changes
before I came back home

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.890
and taking a new path.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.880
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.357
That was so surprising.

00:43:51.357 --> 00:43:52.940
So that was the last
thing I was going

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.730
to-- this is the last thing
I thought to hear, like,

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.250
you had a court
order, and you said,

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.830
you hated when you got there
and you walked away loving it.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.360
That's what you told me,
and the impact it has.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.850
And so you live in
Los Angeles today.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.020
What do you-- just want to
share briefly what you do.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.240
SAM MINER: So I'm
a project manager

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.130
at a company called [? Ucero. ?]
They're a venture-backed food

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.480
tech startup based
in San Francisco,

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.210
but we have an operational
facility in Los Angeles

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.310
that I went to help build.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.232
So it's been a very
exciting time there.

00:44:31.232 --> 00:44:33.700
We make cold-pressed
juice and try

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.230
to help the world by
selling organic products.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.400
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.090
Awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.410
So thank you.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.150
We are going to do
a Q&amp;A in a minute.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:53.749
I just wanted to share that
in my experience of this,

00:44:53.749 --> 00:44:55.290
literally, what I
got out of all this

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.380
was that I was trying
to fit into society.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.520
I was trying to--
just doing it myself.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.440
I was falling into
this game of popularity

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.700
and throwing parties
in high school.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.950
I get into this fight, I end
up in conversion therapy,

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.540
and the whole purpose was
so I can be straight and fit

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.240
into society that way.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.940
And that was the same goal.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.390
And as I saw that
wasn't working,

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.839
I saw that my therapist
wanted the same thing.

00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:20.130
I saw that my therapist wanted
to be a great therapist,

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.090
and all he was really doing
to try and succeed at that.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.190
When I spoke to my
father, my father

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.070
wanted to be a great
dad, and he wanted

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.194
to ensure that I was one
going to have the greatest

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:30.960
future possible.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.460
And when I spoke to Sam, and
what his high school experience

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.410
was about fitting in
and not being left out,

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.520
there was a pattern here
that, really, everyone

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.960
is looking to fit in.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.690
People want to be acknowledged,
accepted, and loved.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.190
And it could believe
even the person

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.330
you think as maybe your
enemy, the person who's

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.630
on the opposite
side of the aisle.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.530
And as an LGBT activist,
I was seeing this not just

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.320
in the LGBT community like we
are standing to be accepted,

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.400
but so is everyone else.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.000
And that's really what
I wanted to share today.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.440
And it was a privilege to
bring my mom and Sam here.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.072
And yeah, I just wanted
to present to you here

00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:09.530
this is what our
story was, this is

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:10.740
what we experienced together.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.790
And this is who we
are today, and we both

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:16.082
stand for making a
difference in the world.

00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:18.040
And just, really, just
thank you for having us.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:18.953
Thank you.

00:46:18.953 --> 00:46:21.911
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:32.649
So I know we're going to do a
Q&amp;A. If anyone in the audience

00:46:32.649 --> 00:46:34.440
has any questions,
there's two microphones.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.850
I also know that there is--
people from their desk,

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.200
can ask questions, I was told.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.856
I'm not a Googler or a Gaygler,
but I know they can do that.

00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:48.356
Yeah.

00:46:48.356 --> 00:46:49.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.220
Thanks for coming.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.720
My question is it sounds like
you've rekindled, made amends

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.270
with a lot of people
that you had maybe

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:57.320
broken the relationship
with before,

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.269
whether it be your ex-therapist,
friends, whatever it is.

00:47:00.269 --> 00:47:02.560
I'd imagine there's probably
some people you approached

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.840
that didn't go as well.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.033
And I'm curious, how did
you approach that situation?

00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:08.540
How did you overcome that?

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.980
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.032
Thank you.

00:47:11.032 --> 00:47:12.860
Well, I did.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.080
This is funny.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.340
Sam and Steven-- so
Steven's obviously not here.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.410
So he's the person who--
that didn't go that way.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.270
So I called both of them.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.280
I tried Steven once,
he didn't answer.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.470
I think I left a voice--
I left him a voicemail.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.150
And I think I waited a couple
weeks and I tried again.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.010
And he picked up the phone, and
he didn't say hello, he just

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.539
said to me, I don't
know why you're calling.

00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:38.205
I don't want to know
why you're calling.

00:47:38.205 --> 00:47:40.600
And I don't want
you to try again.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.970
And he hung up.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.460
And I respected it.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.930
I was proud of
myself for doing it.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.530
I had the same apology
that I gave Sam.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.147
That's why I was calling.

00:47:51.147 --> 00:47:52.730
But I have to respect
people's wishes.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.650
And I gave him that space.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.050
And we have never spoken since.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.040
And then Sam returned
my phone call.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.070
And we had this incredible
conversation that

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.422
led to us being here today.

00:48:04.422 --> 00:48:05.880
AUDIENCE: If I can
ask a follow up.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.380
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.920
AUDIENCE: You talked about when
you called your old therapist

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.770
and he called you back.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.020
And you saw his number, and
you don't want to pick up.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.900
Sam, when you saw his number
come up, what did you do

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.740
and what was your response?

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.180
SAM MINER: It was totally fine.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.410
It was like just
another call from you.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.580
I think I called him back
as soon as I had a chance.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.570
And one of our mutual
friends, David [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:33.110
sent me this text of Matt
on CNN, so when Matt called,

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.690
I was like, congratulations.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.220
I saw you on TV.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:36.743
MATTHEW SHURKA: This
is the weirdest moment

00:48:36.743 --> 00:48:37.010
in the phone call.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.580
SAM MINER: And that's how the
conversation just started.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.340
I mean, I never like--
yes, I didn't like Matt,

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:46.690
but it was for silly reasons.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.885
And I was just so past it.

00:48:47.885 --> 00:48:49.260
MATTHEW SHURKA:
But why did you--

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.370
And now I have a question.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.799
Why did you think I was calling?

00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:53.840
SAM MINER: I had no idea.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.230
MATTHEW SHURKA: It
was nine years later.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.820
SAM MINER: I didn't
think about it.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.440
MATTHEW SHURKA: OK.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.800
You were just making--
you're making juice.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.050
SAM MINER: I was making juice.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.700
Yeah.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.450
I was like, what
does he have to say?

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:09.453
I want to hear him out.

00:49:09.453 --> 00:49:11.768
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:11.768 --> 00:49:13.160
MATTHEW SHURKA: Hey.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.380
AUDIENCE: So I grew
up in South Florida

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.850
in an area that seems very
similar to you, Great Neck, so

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.460
a lot of Israelis, Jewish.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.940
Wondering how much
of this do you think

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.597
is driven from the fact
that your father is Israeli?

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:28.430
Versus potentially the
fact that you may not

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:30.779
have had a bunch of
friends who are gay, who

00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:32.070
are going through this as well?

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:38.190
Because one of my closest
friends, when I was growing up,

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.050
I personally think he's
gay, but he never came out.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:45.922
He's married, he-- I think
has a pretty bad marriage.

00:49:45.922 --> 00:49:48.130
And I think he's never come
out because his father is

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.640
like a extremely
staunch Israeli.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.870
And just wondering--

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.070
MATTHEW SHURKA: I'm relating
to you, so this is why--

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.970
MATTHEW SHURKA: --I'm smiling.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.270
AUDIENCE: I'm just
trying to understand

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.375
what the drivers were, and if
you think that it was leaning

00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:00.250
one way or the other.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.140
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.230
It's definitely an impact.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.540
Culture does have an impact.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.840
So first, my father is
Israeli, Iranian, Jew.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.223
So that makes it that
much harder for him.

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:17.640
I actually don't come from
a very religious home.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.300
I was raised traditional,
almost secular,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.980
but we did every holiday, we
celebrated Shabbat dinners

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.840
every Friday, but it was
really out of tradition.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.820
And my father was
this businessman.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.850
And he just saw no
possibility of me

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:33.854
succeeding at all in
life, even though there's

00:50:33.854 --> 00:50:35.270
an overwhelming
amount of evidence

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:39.410
that people can be openly gay
and succeed in their careers.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.480
He just felt like--
my father hustled.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.990
He's pretty much
an entrepreneur.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.590
Didn't have an education,
and he succeeded.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.600
And he felt like, there's no
way you're going to succeed.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.070
And if this is
just in your head,

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:52.720
I'm going to help
you get rid of it.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.710
And that was just
what he thought.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:58.290
He still sort of thinks that.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.250
I took the position to
love and accept him exactly

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.100
the way he is, and
that's really helped.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.274
We have differences, but
I don't let that interfere

00:51:07.274 --> 00:51:08.190
with the relationship.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.080
And it's conversations.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.140
For your friend, who knows?

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.430
That might really be
possible that he's

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.050
afraid of not being
loved and accepted

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.779
within his own family,
which is really

00:51:19.779 --> 00:51:21.820
what the root of what the
whole talk is, is we're

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.930
looking for that.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.130
And we may be
scared to come out,

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.920
because we don't even want to
know that we won't be loved

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.650
and accepted.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:32.016
He knows he's loved
and accepted so far.

00:51:32.016 --> 00:51:37.340
For you as a friend to him, the
advice I can offer you is just

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.700
love him every way he
is, and support him.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:46.040
And being in this work,
I meet so many people who

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.574
are closeted or on the fence.

00:51:48.574 --> 00:51:49.990
Something I keep
dealing with is I

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.771
keep dating guys who
are on the fence.

00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:54.020
This is something that has
been a pattern that I still

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.740
haven't gotten rid of.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.770
And it's sort of like,
I see how clear it is,

00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.770
because of the field I'm
in and the world I came

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.145
from being in
conversion therapy.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.550
Something like I always say,
you know, I can't pee for you.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.790
And people just have to be
able to do it on their own,

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.950
if they ever choose to.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.950
If they want to have their
full self-expression,

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:15.980
have their authenticity
to who they are.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.670
And as a friend,
just no matter what,

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.180
love and knowledge
and support them.

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.820
If he's married,
love him that way.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.950
If he chooses to come
out, love him that way.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:29.159
Because he'll know that he's
in a safe space with you.

00:52:29.159 --> 00:52:30.487
Yeah.

00:52:30.487 --> 00:52:30.987
Thank you.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.376
Yeah, hey.

00:52:35.376 --> 00:52:36.750
AUDIENCE: What
advice do you have

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.836
for people who are-- gay
men who are dating someone

00:52:39.836 --> 00:52:42.210
who has been through a traumatic
experience or conversion

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:42.709
therapy?

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.705
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah, what's
the advice for gay men

00:52:50.705 --> 00:52:53.080
who are dating someone else
who's been through conversion

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.710
therapy?

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.950
AUDIENCE: No, like someone who
has not dating someone who is.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.240
So if you could tell your
partners, if something

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.505
you wish they would know or do.

00:53:03.505 --> 00:53:06.130
MATTHEW SHURKA: So just to make
sure I understand the question.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.270
Let's say I'm a
person who did not

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.290
go through conversion therapy
but I'm dating someone who has.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:10.010
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.759
What advice do you
have for yourself then?

00:53:14.007 --> 00:53:15.673
MATTHEW SHURKA: That's
a great question.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.750
It also depends where the
person is along their journey,

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.800
because what we're seeing with
conversion-- former conversion

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.890
therapy patients-- it
becomes a lifelong challenge.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.540
Especially for minors
who were in it,

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.910
there's a pattern of they
keep putting themselves back

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:36.970
into conversion therapy
because they believe

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.480
they failed the therapy.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.440
I was one of them.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.960
I put my-- at 19, my mother
and father were not in my life,

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.470
and I put myself back
into conversion therapy,

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.370
because I didn't
try hard enough.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.650
And conversion therapists
will tell you that, too.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.040
So there is so much that they
go through, even in the years

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.510
after.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.240
I guess my advice
is really listen,

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.810
get where they're at,
what are they comfortable

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:05.060
with, what are they
not comfortable with.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:10.755
And just so you can
be on their page.

00:54:10.755 --> 00:54:11.880
So you know where they are.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.562
You know what to expect.

00:54:14.562 --> 00:54:16.270
If they're being-- if
they're telling you

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.140
that they were in
conversion therapy

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.400
and they're being open
with you enough about it,

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.944
and there's things that--
it sounds like-- I'm not

00:54:21.944 --> 00:54:23.860
sure exactly what the
problem is specifically,

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:28.680
but there's a lot of--
one common thing is shame.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.712
And when I came out of the
closet, I was not proud.

00:54:31.712 --> 00:54:33.420
I came out not proud,
because I was like,

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.990
what if I made a mistake?

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:36.540
What if I want to go back
into conversion therapy?

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.540
What if I still want to
try and be heterosexual?

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.540
And I was out.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.690
And it took about--
it took months,

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.470
and there was
specific people I met

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:48.630
who, I got like, I'm actually
great exactly the way I am,

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.260
and I can be proud of being gay.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.090
So I really-- I think if you're
in a relationship with someone

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.120
who's been through
conversion therapy,

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.070
really want to listen to
them, hear where they're at.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:02.685
And if you are
obviously willing to be

00:55:02.685 --> 00:55:05.310
in that relationship with them,
and go through whatever they're

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.430
going through, just want
to love and support them

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:08.895
wherever they are.

00:55:08.895 --> 00:55:10.770
And get to know what
your ex-- what to expect

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.160
and what not to expect.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.350
And be good with it.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.210
MATTHEW SHURKA:
[? Cat, Cat, Cat. ?]

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:20.796
SPEAKER 1: Hi, do I know you?

00:55:20.796 --> 00:55:22.170
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.700
So you said something
universal for me,

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.340
in when you came
out to your father.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.230
And how he was like, I love
you, I'm there for you.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.320
And then you went through
what you went through

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.860
in conversion therapy.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.310
And it really struck me,
because when I came out

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.300
to my parents-- and Mathew and
I, we're two different people.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.900
I identify as a lesbian.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.260
I come from a family
of-- a Hispanic family,

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.090
very Catholic, very religious.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.520
And my mom said the same thing.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.930
She was the first
person I came out to.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.850
And what was there was love
and acceptance immediately.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:03.817
And I think that's always
there, especially with that bond

00:56:03.817 --> 00:56:04.400
with a parent.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.780
What's there is always
love and acceptance.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.000
But the next day, they sat
me down and I was like, oh,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.200
my god, why am I in trouble?

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.590
We had a little fireplace,
and they sat me down.

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:17.250
And they immediately wanted
me to stop hanging out

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.720
with my gay friends.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.059
Like almost, what's the
source of the gayness?

00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:22.100
Where's this coming from?

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.016
How is this happening?

00:56:23.016 --> 00:56:25.620
It's like, oh, she's hanging
out with these gay friends.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.580
They're a bad influence on her.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.880
We have to bring
her back to church.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.580
Maybe she needs to go
to military school.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:36.820
And then started suppressing
my expression as well,

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.190
in the sense of I wasn't
allowed to wear certain things.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.250
I wasn't allowed to
have my hair short.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.620
And I know it wasn't
from a place of hate.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.410
I know it was all
from a place of love.

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.550
And then I look at what's
going on in the country.

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:56.350
We have made so much progress
in the sense of LGBTQ rights.

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:59.870
And at the same time, too,
with this love and acceptance,

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:05.250
there comes this uprising
of discrimination laws

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.600
for different people.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.420
And I almost wonder,
what do you think

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.970
is the source of that shame?

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:14.110
And how can we
impact the country

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.340
to really transform that
conversation for people

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.980
so we can impact it
on a larger level?

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.230
MATTHEW SHURKA: Yeah.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.080
That's so great.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.870
I think the biggest thing is
people sharing their stories.

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:33.440
Yes, we are passing laws,
and laws are very effective.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.240
Yet it's not the thing that
shifts the public opinion

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.700
of a country.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.910
Right now, what we're
seeing in North Carolina,

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.500
we're seeing in several
states about gay marriage,

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.050
there's a huge opposition to
our conversion therapy bills

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:50.020
that we're working to pass.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.160
And just because
there's a law in place

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.230
doesn't mean the hearts and
minds-- the mind of hearts

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:58.120
have changed.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.720
If I said that correctly.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.580
And I think when people share
their stories, share openly

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.480
and authentically,
that's when people

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.260
get to relate to each other.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.980
And that's what I
think what really

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.320
needs to be out there more.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.590
You know, we're having a
conversation about bathrooms,

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.300
but where's the humanity in it?

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:22.544
And that's what I think needs--
what's so great what we're

00:58:22.544 --> 00:58:24.210
doing here at Google
is there's a-- it's

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.549
a month-long series of
talks of people sharing.

00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:29.090
Those are some of the strongest
and effective ways for people

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:30.260
to relate to each other.

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.810
[INAUDIBLE] we go through.

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:33.960
I come from a
conservative family.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:39.060
And conversion therapy
broke my family apart.

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:43.560
When I tell that to Republicans,
that really touches them,

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.790
because they are all
about the American family

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:47.470
and the values of that.

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:50.732
Where, as a simple example.

00:58:50.732 --> 00:58:52.690
You know, that's when it
gets really political.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.000
What are those key points?

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.310
But I really think
the biggest things

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.330
is the storysharing,
people sharing themselves

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:00.180
authentically.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.766
And that will also have laws
move along and move faster,

00:59:03.766 --> 00:59:06.140
because people will start to
be compassionate, and relate

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.330
to them, and get the
importance of all those bills.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.280
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it's
interesting, too,

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:17.059
because I remember I had
a mentor in high school

00:59:17.059 --> 00:59:19.100
when I came out, because
I was going through what

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.590
I was going through.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.420
And he said, you know,
I come out every day.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.040
I don't come out
once, and that's it.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.530
I come out every day.

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:29.300
And I feel like that's
where a lot of us are, too.

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.940
We come out every
single day, just so we

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.500
can forward this conversation.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.030
So thank you.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:37.560
I want to also just
thank you for forwarding

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.490
that conversation of
love and acceptance.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.760
I know we that conversation
with that, so thank you.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.680
Forwarding the source.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.359
Just getting to the root of it.

00:59:46.359 --> 00:59:47.900
MATTHEW SHURKA:

you so much for having us.

you from all of us.

Thank you.
