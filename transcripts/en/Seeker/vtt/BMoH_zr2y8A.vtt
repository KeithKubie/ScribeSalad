00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.710
Recently, SpaceX announced its plan to provide
better Internet to people around the world

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.849
with a constellation of 4,425 broadband satellites
between 2019 and 2024.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.759
They’ll orbit in 83 different planes closer
to Earth than most existing communications

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:16.759
satellites.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:17.759
And SpaceX isn’t stopping there.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.900
Looking ahead, the company hopes to add another
7,500 satellites in even lower orbits for

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.780
faster signals in heavily populated areas.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.920
That all sounds great.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
But how can we just put almost 12,000 more
satellites into orbit?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.230
Space seems infinite, but there’s a lot
of stuff already up there.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.810
The key to adding new satellites is that they
don’t all go in the same place…

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.060
Some satellites are in a High Earth Orbit,
about 22,000 miles above the planet.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.170
This is a sweet spot for geosynchronous satellites;
they orbit the Earth once per day so seem

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.829
to hover above one point on Earth, a great
location for weather monitoring and communications

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.829
satellites.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.319
Closer to home are Medium Earth Orbit satellites,
some 12,500 miles above the Earth’s surface.

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.050
Orbits here are consistent and dependable
making this an ideal region for GPS satellites.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.920
And lastly we have satellites in Low Earth
Orbit, the area between 100 and 1,200 miles

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.240
above the planet.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.241
These satellites are in circular orbits that
vary depending on the mission needs, and this

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:15.030
is also where the International Space Station
and Hubble Space Telescope orbit.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020
It's the easiest region to get to, so a pretty
popular one.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.921
Currently, there are about 1,200 operational
satellites in orbit.

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.921
About half of these satellites are scattered
throughout Medium Earth Orbit and High Earth

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:22.921
Orbit and the remaining half are in Low-Earth
Orbit… the same region SpaceX is eyeing…

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:24.420
and SpaceX wants to add more than ten times
that much!

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
But it’s not like SpaceX will throw them
up pell mell.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.780
Satellites are launched into orbits deigned
not to interfere with other satellites.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.000
And satellites in the same orbit all have
the same orbital velocity -- meaning they

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
orbit at the same speed and aren’t likely
to hit each other.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.200
It’s like a team of people driving laps
in go karts.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.560
You can’t just join in and change speeds,
you have to find a gap and match their pace.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.409
But satellites aren't the only thing up there.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.600
There’s a LOT of junk from dead satellites
to spent rocket stages and discarded fairings.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.549
And every launch creates space junk.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.990
We’ve seen over 5,000 launches since the
space age began in 1957, and that’s created

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.740
over 20,000 piece of space junk bigger than
a softball!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.439
We can track a lot of that, but there are
little bits and pieces that we can’t keep

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.620
tabs on… dust from solid rocket motors,
coolant from old Russian nuclear-powered satellite,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.360
even flecks of paint as small as a grain of
sand.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.390
And those tiny things can pack a punch, that
one fleck of paint can hit a satellite with

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.110
as much force as a 550 pound object traveling
at 60 miles per hour!

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.510
Not all satellites can avoid this debris,
but some, like the ISS, have to dodge that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.510
junk.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.120
So SpaceX’s proposed new constellation of
satellites will give us better broadband,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.030
but it’s also going to clog up LEO that
much more, and make it that much harder not

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.950
only to send satellites into safe orbits,
but it’s going to get that much more hazardous

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.409
for manned missions to fly through that growing
debris field to other planets.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.409
Can you imagine being up in space and seeing
random debris float by outside?!

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.819
That’d be an experience, and speaking of,
did you know we have a sister channel called

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.819
Seeker VR?

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.230
It’s everything you love about Seeker, but
in 360 degrees!

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.400
SeekerVR will take you on some incredible
journeys that you probably wouldn’t get

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
to experience otherwise.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.099
Like in a recent episode, we took a ride on
one of the most deadly trains in the world.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.580
Check it out here.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.420
And speaking of space junk, the oldest dead
satellite up there is Vanguard 1, launched

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.420
in 1958.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.700
If you’re curious about that era, check
out this video from my own channel, Vintage

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700
Space.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.880
What do you guys think about all this space
junk?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.500
