00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.660
If you’re not so good with money, you should
try holding on to your cash.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.440
Hello Scrooges, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.360
If you’re like me, you’re bad with money.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360
Nerdy T-shirt?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360
I need it.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
Steam Summer sale?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360
Wallet armageddon.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.220
Something that even vaguely references Futurama?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.000
“Shut up and take my money!”

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.680
If I could just stop burning through all the
sweet sweet internet cash I’m making, I’d

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.460
be a hundredaire by now.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.439
Luckily for me there might be a way to curb
my spending sprees, and it’s as simple as

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.730
switching from credit cards to cash.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.590
Not because you can’t pay with cash online
or because cash purchases don’t charge an

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.400
interest rate, though I’m sure those both
help.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.050
At an even more fundamental level, it’s
just harder to part with money that you are

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250
physically holding in your hand than it is
to swipe a card and sign the receipt.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.510
This idea that we spend more based on the
form of payment has a few studies to back

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.510
it up.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.790
One from MIT in 2001 auctioned off tickets
to a sold out basketball game.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.640
Students who showed interest in the tickets
were given a worksheet that asked how much

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.140
they were willing to pay.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
Unbeknownst to the participants, the researchers
handed out two different worksheets at random.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
One stipulated that the payment had to be
in cash, the other required the student to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.890
pay with a credit card.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.220
The result was the average credit card bid
was over twice as high as the average cash

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.220
bid.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.280
Another series of studies published in the
Journal of Consumer Research in 2015 examined

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.550
how attached we are to our purchases based
on how we payed.,6 In one of the studies,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.420
participants had to buy a $2 mug, half had
to pay in cash and the other half had to buy

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.540
it with plastic.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.920
Later when they were asked to sell the mug
back, the people who paid in cash wanted $3

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.010
more on average for a mug that didn’t even
cost that.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.200
Another study didn’t even have the participants
use their own money; they were either given

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.930
a $5 bill or a $5 voucher and had to donate
it to one of three charities they had never

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.930
heard of.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.460
Even though it wasn’t their own money, cash
donors reported a stronger connection to their

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.720
chosen charity.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.640
So we’re less invested in our purchases
when we pay with a credit card, and we’re

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.020
even more laissez faire when we don’t think
of our money as money.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.760
Some industries are aware of this, and have
explicitly designed ways to put more mental

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.860
distance between you and your money.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.680
If you’re a gamer, you know what I’m talking
about.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960
Many games, particularly the “free to play”
mobile games, have a premium currency system

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.590
in place where you pay real money to buy fake
money to buy fake things.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.730
Of course you probably think that you’d
never stoop to paying for this free game;

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.940
you’re going to play for free forever!

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
That’s why the game makers design a point
where the game gets much harder to play unless

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.020
you pay up.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.780
It’s called “the pinch,” and 1.9% of
the time it works every time.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.950
That’s the percentage of players of “free”
games who decide to make in-app purchase in

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.950
a month.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.610
It’s not just free games though, as now
some Triple A titles also have in-game currency

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.870
for purchase that takes the effort out of
unlocking rewards *cough* Helix Credits *cough*.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.520
So you can spend $60 on a game, and then another
$100 so you don’t have to play the game.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.010
A lot of gamers bemoan in-game purchases as
the latest plague of gaming, but as development

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.170
costs rise, it’s a viable strategy for developers
to recoup their investments.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.710
And it works because the foggier the connection
is between what we’re buying and it’s

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.510
real cost, the more likely we are to be OK
with spending our money.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.810
Apparently a good way to save your cash is
to literally hold on to it.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.709
But is your money icky?

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:25.100
Anthony tries to figure out just where your
money’s been here.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.410
Do you notice you spend more freely when you
use a credit card, or are you frugal either

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.410
way?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.180
