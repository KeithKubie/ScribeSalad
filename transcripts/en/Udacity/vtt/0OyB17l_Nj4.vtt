00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now comes the tricky question. In the Kalman filter program that we studied,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the 2-D Kalman filter, we had a matrix F.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And for delta T equals 0.1, our F matrix, the state transition matrix,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
had a main diagonal of 1, which means in exportation our location stays the same

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and our velocity stays the same. And we also knew

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that the velocity affected our state in the following way.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And you could now place 0.1 instead of the delta T

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to get this specific F matrix.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now I want to know from you for this new 2-D case with a 4-dimensional state vector

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what is the new F? It is a 4 by 4 matrix, so I want you to fill in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
all of those values. Again please assume that delta T is 0.1,

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and don't write delta T, write 0.1.
