00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.429
Chances are the relationship between
you and your editor will be a long one,

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:07.730
and like with any good relationship, you
need to work on it and invest early on.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.620
If you don't, you'll frustrate each
other and things get complicated.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.070
In the first couple of days of using it,
try on lots of built-in shortcuts and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310
features, even if they seem overkill.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.770
Try them all out and observe yourself.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.170
Which shortcuts stick?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.610
Which do you have to
force yourself to use?

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.700
You'll get a pretty good feel for
what matters.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.868
But let James give you a quick
little glimpse of the little tricks

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:30.400
he likes best.
