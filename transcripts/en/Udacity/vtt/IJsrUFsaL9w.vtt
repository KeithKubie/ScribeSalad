00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.230
Here it is. H of x equals 5 to the x. But what points lie on this function?

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.998
Let's figure it out. Here's a table for you to fill out, so that we can

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:12.920
organize this information well. However, in order to do this, you're probably

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.842
going to need to use a calculator. Since the numbers are going to get really

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:22.284
big, really fast. If you don't own a calculator, it's easy to find one online

00:00:22.284 --> 00:00:26.872
by searching for scientific calculator. And if you do have your own scientific

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:31.340
calculator. It should have a button that makes evaluating exponential functions

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.286
very simple. In fact, Google makes a calculator that's very easy to find and

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:41.079
very easy to use. Here it is. It comes up right when you search scientific

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.479
calculator on Google. This is what I'll be using today to do our calculations.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.010
As you can see, this calculator has a button that says x to the y on it. Now if

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.612
I want to calculate six to the third power, for example, I would press 6. Then

00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.626
I would press x to the y. And then I would press three. You can see that the

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:05.941
calculator is showing us 6 to the 3rd. When I press equals, that gives me the

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:10.520
number that's equal to, which is 216. Let's try another one. Maybe I want to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.474
find four to the negative fifth. Well, I press four, then our lovely x to the y

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:20.046
button, and then I type negative 5. Great, I see 4 to the negative 5th, which

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.926
is what we're looking for. Pressing Enter tells me that it's this long

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:28.506
exponent. Let's practice using that button on our calculator to find different

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:33.190
points on this function. For each value of x, I've written here, please fill in

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.316
the corresponding value of h of x. In other words find 5 to the x for each of

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:40.090
these x values.
