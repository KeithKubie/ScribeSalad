00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
PROFESSOR: So we've seen
that partial orders are

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.170
a set of axioms that capture
the positive path relation

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.740
or the arbitrary path relation
in directed acyclic graphs,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.730
or DAGs.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.870
But there's still another way
to understand these axioms

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.500
that gives a kind
of representation

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.200
theorem for the kind
of mathematical objects

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.250
that are partial orders and that
every partial order looks like.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.250
So let's look at that example.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.540
I'm interested in the
proper subset relation.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.570
A is a proper subset of
B, which, you remember,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.150
means that B has everything
in it that A has and something

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.950
extra.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.180
So in particular, since
B has something extra,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.590
B is not a subset
of A, certainly not

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.940
a proper subset of A.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.840
So let's look at
an example of that.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
Here are seven
sets, and the arrows

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.000
indicate the proper
subset relation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.080
Or more precisely, the positive
path relation in this graph

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.380
represents the proper
subset relation

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.670
where edges are understood
to be pointing upwards.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.209
So I've left out the arrowheads.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.510
This is also known
as a Hasse diagram,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.140
where the height
is an indication

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200
of which way the arrows go.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.990
So if arrows are
pointing up, this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.410
is telling me that, for example,
this set of two elements,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.200
1 and 5, because there's
a path up to the top set,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.380
the top set has everything
that this lower set has.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.080
Namely the top set has 1 and
5, and it's got extra stuff.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.390
The set consisting of just 1
is a proper subset of 1 and 5

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.290
because the set has 1 in it,
but it has an extra thing, 5.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.590
And also, there's a
path from 1 up to 1,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.190
2, 5, 10 because 1, 2, 5, 10
has a 1 in it and extra stuff.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.690
So that's what the
picture is illustrating,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.660
the proper subset relation
on this particular collection

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.360
of seven sets.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.770
Now, let's look at a
very similar example

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.930
of the proper divides
relation on some number.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.140
So proper divides
means a properly

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.220
divides b if a divides b
and it's not equal to b.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.740
And I'm interested in the
proper divides relation

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.120
on this set of seven numbers,
1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.080
And now there's a path from 5 to
30 because 5 is a divisor of 30

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.270
and it's not equal to 30.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.050
It's a proper divisor of 30.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.070
And of course, the
point of this picture

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.930
is to show that the proper
divides relation on these seven

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.700
numbers has exactly the same
shape as the proper subset

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.860
relation on those seven sets.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.960
So there's the seven sets and
their proper subset relation

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.810
shown by the picture followed
by the proper divides relation

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.840
on this set of seven numbers.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.064
And the precise notion
or sense in which

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.480
these things have
the same shape--

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.650
obviously they can be drawn and
one superimposed on the other.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.840
But abstractly what we care
about with partial orders

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.010
and digraphs in
general is when things

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.152
are isomorphic-- is
the technical name

00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:03.860
for the same shape--
and isomorphic means

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.600
that all we care about
are the connections

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.410
between corresponding vertices.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.410
Two graphs where the
vertices correspond in a way

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.935
that where there's a
connection between two vertices

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:18.060
there's also a connection
between the corresponding

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610
vertices are isomorphic.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.930
And the precise
definition of isomorphic

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.890
is that they're
isomorphic when there's

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.090
an edge-preserving matching
between their vertices.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.210
Matching means bijection.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.680
And the formal definition is G1
is isomorphic to G2 if and only

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.710
if there's a bijection from
V1, the vertices of G1,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.840
to V2, the vertices of G2, with
the property that if there's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.170
an edge between two vertices u
and v in the first graph, then

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.100
there's an edge between the
corresponding two vertices

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.750
f of u and f of v
in the second graph.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.790
And that's an if and
only if relation.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.140
There's an edge between f
of u and f of v if and only

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.670
if there's an edge between u
and v in the original graph.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.640
And that's the
official definition

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.150
of isomorphism for digraphs.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.020
And the theorem
that we illustrated

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.120
with that example of proper
divides and proper subset

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.709
is that, in fact, every
strict partial order

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.620
is isomorphic to some collection
of subsets partially ordered by

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.440
less than.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.660
So this is a kind of a
representation theorem.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.190
If you want to know what kinds
of things are partial orders,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.260
the answer is that a
strict partial order

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.920
is something that looks
like a bunch of sets

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.780
under containment.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.430
It's isomorphic to a bunch
of sets under containment.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.600
And the proof, actually, of
this is quite straightforward.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.000
What I'm going to do to find
an isomorphism is you give me

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.150
your arbitrary strict
partial order R,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.700
and I'm going to map an
element a in the domain of R

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.560
to the set of all of
the elements that are,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.090
quote, "below it," that is,
all of the elements that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.010
are related to R.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.310
So a is going to map
to the set of b's such

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.795
that bRa or b is equal to a.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:09.720
And that is added for
a technical condition.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.630
Remember, R restrict, so a
is not related to a under R.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.620
But I want it to be
in the set that a maps

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.360
to, so I'm throwing that in.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.470
Another way to say this
is that the mapping f of a

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.135
is equal to R
inverse of a union a.

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:29.650
And let's just illustrate
that by the example of,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.410
how do you turn the divides
relation into the subset

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.140
relation?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.360
Well, the smallest element
in the proper divides example

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.990
was the number 1, and
I'm going to map it

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.540
to the set consisting
of 1, which

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.580
is all of the elements that
properly divide 1 along with 1.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.680
And then I'm going
to map the number

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.650
3 to all of the elements that
properly divide 3 along with 3,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.300
and that is 1 and 3.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.640
5 maps to 1 and 5.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.460
2 maps to 1 and 2.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.370
And at the next level,
I'm going to map 15

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.710
to all of the
numbers that properly

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.800
divide 15 along with 15.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.420
So 1, 3, 5, and 15 are
what the number 15 maps to.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.870
That's a set.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.160
Likewise, 10 maps to 1,
2, 5, 15, and 30 maps

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.020
to all of the numbers that are
below it, including itself.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.150
And this is the general
illustration of the way

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.720
that you take an arbitrary
strict partial order and map

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.610
elements into sets, which are
basically their inverse images

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.080
under the relation.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.820
And the sets have exactly
the same structure

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.010
under proper containment
as the relation.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.630
So this is, again, a
representation theorem

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.810
that tells us that if we want
to understand partial orders,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.100
they are doing nothing more
than talking about relations

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.110
with the same structure as
the proper subset relation

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.870
on some collection of sets.
