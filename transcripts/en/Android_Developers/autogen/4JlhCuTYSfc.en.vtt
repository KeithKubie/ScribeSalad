user says talk to coding fortune cookie

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:15.950
user says talk to coding fortune cookie
 

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.760
user says talk to coding fortune cookie
then the Google assistant will connect

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:18.770
then the Google assistant will connect
 

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:23.680
then the Google assistant will connect
the user to my service the next step is

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:23.690
the user to my service the next step is
 

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.799
the user to my service the next step is
dialogues so once the user is connected

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:26.809
dialogues so once the user is connected
 

00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:30.340
dialogues so once the user is connected
to my service how do I talk to them what

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:30.350

are valid responses what are invalid
responses in this case I'm going to make

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:40.309
responses in this case I'm going to make
 

00:32:40.309 --> 00:32:43.080
responses in this case I'm going to make
you a simple question

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.090
you a simple question
 

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.510

responses in this case so let's suppose

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.130
responses in this case so let's suppose
 

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.180
responses in this case so let's suppose
that the user picked Java now we can

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:55.190
that the user picked Java now we can
 

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.700
that the user picked Java now we can
move on to third third step which is

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:57.710
move on to third third step which is
 

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:02.290
