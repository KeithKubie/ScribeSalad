ELIZABETH CHOE: Today is the
end of day four, it's Thursday.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.120
Today is the day
that I'm feeling

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.000
the class sort of catching
up to my general well-being.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.530
So today's the day that
has made me empathize

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.250
a lot with professors.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.690
And it's made me think of
how the entire infrastructure

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.770
of teaching roles was
created in the first place.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.390
It actually doesn't seem
very intuitive to me

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.240
to pair a researcher
and an instructor

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.130
and put it together
in the same role,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.200
because they're really
different people.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.300
I'm really sensing a lot of
trepidation and hesitation

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.450
in just trying creative ideas,
which I completely relate to.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.940
But it's just so
incredibly striking to me

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.280
how everyone has this
mentality-- and not

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.290
just students in this class,
but every single student I've

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.360
worked with for
Science Out Loud--

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.600
that you have to measure 20,
30 times before you cut once,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.140
and that as long as you
measure 20, 30 times,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990
you only have to cut once.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.090
But the whole paradigm for
this production process

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.760
is almost the opposite.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.435
You measure like three or four
times, and you cut 20 times.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.790
You come up with like five
ideas and you write 20 scripts.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.190
And there's just this
crippling hesitation,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.760
this overwhelming
paralysis to just attempt

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.000
to write a script
that is so pervasive

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.490
through every single
student I've worked with,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.980
including myself.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.480
I'm also realizing that the
thing that students need

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.020
is concrete
examples, that people

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.030
can recognize big
concepts and not

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.540
be able to implement them
themselves successfully.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.070
It takes a lot to become
self aware of your work,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.010
essentially.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.830
But I think today was good
because it gave the students

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.100
a chance to look at a script
that was written and storyboard

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.710
it and sort of unpack
what about it worked

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.950
and what didn't, and
sort of tie the bigger

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.070
concepts that we've been talking
about into a concrete example.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.940
The next step that
they need to make

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.140
is being able to implement
that into their own work.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.200
So we have the concepts
that we've established,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.140
we give examples of what sort
of fit into those concepts

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.860
and what don't, and
then there needs

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.860
to be a third level of using
their work specifically,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.160
to explain if their work fits
into those concepts or not.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.390
I feel like each day
goes by so quickly,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.880
but it's like a massive
amount of time that's passed.
