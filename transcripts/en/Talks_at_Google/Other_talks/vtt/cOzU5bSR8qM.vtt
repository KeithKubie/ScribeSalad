ADAM QUAYLE: Thanks
for coming, everyone.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.610
I'm Adam Quayle, and
I'm really excited to be

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.750
hosting Ashanti Branch today.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.310
Ashanti is a lot of things.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.780
He's the founder and
executive director

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.760
of the Ever Forward Club,
which we'll learn about today.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.420
He's also an education fellow
at the Stanford d.school.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.760
And he's also assistant
principal at Montero Middle

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.880
School in the East Bay.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.960
And so today Ashanti
is going to take us

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840
through the Taking
Off the Mask exercise.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.410
So I hope you're all
ready to get really

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.440
real with your
coworkers, because it's

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.960
going to get real in here.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.610
And then we're going to learn
a little bit about how the Ever

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.914
Forward Club is helping young
men in the East Bay and beyond.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.830
And you'll hear from
some of the students that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.410
have benefit directly from it.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.800
So with that I'd love to
welcome Ashanti Branch.

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:00.505
ASHANTI BRANCH: Good afternoon.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.990
So Adam probably made you a
little nervous when he's like,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.375
are you ready to get
real with your coworkers?

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.250
I think that when we
talk about getting real,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.160
sometimes that's a very--
it means different things

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.100
to different people.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.270
So we're not going
to start there.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.760
I'm gonna start by getting
really real with you about me.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.970
So I'm more nervous than usual
because my mom's in the room.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.954
And she's never heard
me present before.

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:32.870
I don't know if she's
ever watched me present,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.100
but I know she's never
been to one of my talks--

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710
at least my new talk.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.680
And I talk a lot about her.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800
So this morning I
was like, oh, man.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.305
How do I change that talk?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.530
How do I not say
all the stuff I say?

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:51.440
And I had to call her
yesterday for help.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.470
I had to call her
yesterday for help.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.330
As an adult man,
I had to call her

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.240
because I didn't have
enough drivers to get

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.420
all the young men
here, and so I had

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.520
to ask her for help yesterday.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.505
And she said, OK.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:07.130
And so I said, well, why would
I change the talk to try and not

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
talk about her when the reason
I'm standing here alive, free,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.728
educated is because of her?

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.530
Of her sacrifice?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.450
My father died three
months before I was born.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.629
His father died three
months before he died.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.170
So six months leading
up to my birth,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.510
I lost both my
grandfather and my father,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.890
and no one gave me a
choice in the matter.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.500
I just showed up
here on the Earth,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.280
out of Bates hospital, popped
out, and there was problems.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.430
Like, if you handed me
a checklist in the womb,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.346
and I had a choice, I
would have chosen things

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:48.540
that looked pretty different.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.050
Like I would have chosen
to have two parents,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.480
to maybe live in a house.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.450
To maybe live in a community
where being smart was OK.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.330
Or like being your best wasn't
like making other people feel

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.220
bad, but being your
best was absolutely--

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.110
people were pushing you to
be better than your best.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.926
But I didn't get that, either.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.810
So I grew up in
Oakland, California.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.560
I knew there were
certain ways I had

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.640
to behave and act that would
give me either respect, or not.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.310
And there was a very
short list of what

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.180
it meant to be a
man-- a boy growing

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.825
into be a man-- in
Oakland, where I grew up.

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:27.700
Like when you're a boy,
you have to be a man.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.460
Like they're
telling you, man up.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.840
Be tough.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.365
Don't show no emotions.

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:38.410
Can you imagine my first
day of fourth grade,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.690
showing up at a
new school, excited

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.390
to be in this new
school in the hills.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.770
It was incredible.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.360
There was no apartments
around there.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.310
It was all houses.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.550
It was beautiful.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.460
I had a fight my first
day of fourth grade

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.410
because a guy was like,
we're playing tag.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.070
Fourth graders play tag, right?

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.940
We're playing tag.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.621
He tags me.

00:03:57.621 --> 00:03:58.121
I said, OK.

00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:58.621
I'm in.

00:03:58.621 --> 00:03:59.770
You should be running.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.012
But he tags me again.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:03.470
I said, why do you
keep tagging me?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.922
I'm already it.

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:08.130
He tags me again, and I
realized he's not tagging me.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.380
He's hitting me.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.890
Now, I also know certain rules.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.870
At fourth grade, I
already know that if I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.020
let this keep
happening-- this is

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.910
in the moment of a
couple of seconds.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.970
I'm processing.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.750
If I let this keep happening,
everybody at this new school

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.887
is going to think they
could be hitting me.

00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:25.720
I don't wanna fight.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.740
I don't even like to fight.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.960
But in that moment, I knew
that something had to happen.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.400
I can either take it and
then be a victim the rest

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.270
of these years in
elementary school,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.804
or I could do
something about it.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.450
If you're not the kind of person
who really likes fighting,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.340
that's a hard decision.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.740
I was raised by my mother.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.160
She taught me to be really nice.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.280
But nice doesn't work so
well on the playground

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.300
for a young, black boy
growing up in Oakland.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.120
Being kind and being
gentle doesn't really

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.640
help you be looked at as
somebody who people were

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.150
like, man, he's incredible.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.792
Actually, it makes
you look weak, soft.

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:12.250
They call you many
names that would

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.050
fit in the soft/weak category.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.850
They're usually
not very positive.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.740
And so I was so thankful
that, throughout elementary,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.360
you're only in a class with
maybe 25 people, so being smart

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.000
is kind of OK.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.042
You can kind of be smart
with those 25 people.

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:30.850
Not too many people bother you.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.740
But when you get
to middle school,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.770
it's a whole other
world, because you've

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.130
got 180 kids you got to
deal with, six classes.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.262
You gotta be in PE.

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:37.720
You gotta be in
and out of classes.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.680
You gotta shift your
behavior so many times a day.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.740
And I learned that
smart wasn't cool.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.620
So even though I maybe,
in my back of my mind,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.576
though I was smart, that
was not what I was showing.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:54.700
Now, for me, math was easy.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.531
So I could do math.

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.030
We played a lot of math games
at my house, so math was easy.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.650
So I was passing math
without a problem.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.770
But English-- I didn't
really like English.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.660
I didn't really like
science, history.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.690
Didn't really like
anything else.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.960
Didn't really like PE.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.580
So I just did barely enough
so that my mom wouldn't trip--

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.750
so C-.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.220
I can kind of talk
my way out of it.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.720
Can't come home with no Ds.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.400
Every once in a while
I'd fall into the D range

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.800
and couldn't climb out, and
that would be like a half

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.262
hour lecture about something.

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:27.720
I don't really
remember much of it.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.560
But I want you know that middle
school, I was in trouble.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.560
If you saw me in
middle school-- if you

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.599
walked to my middle
school campus and saw me,

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.140
you would never have
said, this guy's

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.492
going to speaking to
companies one day.

00:06:41.492 --> 00:06:42.950
You wouldn't be
like, they're going

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.064
to study what this
guy's doing one day,

00:06:47.064 --> 00:06:48.480
because my behavior
was definitely

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.920
not leading me to toward
being educated in any way.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.590
And so my life began
to get really chaotic

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.140
in middle school.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.410
Middle school was that
place where you now

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.720
are beginning to be tested.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720
Your body's growing.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.920
Your mind is saying,
hey I want to do this,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.600
but people around you are
saying, you can't do that.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.170
And so you're beginning
trying to figure out

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.320
your world around you.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.667
Getting bullied?

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.500
Having somebody might
take your lunch money?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.340
That was happening.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.160
I couldn't tell mom about it.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.530
First of all, how do
I deal with it myself

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.070
that I let that happen--
that I was afraid enough

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.112
to let somebody take my
money, and I gave it to him.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.590
That was really
tough to deal with.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.200
So I kept it to myself.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.199
And I think the only
way she figured it out

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.240
is because every time I'd
come home after school,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.309
I was super hungry.

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:42.850
And there was already not a lot
of things in the refrigerator

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.050
anyway, so she would know
when something was missing

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.290
because I was eating lunch and
breakfast at the same time,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.010
kind of.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.640
And it wasn't until
that moment, where

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.082
I was like, this
can't happen anymore.

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:59.165
Another moment in my life,
being in seventh grade,

00:07:59.165 --> 00:08:00.081
where you're like, OK.

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.460
I gotta stop this
from happening.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.020
What if you're afraid?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.456
What if the people who
are pushing on you,

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:08.330
making you do something
you don't want to do,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.796
but you're afraid to
like stand against them?

00:08:11.796 --> 00:08:12.420
What do you do?

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.800
Well, it becomes a very
scary day to have to be like,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.710
I'm actually really
afraid, but I'm actually

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.310
going to have to face this fear
because if this doesn't stop

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.622
now, it's going to keep going.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.490
And so it wasn't
until middle school,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.809
around the eighth grade,
moving into ninth grade, where

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.659
a teacher really
pulled me aside.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.345
She said, you're
really smart, but you

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:43.390
don't act like you're not.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.896
I know that you're upset
that your father died

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:46.770
before you were born.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.304
I know that you're
upset about that.

00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:49.470
Maybe you're sad about that.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.310
I'm like, I ain't sad.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.990
When she said upset,
I was cool with it.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.500
I'll be upset,
because you can be

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.845
upset as a young man
in Oakland, but don't

00:08:56.845 --> 00:08:59.870
be talking about me being sad.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.139
I think deep down
I was really sad.

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.430
When I would see kids get
dropped off by their fathers,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.874
or get picked up
by their fathers,

00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:07.790
or get chastised by their
fathers, I was like,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.810
I want that.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.220
And it wasn't till
she said to me,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.240
life doesn't give
you what you want.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.550
Life gives you what
you get, and you have

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.820
to make the most out of it.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.865
And in that half hour
lecture she was giving me

00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:25.264
at that moment, that's the
only sentence I remember,

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.680
but it absolutely
changed my life.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.090
And so I get my act
together, go to high school.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.870
I'm going to go to college.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.170
I hear there's a program
called Upward Bound.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.379
They help you get to college.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:40.669
First generation college
student-- I'm like, excellent.

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:41.801
Turn in my application.

00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:43.800
The lady calls me into
the office and said, hey.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.560
I said, all right.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.400
Where do I start?

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.987
She's like, well, I
have some bad news.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.070
What do you mean bad news?

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.070
I want to go to college.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.610
You help people get to college.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.910
She's like, well, you're
not first generation college

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.410
student.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.672
I was like, of course I am.

00:09:55.672 --> 00:09:58.436
Nobody went to
college in my family.

00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:00.170
She was like, your
mom went to college.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.545
Your mom's a teacher.

00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:04.500
I'm like, we don't
make no money.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.220
Don't you go to
college to make money?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.500
Why are we broke?

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.250
And I knew that day I
would never be a teacher.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.710
I was clear that I would
never, ever be a teacher.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.825
I'm like, OK, if I'm
going to college,

00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.283
I ain't going to be no teacher,
because teachers don't make

00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:21.410
money, and we got
teachers at my house,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.210
as much as I love my mom.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.865
So I went home that day,
pretty upset with her.

00:10:26.865 --> 00:10:29.150
What do you mean,
we went to college

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:34.570
and we are just barely
able to make it?

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.104
It was an awakening for me.

00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:37.520
So I knew then I
was good at math.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.050
Science started
getting better for me.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.450
I'm gonna start
paying attention.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.780
I'm going to be an engineer.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.500
Graduate high school, go to
college for civil engineering.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.930
Start working, making money.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.090
Great.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.410
Working, making money--
I could pay rent

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.340
and PG&amp;E the same month and
still have money for food?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.970
That's a big deal.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.114
That's a big deal.

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:59.770
But why am I not happy?

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.430
How in the world am I able to--
like, poor boy from Oakland

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.290
goes to college, becomes
an engineer, making money,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.100
and I'm not happy?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.040
They told me that was what
the secret to happiness was.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040
You make a lot of money.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.320
You're gonna go do fun things,
never miss a bachelor party.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.600
You go everywhere
when you have money.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.700
But I'm not happy.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.850
And what happened to me
in the next year or two

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:33.014
was not planned by any--
definitely not my plan.

00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:34.930
So I'm gonna tell you
this story really quick.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.637
It's gonna go real fast.

00:11:36.637 --> 00:11:38.220
I was tutoring at
his learning center.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.300
One day a kid walked in.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.674
He couldn't multiply
polynomials.

00:11:40.674 --> 00:11:42.590
I love multiplying polynomials.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.290
He looked at me.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.623
He said, can you really help me?

00:11:44.623 --> 00:11:45.951
I'm like, dude, I got this.

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:46.450
He comes.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.110
He sits down.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.980
I help him.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.830
The light turns on.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.050
He turns the book, and he sees
the answer, and he looks at me.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.030
He's like, oh, my gosh.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.110
It's that easy?

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.250
I'm like, yes.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.230
And I felt it.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.980
I felt this thing that
I had never felt before,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.940
and I was like, oh, no, no, no.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.670
That's teaching thing.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.000
We're not doing that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.230
So I told the lady at the front
desk who hired me-- I said,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:17.000
listen I'm not working here no
more because if you're telling

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.260
me that this teaching
thing feel that good,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.250
and I actually enjoy it, then I
gotta run from it because that

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.080
doesn't make money.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.663
And I've already
been clear in my mind

00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:27.317
that I would never be a teacher.

00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:27.900
So I took off.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.170
I said, well, I'll also help
until the end of this SAT

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.960
season and then don't call me.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.020
But it was already in me.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.020
The seed was planted.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.910
It was growing really fast, and
I was trying to run from it.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.510
So I move on.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.040
I make more money.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.685
And it starts getting worse.

00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:44.810
So then I said, well, look.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.920
I can always go back
to being an engineer.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.470
I'm gonna go do this teaching
thing for a little while

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.540
and then I can always
go be an engineer.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.390
I got my degree on
the wall, so they--

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.420
they can't take that, right?

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.260
So I become a teacher.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.680
And that was 2002 and
I haven't look back.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.570
Well, I've looked back.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.054
I've only looked
at the salaries.

00:13:03.054 --> 00:13:04.720
I haven't looked back
at saying that I'm

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.790
going to be going back.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.700
And so my first year
teaching-- coming out of heart.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.100
Heart calling me
to do this work.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.260
I'm failing.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.890
I signed up for a low salary.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.540
I didn't sign up for
being broke and a failure.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.030
I wasn't going to have both.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.890
So I was like, look.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.670
I'm going to go back to work
to making money thing if I

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.422
don't figure this out, so I
invited some students to lunch.

00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:30.130
And I said, look.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.710
I'll buy you all lunch once a
week-- a group of young men--

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.109
if you teach me how to
be a better teacher.

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:38.150
Tell me what I'm doing
wrong, 'cause I'll fix it.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.450
If there's something I
can fix in why you're not

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.032
passing my class, and the fact
that I'm here for you 100%--

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.240
the fact that I'm here early.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.735
I stay late-- I'll
provide food for you.

00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:49.110
There's always
snacks in my room.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.680
What do you need me to do
to help you pass this class?

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.070
Because I knew that algebra
wasn't just algebra.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.940
Algebra was the gatekeeper,
because no algebra,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.060
no high school graduation.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.675
That's how California works.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.050
You don't get
through high school

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.730
if you don't pass algebra.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.610
So I knew that I could
see four years down

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.150
the line ahead of them.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.990
Like, you don't pass this,
this is bad news down the line.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.880
And many of them couldn't
see that for themselves.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.380
And so Ever Forward
Club started out

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.335
of that-- these
lunchtime meetings where

00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:23.710
I begin to hear them say, it's
not cool to be smart here.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.960
I ain't gonna be no nerd,
no geek, no teacher's pet.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.290
I'm not carrying
no heavy backpack.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.000
All the things I remember
thinking and saying

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.750
when I was in middle school.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.860
And I knew that my job
was never going to be,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.240
I'm gonna tell you that
it's OK to be smart,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.942
and you're gonna believe me.

00:14:39.942 --> 00:14:40.900
Anybody have teenagers?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.910
Have you ever tried to
tell a teenager something

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.800
that you know is
right, and they are

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.120
convinced that it's not right?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.030
They'll wear you out.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.140
They have way more
energy than us.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.890
So I knew that my job
was not to tell them

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.490
that yes, smart is cool.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.380
You can be smart.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.820
It will pay off later, because
it's not paying off right now.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.720
The payoff at the lunch
line isn't-- this smartness

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.800
ain't paying off there.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.883
It's not paying off at PE.

00:15:07.883 --> 00:15:09.720
It ain't paying off
at getting to school.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.110
It ain't paying off on the bus.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.670
If they can't see the
payout, why would they

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.480
invest the time and energy?

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.959
So we began to work
around the system,

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.000
and that's how the Ever
Forward Club was created.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.750
I was not trying to
start a nonprofit.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.810
I had already decided
to be a teacher.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.190
Why would I be in some
nonprofit kind of thing?

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.700
That just seems totally running
in the opposite direction

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.380
of what I had worked
so hard for, I thought.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.869
So I was like, we're going
to figure this thing out.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.660
And so what I'm gonna
have you do right now

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.650
is I'm gonna have you hear
from some of the young men that

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.750
are in our program, who
have been in the program

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.135
either for a long time, or up
to just a couple of months.

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:48.760
And they're obviously
going to tell you

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.010
one or two sentences
about themselves,

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.830
or what school they're at.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.580
Some of them are really
nervous right now.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.163
When there was like one or two
people in here, they were like,

00:15:57.163 --> 00:15:58.380
I got this.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.850
And when people
started filling in,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.433
they started getting
a little nervous.

00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:03.767
So just smile at
them a little bit.

00:16:03.767 --> 00:16:05.100
So they're all going to come up.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.260
You're going to come
up at the same time.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.150
All of you, come up.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.899
Ambrosio, come up.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.200
NATE: My name is Nate, and I'm
a student at [INAUDIBLE] High.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.990
I became a part of
the Ever Forward Club

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.730
because I thought this would be
a wonderful experience for me.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.240
This Club had done
many things for me,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.825
including focusing more on
school and raising my grade.

00:16:38.825 --> 00:16:39.326
My name is

00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:40.533
DESHAWN SMITH: Deshawn Smith.

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.450
I'm 16 years old.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.180
I got to Santa Rosa High School.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.570
I've been a part of this
program for a year and a half.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.256
I joined the program because
I saw my friends in it,

00:16:50.256 --> 00:16:53.530
and honestly, they was having
fun, and was like, join in.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.480
So hopped in and
it taught me a lot.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.110
It made me become a better
mature young man-- educated,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.661
get me through tough times,
and I appreciate what

00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:06.869
this program has done for me.

00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:11.800
DANA WILLIAMS: My name
is Daniel Williams.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.700
I go to [INAUDIBLE]
Middle School.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.319
I started this
program two years ago.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.349
I like this program because
it's a good program.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:24.280
It also helps us become
educated and strong men.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.380
The reason why I joined
the Ever Forward Club

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.700
is because I thought
I should try it out,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.970
and it turned out great.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.850
So that's why I
stay in this club.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.570
And it helped me
graduate middle school.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:37.680
DEVON WILLIAMS: Hi my
name's Devon Williams,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.610
and I go to [INAUDIBLE]
Middle School,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.890
and I've been at Ever
Forward Club for two years.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.430
I joined this Club
because I wanted

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:50.110
to be successful in life, and
Branch taught me to be mature.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.880
And it helped me go
through bad things.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.010
JAVIER SANDOVAL: Hi, my
name is Javier Sandoval.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.750
I'm a junior at
Arise High School.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.060
I've been an EFC member
for about six months now.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.590
I joined to have
a safe environment

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.530
to share about problems that
I was going through back then.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.069
I found out that everyone goes
through struggles, even if we

00:18:15.069 --> 00:18:16.360
don't normally talk about them.

00:18:21.522 --> 00:18:23.230
AMBROSIO PABLO: My
name's Ambrosio Pablo,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.950
and I just graduated
from Arise High School.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:32.550
And around September I'm gonna
start college at Berkeley.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.060
I joined Ever Forward
my freshman year,

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.530
and throughout these
years, I've been

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.230
given a lot of opportunities
provided by him and by the Ever

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.280
Forward.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.530
And I feel like if I hadn't
joined the Ever Forward,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.810
I wouldn't have had the
opportunities that I had.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.530
Also, throughout the years,
I've learned a lot of stuff.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:01.820
He's also always on my back,
but, I mean, it's helpful to me

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.160
because sometimes I've
just fallen back on stuff

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.680
and I'm just like, let me
just give this a break.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.230
But then he always calls
me up and he's like,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.276
have you done this?

00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:16.150
Just stuff like that.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.940
He just tells me,
have you done this?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.450
Like, always on my back.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.230
Sometimes I get annoyed,
but it's helpful.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.555
Straight up.

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:26.180
ASHANTI BRANCH: So
Ambrosio, come here.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.680
Ambrosio.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.100
Ambrosio is-- so he's going
to be starting at Cal.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.470
So Ambrosio, actually, is going
to be on a full ride to Cal,

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.900
so I'm really proud of
him and all his hard work.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.792
So I wanted you to be
able to hear from them.

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:55.060
And I think that if you
stayed afterwards and asked

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.434
them more questions-- I tried
to get them not to read it.

00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:58.930
I was like, don't read it.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.290
You wrote it, so you know it.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.100
So just let it come through you.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.070
And they were like, no.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.650
I gotta have this thing.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.064
So we're in a technology place.

00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:07.980
You all get it, right?

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.790
The technology for them.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.400
And so let it be.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.550
So when the Ever Forward
Club began to grow,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.200
and we ended up back at my alma
mater, Freemont High School,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.760
there was a lot
of chaos going on.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.301
There's still a lot
of chaos going on

00:20:25.301 --> 00:20:26.490
at Freemont High School.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.550
And I was thinking, how could
I try and be of service?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.600
I was like a dean that
year, and I was like, well,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.990
I'm dealing with
all these referrals,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.790
and I keep seeing a
lot of our young men

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.250
just getting sent
out, kicked out.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.810
I didn't have the
vision I was going

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.010
to be running a Club there.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.120
I was like, well, I'm
here to do this job.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.040
And then there was a need.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.850
There was a need.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.547
And the documentary
"The Mask You Live In"--

00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:51.880
has anybody seen the documentary
"The Mask You Live In?"

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.180
A few of you.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.900
The Representation Project,
which their founder

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.550
is Jennifer Siebel Newsom.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.410
Her first film, back in
2011, was called "Miss

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.990
Representation,"
M-I-S-S, and it was about

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.510
the under-representation,
the misrepresentation,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.490
of women around the nation,
around sports, media, music,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.300
all different areas.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.620
In 2015, released at Sundance
was "The Mask You Live In,"

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.710
and it was about American
masculinity and the challenges

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.180
our boys and young men face
in a society where they're

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.440
being told that this is
the limited list of what

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.290
it means to be a man.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.905
Very limited list very.

00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:35.190
A very small box of things
that show your masculinity--

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.490
that you're a man.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.950
And so when they asked us to
come film at Freemont High

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.460
School, I said,
well, I'm working

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.300
with a group of young men.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.716
They're kind of what they call
this thing the Brotherhood,

00:21:44.716 --> 00:21:48.085
but they're not really
telling the truth often.

00:21:48.085 --> 00:21:53.150
When we check in, they all say
they're a 10-- from a 1 to 10,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:53.680
I'm a 10.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.440
All them are 10.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.640
And I'm like, now I know, as
a dean, they're not all 10s.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.800
I'm like, my man, you just
got four referrals today.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.812
How are you a 10?

00:22:03.812 --> 00:22:05.520
And I know that you're
dealing with this,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.710
and you're dealing with
that, but my job as a mentor

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.680
is not to tell their
stuff to the circle.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.500
It's a whole space.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.530
Even if I'm letting them
sometimes not really

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.290
always tell the truth.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.540
And so I said, well, you can
come, but just so you know,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.530
it's not really real.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.724
It's kind of fake.

00:22:23.724 --> 00:22:25.140
And they were like,
well, at least

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.970
we get to see they're
resist an opportunity

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.120
to let go of some stuff.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.061
And I was like, OK.

00:22:29.061 --> 00:22:30.560
OK, no problem,
because I was really

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.190
excited they were coming,
but in my mind, I was like,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.020
you're not about
to be filming me

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.126
with a group of young men lying.

00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:38.500
That's not gonna happen.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.700
So I was trying to
figure out how do I

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.110
get them to talk about it in
a way that was disconnected

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.210
from them a little bit--
as a little bit out

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.700
of their direct way of having
to say, I'm dealing with this.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.870
And so what you're going
experience right now

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.150
is what was created
for that day.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.270
And if you see the
documentary, you'll

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.510
see a little bit of
that in the documentary.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.710
It's now available on
Netflix and iTunes,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.392
and we'll hopefully
be doing some--

00:23:05.392 --> 00:23:06.600
AUDIENCE: Google Play Movies.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.170
ASHANTI BRANCH: I'm sorry?

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.460
AUDIENCE: Google Play Movies.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.918
ASHANTI BRANCH:
Google Play Movies?

00:23:09.918 --> 00:23:13.400
Google Play-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.502
See-- see what happens?

00:23:14.502 --> 00:23:15.960
I told them I was
going to mess up.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.293
I told them I was gonna mess up.

00:23:17.293 --> 00:23:19.165
And Google Play Movies.

00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:20.650
That's right.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.600
How dare you.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.060
I was already
sweating as it was.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.890
OK, OK.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.390
Reset.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.160
I gotta get some water.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.910
I need some water.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:29.990
I need some water.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.490
Got me.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:30.980
I gotcha.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.480
I gotcha.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.320
I got you.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.200
And on Google Play Movies.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.757
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:23:39.757 --> 00:23:42.090
And so right now, in your
seat-- or probably you already

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.530
put it on the floor-- you
have a blank piece of paper,

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.330
and you have a pen, a marker.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.430
So please grab that
marker, the piece of paper.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.000
So we know we have people that
are viewing from other places,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.954
and so if you have a
piece of paper handy,

00:23:54.954 --> 00:23:57.370
or you have a journal there,
you can actually participate,

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.930
as well.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.160
So it's just a
regular blank paper,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.300
and so you can
participate wherever

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.140
you are watching, as well.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.270
And so when we start
with the blank paper,

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.600
my first question to anyone in
the room is, what do you think,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.510
or what do you find,
what do you believe,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.510
is a purpose of a mask?

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.610
What is a purpose of a mask?

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.110
Yeah?

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.859
AUDIENCE: Hide.

00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:25.150
ASHANTI BRANCH: Hide something.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.130
AUDIENCE: Transform.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.213
ASHANTI BRANCH: Transform.

00:24:27.213 --> 00:24:28.277
AUDIENCE: To fit in.

00:24:28.277 --> 00:24:29.360
ASHANTI BRANCH: To fit in.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.819
AUDIENCE: To put
out a fake facade.

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:32.526
ASHANTI BRANCH: To
put out a fake facade.

00:24:32.526 --> 00:24:33.590
AUDIENCE: Safety.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.214
ASHANTI BRANCH: Safe--
who said safety?

00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:36.262
Safety.

00:24:36.262 --> 00:24:38.250
AUDIENCE: Project
something about yourself.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.790
ASHANTI BRANCH: Project
something about yourself.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.850
Those are excellent answers.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.060
What I would like you do
is-- and I know some of you

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.790
are sitting with
friends, so do your best

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.080
to just kind of focus
on your own paper.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.040
Do your best not to look
to the left or right.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.970
I want you to just come from
whatever is in your mind.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:25:00.110
And I want you, on this
paper, to draw a mask.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.360
Whatever you think a
mask looks like is right.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.348
Just draw a mask.

00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:17.380
You can turn it over just so
you don't have any people trying

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.505
to look at your mask right now.

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:20.880
What I want you
to think about is

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.222
this mask as being a
representation of you.

00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:26.760
I'm not saying it
looks like you.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.120
I'm just saying it's like
a representation of you.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.090
It came from your mind to
your pen, to your paper,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.320
and you drew it.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.090
So just think of it as
a representation of you.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.360
And so what I would
like you to do

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.120
is I'd like you, on
the front of the mask,

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.880
to think of three
characteristics

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.474
that you gladly let the
world see about you.

00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:49.140
When you leave the
house, and you go out

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.130
into the world, what are those
three characteristics that you

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.140
would say, I show the
world that I'm this.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.590
I'm these three things.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.010
Three characteristics or
phrases that you represent

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.410
that you let people see.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.720
There's no talking.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.597
Thank you.

00:26:03.597 --> 00:26:04.930
Please write those on the front.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.070
And once you've finished
those on the front,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.204
then turn your paper over.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.900
So now if the front of the
mask representation of you

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.180
are the three things
you show the world,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.680
what do you think I'm going to
ask you to write on the back?

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.310
Somebody laughs.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.930
They're like-- say it again?

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.714
AUDIENCE: Things you hide.

00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:31.630
ASHANTI BRANCH: Maybe.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.450
It may be things you
hide, but it may just

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.400
be things you just don't talk
about-- maybe things you just

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.430
leave unsaid, like
no one brings it up.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.810
I don't bring it up.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.580
It doesn't exist.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.590
maybe there's things you just
leave that people can just

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.150
guess if they want, but I don't
really talk much about that.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.210
So I'd like you to write
whatever-- to your level

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.834
of comfort-- three
things that you just

00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:57.160
don't show the world-- you just
don't talk about-- on the back.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.137
Three words or phrases-- those
three things on the back,

00:27:00.137 --> 00:27:00.637
please.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.900
And when you finish, I want
you just to ball the paper up.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.784
And if you're in
a satellite place,

00:27:12.784 --> 00:27:14.575
you can just-- you may
not want to throw it

00:27:14.575 --> 00:27:15.600
at people in the room
'cause they're probably

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.750
right in front of you.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.940
But in this room, we're
going to do something.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.981
I want you to ball it up.

00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:21.170
I want you to stand up.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.542
You need your hands free.

00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:23.500
I'll have you stand up.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.020
And what I'm going
to have you do

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:40.830
is how about we have the
first two rows stand up,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.919
and on this side, and I want you
all to kind of face this way.

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.460
Everyone's gonna
stand, but I'm gonna

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.590
have you all face this way.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.620
Have you all face that way.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.936
And what I need you to do is I'm
gonna have you close your eyes.

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:52.686
You're like, what?

00:27:52.686 --> 00:27:55.340
What is happening here?

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.970
OK, trust me.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.090
Well, do your best to
trust me, if you can.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.500
I want you to imagine that this
piece of paper in your hand

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.235
is turning into snow.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.860
You feel it?

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.380
Can you feel the snow?

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.989
It's like a snowball right now.

00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:16.280
And what I want you to do
is, except for the people who

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.450
are right in the middle--
I don't want you to hit

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.866
the person right
in front of you--

00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.826
I want you to hit someone
with this snowball

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:22.200
on the opposite
side of the room,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.990
but you gotta keep
your eyes closed.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.448
I don't want you
to aim at anybody.

00:28:25.448 --> 00:28:28.850
I want you to just throw it,
and it will hit somebody, pray

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.950
maybe.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.430
Now, this is supposed to be fun.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.380
So if you are kind of
the person right now

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.790
who's not feeling like fun--
you're not in a fun mood--

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.245
I would say you can not do it.

00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:40.995
But I want you to at
least throw your mask

00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:45.170
and just throw it to the
air, and it will work out.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.320
It always works out.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.903
So I'm gonna have
you close your eyes.

00:28:47.903 --> 00:28:50.417
And I'm gonna say
3, 2, 1-- wait.

00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:51.250
Now don't do it yet.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.200
I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna say,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.116
then I'm gonna say it.

00:28:53.116 --> 00:28:56.670
I'm going to say 3,
2, 1, snow throw.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.919
And when I say snow
throw, you just throw 'em.

00:28:58.919 --> 00:28:59.960
It's gonna be incredible.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.001
It's gonna be incredible.

00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:01.700
Just watch.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.500
So here we go.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.500
OK, now close your eyes.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.340
Here we go.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.340
3, 2, 1, snow throw.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.450
Now you can open your eyes.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.807
Now you should find one.

00:29:12.807 --> 00:29:13.640
You should find one.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.980
Everyone should just find
one, but don't open it.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.760
Don't open it.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.604
You should find one.

00:29:19.604 --> 00:29:21.490
AUDIENCE: We didn't get any.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.740
ASHANTI BRANCH: If you don't
have one, we'll pass one.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.212
Do you need one?

00:29:25.212 --> 00:29:26.131
AUDIENCE: I found one.

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:27.297
ASHANTI BRANCH: You got one?

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.516
There's one right there
by that bag right there.

00:29:33.516 --> 00:29:35.390
Can I have that bag right there?

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:35.890
Awesome.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.580
Thank you.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.645
Everyone has one?

00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:38.470
Who's missing one?

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.900
I got an extra one.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.430
Everybody got one?

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.650
Everybody got one?

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.600
Awesome.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.100
We good?

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.560
OK.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.518
So you can have a seat.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.299
I want you, right now,
to take a deep breath.

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:55.090
Take a deep breath.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.380
Take a deep breath.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.070
Young man.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.164
Thank you.

00:30:00.164 --> 00:30:00.955
Take a deep breath.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.280
OK.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.210
Now, here's where it
gets a little tricky.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.290
Sometimes in this activity,
in this workshop-- so

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.510
we've done this workshop,
this last school year,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:17.250
with about 5,000 people,
parents, teachers, young men,

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.740
young women in schools.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.320
And so people bring
us into their teams

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.500
to do this workshop.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.600
This is just the first part.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.100
And what we found
at the beginning--

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.599
the reason I'm having to tell
you this disclaimer before you

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:31.100
can open it is because sometimes
people were opening it,

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.555
looking for something.

00:30:33.555 --> 00:30:35.430
And I want you to know
that you're not really

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.250
looking for anything.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.320
This is the gift
you've been given.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.100
Because one of my mentors
said, showing up is about 90%

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:45.620
of success.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.530
Now, you may have
heard 98%, 95%.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.800
Some percentage of success
is a high percentage

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.660
of just showing up.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.190
So whatever you have is
somebody showed up today.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.134
I'm really thankful
you all showed up.

00:30:58.134 --> 00:30:59.800
But they showed up,
and they said, well,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.730
even if I don't
write anything, I'm

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.021
gonna participate a little
bit by balling this paper up

00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:04.850
and throwing it at somebody.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.160
So you're not looking
for something inside.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.830
So if it's blank, it's
supposed to be blank.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.820
If it's illegible and
you can't read it,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.210
it's supposed to be illegible
so you can't read it.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.796
Anything inside is just extra
to the gift for somebody

00:31:18.796 --> 00:31:20.295
just showing up and
saying, hey, I'm

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:24.510
gonna just give a little
bit of myself in this space.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.450
So what I'd like you to do,
carefully, respectfully,

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.358
is to open the paper, but don't
talk about it to your neighbor.

00:31:31.358 --> 00:31:33.123
Don't talk about it
to your neighbor.

00:31:44.962 --> 00:31:46.670
So what I need is I
need some volunteers.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.460
And we gotta move.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.570
I gotta move quickly.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.310
I need maybe five
volunteers who would

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.110
be willing to read
one of the words

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.813
from the front of the mask.

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.340
I'll have you help,
and then, yes, sir.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.310
You there, you, and you.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.200
Anybody on this side?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.450
You wanna volun-- OK.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.740
And then I'll--
OK, please start.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.770
Read one word from the front.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.740
AUDIENCE: Happy.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.823
ASHANTI BRANCH: Thank you.

00:32:10.823 --> 00:32:12.920
Will you pass it?

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.924
AUDIENCE: Poised.

00:32:14.924 --> 00:32:15.590
AUDIENCE: Smart.

00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:19.180
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.880
AUDIENCE: Male.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.720
AUDIENCE: Curious.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.680
ASHANTI BRANCH:
Poised, smart, curious,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.760
AUDIENCE: Confidence.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.900
ASHANTI BRANCH: Confidence.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900
AUDIENCE: Energetic.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.380
ASHANTI BRANCH: Energetic.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.213
Hold it right there.

00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:35.440
Hold it right there.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.870
You're good.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.499
Those qualities-- do you
recognize those, working here,

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:41.540
for those that work here?

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.110
Do you recognize
those qualities?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.280
Smart, energetic,
poised, hard-working.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.438
There's a few males here.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.806
Those are the
qualities that we show,

00:32:53.806 --> 00:32:54.930
so hopefully you recognize.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.770
I've been to a
workshop where people

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.740
read one word from
the front, and I said,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.831
do you all recognize
those qualities here?

00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:03.800
And people were like, uh.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.130
I was like, well,
you all wrote them.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.050
You all said that's
what you show.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.440
Do you know that it's
possible for some people

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.148
not to see what you
think you're showing?

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.140
At this point it gets a little
harder, a little trickier.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.397
And it may have been tricky
when you were asked to write it.

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:24.730
Maybe your stomach was churning.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.730
Maybe your brain was spinning.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.938
Maybe the connection between
your heart and your head

00:33:27.938 --> 00:33:29.630
was like in a battle,
like, don't do it.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.080
Do it.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.590
Don't do it.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.090
Do it.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.240
Whatever happened when you wrote
the back may have brought you

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.430
to a certain different place.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.800
And you'll experience it
again right now, maybe.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.954
Please turn the paper over.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.740
And can I have a few
volunteers to read

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.520
the words that are on the back?

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.260
Now if you're in the overflow,
in one of the side rooms,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.040
maybe you can just
read your own and just

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.690
listen to what we are going to
hear happening in this space.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.300
So just look for a hand
and then pass it, OK?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.260
So this is from the back.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.840
AUDIENCE: Personal stuff.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.030
AUDIENCE: Fear.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.530
AUDIENCE: Sad stories.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.389
AUDIENCE: Personal
family relationships.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:11.580
AUDIENCE: Tears.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.810
AUDIENCE: Insecurity.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.580
AUDIENCE: Fear of failure.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.130
AUDIENCE: Impostor, unqualified.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.280
AUDIENCE: Struggles.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.840
AUDIENCE: Watch YouTube.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.170
AUDIENCE: Respectful.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.409
AUDIENCE: Stress.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.719
AUDIENCE: Childhood.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.900
AUDIENCE: Lack of
family connections.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.618
ASHANTI BRANCH: Can
you take a breath?

00:34:29.618 --> 00:34:30.409
Take a deep breath.

00:34:34.468 --> 00:34:36.500
So what do you--
what's happening?

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.570
What do you notice?

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:42.889
What's happening in your head
and your body and your heart?

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.338
What are you noticing?

00:34:45.338 --> 00:34:46.710
AUDIENCE: Empathy.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.710
ASHANTI BRANCH: Empathy.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.560
Can you say another
sentence about empathy?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.509
AUDIENCE: Being able to feel
what a room is feeling like,

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.008
anonymously.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.110
AUDIENCE: We're probably all
closer onto the negative side

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.400
than we think.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.480
AUDIENCE: I feel more
connected to other people,

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.800
as opposed to connected
to myself only.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.230
AUDIENCE: I feel like I'm not
the only one feeling certain--

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.644
some of those things.

00:35:15.644 --> 00:35:17.060
ASHANTI BRANCH:
So no matter where

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.990
I go to do this
workshop-- whether I'm

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:24.500
at a middle school or 98th
Avenue in deep East Oakland;

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.610
whether I'm at a private
school in San Francisco;

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.850
whether I'm working with
some parents at a parenting

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.980
workshop; whether I'm
in Nashville, Tennessee;

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:37.380
whether I'm in Seattle,
Washington-- what I experience,

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.390
what I've observed, is
that so often people

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.690
don't realize how
much we're dealing

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.170
with some of the same stuff.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.130
As an educator, you know that
you have to show up in class,

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.139
leave the junk in the car, go
up in front of the students,

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:57.180
be on the show, and when
you get back in the car,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.250
you can pick it back
up on the way home.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.260
And I imagine maybe some
of you have to do the same.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.442
And the question is, do you
just tell everybody everything?

00:36:13.442 --> 00:36:14.900
Like, when they
say, how you doing?

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.450
You say, oh, let me
tell how I'm doing.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:16.900
Let me.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.774
Thank you for asking.

00:36:17.774 --> 00:36:21.139
I've been waiting for
somebody to ask me all day.

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:22.930
Most times, when people
say, how you doing?

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.550
They are already
like three feet away

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.850
by the time you answer, because
oftentimes we don't really

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.844
mean, how you doing?

00:36:29.844 --> 00:36:31.510
We just have gotten
comfortable with how

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.070
you doing being just
a way to say I'm

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.301
really kind of noticing you.

00:36:37.301 --> 00:36:39.570
Have you ever experienced it?

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.320
Think about it the
next time somebody asks

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.310
you how you're doing,
see if they're actually

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.440
caring how you're doing,
or is it just our way

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.430
of greeting each other?

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.260
Try it next time.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.090
The next time somebody
says, how you doing, say,

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.370
I am so glad you asked.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:57.380
Let me tell you, and watch them.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.180
Watch their face.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.010
They're just gonna
be like-- try it.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.580
Try it today.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.829
It'll happen in the afternoon.

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:05.600
How you doing?

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.350
So glad you asked.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.610
Sit down for some coffee.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.140
And what I believe is
that, because we are human,

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.920
we say it because it's what
we've been taught as kindness.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.850
It's just a greeting.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.870
So how do we deal
with the real stuff?

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.570
When we're in a high-performance
environment, when we're

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.840
in a high-stress environment,
like middle school

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.100
and high school, how do we
deal with the real stuff

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.410
when we can't really
deal with it there?

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.610
I wish that Ever Forward
Club didn't have to exist.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.180
When I started
teaching, I was barely

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.360
learning the teaching thing.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.410
I wasn't trying to start
anything on the side,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.900
but the teaching
wasn't reaching them,

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.410
because they were trying to
pretend that the baggage wasn't

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.240
real, that they were showing up
to school super silly, happy,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.550
whatever they were doing,
but they had a harder filter.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.800
Their filter was harder, so
it was kind of leaking out

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.820
into their day-to-day actions.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.630
As adults, we have
more practice.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.950
We know, hey, I'm not
showing none of that.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.696
I'll go in and get myself ready.

00:38:05.696 --> 00:38:07.070
None of that
happened last night.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.630
That didn't happen.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.213
That didn't really just happen
this morning on my way to work.

00:38:10.213 --> 00:38:12.160
It didn't happen.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.940
I didn't just get that
text at lunch time.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.720
It didn't happen.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.290
Let me just get back to work.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.290
And so what I've
learned, and what

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.750
we have learned in
Ever Forward, is

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.390
that providing these young
men a safe space to talk

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:29.260
about what's really
going on in a safe space.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.940
I don't expect them to be able
to talk about that stuff out

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.440
there.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.100
Not yet.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.670
Our society's not
ready for young men

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:39.750
to be totally into
their emotions.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.400
There can be an anger.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.450
Anger gets you respect.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.525
You can be super
funny and silly.

00:38:44.525 --> 00:38:46.950
That'll get you some points.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.210
But you can't be sad.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.904
You can't be afraid.

00:38:50.904 --> 00:38:53.070
And so what I've experienced,
in working with adults

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.350
and working with
parents, is that, if you

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.740
don't find a place--
it may not be at work,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.270
but if you don't find a place
that you can go regularly

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.090
to be like, let me just talk
about what's really going--

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:12.920
not to be fixed, but just to
be heard, just to be seen,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.366
I believe that we do
ourselves a disservice.

00:39:16.366 --> 00:39:18.490
If you're a manager and
you're working with people,

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.406
and you've got people
in your team who may not

00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:22.110
be doing everything
the way they should

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:27.010
or whatever, maybe you
could ask, how's it going?

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.767
Can we just have a real talk?

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:32.100
That's why I don't say get real.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.886
Getting real is like, can I talk
about what's really going on

00:39:34.886 --> 00:39:36.260
and feel safe that
it's not going

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.700
to jeopardize my valuation,
or my status among my team.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:51.040
It wasn't until I joined a men's
team, in 2010, that I really

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.120
felt like I was being seen by
other men that were pushing me

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.460
to be better, like I could
talk about successes at work

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.480
and people were not
like, oh, whatever.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.270
It was like, yeah!

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.770
Nice!

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.210
That's powerful.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.080
It's powerful to
be knowing that you

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.470
could have people around you who
care about you being the best

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:18.320
you.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.490
So they help you
through the down times,

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.160
because the only
way to move back up

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.220
is to get through
the down times.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.600
We're all going to have them.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.600
But if we're always
pretending like everything's

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.700
always perfect, then when
do we ever get support

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:36.045
to get stronger, to get better?

00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:38.360
So if you don't
have that, I would

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.016
encourage you to find that.

00:40:41.016 --> 00:40:43.480
In the Bay Area here, there's
plenty organizations--

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.090
men's teams, women's
teams, or organizations

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.190
that support all
different groups

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:54.597
that you would feel that you
would want to connect to.

00:40:54.597 --> 00:40:56.930
What does that feel like to
be able to talk about what's

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.630
really going on and
know that it's not

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.780
going to get back to people
that could make decisions

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.180
about your life?

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.470
Say, you know, I'm really sad.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.050
I'm really dealing
with some sadness.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.430
I have an extreme
fear of failure.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.458
I have extreme fear of police.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.810
I'll see one walking
into Starbucks,

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.220
and my heart will
start pounding.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.180
Pounding, like I want to leave.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.920
So where do I go
talk about that?

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.230
Who do I tell that I'm felling
this anxiety every time

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.870
I see some flashing lights,
because I have a big mouth

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:46.000
and sometime I talk a
lot, so I talk back.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.010
And so I'm like, OK.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.260
I better not say nothing back.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.900
I better say yes sir, no sir.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.160
I feel like I gotta do that
to keep my life sometimes.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.547
Who do I talk about to that?

00:41:59.547 --> 00:42:00.880
Some people can't understand it.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.610
And so I'm so glad that
you all came today,

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.610
and I think that one of
the things that you have

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.720
on your seat is you have ways
that you can get involved,

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.910
like you can support the young
people in your community.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.600
Right now, our program
is in its growing phase.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.910
The Stanford d.school
fellowship has really

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.880
helped me to be able
to tell what we're

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.450
doing in a better way,
clearer, using design thinking,

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.870
starting with empathy, starting
with the human-centered design,

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.360
like am I designing?

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.086
Am I creating a
program for them?

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.940
Am I asking them
what is it that they

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.750
need so that we make sure
that the program exists

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.980
to support them?

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.610
And so we have a
Google Serve day

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.090
that Adam is helping us put
together-- all the information

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:50.130
on that paper.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.700
You can sign up to
volunteer with us.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.340
You can just be
in touch with us.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.800
You can just send
information out

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.200
to people about
what we're doing.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.212
You can participate in that.

00:42:59.212 --> 00:43:02.410
You can also donate.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:07.270
I'm not asking you to leave
your job to go do this work.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.330
I made that sacrifice.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.920
And so if you feel inclined,
and if it calls your heart

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.200
to support us in
a financial way,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.342
we would encourage
you to do that, too.

00:43:17.342 --> 00:43:19.300
Maybe there's something
else-- some other cause

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.049
out there that's really
calling your heart

00:43:21.049 --> 00:43:22.570
and you've been
kind of ignoring it.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.680
Maybe you could begin putting
some attention to that.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.472
So I'm really super
thankful for this time.

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:29.971
And I wanted to
leave a few minutes.

00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:31.720
We only have maybe
five or seven minutes

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.479
left if there were any questions
for the young men, for myself.

00:43:37.479 --> 00:43:38.770
But I thank you for being here.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.560
I thank you for participating.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.810
The mass that you
have, we will collect.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:48.330
We are envisioning what the
data looks like as we travel

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.830
all over doing this workshop.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:50.890
So we will collect these.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.760
So if you could just leave
them on the seat if you leave,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.100
or you can pass them forward.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.180
But if there's any questions,
we'll take some questions.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.960
If they can be aimed
at myself, Ambrosio

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.771
back there, or any of
the young men here.

00:44:02.771 --> 00:44:03.770
Thank you for your time.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.387
Thank you.

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:13.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.810
Thanks for coming out here.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.620
I appreciate you
sharing your story,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.702
taking off your mask for us.

00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:20.160
And I appreciate
all the great work

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.460
that you're doing with these
young men over there, as well.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.470
Question is are
you doing any work

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.424
with men in the South
Bay area or peninsula?

00:44:29.424 --> 00:44:31.840
And if so, just want to hear
a little bit more about that,

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.277
and how to get involved in that.

00:44:33.277 --> 00:44:34.360
ASHANTI BRANCH: Thank you.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.890
So this year we have
been doing workshops

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.460
all over the Bay Area, and
being invited to other states

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.410
to do workshops.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.870
So we have a chapter that's
at Jordan Middle School, which

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.280
is in Palo Alto.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.800
And we have been
invited to JLS, which

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.062
is-- I don't wanna say
what the JLS stands for,

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:51.770
but there's another
middle school that we

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.560
went to a screening
for the documentary.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.997
And so there's
teachers there who

00:44:54.997 --> 00:44:57.080
want us to do some work
with some young men there.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.880
We go into schools and we do the
Taking Off the Mask workshop.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.580
It's usually about
a two-hour workshop.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.390
And so that's our first level
of engagement with the students.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.430
And once that
workshop happens, they

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.080
will know-- the
administrators will

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.570
know-- whether the young
people are connected,

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.530
like they're ready to get real.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.754
Because the work
is you gotta help

00:45:14.754 --> 00:45:16.920
them understand that there's
a reason that we're not

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.240
getting real-- because
we're not allowed to.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.340
And so there's a school
in San Jose that had just

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.810
been-- so I'm reaching out.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.990
So if you know schools,
if you know principals,

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.960
if you know a school that
we should reach out to, we--

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:36.070
so this academic school year,
'16-'17, our goal is to take

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.910
10,000 people
through our workshop.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.950
This past year was
5,000, and so we're

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.520
going to be building the team
of facilitators that go out.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.540
And so we're ready.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.040
We're in that stage of like,
what is the distribution

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.320
model of how we get our work out
to a bigger part of the world?

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.995
And we're raising
money right now to-- I

00:45:54.995 --> 00:45:57.600
took a leave of absence to
take the Stanford fellowship.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.190
So that's one year off.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.880
So I'm purposely not
looking for a job right now,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.800
because this is what
I should be doing.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.590
And it's also scary.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:10.110
It's scary to go from
a high salary to low.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.590
It's even scarier to go from
just a little bit of salary

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.060
to none.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.370
And I feel it.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.770
But I'm also knowing
that that's why I do it.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.276
And it's going to happen.

00:46:22.276 --> 00:46:23.150
Thank you for asking.

00:46:28.974 --> 00:46:29.640
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.660
Have you done talks outside
of the state of California?

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:38.260
ASHANTI BRANCH: Yeah, we
got invited to Minnesota,

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.610
in the Minneapolis area.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.570
And they're screening--
we did a talk there.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.760
I was on the Minnesota
Public Radio.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.717
I'm going to be in
Texas in the summer.

00:46:49.717 --> 00:46:50.800
So we're doing a lot more.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.580
So right now, as we begin
to reach out-- but yeah,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.977
we do talks wherever
anybody wants us to come.

00:46:56.977 --> 00:46:58.560
AUDIENCE: So how do
we get in contact?

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.310
I would be very
interested for you to come

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.890
to Atlanta, Georgia for a talk.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.799
ASHANTI BRANCH: Fantastic.

00:47:04.799 --> 00:47:06.340
You have my information
on that card,

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.570
but if you want a
[INAUDIBLE] before we end,

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:08.960
I'll give you my information.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.990
I would love to do that.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.830
AUDIENCE: I appreciate it.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.288
ASHANTI BRANCH:
Thank you, brother.

00:47:12.288 --> 00:47:13.130
Thank you so much.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.796
AUDIENCE: Ashanti,
thank you for coming.

00:47:14.796 --> 00:47:16.130
This is super educational.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.700
I knew nothing
about the program.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.229
Super pumped.

00:47:19.229 --> 00:47:21.520
I want to thank these young
gentlemen who got up there.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.377
It took a lot of
courage to do that.

00:47:23.377 --> 00:47:25.460
And I know you're saying
they're on their iPhones.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.365
As a really shy kid growing
up, we didn't have iPhones.

00:47:29.365 --> 00:47:30.730
I had a piece of paper.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.290
I was told memorize it.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.360
And I thought you guys
did a really great job

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.730
articulating yourselves, and
articulating the program.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.390
So I just wanted to thank you
for participating in that.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.473
I think it was super cool.

00:47:45.284 --> 00:47:46.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.870
We saw him it at Wisdom
2.0-- one of the few standing

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:57.330
ovations of three days of
just heartfelt presentations.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.250
So I actually wanted
to thank your mom

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:03.150
for doing such a great job.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.830
I guess for those of us that
might be parents, be parents

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.300
down the road, how did
you do such a good job?

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:16.000
AUDIENCE: It took
a lot of prayer.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.660
Ashanti really was a good kid.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.740
He really was.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.600
I think only one time his
temper got the better of him,

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.000
and that was in
elementary school.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.880
And I think he turned over
a desk he was so upset.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.300
But I think that's the
only time where I can ever

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:39.340
remember having to
go to the school

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.810
to deal with a lot of
discipline with Ashanti.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.210
He was really a
good big brother.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.900
He was really a good first son.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.220
Does he have his moments?

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:49.730
Yes.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.160
But we all do.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.060
So that's why I had to
keep praying for him

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.830
and the rest of my children.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:02.760
And just-- life is life.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:08.890
With children, you have to
let them know, I love you.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:12.490
But one thing he knew,
when the teachers told me

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:17.280
he did something, I said,
I'm believing the teachers.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.830
I believe you, but I'm
believing the teachers.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.830
But he knew that I had
his back on things.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.590
But he knew that I
expected high of him.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:30.394
I remember one year when he
was getting ready to graduate.

00:49:30.394 --> 00:49:36.990
Ashanti said, well, I've decided
I'm not going to college.

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.890
I said, oh yeah?

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.530
You're not going to college?

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.030
Nope.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.590
I've decided I'm not
going to college.

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.040
I said, OK.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.560
Well just get ready because
you need to find a job.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.520
So that means that
everything you

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.990
will be paying for yourself--
your food, your clothes,

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.260
and everything, since you feel
you're not going to college.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.080
And I think he was
playing a game with me,

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.390
because he went to college and
won a bunch of scholarships.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.250
But I had to let him know
that's your decision.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.151
So we have to just
support our children.

00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:19.220
ASHANTI BRANCH: There's a
lot she's not telling you.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:23.400
I'm just gonna say I'm
gonna let that one go.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.030
Thank you, Mom.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.910
Thank you very much.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:25.640
ADAM QUAYLE: Thank
you for coming,

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.210
and thank you, Ashanti, for
sharing your wisdom with us.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.501
ASHANTI BRANCH: Thank you, man.

00:50:29.501 --> 00:50:30.810
Appreciate it.
