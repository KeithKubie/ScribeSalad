00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.610
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.450
In the video today, we're looking at that
time drilling an 14 inch hole accidentally

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.980
created a 1,300 foot deep saltwater lake out
of a formerly 10-foot deep freshwater one.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.420
Lake Peigneur is located in Louisiana near
the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.160
Before 1980, it was an approximately 10-foot
deep fresh water lake with an island in the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
middle.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.130
Next to it, and partially under it, Diamond
Crystal Salt Company maintained a salt mine,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.470
with salt being mined near the lake since
1919.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.620
Around large underground salt domes, you can
often find oil.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.570
As explained by one Dr. Whitney J. Autin,
"...salt moves upwards and it pierces through

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.170
surrounding strata... and this piercing produces
faults and folds within the surrounding sediments

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.699
producing an ideal mechanism to trap oil."

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.350
As such, Texaco was doing some drilling in
the lake.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.900
On November 20, 1980, crews on the oil rig
in the lake ran into a problem.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.180
At just over 1,200 feet, their drill seized
up.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.050
Not a major problem normally, they worked
to get it loose.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.989
In the process, they heard several loud pops
then the oil rig tilted like it was going

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:04.989
to collapse.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.090
The men got off the rig and to shore as quickly
as possible.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.520
Not a moment too soon.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.930
Just 19 minutes after their drill had seized
up, they watched from the shore as the 150

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.579
foot tall platform overturned and sunk into
the 10 foot lake...

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.310
Next, the astounded drillers watched as a
whirlpool slowly formed, soon reaching a quarter

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.660
mile wide and centered over the site of the
oil drilling.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.660
Whoopsadoodle.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.560
At the same time the oil workers were watching
their $5 million drilling rig disappear into

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.560
the lake, workers in the salt mines below
the lake noticed something was wrong as well;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.110
a stream of water was found flowing along
the floor of the mine shaft at about the 1,300

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.070
foot level of the mine, which went down to
about 1,500 feet at its deepest.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
As water wasn't supposed to be in the mine,
the evacuation alarm was raised.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.439
Foreman Randy LaSalle then drove a cart around
to the regions of the mine where the alarm

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.200
signal could not be seen, making sure everyone
knew about the evacuation.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.700
By the time those from the deepest areas of
the mine made it to the elevator, they encountered

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.189
knee-deep water.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.670
Despite the fact that the mine was rapidly
filling with water and the exit elevator could

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.500
only take up eight people at a time, all 55
miners were evacuated successfully.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.770
It wasn't clear to the miners what had happened
at the time, but from the evidence at hand,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.250
the theory is that the drilling crew miscalculated
their location and instead of being several

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.220
hundred feet from the salt mine, they had
instead been directly over a portion of it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.760
and penetrated the salt dome.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.260
The initial hole resulting from this mistake
was only 14 inches wide, but water spraying

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.580
in at extremely high pressure quickly widened
the hole.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.330
The water also dissolved the salt pillars
that supported the ceiling of the mine, causing

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.740
the shafts to collapse.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740
The widening of the hole and the collapse
of the mine gave strength to the whirlpool

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.460
on the surface of the lake, which caused major
damage.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.630
Docks, another drilling platform, a 70 acre
island in the middle of the lake, eleven barges,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.870
vehicles, trees and a parking lot near the
lake were all sucked into the mine below.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.590
The pull of the whirlpool was so strong that
it reversed the flow of the 12-mile-long Delcambre

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.000
Canal that drained the lake into the Gulf
of Mexico.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.090
Three hours after the first signs of trouble,
the three to four billion gallons of water

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.780
that had made up the lake were almost all
gone, having dropped into the mine below,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.370
leaving a gaping crater.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.060
The backward-flowing canal formed a 160 foot
waterfall that gradually refilled the lake,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.810
this time with salt water from the Gulf.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.310
The 10-foot deep freshwater lake was now a
saltwater one, now approximately 1,300 feet-deep.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.311
Amazingly, there were no human deaths or serious
injuries as a result of the disaster, though

00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.790
the ecosystem of the lake was forever changed.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.260
Further, three dogs died in the event.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.360
Many lawsuits were filed, all settled out-of-court,
costing Texaco about $45 million, or about

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.620
$130 million today, in damages, with about
70% of that going to Diamond Crystal.
