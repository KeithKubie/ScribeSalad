Who says a movie's best actors, jokes, or
references have to be put directly in front

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.350
of the audience? Whether it's thanks to a
total fluke, a relationship behind the scenes,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.560
or just a joke too good to pass up, an unexpected
or well-hidden cameo can make a good scene

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.359
into a great one. But fans have to notice
them first. Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.830
Movie Cameos You've Never Seen.&nbsp;

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.980
Scream
The late Wes Craven helped create the slasher

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.130
genre with movies like Nightmare on Elm Street
and The Hills Have Eyes, but when he returned

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.820
with the thoroughly modern Scream, he showed
he truly was the master of horror, regardless

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.780
of his age. To celebrate, Craven gave himself
a cameo as the school’s janitor, Freddy,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820
wearing the signature hat and striped shirt
of his other horror icon, Freddy Krueger.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.309
The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
Guy Ritchie set his skills on a 60s era Spy

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.079
adventure with this reboot, but relied on
a few of his friends from the modern age to

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.290
fill out the cast. But the most incredible
cameo is the appearance of English footballer

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.320
David Beckham as a Soviet projectionist, visible
on screen for just a few seconds.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.830
Ant-Man
When Scott Lang is first trying out his Ant-Man

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.220
suit, things don't go according to plan, winding
up crashing on top of a parked car. The driver

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.610
isn't random, though: but a cameo from former&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;Night
Live cast member Garrett Morris. Who just

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.500
happened to be the first person to play Ant-Man
in live action, during a superhero sketch

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.990
that took more than a few shots at Ant-Man's
strange abilities.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.560
Ghostbusters
Few actors have a longer filmography than

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.850
Ron Jeremy, but most of his roles are of the
adult variety. Still, the actor made himself

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
a memorable member of the Ghostbusters’
cast, appearing with his unmistakable moustache

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.060
as just an average New Yorker looking on as
the containment unit explodes at Ghostbusters

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.220
headquarters.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.290
Fellowship of the Ring
Peter Jackson may have cast Bret McKenzie

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.280
as one of the elves in his first Lord of the
Rings without giving it much thought. But

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.340
once The Flight of the Concords star was spotted
by fans, they exploded online. As a result

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.189
of their passion, Jackson found a place for
the unnamed elf to show up in the end if his

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:25.099
trilogy - with lines, this time!

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.629
Iron Man
Marvel's first shared universe superhero film

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.930
relied on a soundtrack of electric guitar,
which was actually performed by Rage Against

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.549
the Machine guitarist Tom Morello. As a thank
you for providing the music behind Tony Stark,

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.749
Morello got the honor of being the very first
member of the Ten Rings taken out by Stark's

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:49.180
first crack at an Iron Man suit of armor.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.930
The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug
Late night host Stephen Colbert revealed himself

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.379
to be a scholar of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth
over the years, which led to an incredible

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.140
role in The Hobbit movie trilogy. Few actually
believed that he had been given a part in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.560
Peter Jackson's movie, The Desolation of Smaug,
but he definitely did, hidden behind an eye

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.129
patch and ragged clothing amongst the residents
of Lake Town.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.599
X-Men Days of Future Past
This X-Men blockbuster literally rewrote the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.719
franchise's history, with mutants first revealing
themselves to the world in 1973. And director

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.389
Bryan Singer was there to capture it, behind
and in front of the lens. The director makes

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.081
a cameo doing - what else? - filming the showdown
between Magneto, Mystique and the rest of

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.599
the cast in France.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.650
Catch Me if You Can
It's an impossible story to believe, but the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.021
life of con man and professional liar Frank
Abagnale actually did happen the way the movie

00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:49.769
showed (for the most part). To make sure,
the real Abagnale was brought onto the film

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.480
as a consultant, and even makes an appearance
as the policeman arresting his younger self.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.640
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
When Marvel handed the reins of their Captain

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.090
America sequel over to the creators of the
TV comedy Community, fans didn't know what

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.659
to expect. What they got was an accomplished
action movie... but the Russo Brothers found

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.139
room for one fan-favorite cameo. Since Abed
was probably the only Community character

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.910
smart enough to earn a job at S.H.I.E.L.D.,
seeing actor Danny Pudi appear in the third

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.470
act actually made sense.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.640
Those are just a few of the cameos we've spotted
in some of our favorite movies but which ones

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.940
did we miss? Let us know in the comments,
