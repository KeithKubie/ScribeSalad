00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.640
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Hello, everybody.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.400
Thanks for coming out on a lovely
fall night here in Washington,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.420
DC and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.730
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.580
I'm the head of Poetry and
Literature Center here.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.760
And I'm thrilled and
delighted to kick off another

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.890 position:56%
of our Asian-American Literature
Today Series events, the first event

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.930
of the fall with this series.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.880
I want to thank our
presenting partners,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.730
the Asian-American Literary Review,
the Asian-American Studies Program

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.290 position:56%
at the University of Maryland, and
the Smithsonian Asian-Pacific Center

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.200
as well as poets and writers.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.520
And I want to thank Lawrence-Minh
Bui Davis who's at the center

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.960 position:56%
of all those organizations for his
hard work to keep this series going.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.080
Before we begin, let me just ask
you to turn off your cellphones

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.140
and any other electronic
devices that you might have

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.860
that will interfere with the event.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.090
I also want to let you know that
this event is being recorded

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.130
for future webcast and if you
choose to participate in the Q

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.190
and A session, you
give us permission

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.210
for future use of the recording.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
And also, let me tell you a
little bit about the Poetry

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.620
and Literature Center here
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.910
We are home to the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.970
Our 21st Poet Laureate
is Juan Felipe Herrera

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.230
and you can read all
about him online.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.430
In addition to taking
care of our Poet Laureate,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.840
we host three to four
public programs

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.190
like this throughout the year.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.610
We have information on the poetry
and literature center outside

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.000
in the foyer on the table.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.380
If you want to find out
more about the programs

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.240
like this, you can check that out.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.400
You can sign up for our RSS feed.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.930
You can also go to our
website, www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.290
So you've seen the program,
the order of events.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.930
I'm going to introduce -- to
introduce her but before I do that,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.980
let me just give a special shout

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.290
out to Kundiman's new Executive
Director, Rita Banerjee,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.590
who's in the very front row.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.390
Let's give her a warm welcome.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.910
And I'm happy to introduce
my dear friend, the poet

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.640
and Kundiman Advisory Board
Co-Chair, Jennifer Chang, to get up

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.740 position:56%
and tell you a little bit more about
tonight's featured readers as well

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.850
as moderate the discussion
afterwards.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.650
Thank you.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.710
[ Applause ]

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.120
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Hi, thank
you so much for coming.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.030
In preparation for today's reading,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.250
I asked the poets Aimee
Nezhukumatathil and Janine Joseph

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.870
to tell me about the first
time they met each other.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.920
Neither could remember a
first or second time and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.230 position:56%
yet both claim they didn't
remember ever not knowing the other.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.270
Nezhukumatathil wrote,
"I feel I've known Janine

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.800
since the formation of Kundiman.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.750
Admittedly, my research
yielded no empirical evidence.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.060
But I think it illustrates
how writing friendships

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.630
and writing communities, the
poems, stories and conversations

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.110
that animate in arts
culture can be atmospheric,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.470 position:56%
a kind of weather system that
crosses boundaries of time and place

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.720
to share experience that we feel
immediately perhaps intuitively

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.130
in our bones before recognizing
as a fact like temperature."

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.050
The fact is that Kundiman has
cultivated and nurtured a community

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.940
of Asian-American writers since
its first retreat in 2004.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.600
And it continues to connect
Asian-American writers

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.100
across generations and aesthetics
through organized readings

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.320
like this one, publication
opportunities and formal

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.100
and informal mentoring
relationships.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.640
You can find out more about
the specific accomplishments

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.410
of our fellows, faculty and staff
at the website www.kundiman.org.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.740
Today is all about
Aimee Nezhukumatathil,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.070
a two-time faculty member of the
[inaudible] and Janine Joseph,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.290
a fellow and a winner of the
2014 Kundiman Poetry Prize.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.160
If they themselves cannot
remember a first meeting,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.230
their poems suggest an ongoing
conversation, that dynamically

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.290
and persistently challenges
our conventional notions

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.830
of everyday life.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.990
In poems of childhood
memory, town life, motherhood

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.840
and the deceptively ordinary,
Nezhukumatathil uncovers the animal

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.060
and mythological, shining
a light on the strangeness

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.390
of tilapia, high school in Ohio.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.980
Joseph's personal lyrics are
fraught with the political

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.080
as she rewrites the
American dream as complicated

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.630
by her family's status as
undocumented immigrants.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.160
Hers is a poetics that attends
to these central fragmentation

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.150
of any narrative, formerly
rigorous yet riddled always

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.220
with doubt of self and world.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.130
These two poets remind
us that writing the songs

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.620
of one's self is neither a
[inaudible] nor lonely exercise

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.210 position:56%
and that to sing it all is to reach
out to other people, other cultures,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.890
and histories, and other
possibilities of thought and being.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.700
Aimee Nezhukumatathil is
the poetry editor of Orion,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.980
America's premier environmental
magazine

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.330

and <i>Miracle Fruit</i>
all from Tupelo Press.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.490
And her book of illustrated
nature essays,

<i>World of Wonder </i>is forthcoming
from Milkweed Editions.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.990
Janine Joseph's first
book is <i>Driving</i>

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.690
<i>Without a License </i>and it won
the 2014 Kundiman Poetry Prize

Channel </i>and <i>From My Mother's</i>

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.650
<i>Mother </i>.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.950
She's an Assistant
Professor of Creative Writing

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.600
at Oklahoma State University
in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.510
Please join me in giving a very
warm welcome to tonight's poets.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:53.460
[ Applause ]

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.990
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Leaving the
nonprofit immigration lawyer's

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.630
office, 2001.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.500
When the car drifted from the Santa
Ana winds, I switched off the radio

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.830
and pointed at the
street poles swaying

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.230 position:56%
over the two-way stretch like palms.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.100
All night, the wind brushed dry the
hills with fire and I kept driving.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.180
His hands steady out the
window taking snapshots

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.630
of the red, whipping rings.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.420
I power rolled the windows down
to let the smoked grass scent seep

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.550
into the upholstery,
circulate coyote

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.570
and birdsong through the air vents.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.300
"Can you smell the burning
mustard plants, the foxtail

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.720
and fox glove weeds on my skin?"

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.400
I asked. Hands open, the
wheel orbiting under my palms.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.110
Watch when I let go.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.490
I demonstrated, knuckles
loosening around the leather,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.050
the car coasting left with
pollen and butterfly debris.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.650
"We'd be pitched into the
brush glare," I warned.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.310
If I let go completely, we'd
grate the chain-linked fence

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.430
and itch the ashen shrubs.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.880
I shuddered slow at tumbleweeds
storming the undercarriages,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.390
storming the road.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.310
B said, "Right, like you'd let go."

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:23.250
Thank you, everyone for coming out
tonight to see Aimee and I read.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.980
Aimee is one of my literary heroes

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.050
so this is a really
surreal experience.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:35.290
Thank you to Rob and Anya, and Rita
and Kundiman, and Jen and Lawrence

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.670
for making this entire reading
and this collaboration possible.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.660
As Jen mentioned, I'm going to
be reading largely from my book

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:51.120
which just came out this past May
and the book follows an immigrant

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.810
from the Philippines who
is living in the U.S.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.560
without proper legal documentation.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.730
And the book is very much informed

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.680
by my own experience
having lived undocumented

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.960
in the U.S. for 15 years.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.020
I immigrated my family when
I was eight years old in 1991

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.280
and did not get my green
card until my first year

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.960
of graduate school at NYU.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.470
This next poem has so many parts.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.450
There's an epigraph which no
longer appears in the book.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.780
There are parts -- there are
sections and then there's language

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:36.150
that is lifted from the U.S. CIS
N-400 form for naturalization

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.300
as well as language that's taken
from a number of newspaper articles

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.700
about undocumented immigrants,
undocumented immigration.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.310
It's called <i>Between
Chou and the Butterfly </i>.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.080
And again, I'll begin
with the epigraph.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.710
And for each section,
I'll just pause.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.780
He does not know whether he is
Chou who dreams he's a butterfly

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.730
or a butterfly who
dreams he is Chou.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.980
Between Chou and the butterfly,
there was necessarily a dividing.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.800
Just this is what is meant

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.100
by the transformation
of things -- Zhuangzi.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.810
Between Chou and the butterfly.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:21.500
On my way to America, I am
in an airplane, on a boat.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.600
When my life is a story, I am a
good swimmer, an American dream,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.210
a guest worker, freeloader, fence
hopper, uninsured brother carried

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.820
from hospital to hospital,
a crushing case load,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.770
a wrenching anecdote, a
deserving young people and anchor.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.370
Before anyone finds me, I am
heartwood exposed by lightning,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.270
by the young Republicans,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.930
by newscasters playing find illegal
immigrant, find the unwed single,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.670
the crier, the spouse battered
by U.S. citizen spouse.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.510
Find the widower, the one
you will petition to marry,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.710
the headless bodies
in the Arizona desert.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:15.010
I hear they raid when you're naked
in bed, packed like a sardine,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.560
pillows tucked around you.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.490
I hear like dogs, like alien
relatives while you cry

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.630
and hug, they swarm.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.910
They ax your back door.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:31.670
The trunks of trees, they ax
the wild terrain, the scrub,

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.990
the rapid succession of sounds I
make when I walk alone and sweaty

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.170
and hardly myself in the dark

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.630
where a man migrating suffering
great pain is found hanging

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.130
from a tree later charred.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.230
According to eyewitnesses, I am
the same crazy, lost on my way

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.140
to dead man's tree, to the hallowed
tree of virgin in the valley

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.690
of the lost ones, in the
wilderness stripped of my underwear

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.470 position:56%
for the money stitched into the
seams, for mental status evaluation.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.720
A physical examination to
include complete disrobing.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.330
Worse than genital herpes, the
situation with these illegals

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.620
into the microphone,
says the interviewee.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.430
"I, the undersigned, am not
a communist and not likely

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.590
to become a public charge.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.710
I understand I do not traffic other
humans, recruit child soldiers.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.430
I do not seek to practice
polygamy, engage in espionage

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.220
in ordered genocide in items
A through L. I do not have

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.660

if I am not who I say I am.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.770
I may subject me to
permanent exclusion."

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.300
Landscape with American dream --

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.280
putting down the beets you got to
thinking my life had dead-ended

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.230
and we're serious and I agreed
but first, "I need capers

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.380 position:56%
and whatever is past the pimientos,"
I said and scanned the list.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.060
I needed the lemon glaze, the
stuff I craved on the ethnic lane

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.680
and still I had to sing of how
I walked a thousand hot miles

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.480
because my mom was Catholic
and pressed the white blouse,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.610
the blue jumper and
we were good people

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.120
and good people lent their good
cars to those in more need.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.570
It was like the distance from
here to the Philippines, I nodded.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.830
I MapQuested it once.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.800
And they -- my brothers, were
all eyes on their Gameboys,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.820
dodging potholes, snake holes
and anthills from Saint Francis

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.370
to who knows where we lived.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.780 position:56%
We walked so much my dad every night
kneaded the stiff backs of our shoes

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.420
so they wouldn't scallop our heels
when we walked lesson after lesson

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.500
without turning an ankle.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.400
What wrecks we were.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.800
What expert wrecks burning
down those sun sponged streets.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.970
Now look high muscle my stack
of avocadoes and hearts.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:21.040
See how I coast and carved
and fault my rootless cart.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.690
See how I course my
arm to say go and go.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.990
Do you wait for me?

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:31.490
Do you circle the lots quiet
loop while I lift into a run

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.210
like a dog dead and
slipped from her lease?

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.540
Do you brake?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.840
Do you idle?

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.050
Do you worry your arm from an aisle

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.470
like a table sauce
saying come, come?

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.280
I've a line to beat
and know double coupons

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.970
so do you strike up your shoes?

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:55.860 position:56%
Do you bare hand your grief and pump
it slack, lap after lap after me?

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.920
Come, bread roadster,
come American galloper,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.970
come bark with this
breath out with me.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.420
I have one final poem.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:18.290
I had a first career when
I was three years old.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.710
I was the face of a Kraft
Cheddar Cheese in the Philippines.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:28.000
And this title takes the -- takes
its name from part of a jingle

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.190
from a Kraft Cheddar
Cheese commercial from 1986.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.220
More milk, more milk
makes it better.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:44.060 position:56%
In 1986, when I was three-and-a-half
years old, I won an award

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:49.360
for sitting cute and biting into
a slice of Kraft Cheddar Cheese.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.860
Then how my star blew up.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.850
I was on the cover of
calendars in the Sunday section,

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.500
stomping the runway, turning
down small parts in movies.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.480
At seven, I promised my mom I
would never be chubby again.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.200
No way. I swirled a dress
in the dressing room

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.450
and was the daughter
my brothers hated.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.530
Nothing could stop
me, not even America

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.950
with its rich marshmallow cereals.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:24.380
But the milk, oh God, the
grade A vitamin D milk!

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.280 position:56%
No one knew what it was doing to me.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.030
Little Miss Piggy drinking eight
ounces by the kidney bean pool.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.480
All my life, it had been coconut
juice, mango juice, and water.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.130
Little Miss Piggy mending
her polka dot suit.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.490
It had been goat's
milk and goat's milk.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.200
Little Miss Piggy clasping
her knees to her chest

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.200
and winning the cannonball contest.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.700
I was small, indomitable and could
hide behind the couch with a stein.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.370
It was the drink of all the saints.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.360
It was worth all my work
in the world [laughter].

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.160
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.470
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Hello, everybody.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.960 position:56%
Thank you so much for being out
here -- the middle of the work week.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.010
I'm going to play just a little
snippet of something for you.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:37.020 position:56%
So I'm a child of the '80s, to carry
on the '80s theme here, Janine.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.460
And there was a drama
that was Emmy nominated.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.230
High schoolers wanted to
go around and visit them.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.950
They don't believe that this
happened or that it was possible.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.250
But there was a drama called "The
Incredible Hulk" and that was full

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.220
of my childhood crush, Bill
Bixby there [laughter].

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.520
So I know most high school --

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.870
this was not the stereotypical
like '80s crush at the time,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.520
Michael Jackson, Menudo, Ricky
Schroeder and all that stuff.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.800
But there was a song -- this
was the theme song of the show.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.010
And they played it at the
end of every said episode

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.310
so this is the Incredible Hulk.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.430
I don't want you to be thinking
of not the Avengers nonsense.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.230
This is --

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:26.050
[ Music ]

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.350
Do you guys know this show?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.850
Okay.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.050
[ Music ]

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.350
I swear [laughter].

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.170
If you don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.950
I think it's on FX
every once in a while.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.250
You have to see this.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.550
There was no special effects.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.940
It was Bill Bixby was the scientist
and then it would bad editing

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.480
and then Lou Ferrigno
played the Hulk.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.980
So this is what I learned
from the Incredible Hulk.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:19:01.120
When it comes to clothes, make
an allowance for the unexpected.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.950
Be sure to spare in the
trunk of your station wagon

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.790
with wood paneling is
not in need of repair.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.840
A simple jean jacket says,
"Hey, if you aren't trying

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.970
to smuggle rare Incan coins
to this peaceful little town

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.440
and kidnap the local
orphan, I can be one heck

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.690
of a mellow kind of guy."

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.360
But no matter how angry a man
gets, I learned that a smile

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.810
and a soft stroke on his
bicep can work wonders.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:34.360
I learned that male chests also
have nipples warm and established

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.470
and I learned that green
does not always mean envy.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.140
It's the meadows full of clover
and chicory that the Hulk seeks

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.460
for rest, a return to normal.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.330
And sometimes, sometimes a woman
gets to go with him [laughter].

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.250 position:56%
Her tiny hands correcting his
crumpled hair, the cuts in his hand.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.130
I watch it and know that green is
the space between water and sun.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.600
It's the cover for a quiet man,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.970
each of his ribs shuttling
drops of liquid light.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.280
I moved around a lot
when I was little.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.180
Various places all over
kind of rural America.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.030
My mother was a psychiatrist and
we always lived in these rural kind

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.560
of areas that had state hospitals.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.100
But I never felt lonesome
because my father --

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.540
and my parents were always
working, working, working.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.980 position:56%
But they always made sure that we
knew every constellation in the sky.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.930
From as long as I can remember,
we knew what the names of rocks,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.570
we knew the names of
plants and fruit.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.020
So that -- you know, even if I
didn't make friends right away,

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.530
at least then you could look up
and be kind of grounded and stuff.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.170
And this is called "Mosquitoes."

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:59.060
When my father wanted to point
out galaxies or Andromeda

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.310
or the Seven Sisters, I would
complain of the [inaudible]

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:09.220
of mosquitoes and the yawning moon
quiet in that slow summer air.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.020
All I wanted was to go
inside into our cooled house

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.230
and watch TV or paint my nails.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:19.010
What does a 15-year-old
girl know of patience?

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.770
What did I know of the steady turn

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.240
of whole moon valleys
cresting into focus?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.940
Standing there in our driveway with
him, I smacked my legs, my arms

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.820
and my face while I waited for
him to find whatever pinhole

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.340
of light he wanted me to see.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.330
At night, when I washed my
face, I'd find bursts of blood

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.530
and dried bodies slapped
into my skin.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.140
Complained at breakfast how
I'd never do this again, Dad.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.300
I have more homework now, Dad.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.030
I can't go to school with bites
all over my face anymore, Dad.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.780
And now, now I hardly ever say no.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.250
He has plans.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.430
He has plans to go star
gazing with his grandsons

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.060
and for once, I do not protest.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.830
He has plans.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.070
I know one day he won't ask me.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.950
He won't be there to show me how
the rings of Saturn glow in gold.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.940
Jump, if you catch it
on the right night.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:17.060 position:56%
I know one day I will look up into
the night sky, searching, searching.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.360
I know the mosquitoes will
still have their way with me

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.970
but I know my father one day won't
be there to hear me complain.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.780
I -- hang on one second.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:41.220
My father is from South India and
I have not been northern India

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.530
up where the Taj Mahal is
and I'm planning a big kind

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.010
of family trip out there.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.360
And kind of to my chagrin,
my surprise --

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.870
there are reviews of basically
all the wonders of the world now.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.490
Like there's Yelp reviews
of these places.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.680
I always say like the cesspool
of humanity is in the --

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.640
writ like the one-star
reviews of places.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.130
This is, and I started about
a little mini-series of poems

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.910
like one-star reviews of
the Great Wall of China.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.150
This is one-star reviews
of the Taj Mahal.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.970
This is all -- I found a poem,
all I did was break the lines.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.420
Too bad, it's manmade [laughter].

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.970
As a standalone attraction, I
guess it's passable but compared

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:35.070
to the McDonald's at
Celebration Mall, it's just meh.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.370
Not for Indians.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.620
Very, very tacky.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.570
There is no coat room
at the South Gate.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.940
The garden is basic.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.400
Everything is basic [laughter].

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.090
We were ripped off by asking
local shopkeepers to hold our bags

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.470
for us and you will be swarmed.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.240
Swarmed by street vendors,
and swarmed by children,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.150
and swarmed by camels, and
parking lot goons, and children,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.010
and cheat cameramen, and
stalker tourist guides,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.980
and camel children,
and footwear thieves.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.160
So I just want you to
know mind your belongings.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.980 position:56%
I guess it's just an old love story.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.210
But is it love or hate [laughter]?

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:22.280
Can you believe I was told to
get out with my selfie stick?

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.720
Don't even think about
seeing it under a full moon.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.130
And I want you to know this
tomb has no reds [laughter].

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:41.620 position:56%
One final one and this is the first
poem in my new manuscript, "Oceanic"

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.100 position:56%
and this is called "The Invitation."

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.810
Come in, come in.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.670
The water is fine.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.450
You can't get lost here.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.750
Even if you want to hide behind
the clutch of spiny oysters,

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.190
I promise I will find you.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.200
If you ever leave me at night by
boat, you will see the arrangement

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.780
of red-gold sun stars
in a sea of milk.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.440
And though it's tempting
to visit them, stay.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.590
I've been trained to gaze up all my
life no matter the rumble on Earth

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.370
but I learned it's okay to
glance down into the sea.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.410
So many lessons bubble up
if you know where to look.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.830
Clouds of plankton churning in open
whale mouths might send you east

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.590
and chewy urchins might
send you west.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.820
Squid know how to be rich
when you have ten empty arms.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.490
And can you believe there are
humans who don't value the feel

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.600
of a good bite, an embrace
at least once a day?

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.110 position:56%
Underneath you, narwhals spin upside

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.370
down while their singular
teeth needles you

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.000 position:56%
like a compass pointed towards home.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.620
If you dive deep enough,
where imperial volutes

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.600
and hatchet fish swim, you will
find all the colors humans have not

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.770
yet named and wide caves of
black coral and clamshell.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.000
A giant squid finally let itself
be captured in a photograph

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.340
and a paper nautilus ripple flashes
its scarlet and two kinds of violet

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.990
when it silvers you near.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.520
Who knows what will happen next?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.320
And if you want to look up, I hope
you see the dark sky as oceanic,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.140
boundless, limitless like all
the shades of blue in a glacier.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.460
Listen to how this planet spins
with so much of fin, wing, and fur.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.510
Thank you.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:36.170
[ Applause ]

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.470
&gt;&gt; Oh, you have [inaudible].

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.580
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Where do you want to sit?

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.380
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: I
was going to sit here.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.100
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: I feel like
we've been musical chairs today --

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
I know [laughter].

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.700
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
I know, I know.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Thank you
for that beautiful reading.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.960
[Inaudible] hear me?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.260
I have some questions for you.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.380
And I wrote them out
too because [inaudible].

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.600
I wrote them out because
I can't do anything adlib.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.900
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Okay, great.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.730
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Okay,
so I was trying to figure

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.240
out how you guys met each other
and you just -- you had no answer.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.380
But one of the recurring
possibilities was that you'd met --

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.490
I could be wrong -- at
the retreat at a workshop

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.530
and then Janine pointed out
that you'd never worked out.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.830
You'd never made it
to the classrooms.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.080
I was thinking about
teaching and pedagogy

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.440
and since you're both
writers who write --

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.360
writers who teach creative
writing, I was very curious

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.870
about how you teach,
how your experience

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.710
in workshops have shaped
you as a writer,

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.720
how your writing informs
your workshop?

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.520 position:56%
And I'm asking this, pardon me, from
a two to one perspective thinking

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.620
about the [inaudible] years ago
where he basically made plain

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.170
to everyone what [inaudible]
have always known

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.040
that the creative writing
workshop has been very exclusionary

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.050
to discourses of race, and
identity, and other kind

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:22.920
of normative otherness
and things like that.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.670
[Inaudible] of otherness
[inaudible].

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.070
So my question -- sorry
to be so long winded --

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:35.210
is about identity in crafts and
whether identity could be integral

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.630
to crafts and how your experiences

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.240 position:56%
in workshop have helped you figure
these things out as writers but also

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.540
as teachers of creative writing?

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.210
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
I'll start -- it's a great --

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.890
it's a fantastic question.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.320
And there's lots there to attack.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.620
So I'll just [inaudible]
the [inaudible].

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.920
Yeah, this is funny.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.050
I'm going to just like I'm
trying just a little bit of it.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:05.300
I will tell you -- so I went to
Ohio State for my grad program

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:11.750
and it was a pretty lonesome
time in the classroom.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.710
I was not lonesome
outside of the classroom.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.850
Go Bucks! But sorry
-- it's so obnoxious.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.610
We're number two in the country
in college football and I have

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.460
to always drop that every time.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.090
So but I will say there was
a poem, I remember it was --

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.610
it's very kind of formative.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.190
I've never forgotten it.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.050
I was writing about a visit to
my grandmother in South India

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.520
and it's this beautiful
place in Kerala.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.020
I don't know if you --
if anybody's been there.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.520
It's so gorgeous they
call it the Emerald Coast.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.320
I remember one person my
workshop was like, "Eh,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.490
I don't buy this is India.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.140
I mean, where's the poor people?

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.440
Where's the pollution?"

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.620
And, you know, that kind of thing.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.260
And I was just, you know,
you have to be poker faced

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.050
when people are talking
about your poems.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.540
But it just kind of broke my heart
in many different ways that A,

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.450
someone -- I had to kind of
you know, if they said, "Oh,

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.460
your line break is raw, I
could take that," you know.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.920
But if like it was just because
of the kind of insularity

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.010
of not being able to imagine that
a country could be beautiful,

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.310
you know, that kind of thing.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.750
So that was -- and nobody had
really kind of jumped in once

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.990
that person started then
the whole thing was like,

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.420
Yeah, more pollution.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.720
Add some noise.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.320
Add some -- I mean, to the point
we were like heaven forbid,

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.410
I write about beauty
and in that in a place.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.670
And there's definitely like
scary sketchy places in DC

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.430
but there's also beautiful
places in DC as well.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.930
So I don't know if that necessarily
answers your question but I know

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.700
that I was thinking back then
if I ever get to a situation

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.560
where I'm leading a workshop,
none of that is going

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.320
to be tolerated in my workshops.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.860
And it never has been.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.870
And more than that, I just -- you
know, I think we were always kind

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.150
of trained -- write what you
know, write what you know.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.100
So if people in the workshop
are only writing what they know,

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.110
it is hard to kind
of make commentary

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.410
on things that they don't know.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.460
You know, that kind of thing.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.530
Lucille Clifton has
this great quote.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.430
She says, "I don't write
out of what I know.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.630
I write out of what I wonder."

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.670
So I'd like that as almost
a teaching mantra too.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.590
Like what else -- or what
are the possibilities rather

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.940
than what is this poem trying
to be through my limitations?

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.240
You know, that kind of thing.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:35.280
So it's kind of a vague answer but
I don't know if you want to tackle?

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.130
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Sure, I feel like
I had an answer that I was thinking

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:44.670 position:56%
of and then I got so carried away
with her story and then I was trying

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.810
to think if the poem that you
were talking about was "Wrap?"

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.110
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Actually, it was [laughter].

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.410
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: That's great.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.720
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: It's
amazing you know like those were

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.780
from my very, very first book
which was my thesis actually.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.080
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah, so --

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.780
that's a poem that I teach
to my students all the time.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.760
It's actually a poem that
I've used for Job Talk.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.060
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Oh no [laughter].

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.360
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: So thanks
for giving me a job [laughter].

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.070
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
I'll accept that.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.980
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: But I really hear
you with this experience of just,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.690
you know, feeling kind of lonely.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.830 position:56%
For me, my workshop experience, I
think, was just incredibly different

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.530
because when I was in -- when I
was doing my undergraduate studies,

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.830
[inaudible] during my MFA.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:30.360 position:56%
I was still dealing or at least part
way through my MFA with the fact

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.820
that I was undocumented and I had
not come out and it was something

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.420
that I was not able to articulate
in the space of the workshop.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:43.230 position:56%
And so I -- ever poem that I brought
in, people would just kind of try

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.730
to guess as to what was
going on in the poem.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.990
And usually that would mean
that I would have to speak

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:53.150
to my professors during my office
hours, and kind of explain to them

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.420
in confidence what it was
that I was trying to do.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.690
Because I knew that whatever was
going to happen in the workshop,

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.420
you know, they can guide
me in terms of line breaks.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.330
They can say this image
is not working.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.590
But you know, I also
still had feedback

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.500 position:56%
that was like, "Where are the cacti?

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.820
Where is the border wall?"

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.050
And I would -- I had come
from the Philippines.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.360
I flew right into LAX.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.120
So my experience was
not the experience

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.080 position:56%
of undocumented immigrants that
people had imagined in the workshop.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.520
And so for me, the workshop
was incredibly difficult.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.620
But I learned line breaks and
I learned how to craft image

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.410
and metaphor and I would
say that maybe as a teacher,

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.660
I try to be really aware
of the world that is out --

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.130
living outside of the poem
because for me it's true

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.280
because the workshop
was the lonely place.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.340
I found that some of the joy that
I was able to bring into my life

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.620
when I was an undergraduate and
when I was working on my MFA

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.780
and probably even through
the PhD was through a lot --

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.240 position:56%
a number of community organizations.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.280
So for example, when I was
in Houston working on my PhD,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.740
I was working with writers in
the schools that I got to work

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.870
with like second and third graders.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.050
And for them, you know,
like rainbows popping

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.310
out of their hearts is the most
brilliant thing in the world.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:14.610
And I actually even bring in
those poems written by my second

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.800
and third graders into the
graduate level workshop as a way

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.930
of reminding, I think,
my students of the joy

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.460
that is existing outside
the workshop.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.740
And just to kind of keep pushing
them to draw from the world that is

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.550
around them so that we just
don't get stuck in the workshop

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.960
and the workshop mode
and the thinking

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.680
that goes on in the workshop.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.350
Which also includes you know,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.570
making sure that I
actively am teaching a lot

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.560
of contemporary work too, you
know, to give them the sense

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.440
that poetry is very much alive.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.030 position:56%
Because you know, when I was reading
some really -- like really, really,

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.490
you know, canonical works
in my workshops, you know,

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:56.760
sometimes that was helpful but then
you know, there was no experience

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.880
that I felt could in
any way guided me

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.560
and then how I wanted
to live my life maybe?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.930
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Yeah, I
guess, that means really ironical

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.260
that the poems that helped
you through the experience

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.930
of lonely workshops was
Aimee's poem [laughter].

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.230
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.160
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: I did
not plan this at all [laughter].

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.990
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: But then
also, I mean, also it speaks

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.320
to what you were both doing was
looking for other curriculums

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.160
in other spaces and -- is
there something you would say

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.670
about identity as a kind
of element of craft?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.690
I mean, how do you -- how
do you respond to students?

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.400
Do you think workshops are
changing now is what I'm saying,

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.210
especially since you're
in a teaching position?

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:41.510
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: Sure,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:46.650
I think just one tangible way it's
changing is that the insistence

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:52.880
of italics of foreign words is
not -- it's not a mandate anymore.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.800
You know, before, if I used a
word like -- it's not even --

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.450 position:56%
"bangus" which is a specific type of
Filipino fish, people would be like,

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.160
"I don't know what that is
because I've never heard of this.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.550
You must italicize it."

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.350 position:56%
So we would be like -- so on a craft
level, it seemed the wrong move

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.290
to me because I don't
say, "Hey, Justin,

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.510
would you like a dinner of bangus?"

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:22.060
[ Laughter ]

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.890
And not, you know, so --
but I felt like it was

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:30.180
like just putting this spotlight
on something whereas I think now,

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.600
more and more, I'm so pleased
when I see just this vibrancy

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.350
and this -- of language in there.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.810
So it's not -- so I'm
not even aware of like --

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:45.620
so this small little detail on
craft but I'm not nearly as kind

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.460
of nervous as I was about throwing
in foreign words in there as well

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.320
because that's -- that's the world.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.620
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.520
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: There's,
you know, we delve into Spanish

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.980
and French just without
even knowing it.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.200
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
Without telling you.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.500
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.800
Exactly.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.100
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: I would
say the internet has really

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.400
helped [laughter].

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.700
I mean, you know, if I think
about my experience especially

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.790
as an undergraduate because I would
have those workshop moments too

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.510
where someone would say, you know,
"Can you change those English words

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.320
to something in Tagalog," right?

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.780 position:56%
And then -- so in the revised
version, I would just add it, right,

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.250
like a word in Tagalog
and I would think,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.140
I don't even talk this
way with my family.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:27.850
Like -- and also like I was, you
know, there were words that I --

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.120
that were reserved for the
family and there were words

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.570
that I didn't feel like putting
into my poems because for me,

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.340
that workshop space was not
necessarily a familial space.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.740
But then -- so you know, as people
are kind of throwing up these words

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.070 position:56%
with [inaudible] ideas, you know
like put more like dessert in there,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:48.150 position:56%
like if your speaker is undocumented
like -- my God, like put the cactus,

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.940
put all of these other
things in there.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.970
Like now, that's an
opportunity in the classroom

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.010
to say like, "Let's
do some research.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.310
Let's [inaudible].

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.610
Let's do an image search."

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.070
It's like you know, it's a way of
just like expanding the vocabulary

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.380
of all of the students in the room.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.940
I mean, not necessarily
say that what we would pull

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.040
up on Wikipedia would in any
way help, you know, the poem.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.550
But again, just as a kind of
reminder that the world is

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.940
so much larger than
what we understand even,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.100
you know, sitting in our desks.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.650
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Well, you bring
up "Wrap" which I didn't expect you

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:25.410
to do because I was thinking
about wrecks especially Janine.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.920
I don't know the poem by
Aimee or I don't remember it.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.410
But the word "wreck" comes
up a lot in your book.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.860
And you have a poem called "Wreck."

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.560
And it struck me as very
descriptive of the consciousness

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.790
of your speakers but also the
kind of provisional [inaudible].

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:46.880
And so maybe there's a way to
think about wreck as poetics.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.690
So I wonder if you
could talk a little bit

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:53.890
about why this was important
to you, maybe it has to do

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.290
with Aimee [laughter] or maybe
there is a kind of poetic element

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.370
to thinking about wrecks --
everything is kind of a wreck.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.110
You're a wreck.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.630
The poem's a wreck.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.560
America's a wreck [laughter].

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.860
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Why
do we talk [inaudible]?

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.940
Why do we talk a lot about
wrecks but I think --

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
You guys [inaudible].

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.540
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Wrap
-- yours is "Wrap."

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.840
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.140
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Wrap, wrap, wrap.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Oh right.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.740
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Which
is very close to wreck.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.040
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
Yeah, yeah [laughter].

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.300
You're the wreck and
you're the wrap [laughter].

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.910
But why wreck?

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.410
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: So
in 2008, my father

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.520
and I were involved
in a car accident.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.820
We were hit from behind by a driver

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.190
who the police had estimated
was going anywhere between 50

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.550
to 70 miles an hour

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.060
on a semi-residential road
just based on the damage alone.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.300
So a small PSA, don't
text and drive.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.680 position:56%
So in that car, I mean, we survived.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.980
Both of us survived.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.000
We were in the Subaru so that
was my commercial [laughter].

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: I guess you were.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.270
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: I
mean, yes [laughter].

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.580
So my -- you know, we
both had like bruising.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.910
My dad had a hairline
fracture in his collarbone

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.100
but I had suffered a pretty severe
concussion and was pretty much

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:12.280
on a loop about a 20-second
loop for days on end.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.470 position:56%
And so that poem, the poem "Wreck"
that's in my book writes this out of

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.490
that particular experience
but I would say

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.610
that it actually did something
in terms of my poetics in a way.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:27.210
I mean, I hadn't been thinking
about wreck before that.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.410
But I was in the middle -- or maybe
about three-fourths of the way

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.640
through this manuscript
when I had the concussion

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.340
and my memory was gone.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.250
I had no idea what I was writing.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.550
I didn't know who I was.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.640
I started confusing
myself with the speaker

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.330
that though she's very much
based from my life, she's not me.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:50.320 position:56%
So I spent, you know, quite some
time trying to figure out who I was,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.910
who she was and my
various identities.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:41:00.090
And that changed very much with my
poetics because I relied so much

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:06.420
on my memory and I relied so much
on being able to craft a narrative,

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.610
right, so take all these different
experiences that I've had as a way

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.470
of like linking them together
to say something much larger

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.410 position:56%
about the family, about immigration.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.720
And suddenly like, those
memories were all gone

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.100
and all those ties were
completely severed.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.370
But here's the thing.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.550
One of the very first
things that came to me

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.170
after that accident
was you are a poet.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.950
And I had no idea what that meant.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:37.090
And I had no idea what to do
with that word or this identity.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:41.030
But I remember lying down in
bed and it was just there.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.160
And I was like, "Oh, interesting!"

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.460
[Laughter] Right?

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.810
So it came to me.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.780
Nothing else came to me, only that.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:55.350
You know, I didn't even remember
why I had like a neck brace on.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.860
But this identity came back
to me and in that way --

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.380
I don't know, it kind
of taught me to trust

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.100
that the words would
always come back?

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.410
Which maybe is not something that
I would say if something I was

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.440
like hit with dementia,
right, or like something else.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.740
I know that very much.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.590 position:56%
I'm saying that in the space of like
some kind of privilege and some kind

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.870
of able-bodiedness
but that came back.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.240
The words started coming back.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.930
And it just kind of reshaped how I
thought how a poem could be made.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.840
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: So I have
to ask -- there's a poem --

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.430
you write it actually,
it's <i>Landscape</i>

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.560
<i>with American Dream</i>
and there's that moment

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.410
where the speaker speaks
about her two brothers.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.270
We are all wrecks.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.570
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: What
wrecks we were.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Yeah,
what wrecks we were.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:45.570
What expert wrecks burning down
those sun spun [laughter] streets.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.050
So was that before or after?

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.410
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: That was before.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Oh my God!

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.720
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: That
was before [laughter].

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.530
All those poems about
driving without a license

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.820
and driving cars was all before
-- before the wreck, yeah.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.480
But I don't know, what
wrecks we were sounded better

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.510
than like what hot messes we were.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:10.070
[ Laughter ]

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: This
next question is for Aimee.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.380 position:56%
Aimee, I've always admired your work

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.670
for its almost scientific
engagement of nature.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.650
And that reading the books again,
sort of those conversation,

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:25.920
I was also realizing, there's also
a lot of history in the books.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.240
And it was kind of
like an entanglement

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.910
between history and nature.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.210
I'm thinking about poems like
[Inaudible], a natural history

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:37.320
of the color red, reference
folklore,

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.730
[inaudible] tales, [Inaudible].

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:43.210
So I wonder if you could talk a
little bit about that relationship

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.580
between history and the environment

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.340
and maybe perhaps how it
figures in our new work.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.170
I think that you're writing
more about history now too.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.690
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
You know, oh my goodness,

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:57.320
these are all such
brilliant, brilliant questions.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:03.280
So trying to figure out nature
and history and the whole swirl

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.940 position:56%
of things and mythology and
folklore, you know, these are things

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.050
that I've been -- I feel
so cheesy saying it.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.830
I am such a complete nerd and I --

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.130
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: I
knew that [laughter].

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.430
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
I am aware of this,

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.490
I know and she still
loves me but so --

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.300
I don't remember a time

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.860
when my parents would just
take me to the library.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.910
I never -- I didn't know novels.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.340
I didn't know stories.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.590
What I would do -- my idea
still of a good time is --

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:37.560
and I'm hesitant to even say this
out loud but is to read a book

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.930
about shells like -- or the giant
squid, or to curl up by a fireplace

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.000
and read about minerals
and gems like,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.300
I'm still that same little girl.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.820
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: But
the history is kind of is

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.660 position:56%
to get judged by your approach so --

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.670
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
It is, it is.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.260
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: -- in your
[inaudible] you were writing

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:58.020
about history kind of
transformed to contemporary era

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.450
and how we deal with the past.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.160
You're just like we
don't deal with the past.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.460
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
That's true.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.760
That's true.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.060
And I think -- I think
for a lot of it is

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.950
as that little girl reading these
books on science and, you know,

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.610 position:56%
biography so I did like biographies.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:17.070
That to me like you know,
Harriet Tubman, Anne Boleyn --

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.780
these are all like women I
just were so fascinated by.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.630
And as a grown-up, I'm
still fascinated by them.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.110
With the rare exception,

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.580
Harriet Tubman was a
very, very rare exception.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.650
I never saw any brown girls in any

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.590
of these books about
nature, history.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.310
I mean, it was very much kind of
a footnote, that kind of thing.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.670
And so I don't think I
ever sit at my desk to say,

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.910
"I will now insert a brown
girl now in history."

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:48.850
But it's a way for me to kind
of find my place in this whole,

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.900
you know, thing called history.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.980
You know, but also to see
my relation to science,

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.880
my relation to the outdoors, why do
we not see any brown girls outside

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.960
of nature writing as often,
you know, still and it's 2016.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.470
So do brown girls not
like the outdoors?

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:07.770
I know that's not true.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.500
But why are they not
writing about her

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.770
or why are they not
being published in places

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.040
like <i>Outside Magazine</i>
or things like that?

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.170
So it's all very complicated but
I think it's borne from a place

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.260
of not seeing anybody
who looks like myself.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.560
And when I say brown girl,

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.580
I would have been happy
with a Latina, you know.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.930
I would have been happy by a half
-- you know, any, any, anything.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.740
But it was all from this kind
of Caucasian male point of view

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.170
which was great and I was
still entranced and enchanted

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.700
but I think now, especially
there's a lot of girls coming up.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.440
When I visit elementary schools and
high schools that are so excited

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.820
about science, so excited
about nature and they want

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.170
to see themselves in
books of them as well.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.620
So yeah, I mean, it's really
kind of just a refiguring

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.690
of what is my [inaudible] --

00:46:56.690 --> 00:47:00.750
so much of my first kind of
early workings were you know,

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:03.290
coming of age narratives
of my own life.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.380
Now, I'm just wanting
to look outward.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Yes, it's just
like you're trying to find a way

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.960
to write other histories
that already exist.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.400
And so maybe this is a question I
may ask you guys is what are you

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.970
trying to write that you don't
-- that you find is missing?

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.410
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Well --

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:22.710
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.180
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Well, I mean, for
me, of course it was just writing

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.040
through my undocumented
experience especially,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.800
being someone who's coming
from the Philippines.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:37.210
Now the new work is exploring both
the car accident, the memory loss,

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.010
the concussion, and
all of that good stuff

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:44.080 position:56%
because that was also happening
[inaudible] time that I was applying

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.430
to become a naturalized citizen.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.780
So my memory was wiped
out the same exact time

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.820
that I was becoming an
American [laughter].

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.880
Which again, right, like it's
part of me writing myself into --

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: You have to --
in other words, you [inaudible].

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.360
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: [Laughter] I
know, I know [laughter] but so much

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.750
of that is me writing
myself into this narrative

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.910
that is so far being controlled.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:09.510
I mean and I think just my
experience in the workshop

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.400
when people say like,
"Put in the cactus.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.700
Like put in an amiga."

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.280
Right, like and me putting
it in there and having --

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.070
and then having to go research a
little bit and then saying, "Wait,

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.370
why -- what is happening here?"

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:24.090
And I remember a workshop
that I was in --

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.960
or I was sitting in office hour's
poet [Inaudible] and he was trying

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.700
to understand what it
was that I was doing.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.970
And I finally said, "I am trying to
write the girl out of the desert."

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:34.940
And he was like, "All right.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.710
That's a starting point."

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.300
And so I just started
removing all of this --

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.640
all of the desert landscape that
I had not personally experienced,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.510
right, like that was
not my experience.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.550
And I was writing what they knew.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:53.790
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: That's
so interesting about writing out --

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.440
writing the desert -- like
taking the desert away

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.740
from the narrative, right?

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.040
It makes it, you know, yeah --

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.760
it makes no sense that
anybody who knows you knows

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.080
that desert does not
apply to your life.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.130
Right now, I'm working on
essays actually so not poems.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.360
And although poems are always
kind of popping up here and there.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.110
Right now, I think [inaudible]
from a gender earlier --

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:18.520 position:56%
I'm about 50% done with a collection
of [inaudible] nature essays

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.210
and they're also being illustrated.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.360
So that's been an interesting
process.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.800
It's the book basically
that I wished, you know,

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.900
again that I was reading in
high school or something.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.230
And it's about kind of the
wonders that kind of don't get --

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:37.420
the wonders of the animal and plant
world that don't get talked about.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.430
It came -- the nuggets
of it came from --

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.730
there's a poem I was researching

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.050
in <i>Lucky Fish </i>where
I was researching,

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.730
I was reading about pygmy rabbits.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.990
And as I was composing the poem,
I just -- as I do on a normal day.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.840
You know, just reading
pygmy rabbits [laughter].

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.000
And before I could
finish drafting the poem,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.380 position:56%
the last pygmy rabbit on Earth died.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.940
Like on Earth died -- so
that was the first time.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.240
It was so stunning.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.540
I kept saying, "Wait
-- wait a minute.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.840
Not the last one?

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.570
That was not the last, last one.

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.530
It was the last one on Earth."

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:15.100
So that to me kind of
shook up my whole --

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.880
you know, I think you
mentioned the internet before.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.330
And I loved pouring over it -- I go
to the, you know, the [inaudible]

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.980
and research facilities all
over the country and talk

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.450
with botanists and things.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.310
But it is very easy to just
be able to click and see.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.990
There's now, you know, webcams you
can check on you know, sea lions,

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.730
and manta ray, or whatever,
you know, that kind of thing.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:40.380
But yeah, the last pygmy rabbit was
gone so there became an immediacy

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:44.520
for me about all the kind of --
the plants and animals that I loved

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.270
as a little girl and encountered
basically throughout my readings,

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.950
you know, to the present day.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.700
Doing small little snippets
so nothing's over five pages

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:01.460
but it's a small kind of lyric
meditation with about maybe 10%,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.460
you know, memoir kind of thrown in.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.080
But it's really, the focus is on
these strange and beautiful animals

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.890
and plants that are
maybe not really thought

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.480
of as beautiful and
strange by people.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:19.170
So the comb jelly, the narwhal is
one of my favorites and people --

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:23.620
if you guys know a narwhal, the
skin is mottled so it looks --

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.160
it comes from the Norse
word for corpse basically.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.410
So it's not really -- you
don't really see any stuff.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:31.200
Maybe now, you see some stuff
on narwhals but not very much.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.050
It looks like floating
corpses, a whole pod of them.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.740
But they have a tooth that sticks.

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.780
It's punctured through its skin
so it's not really a huggable --

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.660
nobody really says like, "Oh,
you're my little narwhal."

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.320
You know [laughter],
nothing like that.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.820
But I love those kind of things.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.230
So that's terrific
for me [laughter].

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.290
I know, I told you
I was such a dork.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:51.590
I'm such a nerd.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Well, Aimee, I
think it's time to ask the audience

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.460
if they have any questions.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.670
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: And if you
don't mind, I'll just [inaudible]

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:08.320
so we can make sure you capture
the question on videos --

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.620
so again, please raise your
hand, I'll turn on the mike.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: No pressure, okay.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello. Why is there so much anger

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:27.390
and fear regarding the
undocumented in this country?

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:28.690
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
Janine [laughter].

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.880
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: It's all
over the news [laughter].

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.780
Well, so do you mean
regarding the undocumented

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:41.560
or being someone who's
undocumented because I think

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.690
so much of that overlaps, right?

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:49.930
I mean, I -- I'm trying to think
of a way to answer that question

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:54.530 position:56%
without generalizing the experiences

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:57.880
of immigrants particularly
undocumented immigrants

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.260
because undocumented
immigration or --

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.060
and immigration in general
is just not created equally.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.820
You know, when people say
that the system is broken,

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.670
here's one example.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:12.520
I immigrated as I mentioned,
when I was eight years old.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.890
It was 1991 and when I found
out that I was undocumented,

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.900
it was during my senior
year of high school

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.930
when I actually got back my --

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.550
the report after filling out
my [inaudible] where it said

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.420
that you were not a citizen.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.010 position:56%
You can't get any funds for college.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.420 position:56%
I was graduating as a valedictorian.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.070
But when I visited, when I went to
see a nonprofit immigration lawyer,

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:42.260
he had pretty much spelled out that
the paperwork for people coming

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:47.450
from the Philippines was
so far behind that in 2001,

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:51.830
they were still working
on applications from 1990.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.630
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Oh geez.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.930
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: So
when people write --

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.520
so there right, like
there is that anger,

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.800
there is that pain,
there is that sadness.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:05.410 position:56%
And he pretty much just told me that
what I needed to do was get pregnant

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.220 position:56%
which I didn't do [laughter], right?

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:12.200
So I mean, I feel like maybe
just offering that little kind

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.280
of specific tidbit might --

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.360
in help inform like why this is
such a frustrating experience.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.810 position:56%
And I think, you know, if you're
someone from the outside looking in,

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.700
it can be really frustrating

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.250
if you don't understand how the
immigration system works, right?

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:33.120
Like when people say like go
to the back of the line like --

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.510
it probably doesn't exist
and if it does, it exists --

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:40.630
there are so many lines,
so many -- so many lines.

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:44.650
I mean, that's just
specifically the Philippines.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:46.500
You know, it may -- someone coming

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.130
from Europe might have an
entirely different experience.

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:54.630
&gt;&gt; Just as a follow up, I wonder if
you had people talk about how poems

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.920
as a forum allowed you -- or helped
you to address that sense of --

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:04.830
that sense of identity
and shifting and you know.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.030
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: So I actually had
first started out writing a novel.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:13.580
So after I found out that I
was undocumented and had filled

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.790
out the paperwork to go to
community college, I decided then

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:18.600
that I was going to
write a novel, right?

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.140
BecauseI thought I have a story
to tell and for some reason,

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.340
at that time, you know, when I was
just barely graduating high school,

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.330 position:56%
I thought the only way to tell
stories was through writing a novel.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.860
And I got maybe about 70
pages into that and realized

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:37.460
that I couldn't tell that story,
right, because I had no way

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.130
of being able to tell a
straightforward narrative.

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:44.720
And so pretty much, I deleted that
-- no, I didn't really delete that.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.020
It exists [laughter].

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.780
But no one will ever see it, right?

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.260
I think it's on a floppy disk.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.130 position:56%
But you know, writing through poetry
allowed me to break up that kind

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.190 position:56%
of straightforward narrative the way

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.380
that maybe most people
understand immigration, right,

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:04.120
which is that a family
comes from another country.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.420
They have this American dream.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.490
They apply for paperwork and then
they become Americans, right,

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:11.220
and that's the end
of the story, right?

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.950
It has this nice clear arc.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:15.010
And my arc certainly
was not that way.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.360
And my family was a mixed
status family, right.

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.170
So even within my family,
we all had very,

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:25.000
very different experiences
with immigration.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.400
And being able to write about
that through poetry, right,

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.700
where there was this central idea,
central theme, central experience

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.380
that I can approach the
multiple angles like for me,

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.680
poetry was the way to do it.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.950
I mean, maybe if I had taken a, you
know, gone to graduate school first

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:42.080
and figured out how to write a
more complicated novel [laughter]

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.760
like I said, this is chapter one.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.140
I just noticed my [inaudible] --

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.580
my chapters were getting
smaller and smaller.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.510
I was becoming more
and more secretive.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.530
[ Laughter ]

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:54.860
&gt;&gt; I wanted to [inaudible].

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.970
Since this is a Kundiman featured
event, I wonder if the three

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:02.300 position:56%
of you had actually talked about the
importance of Kundiman to you both

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:10.690
in terms of your writing and in
terms of your sense of community.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:11.990
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil:
That's very sharp.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.510
Sure, Kundiman for me has been --

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:22.500
and observing in its capacity
as a faculty member and I think,

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:27.950
a staff member of the most
-- this most recent summer,

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:35.420
and it's the kind of community and
group that I wish was in existence

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.900
when I was an undergrad,
when I was a grad student.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.750
It is a place where I
think, and I don't --

00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:47.860
I don't know how else to describe
it without sounding cheesy

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.490
so I'm just going to say it.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:59.250
But it is like instant family
when you walk into a room,

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:03.580
like that's absolutely
not scripted that Janine

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.340 position:56%
and I can't remember if we ever met.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.700
Because I feel like it's been,
you know, well over a decade.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.800
I know that's not true.

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.190
But I don't remember like
it's suddenly with the --

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.800
so with the internet, I was lucky.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.850
I guess I've never been
so lucky in some ways

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:27.250
that there was no social media
when I was in grad school.

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.550
There was a small bit of sadness
though in knowing that I think

00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:36.550
if there was such a media, I think
I would have been able to connect

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.880
with poets from around the
country -- and not just, you know,

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.280
Asian-American poets but just poets
in general around the country.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:52.160 position:56%
But I think what sets Kundiman apart
is that there is an absolute freedom

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.730
to risk on the page as
well as risk off the page.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:02.550
In terms of just being able
to say like, "Hey, you know,

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:11.540
I'm undocumented," and that's not
the main thing that a person sees

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.350 position:56%
about you or being Filipino, half --

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:20.150 position:56%
or half-Filipino, half-Indian is
not the first thing that people see.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:23.090
It's definitely a part of me

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.230
but it's not the main
kind of thing of me.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:31.870
And so it's a lot of
freedom from explaining.

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:35.050
It's a lot of freedom to just kind
of get busy on the page and to have

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:36.420
that immediate kind of
support in that capacity.

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:37.720
And I've never -- this is
my 15th year of teaching.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.090
I tallied this up not too
long ago and I was stunned.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:40.680
So 15 years of teaching at
the college level and I want

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.210
to say I have seven writers
of color in my classes total.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:43.510
And I live in a rural
kind of a place.

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:44.810
But that's -- it makes me so
sad, you know that kind of thing.

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:46.590 position:56%
So when I teach at Kundiman, it's
amazing to see a room full of people

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:48.000
who look like me, you know it's,
frankly, I mean, it's just --

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.320
it's amazing when I have
never had that before ever.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Yeah.

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:51.920
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: So
I'm a Kundiman fellow.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.220
I graduated in and
I graduated in 2014.

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.520
And I feel like I have a number of
stories where I have this moment

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.820
where I realize this
is why Kundiman exists.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.120
I'll share one with you and it was
from my first retreat actually.

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.420
Another fellow had
encouraged me to apply

00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.720
and I didn't really know what
Kundiman was at the time.

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.020
So this was in 2007
so Kundiman was what?

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.320
Three, four years old at
that time and, you know,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.620
this fellow kept just chiming,
"You know, you have to apply."

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.100
And I really didn't know what
to do at Kundiman because at

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.270
that time again, right,
like I didn't want anyone

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.570
to know anything about me.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.150
And I didn't know what
it would mean to be

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:16.620
around other Asian-Americans
especially because like you know,

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.270
you sort of internalize the
things that you see on the news

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:21.570
about immigration, right?

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:25.190
And so for me, undocumented
immigration didn't even exist

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.830
for Asian-Americans, right?

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:32.710
And so, I go to this first
retreat and the sun had just set

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:38.960
and we were walking through -- and
this was still when it was at --

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.260
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: UVA.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.560
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: UVA --
so we're walking through.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.150
It's getting dark and there
were all these fireflies around.

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:47.160
And I don't know what
prompted me like again,

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.300
I don't code switch all the time.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.160
But I just said like,
"It's paputukan,"

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.840
which in Tagalog is like fireworks.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.230
And then there were so many people

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:02.110
who around me were just
like, "Oh yeah, yeah!"

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:07.490
And like that for me, it's like
this -- Kundiman experience, right?

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:10.110
Like what Aimee's talking
about where suddenly, right,

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:12.140
you're not needing
to explain anything.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.890 position:56%
I mean, one from me to even just say
that word suggests already, right,

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.740
like that already tells me
that I felt like I was home?

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.990
And I felt like I was with family.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.270
And just the fact that people
knew what I was talking about

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:33.720 position:56%
and I didn't even have to
translate and that was, that was it.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: I was
like -- pass the mike.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.390
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Oh [laughter].

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.690
I guess [inaudible].

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:42.550
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: My experience
at Kundiman is a little different

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:45.670
because I've always
been a staff member.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:55.040
And so I didn't get, you know,
the benefits of being a fellow

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.840
or being a faculty member.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:06.010
But in 2003, I had just been
back to New York after living

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:11.970
in San Francisco for
a couple of years.

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:18.180
And I went to one of those
stuffy, uptight [inaudible] parties

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.270 position:56%
where everybody bored me [laughter].

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:28.130
And there, I met Joseph Legaspi and
Sarah Gambito who had [inaudible]

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:35.000
at Kundiman and, you know, they
were so outgoing and friendly

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.320
and they started telling me
about this passion project.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.020
They wanted to get a bunch of
Asian-American writers together --

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:51.890
the poets and help each other and
form a community and have workshops

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:54.880
and connect across federations.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.500 position:56%
And I just thought, "They're crazy."

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.350
[Laughter] It's not going to work.

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:00.680
People don't like each other.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.000
[Inaudible] and I [inaudible]
the loneliness that Aimee

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.610
and Janine were talking
about into the workshop.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.940
It was inherent to being a writer.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.200
So I discovered when we
started working together

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.230
and doing these retreats and
organizing these readings was

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:21.630
that the loneliness is not
inherent to being a writer.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:25.360
The loneliness I was feeling
[inaudible] to my background

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.500
and always feeling
like I don't fit in.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.330
I don't know that I fit
into Kundiman but I feel

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:33.070
like I have people who have
taught me about the possibilities

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.240
of community and how you can be a
writer through generous practice,

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.770
through change, and it
is a social engagement

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:38.070
and an ethical engagement.

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.370
It doesn't compromise your writing.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:40.670
It doesn't compromise
your aesthetics

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.970
or your desire for solitude.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.270 position:56%
Because I think we're all rather
solitary, each of us because we want

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.570
to be when we always have this
sort of connection that brings --

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.870
I mean, I have such
wonderful memories of each

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.170
of your [inaudible] retreats
that I've [inaudible] retreats.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.470
Like I knew Janine was amazing
[laughter] when she came

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:49.770
to the retreat and they were doing
some kind of [inaudible] contest.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.070
They were pinning up your legs and
[laughter] and I never participate

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.370
because I'm not a [inaudible].

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.040
[ Laughter ]

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.770
Janine is in her [inaudible]

01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:58.610
of a poetic force has [inaudible]
the moment and it was a dance.

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.980
And she was -- she wiggled her
hips in this form [inaudible]

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.960
and I just thought, "This woman
is so brave and hilarious."

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.380
And I did something
that wasn't probably --

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.440
that was your first retreat.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.160
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah, it was.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.460
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: That
was about seven years ago.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.760
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: I look at --
this is like history in action.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.050
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yes.

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:25.260
No, like nine years ago.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.560
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: Shit [laughter].

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.860
I'm sorry.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.160
I'm so sorry.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.050
[ Laughter ]

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:34.270
&gt;&gt; So Kundiman's about
10-plus years old now, right.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.680
[Inaudible] was 20-plus
years old and you know,

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.240
you have now people coming to these
organizations, had the opportunity

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.880
of having Kundiman and [Inaudible]
and [inaudible] around probably all

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.110
of their high school experience,
all of their college years, right.

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:54.660
And they're arriving
at these organizations

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.830
with a literary [inaudible] that's
so different than what it was.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.230
There was no possible and sort

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:01.660
of possible [inaudible]
10 or 20 years ago.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.230
So I'm curious, and this is
a conversation we're having

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.600
within Kappi Kanem.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.440
You know, how are you handling
the intergenerational dialog

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.740
within the organization?

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.550
Because you have some
people who are arriving now

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:16.080
and readily taking
advantage of the states

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.170
that organizations are creating.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:22.570
But maybe they're not as aware and
not as familiar with the writers

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:29.700
and the work that was
put in to get to 20.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.260
&gt;&gt; Aimee Nezhukumatathil: I mean,
I think one way to take a look

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.330
at that, and that's really
perceptive, and those of you

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:38.540
who don't know in the audience,
Kappi Kanem [phonetic] and, Cal,

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.360
feel free to jump in,
is an organization

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:46.430
to promote African-American poets
and Kundiman is very much based

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:48.570
and modeled after it, actually.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:53.090
But one thing, going back to your
question, that I would say is --

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:57.000
I think people are
actively or subliminally --

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.880
I hope it's actively, promoting
and trying to teach generosity

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.910
and openness and which
is not as, you know,

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:08.010
probably very easy to teach.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:11.660
But in terms of what you were
saying, there's some -- I think --

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.590
and it's a very exciting
time to be a poet

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.360
in America, I think, right now.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.270
Hands down the most
exciting time to be a poet.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:24.300
But I think sometimes,
it -- there might be --

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.600
entitlement is not the wrong word,

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.080
but I think maybe people not
understanding there was a time

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.160
when you could open up a book
and not see any writers of color

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.040
and nobody would say a thing.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.820
You know, now, you get 10 articles
about why this was a bad thing.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.320
You know, that kind of -- and
then, when I see -- I think --

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.550
I don't personally think that it's
my duty to chastise other people

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:50.020
at all, but I think
when people get a seat

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.790 position:56%
at the table it's absolutely crucial
for them to scoot over to the side

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:57.280
and pull up another
seat for somebody else.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.280
And when I see that not
happening, I don't --

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.190 position:56%
again, I don't actively come around,

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:06.160
because I don't have the time
nor the patience to say, hey.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.460
You need to do this.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:13.380
But I think that by modeling
generosity and modeling not only --

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:17.660
being a mentor, the kind of mentor
you wish that you had when --

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:22.030
that I had when I was really,
really hungry for one and looking

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:23.740
for one, I think is the best way.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.200
And I see this is so -- I'm
trying to keep it cool here.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.340
But this is, like, mind-blowing
to me that Janine ever looked

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.620 position:56%
to my poems as a model for anything
or that is using it for [inaudible].

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.910
You know, that kind of thing.

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:40.040
I had little to no
Asian-American models

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.670
when I was growing
up, so for example.

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:46.310 position:56%
So I just hope that -- I'm not
perfect in any way, shape, or means,

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:50.620 position:56%
but I think hopefully one thing that
I try to model is being generous

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.530
to everybody, not just
Asian-American writers,

01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.830
but to writers coming up
fresh out of high school

01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:00.240
or to the helpless
student who's saying, hey.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.780
I want to be a poet.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.080
I don't know what to read.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.890
Can you share some stuff with me?

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.680
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang: I think
that's the right answer.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.510
I also think that when you're
talking about Kyle is something

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:14.750
that I worry about, I grapple
with, and part of it --

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.860
I think this happened, Kappi
Kanem, is that it started

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.820
out as a grassroots organization,
where everyone pulled their sleeves

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.780
up and started working and it's
become an institution where,

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.570
to get into Kundiman is a CV line.

01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:32.960
And I meet very talented Asian
writers all the time who apply time

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.810
and again and they don't get
in and it's hard to say, like,

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.030
we are inclusive when
it's -- you don't --

01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:41.040
by the nature of its
success, it has to be small,

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.960 position:56%
it has to be an intimate experience.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.900 position:56%
I think this is probably too because
the world of writers has changed.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.970
I think it's -- I think
Dean is right.

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:56.390
It's a wonderful time to
be a poet, but I also think

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:59.250
that people are more
professional wise

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:04.310 position:56%
and I don't know how to answer that.

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:08.670
I'll admit I haven't been back
to a tree [inaudible] now.

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:10.340
It's complicated.

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:15.930
But I think doing what
Aimee advocates for,

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:23.360
which is that everyone is someone
who needs a connection, a mentor,

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.920
[inaudible] in the
conversation of poetry.

01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:29.900
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: I feel
like you both have answered

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.210
that question really well.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:36.110
I mean, I would say maybe if
I were going to add anything,

01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:41.770 position:56%
it would be just from my experience,
being the one with the lone fellows

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.410
who did not return
in a timely manner.

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:48.460
So I became a fellow in 2007
and then I didn't come back

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:52.230
from my second retreat until 2014.

01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.300
And I'm pretty sure we're
supposed to graduate

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.560
within five years, and
I graduated in 2015.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.860
Right? So I --

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Chang:
She was delinquent.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.560
It's like I kept changing
my majors or something.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.420
And so, I came -- I went
to the retreat at UVA.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.210
I went through the retreat
in Fordham and then I was

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.010
at the retreat when it opened
itself up to fiction writers.

01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:15.440
Right? So I've been through some
pretty big changes with Kundiman

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.360 position:56%
and the -- when I came back in 2014,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.510
I was already in an
assistant professor.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:26.050
And suddenly, I was in these
workshops with I'm going

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:28.660
to say young writers, but
I don't mean that to be --

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.930
I mean, like, some of
them were -- there --

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.420
I think we maybe even had
a fellow who was in --

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.450
still working on their
undergraduate degree.

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.630
There were students who
were working on their MFAs.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:40.940
But I was in these
generative workshops

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.460
where I was producing stuff

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.870
that I had just written
hours before the workshop.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.240
And so, this kind of -- right.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.440
Like, it wasn't even this issue
of, like, a generational thing.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.740
It was just, like, no.

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.950
We are all starting from
scratch, here, all together.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.100
And I'm asking for
feedback from someone

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:00.530
who is still pursuing their college
degree and I am so open and willing

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.570
to listen to what they
have to teach me

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:05.790
because I am just so
raw on this page.

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:08.410
I don't know if that
answers anything,

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:13.130
but I guess I can maybe just
add that and I think that speaks

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:17.310
to how the workshops
happen in Kundiman.

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.250
Because you're -- it's an
entirely generative experience

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.280
and so no one comes with their --

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.990
the manuscript that they've
already been sending out to places

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.320
and they're bringing in
polished work as a way

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.760
of patting themselves on the back.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.940
Right? Like, it's just
like you show up there.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.660
You get this prompt
and you figure it

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.650
out while everybody
else is figuring it out.

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:38.990
&gt;&gt; Left: I think that kind of
model has really encouraged rawness

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:42.910
and that the art is
primary at the retreats.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.810
But the professionalization
I think is something

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.780
that we are opening ourselves to.

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.080
&gt;&gt; Janine Joseph: Yeah.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.250
&gt;&gt; And yet, it's also -- it
changes those things a little bit

01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:58.760
and it just changes
things a little bit.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.340
I don't -- I think that might just
be that -- it's Rita's problem.

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:05.080
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: On that note,
I want to thank our readers,

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.210
Janine Joseph, Aimee
Nezhukumatathil, and our moderator,

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:10.310
Jen Chang, for a terrific evening.

01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:13.590 position:56%
Thanks to all of you for coming out.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.220
A couple of things.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.430
First of all, there are two
books for sale in the back.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:23.560 position:56%
I'm sorry to say there's a wonderful
little Jay [phonetic] sculpture

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.970
with cards that you can pick up
that give Janine Joseph's website.

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:31.000
You should go check out her website
and if you want to get a book

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.140
of hers there, please do.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.440
I'm sorry we don't have them here.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.910
You should go do that
as soon as you get home.

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:40.880
But you can get books by Aimee
and Jen and get them signed.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.390
Also, you all have surveys
on your seat or next to you.

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:45.690
Please fill them out.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:47.880
We use these surveys
to determine what kind

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.180
of programs we should be doing.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.390
They're very helpful to us.

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:55.900
So you can give them to me,
you can put them on the table.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.540 position:56%
Finally, speaking of events, we have
a great event coming up next Tuesday

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:06.370 position:56%
at 4:00 o'clock, Poetry, Publishing,
and Race, with Cathy Park Hong,

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.430 position:56%
Evie Shockley, Carmen Gimenez Smith,

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.460
nd the editor of Poetry
Magazine, Don Share.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.760
So I hope you come.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.060 position:56%
You can check it out on our website.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.300
You can see all the events
that we have going on.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.510
Thanks so much for coming
out and have a good night.

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:21.040
[ Applause ]

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.700
