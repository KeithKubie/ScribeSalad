Well let's think. If we have 5 kg bucket of water, I know that bucket has a weight, mg.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to exert some force and this force actually must balance mg.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the case of a 5 kg bucket, mg would be 5  10, 50 N

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as with the force I had to supply to hold the bucket.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well work is just force times this distance of 7 m, that's equal to 350 J.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And what's truly amazing about work is it doesn't matter if we try to use a pulley

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or a compound pulley or an incline plane, we have to do this much work to lift the water.
