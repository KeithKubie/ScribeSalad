While declaring a commission is required for using a

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.240
camera, making a phone call, or accessing contact details. You

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.440
can do each of these things using a system app

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.340
as an intermediator. Because the camera app, dialer, and contacts

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.090
app will each be used to provide the data

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.950
you request users have the chance to cancel the action

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.300
you initiated giving them run time ability to refuse your

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.830
access. However, UI can only access the user's current location

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.170
if it explicitly declares a user's permission.
