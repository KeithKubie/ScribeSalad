00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.211
Many of us have hundreds of things
on our minds at any moment,

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:13.494
often struggling to keep track
of everything we need to do.

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:14.608
But fortunately,

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:18.306
there's one important thing
we don't have to worry about remembering:

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:19.718
breathing.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:24.151
When you breathe, you transport oxygen
to the body's cells to keep them working

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.584
and clear your system 
of the carbon dioxide

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:29.017
that this work generates.

00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:31.451
Breathing, in other words,
keeps the body alive.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.878
So, how do we accomplish 
this crucial and complex task

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:36.800
without even thinking about it?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.646
The answer lies 
in our body's respiratory system.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:43.135
Like any machinery,
it consists of specialized components,

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:45.650
and requires a trigger 
to start functioning.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.656
Here, the components are the structures 
and tissues making up the lungs,

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:53.427
as well as the various other 
respiratory organs connected to them.

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:57.521
And to get this machine moving,
we need the autonomic nervous system,

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.570
our brain's unconscious control center
for the vital functions.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.988
As the body prepares 
to take in oxygen-rich air,

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:08.237
this system sends a signal 
to the muscles around your lungs,

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:09.923
flattening the diaphragm

00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:13.149
and contracting the intercostal muscles 
between your ribs

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.497
to create more space 
for the lungs to expand.

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.826
Air then wooshes into your nose and mouth,

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.080
through your trachea,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.340
and into the bronchi
that split at the trachea's base,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.616
with one entering each lung.

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:30.521
Like tree branches, these small tubes 
divide into thousands of tinier passages

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:32.223
called bronchioles.

00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:34.905
It's tempting to think of the lungs 
as huge balloons,

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:38.466
but instead of being hollow,
they're actually spongy inside,

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.642
with the bronchioles running 
throughout the parenchyma tissue.

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:46.469
At the end of each bronchiole 
is a little air sack called an alveolus,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.382
wrapped in capillaries 
full of red blood cells

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:52.545
containing special proteins 
called hemoglobin.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.984
The air you've breathed in
fills these sacks,

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:56.728
causing the lungs to inflate.

00:01:56.728 --> 00:01:59.123
Here is where the vital exchange occurs.

00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:02.599
At this point, the capillaries
are packed with carbon dioxide,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.392
and the air sacks are full of oxygen.

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.823
But due to the basic process of diffusion,

00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:11.141
the molecules of each gas 
want to move to a place

00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:14.227
where there's a lower concentration 
of their kind.

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:16.592
So as oxygen crosses over 
to the capillaries,

00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:18.804
the hemoglobin grabs it up,

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:22.159
while the carbon dioxide 
is unloaded into the lungs.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.538
The oxygen-rich hemoglobin 
is then transported throughout the body

00:02:25.538 --> 00:02:27.071
via the bloodstream.

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:29.982
But what do our lungs do 
with all that carbon dioxide?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.623
Exhale it, of course.

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.155
The autonomic nervous system 
kicks in again,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.296
causing the diaphragm to ball up,

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:38.574
and the intercostal muscles to relax,

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:42.584
making the chest cavities smaller
and forcing the lungs to compress.

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:46.790
The carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled,
and the cycle begins again.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.260
So that's how these spongy organs keep
our bodies efficiently supplied with air.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.424
Lungs inhale and exhale 
between 15 and 25 times a minute,

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:59.941
which amounts to an incredible 
10,000 liters of air each day.

00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:02.030
That's a lot of work, but don't sweat it.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.195
Your lungs and 
your autonomic nervous system

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:05.695
have got it covered.
