I honestly if I did want to come back I

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.170
I honestly if I did want to come back I
 

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.170
I honestly if I did want to come back I
would want to have an angle just about

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180
would want to have an angle just about
 

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.500
would want to have an angle just about
two inches that way so that I could stay

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:34.510
two inches that way so that I could stay
 

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.940
two inches that way so that I could stay
on this side of the ball because that's

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:35.950
on this side of the ball because that's
 

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.010
on this side of the ball because that's
how it scares me right there no it's not

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.020
how it scares me right there no it's not
 

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.930
how it scares me right there no it's not
scary but the side pocket I couldn't I

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:39.940
scary but the side pocket I couldn't I
 

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.780

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.170
know well I'm not going to play now I'm
playing because of the angle I'm

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.180
playing because of the angle I'm
 

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.750
playing because of the angle I'm
planning to come down here and then

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760
planning to come down here and then
 

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.560
planning to come down here and then
shoot this ball in a side pocket because

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:52.570
shoot this ball in a side pocket because
 

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.440
shoot this ball in a side pocket because
the angles not good the pool when you

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:55.450
the angles not good the pool when you
 

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.190
the angles not good the pool when you
play a certain level it's all about

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200
play a certain level it's all about
 

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.170
play a certain level it's all about
maintaining the correct angle to go from

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:01.180
maintaining the correct angle to go from
 

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.480
maintaining the correct angle to go from
one ball to the other ideally I would

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:03.490
one ball to the other ideally I would
 

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.540
one ball to the other ideally I would
have liked to stop anywhere around right

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.550
have liked to stop anywhere around right
 

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.610
have liked to stop anywhere around right
here so funny I would have stopped I

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:08.620
here so funny I would have stopped I
 

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.139
here so funny I would have stopped I
wouldn't try to stop here yeah cuz I

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:10.149
wouldn't try to stop here yeah cuz I
 

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:11.699
wouldn't try to stop here yeah cuz I
want that shot as opposed to the next

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:11.709
want that shot as opposed to the next
 

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:13.560
want that shot as opposed to the next
well that's good too but I wanted to

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:13.570
well that's good too but I wanted to
 

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.490
well that's good too but I wanted to
once I make the ball I want to wind up

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500
once I make the ball I want to wind up
 

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.170
once I make the ball I want to wind up
right right here and where it's out

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:19.180
right right here and where it's out
 

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.400
right right here and where it's out
right now it's very hard to do that

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.410
right now it's very hard to do that
 

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.720
right now it's very hard to do that
because where it's on right now the

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:21.730
because where it's on right now the
 

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.850
because where it's on right now the
natural angle of shooting the ball in

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:23.860
natural angle of shooting the ball in
 

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.410

its going to make the ball go this way

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:25.420
its going to make the ball go this way
 

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.750
its going to make the ball go this way
so now I have to adjust to that and I

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760
so now I have to adjust to that and I
 

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.220
so now I have to adjust to that and I
have to make the ball go this way

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.230
have to make the ball go this way
 

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.910
have to make the ball go this way
and then out here so I have to hit it

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920
and then out here so I have to hit it
 

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.819
and then out here so I have to hit it
and I hit updated with low right hand

00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:35.829
and I hit updated with low right hand
 

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:38.010
and I hit updated with low right hand
English so that when it hits the table

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.020
English so that when it hits the table
 

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.620
English so that when it hits the table
and hits the rail bounces off and gets

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:40.630
and hits the rail bounces off and gets
 

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.800
and hits the rail bounces off and gets
good

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:44.810
 
 

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.939
 
the other thing that I noticed is

the other thing that I noticed is
 

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:49.970
the other thing that I noticed is
whenever I pray I bring with Tom English

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980
whenever I pray I bring with Tom English
 

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.579
