00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.530
We're asked to shade 20%
of the square below.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.700
Before doing that, let's
just even think about

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.380
what percent means.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.440
Let me just rewrite it.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.890
20% is equal to-- I'm just
writing it out as a word-- 20

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:26.260
percent, which literally
means 20 per cent.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.380
And if you're familiar with the
word century, you might

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.940
already know that cent
comes from the Latin

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.820
for the word hundred.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.230
This literally means you
can take cent, and that

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.700
literally means 100.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.610
So this is the same thing
as 20 per 100.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.970
If you want to shade 20%, that
means, if you break up the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.880
square into 100 pieces, we
want to shade 20 of them.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.130
20 per 100.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.240
So how many squares have
they drawn here?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.970
So if we go horizontally right
here, we have one, two, three,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.400
four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten squares.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.450
If we go vertically, we have
one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.630
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.620
So this is a 10 by 10 square.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.680
So it has 100 squares here.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.580
Another way to say it is that
this larger square-- I guess

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.270
that's the square that they're
talking about.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.970
This larger square is a broken
up into 100 smaller squares,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.220
so it's already broken
up into the 100.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.990
So if we want to shade 20% of
that, we need to shade 20 of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.420
every 100 squares that
it is broken into.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.470
So with this, we'll just
literally shade in 20 squares.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.330
So let me just do one.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.210
So if I just do one square, just
like that, I have just

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050
shaded 1 per 100
of the squares.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.080
100 out of 100 would
be the whole.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.640
I've shaded one of them.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.170
That one square by itself
would be 1%

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.300
of the entire square.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.009
If I were to shade another one,
if I were to shade that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.190
and that, then those two
combined, that's 2% of the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.950
entire square.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.680
It's literally 2 per 100,
where 100 would

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.640
be the entire square.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.490
If we wanted to do 20, we do
one, two, three, four-- if we

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.860
shade this entire row, that
will be 10%, right?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.160
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.430
And we want to do 20, so that'll
be one more row.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.050
So I can shade in this whole
other row right here.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.460
And then I would have shaded
in 20 of the 100 squares.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.010
Or another way of thinking about
it, if you take this

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.750
larger square, divide it into
100 equal pieces, I've shaded

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.590
in 20 per 100, or 20%, of the
entire larger square.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.720
Hopefully, that makes sense.
