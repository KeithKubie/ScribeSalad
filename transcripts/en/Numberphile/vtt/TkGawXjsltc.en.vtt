00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
[Tadashi Tokieda] Here's an ancient, very traditional Japanese toy called kendama

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.120
"Ken" means sword and "Dama" means ball and it's a sword and a ball.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
The French name is bilboquet

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.800
There is the spelling, bilboquet

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.260
We have some english versions of this toy but not so sophisticated as this one

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.760
So, as you can see, a ball is hanging from a string attached to this sword, as we say.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.220
You see, there's a cup here and the challenge is to just tug the ball up and put it in the cup

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.200
Now that's of course is very, very difficult to do.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.780
So you shouldn't do this in public... Because the chances of success are very small

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.420
[Generic News Channel Song]

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.540
[Explosion]

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.540
[Crowd Cheering]

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.800
[Tadashi Tokieda] Even if you succeed with the large cup

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.620
you shouldn't try the smaller cup because that's much, much harder to do of course.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.960
Now, if you're a little mad you say "Ah! I notice that there is"

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.040
some space at the end of this stick.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.860
Presumably that's not designed for play of this kind

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.180
But you know, if you're ambitious, you might try and miraculously succeed.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.940
There is a place where you can rest you know? So surely I will not be able to do this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.360
but once in ten years or so I may succeed.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.080
But what is demonstrably impossible is you see there's a hole at the bottom of the ball

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.960
Is to tug this up and then make it land on the stick

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.620
And it's impossible because you see, when i tug it up

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.600
the ball starts going in all sorts of orientations

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.000
and what are the chances that when it lands, the hole is pointing straight down?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.380
It's very, very unlikely and very, very improbable.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.080
But there's a trick for this:

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.560
There's a grand principle in Physics that permeates all parts of the Universe

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.920
called The Conservation of Angular Momentum

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.840
That means that any body spinning

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.420
Once it gets spinning has a tendency to keep spinning exactly the same way

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.620
Unless disturbed by external influences

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.420
Not only at the same spin, at the same angular speed

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.760
but also around the same axis.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.500
So we can begin by spinning the thing

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.940
And you see that when I tug it up

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.140
you saw that it keeps straight up

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.320
Because this axis of spin is vertical

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
and by the conservation of angular momentum

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.220
once it gets spinning it always keeps the same axis.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.400
So, if I spin this and try, what seems impossible becomes possible.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.980

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.000
[Cheering Intensifies]

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.580
[Tadashi Tokieda] You should contrast this with when I don't spin

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.940
and how much harder and difficult it becomes

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.220
I can do it anyway.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.100
I can reverse the roles of the sword and the ball

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.740
I can hold the ball and then swing it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.720
and try to make the sword come into the ball.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380
This never works.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.940
Hang on. Come on.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.520
Oh!
