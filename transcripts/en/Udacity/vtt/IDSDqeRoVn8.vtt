00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.480
You might be sitting there thinking
that Colt is over doing it a bit.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.320
After all, he does have
a tendency to come on strong.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.020
And anyway, performance is important
in that way that dental cleanings are.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.260
Everyone knows you should
think about getting them, but

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.270
nobody really wants too.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.160
But as any grandmother would tell you,
you don't actually have to floss

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210
all of your teeth just the ones
that you want to keep.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.780
And similarly, you don't need
to think about performance for

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.680
all of your apps,
just the ones that you want to succeed.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.370
Because Colt brought up a good point.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.280
Users will complain about app
performance three times as often as any

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.530
other issues.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.440
So keep in mind that just because
your app works beautifully in your

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.930
development environment with its perfect
Wi-Fi on your fancy new test phone

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.830
doesn't mean it will always work well.
