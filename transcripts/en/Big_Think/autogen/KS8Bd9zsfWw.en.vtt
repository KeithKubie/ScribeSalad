continuing into the 70s and 80s was
 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.200

coalition consisted of a number of
 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.180
coalition consisted of a number of
groups such as white Southerners

working-class voters that inherently had

little in common with each other
 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.910
little in common with each other

voters after the 1960s with the Voting
 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.559
voters after the 1960s with the Voting

Rights Act so this coalition was sort of
 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.710
Rights Act so this coalition was sort of
inherently unstable and what we began to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720
inherently unstable and what we began to
 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.610
inherently unstable and what we began to
see in the 1960s especially after the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620
see in the 1960s especially after the
 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.000
see in the 1960s especially after the
passage of the Voting Rights Act and the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
passage of the Voting Rights Act and the
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.590
passage of the Voting Rights Act and the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
growth of the african-american
 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.730
growth of the african-american
electorate was that the more

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
electorate was that the more
 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.710
electorate was that the more
conservative elements in that coalition

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720
conservative elements in that coalition
 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.130
conservative elements in that coalition
particularly white Southerners but also

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
particularly white Southerners but also
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.080
particularly white Southerners but also
conservative white ethnic voters began

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090
conservative white ethnic voters began
 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.600
conservative white ethnic voters began
to move toward the Republicans we had an

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
to move toward the Republicans we had an
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.800
to move toward the Republicans we had an
ideological realignment that began

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810
ideological realignment that began
 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.500
ideological realignment that began
didn't happen overnight it was it was

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510
didn't happen overnight it was it was
 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.810
didn't happen overnight it was it was
not something that occurred in a single

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820
not something that occurred in a single
 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.310
not something that occurred in a single
election or a couple of elections it was

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320
election or a couple of elections it was
 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.990
election or a couple of elections it was
something that took place over several

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000
something that took place over several
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.870
something that took place over several
decades actually but we gradually began

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
decades actually but we gradually began
 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.899
decades actually but we gradually began
to see these more conservative voters

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909
to see these more conservative voters
 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.300
to see these more conservative voters
moving away from the Democrats and into

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
moving away from the Democrats and into
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.399
moving away from the Democrats and into
the Republican camp and on the other

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409
the Republican camp and on the other
 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.790
the Republican camp and on the other
hand in response to that more moderate

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800
hand in response to that more moderate
 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.969
hand in response to that more moderate
to liberal voters who had been aligned

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
to liberal voters who had been aligned
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.920
to liberal voters who had been aligned
with the Republicans especially in parts

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930
with the Republicans especially in parts
 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.340
with the Republicans especially in parts
of the country where you had moderate to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350
of the country where you had moderate to
 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.980
of the country where you had moderate to
liberal Republicans like the Northeast

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990
liberal Republicans like the Northeast
 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.700
liberal Republicans like the Northeast
they began to

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710
they began to
 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.190
they began to
move away from the Republicans and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200
move away from the Republicans and
 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.660
move away from the Republicans and
toward the Democrats as the Republican

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
toward the Democrats as the Republican
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.400
toward the Democrats as the Republican
Party became increasingly conservative

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410
Party became increasingly conservative
 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.530
Party became increasingly conservative
so you can see this beginning with

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
so you can see this beginning with
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900
so you can see this beginning with
Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy in
 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.660
Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy in
1972 and continuing with Ronald Reagan's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
1972 and continuing with Ronald Reagan's
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.070
1972 and continuing with Ronald Reagan's
presidential campaigns and then

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
presidential campaigns and then
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.600
presidential campaigns and then
certainly in the 1990s with the takeover

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
certainly in the 1990s with the takeover
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.570
certainly in the 1990s with the takeover
of the Republican Party in Congress by a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
of the Republican Party in Congress by a
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.729
of the Republican Party in Congress by a
more conservative group of leaders led

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739
more conservative group of leaders led
 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.120
more conservative group of leaders led
by Newt Gingrich so essentially what was

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130
by Newt Gingrich so essentially what was
 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.090
by Newt Gingrich so essentially what was
happening here was that at the elite

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100
happening here was that at the elite
 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.890
happening here was that at the elite
level we were seeing an increasing

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
level we were seeing an increasing
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
level we were seeing an increasing
ideological polarization and that change

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
ideological polarization and that change
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.110
ideological polarization and that change
began to affect the loyalties of the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
began to affect the loyalties of the
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.160
began to affect the loyalties of the
voters and increasingly over time and by

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170
voters and increasingly over time and by
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.009
voters and increasingly over time and by
the time we got to the 1990s it had

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019
the time we got to the 1990s it had
 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.810
the time we got to the 1990s it had
reached the point where the old

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820
reached the point where the old
 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.949
reached the point where the old
Democratic coalition and the Democratic

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
Democratic coalition and the Democratic
 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.440
Democratic coalition and the Democratic
dominance of at least Congress was no

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450
dominance of at least Congress was no
 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.270
dominance of at least Congress was no
longer no longer existed and it's really

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280
longer no longer existed and it's really
 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.720
longer no longer existed and it's really
continued even up to the present time

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
continued even up to the present time
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.440
continued even up to the present time
now something else that's been happening

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
now something else that's been happening
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.090
now something else that's been happening
over this entire time period and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100
over this entire time period and
 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.380
over this entire time period and
especially the last couple of decades

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390
especially the last couple of decades
 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.960
especially the last couple of decades
it's also playing into this has been the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
it's also playing into this has been the
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.340
it's also playing into this has been the
demographic changes taking place in the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350
demographic changes taking place in the
 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.560
demographic changes taking place in the
electorate and the growing diversity of

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570
electorate and the growing diversity of
 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.650
electorate and the growing diversity of
the American electorate where non-white

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
the American electorate where non-white
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.470
the American electorate where non-white
voters are becoming a larger and largest

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480
voters are becoming a larger and largest
 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520
voters are becoming a larger and largest
share of the electorate and particularly

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530
share of the electorate and particularly
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.880
share of the electorate and particularly
of the Democratic coalition so that by

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890
of the Democratic coalition so that by
 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.830
of the Democratic coalition so that by
2008 when you look at the contributions

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
2008 when you look at the contributions
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.780
2008 when you look at the contributions
of different racial and ethnic groups to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
of different racial and ethnic groups to
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.710
of different racial and ethnic groups to
the party coalition's you see that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720
the party coalition's you see that
 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.440
the party coalition's you see that
non-whites made up over 40% of

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450
non-whites made up over 40% of
 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.569
non-whites made up over 40% of
Democratic voters whereas non-whites

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579
Democratic voters whereas non-whites
 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.289
Democratic voters whereas non-whites
were only about 7 or 8 percent of

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299
were only about 7 or 8 percent of
 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.910
were only about 7 or 8 percent of
Republican voters you know so this is

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920
Republican voters you know so this is
 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.729
Republican voters you know so this is
growing divergence between the parties

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739
growing divergence between the parties
 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.099
growing divergence between the parties
both in terms of the racial and ethnic

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109
both in terms of the racial and ethnic
 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.439
both in terms of the racial and ethnic
groups that support the parties and also

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449
groups that support the parties and also
 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:26.370
groups that support the parties and also
in terms of ideology and issues

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
 
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.350
 
it's the more engaged segments of the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360
it's the more engaged segments of the
 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.560
it's the more engaged segments of the
public that really becomes increasingly

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
public that really becomes increasingly
 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.270
public that really becomes increasingly
polarized because they're the ones who

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280
polarized because they're the ones who
 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.990
polarized because they're the ones who
are really following these debates who

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000
are really following these debates who
 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.850
are really following these debates who
are really attentive to what is going on

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860
are really attentive to what is going on
 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.700
are really attentive to what is going on
in the Congress to the positions of the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710
in the Congress to the positions of the
 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.450
in the Congress to the positions of the
parties and so they tend to react much

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460
parties and so they tend to react much
 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.760
parties and so they tend to react much
more quickly than people who are just

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770
more quickly than people who are just
 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.860
more quickly than people who are just
not you know not paying attention but

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870
not you know not paying attention but
 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.720
not you know not paying attention but
what happens over time is that even

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730
what happens over time is that even
 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.350
what happens over time is that even
though this process of realignment

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
though this process of realignment
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.510
though this process of realignment
really was I think initiated by

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520
really was I think initiated by
 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.240
really was I think initiated by
political elites for strategic reasons

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250
political elites for strategic reasons
 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.120
political elites for strategic reasons
so you had Republican politicians in

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130
so you had Republican politicians in
 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.950
so you had Republican politicians in
particular who I think saw opportunities

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960
particular who I think saw opportunities
 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.470
particular who I think saw opportunities
to win over some of these voting groups

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480
to win over some of these voting groups
 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.900
to win over some of these voting groups
that had been traditionally supporting

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910
that had been traditionally supporting
 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.790
that had been traditionally supporting
the Democrats but once the public or at

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800
the Democrats but once the public or at
 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.110
the Democrats but once the public or at
least the attentive segment of the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120
least the attentive segment of the
 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.780
least the attentive segment of the
public becomes polarized that in turn

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790
public becomes polarized that in turn
 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.420
public becomes polarized that in turn
sort of starts to constrain the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430
sort of starts to constrain the
 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.460
sort of starts to constrain the
positions of political elites themselves

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470
positions of political elites themselves
 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.820
positions of political elites themselves
and now they have to reflect the views

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
and now they have to reflect the views
 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.330
and now they have to reflect the views
of the voters who make up their their

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340
of the voters who make up their their
 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400
of the voters who make up their their
own base and so what we're seeing today

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410
own base and so what we're seeing today
 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.270
own base and so what we're seeing today
is that it's gotten to the point where

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280
is that it's gotten to the point where
 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.640
is that it's gotten to the point where
the party leaders and candidates for

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
the party leaders and candidates for
 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.120
the party leaders and candidates for
office are really kind of constrained to

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130
office are really kind of constrained to
 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.510
office are really kind of constrained to
a large degree by the polarization that

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520
a large degree by the polarization that
 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.850
a large degree by the polarization that
exists among the attentive public so if

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860
exists among the attentive public so if
 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.350
exists among the attentive public so if
you look for example of primary voters

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360
you look for example of primary voters
 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.940
you look for example of primary voters
you find that you know Republican

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950
you find that you know Republican
 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.310
you find that you know Republican
primary voters are really quite

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320
primary voters are really quite
 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.050
primary voters are really quite
conservative by a large Democratic

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060
conservative by a large Democratic
 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.230
conservative by a large Democratic
primary voters tend to be fairly liberal

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240
primary voters tend to be fairly liberal
 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.390
primary voters tend to be fairly liberal
and therefore candidates who want to be

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400
and therefore candidates who want to be
 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.160
and therefore candidates who want to be
successful in politics you know have to

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170
successful in politics you know have to
 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.100
successful in politics you know have to
appeal to these primary voters in

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110
appeal to these primary voters in
 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.510
appeal to these primary voters in
addition there are more and more

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520
addition there are more and more
 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.860
addition there are more and more
congressional districts and even states

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870
congressional districts and even states
 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.610
congressional districts and even states
where one party is dominant and

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620
where one party is dominant and
 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.820
where one party is dominant and
therefore the key to success in those

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830
therefore the key to success in those
 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.200
therefore the key to success in those
types of districts in those types of

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210
types of districts in those types of
 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.770
types of districts in those types of
states is again just to appeal to the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780
states is again just to appeal to the
 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.020
states is again just to appeal to the
party base and there's less need to

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030
party base and there's less need to
 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.720
party base and there's less need to
worry about appealing to voters from the

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730
worry about appealing to voters from the
 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.300
worry about appealing to voters from the
other party so political campaigns have

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
other party so political campaigns have
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.630
other party so political campaigns have
become more about mobilizing the base

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640
become more about mobilizing the base
 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.360
become more about mobilizing the base
than about appealing to the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370
than about appealing to the
 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.230
than about appealing to the
swing voters in the middle
