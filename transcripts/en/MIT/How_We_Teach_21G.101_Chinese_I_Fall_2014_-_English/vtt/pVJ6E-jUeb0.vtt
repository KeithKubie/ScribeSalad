HAOHSIANG LIAO: My
name is Haohsiang Liao.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.270
I'm the senior lecturer
directing the Chinese Language

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.110
Program here at MIT.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.910
And since I've been here, I've
been in charge of Chinese 101

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.340
to Chinese 104 and
that's basically

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.620
the beginning level to the
intermediate level of Chinese.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.540
So my interest in
teaching languages

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.730
started when I was a
grad student in Taiwan.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.590
That was this time
that Taiwan started

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.910
to establish its first grad
school of teaching Chinese

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.350
as a second language,
which was about 1994.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.260
So I was a grad
student there and that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.370
was the time I started
to develop my interest

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.120
in teaching foreigners Chinese.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.690
So I was there for
three years and they

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.210
got me an opportunity to do an
internship at Williams College.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.440
So I was at Williams for
one year and at Williams,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.920
that was the eye-opening
experience for me

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.980
and that was really the moment
I decided to devote myself

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.140
into this profession.
