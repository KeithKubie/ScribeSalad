00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.210
However, solving a problem at one level is not enough. For each piece at

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.580
that level, you have a whole picture puzzle at a lower level. This ladder is

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.860
called a refinement of the former. Devising the puzzles at a lower level, and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.750
ensuring that they satisfy the needs at the upper level is called vertical

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.440
decomposition. Of course the above holds true for each of the top level pieces,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.250
and for however many levels are involved in your decomposition. So

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.060
what we really have are a collection of refinements at one level addressing a,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.150
a problem at a higher level.
