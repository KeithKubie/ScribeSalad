00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.000
RICK: What do we have here?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
ALEXIS: Well, it
is a Cromwellian

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.710
Lobster Tail helmet.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.880
RICK: This style of helmet
was popular in England

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880
during the English Civil
War, happened in the--

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.040
1642.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.960
RICK: 1642, you're good.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.040
--to '51.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.040
Oh, good.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040
You know your history, yeah.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.670
[laughter]

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.420
ALEXIS: Today, I've
got a 1640s Cromwellian

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.080
Lobster Tail helmet.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.080
There's a lot of people that
are interested in this genre

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.000
of arms and armament, so I'm
asking $3,500 for the helmet,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.920
but I think I'd be willing
to sell for $2,000.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.330
RICK: This thing
is definitely cool.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.750
It was just really a
bizarro, weird civil war.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.170
It was the King
saying I'm in charge,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.580
and Parliament saying,
well, you're in charge,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.040
but not really in charge.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.170
You had Cromwell and the
Puritans, and all this.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170
And basically, the king lost.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.210
Mm-hmm.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.210
And he also lost his head.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.880
[laughter]

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.500
As it happens.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
RICK: This was
high-tech and, I mean,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.420
really, it was a lot better than
earlier wars, where they just

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.920
had, basically, a steel
dunce hat on their head,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.080
and they would have
this flap on the back.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.290
And they had leather
straps on the side,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.790
so it gave a little support.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.120
So when you got hit on the
head, it wasn't as bad.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.380
ALEXIS: OK.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.040
RICK: During the
English Civil wars,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.290
these helmets were
used by both sides,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.120
and this design was
considered really high-tech.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.250
You had something that flexed
and protected your neck.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.790
But I have to say,
there's something

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.710
about this lobster tail
helmet that's a little fishy.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.880
[laughter]

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.620
So how much you
want for this thing?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.120
ALEXIS: I'd love to
get $3,500 for it.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.790
RICK: OK.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.880
I have some concerns right
off the bat with this thing.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.420
ALEXIS: Mm-hmm.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.880
RICK: The reason
why it was called

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.330
a lobster tail helmet
was cause this flexed

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.580
like a lobster tail.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.830
This is all one piece.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.080
Mm-hmm.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.330
RICK: And that
really concerns me.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.920
Do you mind if I have
someone look at it?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
ALEXIS: Sure.
RICK: OK.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.500
You can hang out
for a little bit.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.620
I'm going to go call somebody,
and get him down here.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.790
I wonder if they'll
come back in style.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250
ALEXIS: When he mentioned that
he was calling in an expert,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.960
I felt a little nervous.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.330
But I think that this piece
would be perfect in the shop,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170
and I think they'd do
really well with it.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.000
RICK: It's really cool looking,
but I'm not exactly an expert

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.170
on lobster tail helmets.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.380
So I'm calling in
my friend Alex,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.210
who will know all about this.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.880
ALEX: Ah, the lobster
tail pod helmet.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.500
So my big concern is that
this tail doesn't flex.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.710
ALEX: OK.
Well, this is Cromwellian.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.710
Basically, Cromwell
had supporters.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.040
They called them the
Roundheads, and they

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.830
were diametrically
opposed to the Royalists,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.120
who supported King Charles.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.540
They called them the Cavaliers.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.000
RICK: OK.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.170
ALEX: This is why it's
called the lobster tail.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.830
Traditionally, I
guess you could say,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.830
this would have
been three sheets

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.540
of metal riveted
together, so it had

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.210
a little bit of articulation.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.080
They did make them like this
for lower-status soldiers.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.580
It was preferred by officers.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.830
But this shouldn't
be a reason to think

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.380
that this is incorrect.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.920
RICK: All right.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.710
ALEX: There's a lot of
history around this helmet.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.830
This was a brutal
time to be at war.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.080
They're using giant
swords, they're using axes.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.420
There were so many
things, that a helmet was

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.420
crucial to saving your life.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.080
RICK: So what do you
think it's worth?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.080
ALEX: If this were true to
the period, this would be--

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.670
I could see it getting $3,500.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.170
There are some rivets
here, and some pieces

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.420
of leather on the inside.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.170
Those are for cheek
pieces, so they

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.710
would have been worn on
either side, and hung freely.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.750
Now, it's very typical
that they're missing,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.380
because they were connected
by leather, typically.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.790
You can see some of
that leather still here.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.120
I don't see too much
350-year-old leather.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.540
The other thing is
it's really light.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.080
This wouldn't have been
worn in the battle.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.620
There's just no way that
this would have stopped

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.120
a blow from a broadsword.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.250
I would think that it's
actually a Victorian copy.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.460
As a Victorian copy, a
couple hundred bucks.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.080
RICK: Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.960
You're welcome.
I'm really sorry.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.120
[laughter]

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.080
ALEXIS: No worries.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.460
RICK: I'd give you $50 for it.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.250
[laughter]

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.460
ALEXIS: Yeah.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.960
No, at that price, I
think I'll just keep it.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.620
RICK: OK.
I understand.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.120
Like I said, it happens.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.170
What are you going to do?

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.170
Thanks so much.
RICK: You, too.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.920
Bye-bye.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.500
Bye.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
For $50, I think I'll just
go ahead and take it home,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.170
and enjoy it while watching
my favorite British movie

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170
with some wine or something.
