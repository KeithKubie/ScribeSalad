&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
Well, are you going to ask some questions.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.070
&gt;&gt; Sir, we're here to say what one thing do
you think that countries,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.810
companies, or individuals must do to make
the world a better place in

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.769
2008?

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.769
&gt;&gt; To handle [unintelligible], the warming
of the earth, and the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.239
threat of terrorism.
I think it could be done and that would make

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.750
all people healthier,
happier, more optimistic, and more friendly.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.752
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
