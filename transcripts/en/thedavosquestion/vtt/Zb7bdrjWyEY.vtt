00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.390
&gt;&gt; Role models are very important for the
region, especially in the area of environment

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.960
because the Middle East is really suffering
from very big environmental problems, especially

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.500
the contribution to the global climate change
to the region is quite important. So we need

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.880
role models that are basically advocating
for the environment, working for the conservation

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.170
of our marine resources as well as our water
resources. Pollution is a big problem. And

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.390
perservication as a result of climate change
is going to cause big drastic problems for

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.670
the future. So we need to take responsibly
and we need to act for this and role models

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.610
are the ones who can show us how we can act,
what we can do in order to protect our environment.
