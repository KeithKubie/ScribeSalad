00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:15.434
(Music: "East Virginia")

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.708
(Banjo)

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.643
(Singing) I'm from

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:02.667
old East Virginia.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.184
North Carolina

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.417
I did go.

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.559
I met

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:19.833
a fair, young maiden.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.726
Her name I did not know.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.625
(Banjo)

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.643
Don't that road

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:13.792
look rough and rocky?

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.500
Don't that sea look wide and deep?

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.893
Don't my darlin'

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:29.268
look

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:30.833
the sweetest ...

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:36.351
When she's in my arms asleep?

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:41.125
(Banjo)

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:08.934
Her hair

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.708
was a dark-brown curly.

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.167
Her cheeks were chestnut red.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.851
On her breast

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:30.458
she wore a white lilly.

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.059
Through the night, the tears she shed.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:40.667
(Banjo)

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:10.434
Captain,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:16.083
Captain, I am dyin'.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.917
Won't you take these words for me?

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.018
Take them back

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:31.458
to old East Virginia.

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:38.393
Tell my darlin' she is free.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:41.351
(Banjo)

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:44.018
(Music ends)

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:50.458
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.851
That was a song called "East Virginia"

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.809
I learned from a man named Clifton Hicks

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.375
who lives down in Georgia.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.833
The next song ...

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:05.351
I have for you

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.643
is called "John Brown's Dream."

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:09.684
It's an old dance tune.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.393
And you may notice that the banjo
that I'm holding looks a little different

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:15.768
than banjos you might be used to seeing

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:18.934
or the one I just played, for example.

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:24.018
And this banjo
is sort of an earlier model.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:27.268
Banjos kind of evolved like a human has.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:31.351
And I like to say that the sound
that comes out of this banjo

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:36.351
is a sound that was
just a little closer to the source,

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:37.684
which is Africa,

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:39.143
and some people forget that,

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:40.934
so, yeah ...

00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:46.375
(Banjo tuning)

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.101
(Music: "John Brown's Dream")

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:57.292
(Banjo)

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.875
(Banjo continues)

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:45.643
(Singing) John Brown's dream,

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.518
John Brown's dream the devil was dead.

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.434
I'm gonna get that, get that, get that,

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:51.351
I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:54.875
(Banjo)

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:40.809
John Brown's dream,

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.934
John Brown's dream the devil was dead.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.308
(Banjo)

00:08:46.332 --> 00:08:48.183
Come on, Liza, Liza, Liza.

00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:50.143
Come on, Liza we'll be pickin' it again.

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:52.058
I'm gonna get that, get that, get that,

00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:53.933
I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

00:08:53.957 --> 00:09:00.101
(Banjo)

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.559
(Music ends)

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.875
(Applause and cheers)

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:09.233
Thank you very much.
