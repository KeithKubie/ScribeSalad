00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.830
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Good
afternoon to everybody.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.240
Can you hear me?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.160
Okay. I'm standing in
for Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.590
the Chief of the Division
who has to be away.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.540
She will be coming, but
she'll be slipping in late.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.240
She's very much looking forward
to hearing Professor Rendsburg.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.110
So, first, my name is Ann Brener.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.230
I'm the Hebraic Specialist
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.930
in the African-Middle
Eastern Division.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.650
So I'm basically doubling
both as an M.C. of the program

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.210
and standing in for Dr. Deeb.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170
So just a few words for those
of you who have never been

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.360
to the African-Middle
Eastern Division before.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.830
The African-Middle Eastern Division
is comprised of three sections --

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.400
the Near East Section which covers
about 78 different countries

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.980
from the Caucasus down to the
[foreign word] to Morocco.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.850
And there's the Hebraic Section,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.710
and then there is also
the African Section,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.580
which covers all except
Sahara in Africa.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.460
The African-Middle Eastern
Division is recognized as one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.200
of the world's foremost
research centers for all

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.210
of these countries and
all these languages.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.500
And so we'd like to welcome you
to our beautiful Reading Room.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.600
Now today's event has been
a long time in the making.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.840
I think many of you will
feel as I do that the "Song

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.070
of Songs" is the most
beautiful poem ever written.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.390
And for years now I've just
been waiting for the right time

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.060
to display the Library's wonderful
addition to this biblical scroll.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.250
So when I heard that Professor
Tar Rendsburg was going to be here

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.540 position:56%
in Washington, and that he was
willing to come speak at the Library

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.630
of Congress, I knew the
right time had come.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.770
Professor Rendsburg
is quit simply one

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.930
of the most renowned
scholars of The Bible today.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.190
He is the author of seven books on
biblical literature and language

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.190
and about 170 articles,
that's one-seven-zero.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.910
Perhaps his best-known book is <i>The
Bible and the Ancient Near East </i>,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.770
co-authored with the late
renowned Cyrus Gordon.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.320
He has also produced two DVDs for
the <i>Great Choruses Program </i>,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.410
one on the "Book of Genesis" and
one of the "Dead Sea Scrolls."

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.750
His forthcoming book is entitled
<i>How the Bible is Written </i>,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.340
and it will be published by
Azenbraun [assumed spelling]

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.020
in 2018, just around the corner.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.720
Professor Rendsburg currently holds
the Blanche and Irving Laurie Chair

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.900
of Jewish History at
Rutgers University.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.580
He has also served as
Visiting Professor at many

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.400
of the best universities in the
world, including Oxford, Cambridge,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.580
and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.920
But to me, personally, Professor
Rendsburg will always be

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880
that wonderful professor
from Cornell,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.140
the one with whom I had
the great good fortune

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.020
to study during my years
in graduate school.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.980
I took every course I could
with Professor Rendsburg

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.320
and in just a few moments
you'll understand why.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.960
It is a great honor, therefore,
to invite Professor Rendsburg

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.020
to the podium, and to welcome
him into the -- our Reading Room.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.820
Professor Rendsburg.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.080
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.380
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg:
Thank you very much.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.960
Such a lovely introduction and
professors are only as good --

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.610
I should say teachers are only
as good as their students.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.680
And, of course, it's
with such fond memories

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.910 position:56%
that I recall the classes we had at
Cornell before I moved on to Rutgers

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.160
with Ann Brenner amongst
the students.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.880
And here we are, reunited
at the magnificent facility,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.230
the Library of Congress, just
one of the nation's treasures.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.560
In fact, of course, we should
say one of the world's treasures.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.060
So, yes, let's talk about
the "Song of Songs."

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.450
So, basically, what is it?

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.970
What is the "Song of Songs?"

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.380
It is, simply stated, love poetry.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.710
It is exquisite love poetry.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.180
And, of course, as we just heard,
is everyone's favorite poem.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.940
So the immediate question,
of course,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.470
is why is it in the biblical canon?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.100
How did it get there?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.360
And the answer is, because texts
have an afterlife, which is to say,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.640
although the author of the
"Song of Songs," according

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.810
to all biblical scholars,
intended it as simply love poetry,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.250
what Robert Alter calls
and ode to intimacy.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.400
And I'll come back to
that point in a moment.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.470
It was later Jews and
later Christians

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.300
who reinterpreted the text
in that text afterlife,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.770
if I can use that expression.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.380
For Jews, the "Song of Songs" was
not the love between a young man

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.830
and a young woman, but rather
was the love between God

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.270
and the people of Israel.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.320
God being masculine; the people
of Israel being feminine.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.100
While Christians saw the
same love, in their case,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.260
the love between Jesus
and the church.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.350
Again, masculine and feminine,
as exemplified in the poem.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.630
The most famous passage from
post-biblical literature

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.300 position:56%
that we can cite in this regard is
the well-known maxim of Rabbi Akiva,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.090 position:56%
a second-century CE rabbi who played
on the Hebrew words Shir Hashirim

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.390
in Hebrew, "Song of Songs," as a
way of expressing the superlative

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.810
and is grammatically equivalent

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.300
to the expression Kodesh
Kodashim, Holy of Holies.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.170
And, according to Rabbi Akiva,
the <i>Book of Song of Songs </i>,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.030
if all the scriptures are
holy, the Book of Song

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.880
of Songs is the Holy of Holies.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.050
Here's an example from an
Christian art of the expression

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.420
that I have just indicated to you.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.020
The opening words of the
<i>Book of Song of Songs </i>,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.380
after the superscription
which introduces the book,

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.150
is the female lover asking
her male lover to "kiss me."

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.600 position:56%
And if you look at your translation,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.500
you can see that in
chapter one, verse two.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.800 position:56%
This actually comes from The Lothian
Bible, one of the great treasures

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.120
of the Pierpont Morgan
Library in New York City.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.490
And you can see the Latin
words there indicated.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.740
The text, of course, is in the
Latin, the Vulgated Saint Jerome.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.260 position:56%
And you can see the Latin words, the
opening words of the "Song of Songs"

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.660
in Latin there, osculator
me, kiss me.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.280
This text was written
in 1220 in England,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.720
and it's beautifully illuminated.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.570
And here's just one instance where
you can see the love of the male

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.050
and female, although, in this
case, it's obviously intended

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.270
by the illuminator to
be Jesus and the church.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.190
I cannot show you Jewish art
showing you the same thing

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.900
because Jews would shy away
from indicating such things.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.510
But, of course, there is
beautiful Jewish art of The Bible,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.880
and so I'll leave this
image up for a bit here.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.040
This is the beginning of
the the "Song of Songs"

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.250
in the Kennicott Bible,
written in Spain in 1476,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.240
one of the great testimonies to
that remarkable Jewish community

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.020
of medieval Spain on the eve

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.630
of their expulsion just
16 years later in 1492.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.850
This Bible has been at
the Bodleian Library

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.430
in Oxford since the 18th century.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.310
Now let's talk a little
bit about the text.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.610
And you have the translation.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.410 position:56%
It was actually produced by myself
and my co-author, and former student

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.620
as well, Scott Nagel of the
University of Washington.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.520
And he and I wrote
a book on the "Song

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.260
of "Songs" called <i>Solomon's
Vineyard </i>.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.850
In fact, I've given you the
translation that we produced along

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.610
with some -- two sets of notes.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.280
One is a set of literary notes and
the other one is actually a set

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.170
of other notes that requires
further reading into the book,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.840
which we're not going to do today.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.310
But at least you have
the translation

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.960
and the literary notes
at the bottom there.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.090
Now let's talk about
this issue of intimacy.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.680
Normally in The Bible
we do not see intimacy.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.070
We have an occasional scene.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.060
In the Book of Genesis we
get a quick look at Isaac

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.300
and Rebekah playing
with one another,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.090
the Hebrew text there [foreign
words], with one another.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.410
But we see them from a distance.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.370
We actually see them through
the eyes of Avi-Melech before --

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.700
the King of the Philistines,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.080
so that we don't really get a
chance to see them up close.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.910
Or we get to see Jacob and Rachel,
also in the Book of Genesis,

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.740
meeting at the well, and they kiss.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.500
And we actually are taken into
their marriage bed, if I can say,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.900
a few verses later in
Genesis Chapter 29.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.240
But we don't get intimacy.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.900
Each of these scenes is described
in very terse, prosaic manner --

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.350
they did this, they did that.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.340
Even in the David and
Bathsheba story,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.700
where one would think one
would maybe see some passion,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.170
all we read there is that
she came into the palace,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.510
they had intercourse,
and she left --

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:15.230
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.320
And he took her, and she came
to him and he lay with her

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.520
and she returned to her house.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.820
Was there any wooing?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.120
Was there any embrace?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.420
Were there any words spoken?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.720
Was there any passion?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.020
Was there any emotion?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.320
Was there any romance?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.260
None of that is indicated
by the author of 2 Samuel.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.810
The biblical authors, the prose
authors, just told the basic facts

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.790
in this very laconic
style of writing.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.900
But "Song of Songs" is poetry.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.610
Let's just look at one other
instance of the way the <i>Book</i>

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.280
<i>of Song of Songs </i>is
illuminated at the end

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.510
of chapter eight in
the Kennicott Bible.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.620
And with love poetry, we have
something very, very different.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.700
Love poetry gives us all of
the sensual aspects of what

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.000
that word love indicates for us.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.740
In fact, if you'd look
at your translation,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.240
just begin with chapter
one, verse two.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.870
"May he kiss me with
the kisses of his mouth;

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.610
for your love is better than wine."

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.940
Now I'd like to point
out to you here

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.060
that this may sound a little
strange to us in our English sense.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.470
But this is perfectly
acceptable in Hebrew poetry.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.660
Do you notice how the A line --
biblical poetry is parallelistic?

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.070
Usually a set of couplets
where the A line

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.620 position:56%
and the B line speak to one another.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.090
The A lines states the point,
and the B line will enhance it

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.100
or emphasize it in some way.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.060
Notice that in the A line, he is
addressed in the third person.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.750
She says, "May he kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth."

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.210
There's a distance there.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.410
But in the B line, she
shifts to second person.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.710
She addresses him directly.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.690 position:56%
"For your love is better than wine."

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.400
And we'll find other examples of
this occurring in the poem as well.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.680
And if you turn ahead, for
example, to other instances.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.080
In chapter one, verse 12 and
13, she's still speaking.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.920
Her voice is in the italics there.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.410
"My nard gives forth its scent
sachet of myrrh as my beloved to me

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.150
between my breasts
may he lodge," right?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.150
A woman's sachet, a little bag
that would contain the fragrance

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.960
which she would use to make her
body attractive is described here

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.260
as between her breasts.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.650
But she envisions that
her male lover,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.030
that this is where he will lodge,
He's like the little sachet

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.590
of fragrance that lies
between her breasts.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.580
So when I talk about
intimacy and sensual poetry,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.100
this is what you're seeing here
in the <i>Book of Song of Songs </i>.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.220
Or turn ahead to chapter
two, verse six.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.270
"His left hand is beneath
my head," she says,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.880
"and his right hand embraces me."

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.560
Didn't such things occur in
all of those prosaic stories

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.740
that are referred to
earlier in biblical scenes?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.340
And the answer is,
almost undoubtedly yes.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.340
But, again, it's the prose
writers who deny us those images.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.000
But it's the writers of
the poetry that allows us

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.840
to see and to hear these texts.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.850
Now, if you look at
chapter one, verse two --

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.150
here we are again on the image.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.430
We join the dialog, as
it were, in medias res,

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.030
and actually we'll end
in such fashion as well.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.530
It's just two lovers on a
stage talking to one another.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.510
Now we don't get a backstory.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.870
She just begins with the opening
line that you see there, right?

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.400
She just invites the kisses
between the two lovers.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.700
Now the two lovers speak

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.360
to each other throughout the
eight chapters of the poem.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.910
But they are never truly together.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.550
If I were staging this, and
I'll talk about performance

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.610
in a just moment, if
I were staging this,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.290
I actually would envision the
female lover standing on one side

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.480
and the male lover standing on
another side, and they would speak

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.840
to one another occasionally.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.640 position:56%
They would speak to the audience, as
it were, perhaps a group this size,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.970
as they recited the poetry.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.210
Maybe occasionally
turning to another.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.620
But the poem unfolds
without us actually getting

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.400
to see the two lovers,
the male lover

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.740
and the female lover,
ever really together.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.790
And that's true of the opening
line and it's certainly true

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.280
of the last line of the poem which
we'll look at in just a moment.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.260
This shift, by the way, as we just
saw here in chapter one, verse two,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.950
from second person to third
person, also occurs elsewhere.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:31.180
Take a look, for example, at
chapter two, verse 16 and verse 17,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.440
where she says in verse 16, "My
beloved is mine and I am his,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.160
grazing among the lilies."

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.870 position:56%
Famous passage from "Song of Songs."

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.530
Again she's referring to
him in the third person.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.520
But in verse 17 she actually
turns to him in the second person.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.950 position:56%
"Turn, liken yourself my beloved" --

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.640
the word turn there is
in the imperative form.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.710
"Turn, liken yourself my
beloved to a gazelle."

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.830 position:56%
So you begin to see the way the poem
operates between the third person --

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.490
the shifting between third
person and second person.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.070
We do get lines of
poetry, of course,

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.300
that occur in his voice as well.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.310
And turn ahead to chapter four,
verse five, just to show you.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.370
And in chapter four, verse 11.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.570
Just to show you that he, too,
can speak in sensual terms.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.440
Chapter four, verse five.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.500
"Your two breasts are
like two fawns,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.720
twins of a doe grazing
among the lilies."

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.410
Or chapter four, verse 11,
would be another good example.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.730
"Your lips drip honey, my bride,
honey and milk, under your tongue.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.090
And the scent of your clothes
is like the scent of Lebanon."

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.190
Most likely referring to the cedar
tree which is the national symbol

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.510 position:56%
of modern day Lebanon to the present
day, just like we use cedar wood

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.470
in cedar closets to have
our clothes smell nicely.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.710
This is a good example, by the
way, chapter four, verse five,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.820
at the tope of the page there,
to give you an indication

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.470
of how later Jewish interpretation
would understand the "Song

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.500
of Songs" is not referring to
the love between a male lover

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.280
and a female lover, but
rather the love between God

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.580
and the people of Israel.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.890
The whole poem is given an entire
metaphorical meaning in the hands

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.960
of the later rabbinic interpreters.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.160 position:56%
"Your two breasts are like two
fawns," in chapter four, verse five.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.940
If you read the later Jewish texts
that deal with "Song of Songs"

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.040
in this interpretive mode, this
refers to Moses and Aaron, right?

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.340
That will give you an example.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.330
The two leaders of the people
of Israel in the Torah.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.150
So this will give you a sense of
how the book gets reinterpreted.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.690
There are times when the two
lovers are indeed together,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.790 position:56%
and I'm going to show you an example
of that in chapter four, verse 12.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.660
He is speaking.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.090
"A locked garden is
my sister, my bride,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.380 position:56%
a locked fountain, a sealed spring."

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.950
And then he begins to describe her
there in chapter four, verse 13.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.800
"Pomegranates, choice fruits.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.360
Wonderful Hebrew word,
[foreign word], henna with nard.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.380
And if you go chapter four, verse
14, all of these various spices

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.580
that are referred to there --
frankincense, myrrh, et cetera.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.730
And then in chapter four, verse 16,
where the shift goes from his voice

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.290
to her voice, back to the italics
in the second half of that verse.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:24.500
She says, "May its," meaning the
garden, "may its spices stream.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.300
May my beloved come to his garden."

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.600
Who is the garden?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.900
It is she.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.890
So you begin to see the
intimacy with which the voices

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.980
of the two young lovers
speak to one another.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.330
"May my beloved come to his
garden," which, of course,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.450
would be her because he has just
described her as such, as a garden.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:47.740
"And may he eat of the
fruit of its choice fruits."

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:55.330
Chapter five, verse two, one of the
most central passages to my mind

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.080
of the entire eight chapters of
the <i>Book of Song of Songs </i>.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.600
Notice how it begins.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.900
She's speaking here.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.200
Chapter five, verse two.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.580
"I am asleep, but my
heart is awake."

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.600
Let's give you another
image to look at by the way.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.580
Here are the two other pages of
the "Song of Songs," as written

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.750
out in the Kennicott Bible.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.950
"I am asleep, but my
heart is awake."

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.170
Chapter five, verse two.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.280
Now we all know what this means,
or we should know what this means.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.580
She's dreaming.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.610
But notice the language of poetry.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:28.820
A prose write would
simply say, she dreamed.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.850
That's the way prose writers speak.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.260 position:56%
But in poetry, you don't want to use

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.980
such a prosaic and
banal word as dream.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.340
You say things like, I am
asleep, but my heart is awake,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.250
and you get the sense
that everything that is

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.260
to follow here is a dream.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.020
"Hark, my beloved knocks.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.930
Open for me my sister, my darling."

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.380
She is quoting him now, hence
I put it in quotation marks.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.710
"My dove, my perfect one."

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.680
She's imagining this in her dream
sequence that he is coming to her.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.980
Verse three.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.560
"I have removed my tunic.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.020
My beloved sent forth his
hand through the hole."

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.890
You have the idea that he's
playing with the lock on the door

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:09.420
as she says actually in
chapter five, verse five, right?

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.320
As she, perhaps, is also playing
with the lock on the inside.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.050
"And my fingers," at the end
of that verse, "flowing myrrh

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.390
on the handles of the lock."

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.810
So you can begin to see the
arousal here and the expectation

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.700
of the two coming together.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.790
Of course, just as that happens,
in chapter five, verse six,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.700
apparently she awakes from
her dream and now she has

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.140
to go seeking her beloved who
really isn't there because,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.510 position:56%
as we've just learned, this is all
a dream, and this is all love poetry

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.200
in which the two lovers
never come together.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.680
May I point out to you at this
point, as you scan the pages

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.840
in front of you, that there's
much more in the italics

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.640
than there is in the other font.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.740
And that's because the female
voice dominates in this poem.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.650
We always think of the biblical
material as patriarchal literature.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.720
And, of course, to a
great extent it is.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.000
We get the great kings, David
and Solomon, and almost all

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.060
of our prophets are males, and
heroes like Moses and Aaron,

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.560
who are mentioned, are males.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.200
But, of course, when we
come to other aspects

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.940
of biblical literature,
including the "Song of Songs,"

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.910
it doesn't have to be that way.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:13.580
There are 65 lines in the poem
spoken by the female voice,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.990
and 36 verses spoken
by the male voice.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:21.140
She has almost twice as many
lines to recite than he does.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.550
And in a performance you would
actually, of course, begin to see,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.950
or the presentation of this text,
the oral presentation of this text,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.870
you would, of course, see
how much more is given

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.390
to her voice than is to his.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.580
There are also 15 verses
given to a third party,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.540
which we call the chorus,
a set of --

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.790
almost if you can picture
Greek drama here for a moment,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.760
perhaps something like
that would help.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.070
His language, by the
way, is more repetitive.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.270
And her language is more varied
and also much more expressive,

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.830
if I can use that subjective
judgment.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.550
Let me give you examples,
moreover, where the female view,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.460
the female point of
view, actually is

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.240
to be seen in this remarkable poem.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.380
Turn to chapter two, verse nine.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.890
Turn back to chapter
two, verse nine.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.970
Actually at the top of the part
that's at the top of page 193.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:22.150 position:56%
She says, "Behold, he stands behind
our wall gazing through the windows,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.460
peering through the lattices."

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.270
Now, if you look at
the footnote L here,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.100
as you read biblical material
we have a series of scenes

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.610
which we call the "woman
at the window."

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.730
Rahab is inside her house, and
the two spies have been lowered

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.780
down a rope through her
window and on the ground.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.490
And they have a conversation.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.670
But you see that and hear
that through the eyes

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.160
of the two spies who
are on the ground.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.240
Jezebel is in her palace, but
King Jehu is on the ground.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.520
And you see the scene through
the eyes of Jehu on the ground.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.100
And you see this in other places.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.520
Michal, the daughter of
Saul, the wife of King David,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.200
the mother of Sisrah
[assumed spelling].

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.980
These are always women
in the window.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.520
But we view them from the viewpoint
of a man on the ground looking

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.530
up at the window where the
woman is in the window,

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.700
and we actually have artistic
representations of this

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.630
from ancient Near Eastern art,
including Phoenician ivory,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.920
ivories carved by ancient
Phoenicians.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.220
What do we have here?

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.520
We have the entire scene inverted.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.630
Do you realize that she is inside
the house looking out at him

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.180
who is peering in through
the windows?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.600
So this is an inversion of a
trope in biblical literature.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.150
In fact, in ancient Near
Eastern art, if I can expand it

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.290
to that based on what
I've just referred to,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.930
we actually are now
inside the house looking

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.760
out through her eyes,
where he is looking in.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.470
So, hopefully, I've made
that point clear to you.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.570
And, therefore, it is this female
voice which continues to dominate.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.610 position:56%
Now turn to chapter seven, verse 11,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.970
where we see one other
examples of this.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:09.150
If you look at chapter seven, verse
11, she says, it's in her voice,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.440
"I am my beloved's, and
toward me is his urge."

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.150 position:56%
Now, the word urge there is teshuqa.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.770
Teshuqa is used, meaning desire,
and perhaps sexual desire,

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.620
it is used in Genesis Chapter
Three in the Adam and Eve story.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:33.080
But is actually the -- the teshuqa
is actually going to belong to --

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.370
it is an inversion of the
typical male/female relationship

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.110
because it is not the male having
urge for the female, right?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:48.450
In this passage it is the male
having urge or desire for her.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.110 position:56%
So it is an inversion of what we
would call biblical themes or tropes

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.040
or motifs which would have
been well-known, I would argue,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.540
to an ancient Israelite audience
who was consuming this poem

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.060
as a consumer of literature.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.140 position:56%
And those are two excellent examples
of the inversion of the woman

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.010 position:56%
in the window and the inversion here

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.470
of where the word desire
is intended.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.220
And so the male and female
speak to one another, as I said.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.370
But they are never really together.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:24.010
Now let's talk about this
as an oral performance.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.590
Picture the staging.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.020
I think these texts were
in writing and perhaps each

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.000
of our lovers held the
text in their hands,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.790
and there would have been
an audience, a gathering,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.210
perhaps shepherds at the end of the
day around the campfire listening

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.740
to the literature of
Ancient Israel or, perhaps,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.870
in a more urban environment,
at the town square, the piazza.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.760
The only real open space in a very
urban center would be inside the

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.060
city gate.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.510
And these would have
been spoken aloud.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.760
People did not have a
written text in front of them.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.780
This is true not only for
the poetry of The Bible,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.900
this is true for all
ancient literature.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.180
The idea of silent reading
is something which is very,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.780
very late and, in fact, even in the
fourth century, Augustin marveled

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.430 position:56%
at St. Ambrose, the Bishop of
Milan, who was able to read silently

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.190
because no other human
being was able to do

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.490
that in the fourth century.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.360
Literature was produced orally.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.660
It was all heard.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.290
It was an oral/oral effect, oral
from the mouth, oral into the ear.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.270
The poet wants to show you his
or her, but most likely a his,

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.080
although some have
suggested that the poem "Song

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.430
of Songs" was written
by a female, virtuosity.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:34.690
And, accordingly, whenever lines
of poetry repeat in the poem,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.850
they never, I repeat, never,
and there are dozens of examples

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:42.130
of repeated lines, they
never repeat verbatim.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.620
And so you get lines such as
song chapter two, verse five,

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.540
and song chapter five, verse eight,
where you get the same expression,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.840
"For I am sick with love."

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.570
In the second one it's a question,
"That I am sick with love."

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.510
But the poet will not
repeat the words --

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.150
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.750
Or in chapter two, verse six,
one of the lines we looked

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.940
at to describe the
intimacy between the two.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.740
In chapter two, verse six --

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.430
"His left hand is beneath my head
and his right hand embraces me."

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.910
When she repeats those lines
towards the end of the poem

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.780
in chapter eight, she changes the
-- she deletes a very small element

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.900
of the Hebrew grammar
there, the preposition le.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.990
So the proposition
tachathle [assumed spelling]

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.690
which I have rendered beneath,

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.110
becomes just simply tachath
which is the word under.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.350
Fortunately, English
has two prepositions,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.740
synonymous prepositions, and
I was able to play with them

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.240
in the translation using beneath
for one and under for the other.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.230
It so happens, by the way,
that in biblical Hebrew,

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.500
tachath is the normal
way of saying something,

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.970
and tachathle is actually abnormal.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.960
And so we call this
defamiliarization.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.750 position:56%
Where the poet used this less-common
form, tachathle, and then --

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.760
which may have rung a chord with
people listening to this text,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.130
but in chapter eight
corrected it as it were --

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.660
corrected it in quotation
marks here, right?

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.960
Corrected it to the form tachath.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.260
Another example.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.570
In chapter two, verse 16,
these are the famous lines

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.000
that I quoted before, she says
[speaking in foreign language].

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.330
"My beloved is mine, and I am his."

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.090 position:56%
And then in chapter six, verse three
[speaking in foreign language].

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.910
"I am my beloved's and
my beloved is mine."

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.600
This time using the word [foreign
words], my beloved, twice.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.400
The same expression, of course,
is used, but changing from pronoun

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.250
to noun in the second iteration
of this -- of these lines.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.590
Sometimes you get the same three
lines which are used in the poem.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.490
And here's an example of it, which
also brings us to chapter eight,

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.360
verse 14, the last line
in the entire poem.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.200 position:56%
In 2:9 she says, "My beloved is like
a gazelle, or a fawn of the hinds."

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.900
I'm translating a little
hyperliterally here.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.010
And in chapter two, verse
17, I read this before --

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.380
"Turn, liken yourself,
my beloved, to a gazelle,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.770
or to a fawn of the hinds, upon
the mountains of cleavage."

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:06.470 position:56%
Now, that last phrase there [foreign
words], this has engendered a lot

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.140
of discussion because we
really don't know what

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.760
that second means there --
on the mountains of what?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.490
But the Hebrew root,
[foreign word], better,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.450
or in the pausal form here
[foreign words] means to cleave.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.110
It's actually used in
Genesis chapter 15.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.900
For example, when Abraham
cuts up animals.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.320
So we think that this
is probably something

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.620
like "mountains of cleavage."

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.000
So you get the idea that he is a --
like a member of the deer family.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.730
You know how beautiful deers are
and the imagery of the deer hopping

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.800
and jumping over the mountains.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.450
And in chapter eight, verse 14,
the very last line of the poem,

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:47.120 position:56%
when the poem brings everything to a
conclusion or to a quasi-conclusion,

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.690
because I said we joined the poem
in medias res and we sort of ended

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.940
that way, she says
to him once again,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.990
again changing the language
[speaking in foreign language].

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:01.070
Right? "Flee my beloved and liken
yourself to a gazelle [speaking

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.030
in foreign language], or to
a fawn of the hinds [speaking

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.360
in foreign language], upon
the mountains of spices.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.930
And where are the mountains
of spices?

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.760
Presumably she's referring once
more, as we heard much earlier

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.310
in the poem, to her breasts.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.050
And so the mountains of cleavage
earlier become the mountains

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.360
of spices here.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.700
But you're supposed to
remember all this in your mind.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.340
And in an audience, in consumers
of literature who were attuned

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.990
to listening to a text and
not reading it silently,

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.190
I would argue that all
of this would have --

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.280
they would have reckoned
with all of this.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.710
And one more example of
that, in his mouth now.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.080
Very minor changes, but
nevertheless, when he describes her

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.280
in chapter four, "Your hair
is like a block of goats

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.360
that flow down from Mount Gilead."

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.400
And in chapter six, verse five,
he changes the last couple

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.620
of words there simply to "that flow

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.230
down from the Gil'ad"
or "from the Gilead."

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.750
So you get the sense that you
can make these minor changes

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.300
and you get no repetitions
whatsoever.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.470
The variation, the
ability to vary the text

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.110
and to vary the language
is absolutely breathtaking.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.150
Similarly, here, in
chapter four, verse two,

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.650
he says about her teeth
[speaking in foreign language].

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.750
"Your teeth are like a
flock of shorn-ones."

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.980
There is nothing more white than
sheep coming up from the washing.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.050
And so he compares
her teeth to that.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.350
But he doesn't use the word sheep.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.450
He used the word [foreign words],
the ones who have been shorn,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.800
which would be, again,
this defamiliarization.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.730
But when he repeats the lines
in chapter six, verse six,

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.030
now he uses the word for ewes
[foreign words], and, of course,

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.580
we got a hint of that in
chapter four, verse two.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.080
It's not stated more
explicitly in 6:6.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.590
And, again, the poet
has varied the language.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.420
The other thing to note when
you listen to a text orally is

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.390
that you should always pick
up on the alliteration.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.200
Oral presentation of text is
alliterative in the ancient world,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.500
and I would argue, actually,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.730
in any oration you should always
attempt some alliteration.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.320 position:56%
And here we are in Washington, D.C.,
and let us recall the opening lines

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.040
of the "Gettysburg Address"
by President Lincoln.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.810
"Four score and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.360
on this continent."

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.430
Why did he say four score
and seven years ago?

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.140
Why not just 87 years ago?

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.420
Right? Why do we all have to
do that mental math and figure

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.270
out what President
Lincoln was saying?

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:16.720
Because four score and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth --

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.930
you get to hear the alliteration
between the four and the fathers

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.940 position:56%
and the fourth -- brought forth on
this continent a nation conceived --

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.490
listen to that, continent
and conceived, right?

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.060
So the opening syllable.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.720
This is oration and there's
nothing better than the oration

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.020
of the "Gettysburg Address."

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.270
Fortunately I teach in the U.S.
and I can teach this to my students

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.570
because if I were teaching

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.870
in another country I don't
think they would know President

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.170
Lincoln's words.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.470
But you get the point.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.470
Now let's come back to the
poet of "Song of Songs."

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.430
And he alliterates
whenever he's able to do so.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.560
Alliteration is through the poem
[speaking in foreign language]."

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.500
Okay, do you hear I've given
you the transliterations there?

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.540
Do you hear the same
sounds which are being used?

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.510
In song one, verse 17,
she refers to her house --

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:04.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.840 position:56%
I would point out a few things here.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.040
This is the only time in
The Bible where the word

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.420
for cypresses is not [foreign
word], but rather [foreign word]

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:16.140 position:56%
in atypical form because the
t-sound there is going to alliterate

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.000
with the other t's that carry
through this line of poetry.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.370
And [foreign word] means
runners, like the beams of a house

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.750
where they would put
the cypress trees

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.540
up as the runners of the house.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.870
That is a very unusual word
in The Bible [foreign word],

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.910
appearing only one or
two places in The Bible.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.660
So you use unusual
words and unusual forms.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.400
What we would -- what we actually
say in -- sorry for the Latin,

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.530
[foreign words], for the
sake of alliteration.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.530
And other examples of this
as you work through the poem.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.830
I won't do 3:6.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.130
That's a long one.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:54.610
But let's look at 4:2, referring
to the animals, to the animals

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.920
which are always twinned
to each other --

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.220
[speaking in foreign language].

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.520
Sorry, this is referring
to her teeth, again.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.820 position:56%
She has had no missing teeth, right?

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.620
Her smile is perfect.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.340
Right? All of whom.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.640
All of her teeth are twinned.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.260
None of them is bereaved, like this
tooth is missing its matching tooth

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.100
below, or something like that.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.450
In chapter five is the most --

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.770
is the greatest concentration
of the alliteration in the poem,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.510
and it's actually that dream
scene that I referred to.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.850
In her dream scene, she is
able to alliterate her poetry.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.010 position:56%
And I don't think it's a
coincidence that the poet has placed

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.810
into her mouth in that extremely
important scene at the beginning

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.100
of chapter five all
of these words here.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.230
On the right-hand column
Hebrew words are based

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.530
on three-letter roots.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.070
Certainly the verbs and
sometimes the nouns, as well.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.300 position:56%
And I have given you the
three-letter roots that you see here

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.470
in these words in the
right-hand column.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:55.100
Now I've highlighted for you the
word in chapter five, verse three,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.990
'atannepem, shall I soil them?

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.680
This is the only place in The
Bible where this verb occurs.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.640
The root [foreign words] occurs
only here and the word means

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.580
to soil, to make something dirty.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:14.350
In chapter -- two verses later,
she uses the word natpu, dripped,

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.160
taking the same three root
letters with a more common root

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.090
and creating an anagram of them.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.480
But you can see once more
the employment of rare words

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.060
for the sake of alliteration.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.420
Let's end with one instance,
or one final instance

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.030
of the poet's literary brilliance.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.800
And there's nothing more
brilliant than what you see

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.590
in front of you right here.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.300
In chapter two, verse 12,
there is, in this case,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.940
not a couplet of two lines, but
rather a triplet of three lines.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.530
So if you're going to
have parallelistic poetry,

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.900
which I referred to at the
beginning, you have the a line

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.680
and the b line expressing
basically the same thing.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.580
But what if you have an a
line, a b line, and a c line?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.030 position:56%
One of them is going to be something
like an orphan line because a

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.780
and b could be parallel,
leaving c by itself,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.340
or b and c could be
parallel, leaving a by itself.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.730
It's true that all three
could say the same thing,

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.420
but that's not what you have here.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.640
But, of course, the poet is
a literary genius and is able

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.510
to solve the problem
through this triplet.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:20.420
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.370
In the a line -- the whole poem,
by the way there in chapter two

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.220
versus 11 and 12 -- refers to
the end of the winter rains.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.800
The winter rains have gone.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.100
That's in the past.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.670
That's in chapter two, verse 11.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.650
And so this is a description
of spring.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.070
Once more, of course,
you're never going

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.370
to use the word "spring," right?

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.670
Too prosaic.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.970
You're going to paint a picture.

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:43.700
You're going to be a romantic
poet from 19th-century England.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.610
Wordsworth would never, you know,
would never use prosaic words.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.420
He would have to portray the
picture that he was trying to do.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.870
Similarly you have
that here in 2:12.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.350
So, in the a line,
you have the reference

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.190
to the blossoms appearing
in the land, right?

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.890
This is something out of botany.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.540
And in the c line,
you have the voice

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.320
of the turtledove has
returned, right,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.940
because the migration of birds.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.670
The birds are coming back in
the springtime and this comes

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.570
out of the field of ornithology.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.530
So what are you going
to do with your b line?

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.180
So in your b line you
put the word zamir,

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:18.660
and zamir in Hebrew means
both pruning and also song.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:24.560
So with its meaning pruning, the
word looks back to the a line

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.690 position:56%
where you had the blossoms, and with
the meaning song it looks forward

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.170
to the meaning of -- to the
voice of the turtledove.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.430
And everything has to
have a term, right?

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:42.100
We call this Janus Parallelism,
based on the two-faced Greek God,

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.380
Janus, who faced both left
and right, for which our month

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.870
of January is name, by the
way, because it's looking back

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.100
at the old year and
forward to the new year.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.430
This is what poets
are capable of doing,

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.550
and there is no greater poet than,

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.550
as we heard in Dr.
Brener's introduction,

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.170
than the poet who left
us the beautiful poem,

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.820
the most beautiful poem
of the "Song of Songs."

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.620
Thank you.

you so, so much.

Yes, the poet who created this
beautiful poem was the greatest poet

of all.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.120
But it also takes a great
teacher and a great scholar

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.870
to make it come alive for us.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.910

Aren't you jealous?

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.040
I had a whole semester with
him on this [laughter].

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.820
Okay. I'm sure some of you have
questions for Professor Rendsburg,

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.480
so please feel free to ask.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.480
Let me just mention that your
questions will be videotaped

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.200
and will be available
on our website.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.910
So speak politely [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Yes, sir.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:06.090
&gt;&gt; You said that the poet
might be a xenophobe.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:11.300
Do you [inaudible] who it might
be or is there an [inaudible]?

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.680
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Could you
repeat the question, please?

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.030
And then I'll repeat
it for everyone here.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.950
&gt;&gt; You said that the poet might
be [inaudible] based on the fact

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.250
that are quite [inaudible] lines
in [inaudible] voice [inaudible].

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:26.620
Is there any way of knowing
who it might have been?

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.220
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: So --
okay, the question is,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.040
since the female voice dominates,
and feminine themes dominate

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.080
in the poem, can we judge
who this poet might have been

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.380
if it was indeed a woman?

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.060
Of course, the same question could
be asked if the poet was a man.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.820
And the answer is we cannot.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.640
These poems -- all of this
literature is simply anonymous.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.050
And this is not just true of
ancient Hebrew literature.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:53.690
It's also true of all the other
literatures of the Ancient World.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:57.280
So let me distinguish for you
between Near Eastern Literation,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.180
and by that I mean Ancient
Egyptian, Ancient Babylonian,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.630
Ancient Hebrew, whatever
we may have.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.380
The texts are almost
always anonymous.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.060
We simply do not know
who the authors are.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.050
And contrast that with Ancient
Greece where we know the names

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.540
of all the authors, and then
also in the wake of Greece, Rome,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.650
because in the Greek
and Roman models,

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.000
texts belonged to their authors.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.420
So we know who the playwrights
were -- Aeschylus and Sophocles.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.900
And we know who the historians
were -- Thucydides and Herodotus.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.200
And we know who the philosophers
were -- Plato and Aristotle.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.640
And the physicians who left us
text -- Hippocrates and Galen.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.250
And on and on it goes.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.580
This is not true in
the Near Eastern mode.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.890
The texts were communal property.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.370
If you're aware of
this, Izaiah Chapter Two

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.460
and Makkah Chapter Four are
almost verbatim the same language.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.440
Now my students worry because,
of course, we have an honor code

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.820
at Rutgers and all universities.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.090
Which one plagiarized
from the other?

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.860
And I tell them it's not a
question of plagiarism whatsoever.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.650
It's almost an honor
to quote the other one.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.270
And, of course, both
poets may have --

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.450 position:56%
both prophets may have been
quoting yet a third party, you know,

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.620
author x, whom we don't know.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.390
So texts were communal property.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.690 position:56%
What we do know occasionally are the
names of the scribes who actually,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.640
in ancient colophons, would
even give us their names.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.220
Nothing like the more
well-developed medieval colophons

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.890
where we learned lots of
information beyond their names.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.770
But basically all we then get
is just the name of the scribe

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.040
who then says, I copied it word
for word, letter for letter,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.010
symbol for symbol, from the
text that was before me.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.450
So, unfortunately, we can say
nothing beyond that, yeah.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.250
I should say something
about female authorship.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.980
Our assumption is that almost
all texts are written by men.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.790
That's just the working hypothesis
in the Ancient Near East.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.100
Having said that, and now I'm going
to speak out of the other side

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.770
of my mouth, the earliest
writer whom we know by name

00:39:54.770 --> 00:40:00.570
in the world was a Sumerian
priestess named Enheduanna.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.660
And she left us some hymns

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.460
to the Goddess Ishtar,
and we know her name.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.840
And it's very possible that we know
her name because she was a woman

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.910
and felt it was necessary
to give us her name.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.820
It was around 2000 BCE.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.410
A little bit actually
-- or 2200 BCE.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.990
So that would be an exception.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.450
But it also gives us the idea
that, yes, women did author texts.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.150
And as far as the authorship
of the "Song of Songs,"

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.340
and I am totally agnostic on this,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.800
the female authorship has
been proposed by scholars

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.240
and most notably by the great
scholar Shelomo Dov Goitein

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.440
who is associated with his
great work on the Cairo Geniza,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.030
but also made major contributions
to the study of The Bible as well.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:49.620
Who else? Yes, sir.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:58.540
&gt;&gt; If I understand you correctly,
you're saying that a text written

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.390
by a woman would be very rare.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:08.800
But this brings to mind the <i>The
Book of J </i>by Professor Harold Bloom

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.630
who sets out the hypothesis
that the J text

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.330
and the core is written
by a Negro princess.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.630
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Right.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.930
&gt;&gt; Would you comment on it?

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.230
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: I have the
greatest respect for Harold Bloom

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.140
who is just one of the world's
greatest Shakespeare scholars

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.410
and elucidators of Renaissance
English Literature and much else

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.250
in English and world literature.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.200
But he simply doesn't know the
biblical material well enough,

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.730
I'm sorry, to say.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.020
Anything is possible.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.770
First of all, I even reject
the notion of a J source,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.340
I have to tell you that, because
I approach the biblical material

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.280
differently from the
usual source critics.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:52.220
But he is -- this was a
very well-known book of his,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.520
where it made a big popular
splash when he wrote it.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.310
And I don't want to say anything
harsh about Professor Bloom

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.020
because I've learned so
much from his writings.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.100
I was an English major as an
undergraduate and, of course,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.860
Bloom was something we all read.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.310
And I continue to read
and learn from his work.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.730
But his work on biblical
studies should just be set aside

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:14.830
for the moment, with all due
respect to his remarkable intellect

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:19.260
and great contributions to the
field of comparative literature.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.510
Yes. Yes.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:47.120
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.420
&gt;&gt; Gary Rendsburg: Okay.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:53.150
So the question was, at what point
did Jewish authors actually begin

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:58.230
to ascribe their names
to their compositions?

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.060
The second half of your question
I'll deal with in just a second.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.920
And the answer to that is, under
the -- in the Age of Hellenism.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.780
When Alexander the Great
conquered the Near East in 330 BCE,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.740
Hellenism spread throughout.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.570
Egypt became Hellenized.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.310
The Land of Israel
became Hellenized.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.720
What we now call modern-day
Syria became Hellenized.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.670
And, actually, far to the
east, as far east as Iran

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.360
and modern-day Afghanistan we
have Greek inscriptions all

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.230
because of the great
empire that Alexander built.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:33.080 position:56%
And Hellenistic influence
certainly took hold on those regions

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.590
which were closest to Greece --

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.330
Egypt, the Land of
Israel, Syria, and so on.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:42.680
The earliest Jewish writer who left
his name to a book is <i>The Book</i>

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.660
<i>of Ben Sira </i>written in 180 BCE,

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.530
where we actually know
the name of the author.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.520
Embedded into the Hebrew text
is the name of the author.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.570
And that Hebrew text, as you
may know, was lost at some point

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:59.150 position:56%
in the Middle Ages and was recovered
in the Cairo Ganesa in the end

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.090
of the 19th century -- Solomon
Schechter being the first one

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:06.390 position:56%
to identify a Hebrew original of the
Greek translation of <i>Ben Sira </i>.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.660
But we have the [inaudible]
in Greek translation

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.980
and we have two-thirds
of it now in Hebrew.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.280 position:56%
It's Heboriginal [assumed spelling].

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.410
So he would be the
first author to do so.

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.500
And then in his wake you also --
writing in Hebrew I should say.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.340
He's the first author
writing in Hebrew to do this,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.090
Jewish author writing in Hebrew.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:24.760
There were Jewish authors
in Egypt who actually wrote

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.390 position:56%
in Greek even earlier than Ben Sira.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.410
We have only snippets
of their material.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.870
And a century after that
we have the famous case

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.990
of Philo, a prolific writer.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:37.790
So, yes, all of these Greek Jewish
writers left us their names,

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.300
and Josephus in that
mode is writing in Greek.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.250
So he, of course, would give
us his name, as he does.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.880
Now, the second part of the
question deals with a comment

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.540
in the <i>Talmud </i>in
the "Tractate of" --

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.280
in the <i>Babylonian Talmud </i>in the
"Tractate of Bava Batra" from,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.070
let's say maybe 4- or 500 CE,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:45:00.340
although that passage is
evoking an earlier layer

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.650
of rabbinic literature, so
it may go back what's known

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.640
as a Brita in Hebrew, or Aramaic.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.730
It may go back to 200 CE.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.340
And there the rabbi's
attempt to give us the names

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.740
of who wrote the biblical
books, right?

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.240
So that's what -- they
do that at that point.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.510
They actually don't mention
the "Torah" in that passage,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.860
because I guess the
"Torah's" just assumed

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.960
to have Mosaic authorship
or divine word.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.750
But it starts with Joshua and it
works through, and it attempts

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.740
to give us the who wrote
book this and book that.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.610
So that is probably, again, part
of the Hellenistic influence

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.790
on the rabbis who now
decided that they needed

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.930
to ascribe the biblical
books to particular authors.

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.990
And if I didn't mention --
I did not mention the "Song

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.160
of Songs" gets attributed
to Solomon,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.220
which is why it's also known
as the "Song of Solomon" in --

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.020
more likely in Christian context.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.820
Yes.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:46:01.520
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.360
Okay. Who claims this did you say?

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.660
Ethiopes and Christians.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.960
I though so.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.660
Right. So the Ethiopes
and Christians --

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:13.120
I don't know, venerate may
be too great a term for it,

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.310 position:56%
but venerate the story of Solomon
and the visit of the Queen of Sheba,

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.280
Sheba being in far Southern Arabia,

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.660
just across the Red
Sea from Ethiopia.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:29.750
And so this would be part of the
Jewish and Christian traditions

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:34.680
of Solomon writing the <i>Book
of Song of Songs" in his youth.</i>

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.500
<i>And I don't think there
were Jewish passages</i>

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.900
<i>which ascribe it specifically to
the visit of the Queen of Sheba,</i>

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.250
<i>but there are rabbinic texts</i>

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:45.760
<i>which ascribe Solomon's authorship
during the time of his youth,</i>

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.620
<i>in contrast to his
authorship of the Book</i>

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.280
<i>of Proverbs </i>which he
did in full maturity.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.850
And then the <i>Book of Ecclesiastes"
or Kohelet </i>which he did in old age.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:58.120
So that's as much as
I can say about it.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.720
So it's a beautiful
tradition, of course,

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.230
amongst the Ethiopian Christians.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.620
So thanks for reminding us of that.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.800
And, of course, for the great
place that Solomon holds

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.220
in the Ethiopian tradition.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.710
Yeah.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.010
