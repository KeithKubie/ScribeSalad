00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.890
David, how did you fill up these boxes?

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.220
&gt;&gt; So
there are three possible moves here.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.840
A on the table, A on D, or D on A.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.879
So up top I have A on D, moving A to D.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.700
In the middle I have moving D up to A,
and on the bottom I have A on the table.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.700
&gt;&gt; That looks right, David.
