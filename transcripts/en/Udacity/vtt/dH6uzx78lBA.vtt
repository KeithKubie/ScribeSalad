00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The particle filter that you're going to program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
maintains a set of 1000 random guesses as to where the robot might be.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, I'm not going to draw 1000 dots here,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but let me explain how each of these dots looks like.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Each of these dots is a vector which contains an X coordinate,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in this case 38.2, a Y coordinate 12.4,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and a heading direction of 0.1,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is the angle at which the robot points relative to the X axis.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, this robot moves forward, it will move slightly upwards.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In fact, now a code--every time you call the function robot

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and assign it say to a particle,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
here the [i] particle,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
these elements p[i]x, y, and orientation,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is the same as heading,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are initialized at random.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, to make a particle set of 1000 particles

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
what you have to program is a simple piece of code that assigns 1000 of those to a list.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, let's do this; let me set N=1000 for 1000 particles.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here's my initial set of particles; it's going to be an empty list,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and I want you to fill in some code

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
after which we have 1000 particles assigned to this vector over here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, when I print the length of this thing

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.373
I will get 1000 instead of 0.
