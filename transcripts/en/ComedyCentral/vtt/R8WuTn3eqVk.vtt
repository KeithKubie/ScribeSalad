- Anderson, I am not
investing in your drug drink.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.060
- Will you marry me?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.393
- Oh my God, no.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:22.998
- Why the fuck did you do this?

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:25.331
- Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.459

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.047
Things are looking up, okay?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.737

- I'm not saying that she wouldn't,

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:06.547
I'm saying that it's
not good for you, okay?

00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:07.435
- It's fine, dude.

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:09.744

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.801
Yes, yes, we want to buy the oxy.

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.280
- Oh, it's one of those

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:44.049
Hey girl.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.299
Sick mom jeans.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.685
Also, they've got a Mrs. Field's in there

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:51.518
and I super feel like a
cookie cake right now.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.950
- All right.

00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:57.739
- What the fuck is this?

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:58.901
- Oh, it's your money, dude.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:01:59.940
Sorry it's like messy or whatever,

but this is all I could find in my room.

00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:03.798
It's 10,000 dollars though.

00:02:03.798 --> 00:02:04.631
- Hey guys.

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:06.631
- [Group] Oh, shit, run!

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.329
- Hey, woah, hey.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.300
I just need you guys to move your car.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.633
There's a lot of spaces, so.

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.590
All right, have a good one.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.757
- Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, hey dude, dude, hey.

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.321
You didn't see nothing, okay?

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.339
- You just pay on your way out.

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.339
- Okay then.

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.064
- Okay.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.070
- Holy shit.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.493
Okay, I think we're fine.

00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:42.580
- So, what are you guys
gonna do with all this?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.278
- Oh, I am selling a new energy drink

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:47.390
with Oxycontin in it.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.140
- So, you're a drug dealer.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.459
- No, why the fuck does
everyone keep saying that?

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.781
You're the drug dealer, douchebag.

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.071
- No, actually I'm a cop
and you're under arrest

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.811
for buying a Schedule One
narcotic with intent to sell.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.660
Get your hands where I can see em!

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.493
- Oh shit, Schedule One?

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:02.326
- You have the right to remain silent.

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:05.111
- Wait, wait, dude, dude, dude, calm down.

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.990
If we ask him he's a cop and
he says no, that's entrapment.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.920
Are you a cop?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.670
- Yeah, and you're under arrest.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.920
- Oh shit, run!

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:16.544
- Ahh!

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.096
- Zac, oh my god, Zac!

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:22.222
Oh fuck, oh god.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:23.772
Zac, I'm sorry, dude.

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:25.308
This is all my fault,
this is all my fault.

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:27.922
- Stop, listen, listen.

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:31.422
Did it look cool when got hit by that car?

00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.678
- Yeah dude, it was so cool.

00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:36.511
- Cool.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360
- It was so funny, dude.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.613
Zac?

00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:48.922
Oh my god, Zac?

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:53.005
You were like, "Oh, owie,"
it was so funny, dude.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.398
It was so sad, dude.

00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:58.565
It was so sad.

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:03.074
It was so funny and it was so sad.

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:06.200
I love you, Zac.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:08.253
Don't be dead!

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:11.027
