00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:09.685
In the deserts of the American Southwest,

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:14.078
spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases.

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:18.602
Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.484
but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:24.895
The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:28.143
to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear.

00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:32.294
So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size.

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:36.253
They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:39.384
to devour their smaller pond mates.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.147
Nourished by this extra fuel,

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:45.875
they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.990
The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.705
to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:56.073
All of these animals do.

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.626
If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:01.538
Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:06.439
was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.699
Well-known cannibals,

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:10.284
like the praying mantis
and black widow spider,

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.798
were considered bizarre exceptions.

00:01:12.798 --> 00:01:17.438
But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule.

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.188
While it may seem counterproductive

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.677
for members of the same species 
to eat each other,

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:25.270
cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.918
by reducing competition,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:28.137
culling the weak,

00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:30.199
and bolstering the strong.

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.397
Some species, like the spadefoot toad,

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:35.739
cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:37.586
Their situation is precarious,

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:41.998
but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation.

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:45.171
Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.866
where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.319
or dangerous environmental conditions.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.277
Other species, including many fish,

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:57.148
indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior.

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.472
Fish produce large numbers of tiny young,

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:03.997
and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring

00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:07.198
as humans do for a handful of raisins.

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:12.408
Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals,

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:14.417
and with thousands of eggs in a clutch,

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:19.175
plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.725
Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults—

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.518
siblings eat each other too.

00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:28.058
Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:31.557
inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times.

00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:34.347
When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs,

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.707
they eat the other eggs and hatchlings

00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:40.638
until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains.

00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:44.578
When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:47.327
who stand a better chance of surviving.

00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:49.497
Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition,

00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:52.667
young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:53.658
Hamsters,

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:54.445
rats,

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.135
and other rodent mothers

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.388
will eat some of their young
if they’re sick,

00:02:58.388 --> 00:02:59.127
dead,

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.986
or simply too numerous to feed.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:04.529
In other mammals, 
including bears and lions,

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.978
males will kill offspring 
sired by another.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:12.597
That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly

00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:15.103
than if they were caring for a cub.

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:19.947
Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs.

00:03:19.947 --> 00:03:24.017
Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups,

00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:27.578
but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings

00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:32.617
as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots.

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:36.948
When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females,

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:41.268
usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller.

00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:46.626
Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:50.756
Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault,

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:55.476
bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts.

00:03:55.476 --> 00:04:00.817
The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen.

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:04.497
Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray,

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:05.926
often half-eaten,

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:10.366
to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.432
So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm,

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:16.068
but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:20.740
to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.437
All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is

00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:25.781
as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom

00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.869
as other, better-recognized behaviors.

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.327
As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature,

00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:33.915
we might ask ourselves,

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:38.677
what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?
