IRENE NOKAN: Well, hi, everyone.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.210
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.510
My name is Irene
[? Nokan ?], and I

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.960
am on the large customer sales
team out of San Francisco.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.140
I'm here today to introduce
chef Jason Halverson, formerly

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.170
the sous chef of Michael Mina.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250
He is now the executive chef at
two San Francisco restaurants,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.690
Stones Throw in Russian Hill
and Trestle in Jackson Square.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.350
So please join me in
giving him a warm welcome.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.560
JASON HALVERSON: Thank you.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.951
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:34.450
Welcome.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.825
Thank you for having us.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.540
It's super exciting.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.870
We're going to
make a pasta dish.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.080
Pasta really makes me happy.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.480
It's a fun dish that really just
includes things that I like.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.890
And that's what's fun about
cooking for me, where you can

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.890
include things that you like.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.660
If you like something,
you add more of it.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.160
If you don't like
something, keep it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.110
out of there, which
makes it really fun.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.630
So what we're making is
a squid ink coquille.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.540
So coquille being the
shape of the pasta.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.870
Squid ink being the
base or the flavor

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.470
or the coloring of
what we're making.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.510
But to start we're
going to make the sauce.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.800
So the sauce itself is a
shellfish and caper sauce.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.430
It's slightly spicy.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.110
The whole dish is
slightly spicy.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.630
There's a lot of acid.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.900
It's really, slightly rich,
which makes it a lot of fun.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.940
So to start in a pan, one
thing that we've done already

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.400
is we've cut off
mussels and clams.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.610
If anybody hasn't ever cooked
mussels and clams, what

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.650
we really did is we're
using it for the juice.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.200
And we're going to use the
clams and mussels later.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.330
But basically we had
a pan get really hot.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
We added the mussels and
the clams, covered them

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.260
in white wine, covered
the pot, and what

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.240
happens is they'll
steam opened letting out

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.290
a lot of their liquid, which
is a great base for a sauce.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.910
Which you'll see how we
use it here in a second.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.330
So trying to figure out how
to use this fancy stove.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.640
So what we have-- a smaller
pot, a little bit of oil.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.620
What we're going to do
is to the base of this,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.036
start by sweating
out some onions.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.450
We're going to try to
make these translucent.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.940
You'll see, I guess in
my style of cooking,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.350
onions are used as a
base for a lot of things.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.320
It's just a great foundation.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.680
We'll get a lot of nice
flavor out of this.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.570
I also like how they
smell, which is weird.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.440
So we'll let that
kind of start off.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.500
Other ingredients in the
sauce itself are capers.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.920
Capers for me add a
saltiness, which I really

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.690
like, without adding just a
handful or big pinch of salt.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.260
It actually adds a flavor, which
has its own again, salinity.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.550
We'll have sliced garlic.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.200
Again, the spicy component
to it is a piri piri chili.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.950
It's pretty spicy.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.420
It's a North African chili.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.680
This one happens to be dried.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.180
If for any reason
you can't find these,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.540
a chili flake is a
great substitution.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640
What's fun again,
about this is if you're

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.140
a fan of something spicy,
go ahead, get crazy with it,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.090
use a lot.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.750
But if you're kind of
timid about it, shy away.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.219
It's kind of making
what you want.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.260
What we're going to do is
add some sliced garlic.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.760
And more or less
seeing fit to you.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.270
We're going to take a
couple of these piri piris.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.720
If you use these, make sure
to wash your hands after.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.455
Don't touch your face,
don't do anything else,

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:49.555
just wash your hands.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.500
And with these, I'm
just about adding

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.475
or I'm going to add
four or five of these.

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.600
You can always add more,
it's hard to take it away,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.110
so kind of a fun note with that.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.420
Capers.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.899
Capers themselves are going
to be the main salt component,

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.940
so I actually enjoy quite
a few of that in there.

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:23.290
And pretty soon you should be
able to start smelling this.

00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:34.140
IRENE NOKAN: How do
you go about finding

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.665
quality shellfish like the
ones you're using here today?

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.290
JASON HALVERSON:
There's a lot of trust

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.760
that we have like
fish purveyors.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.387
And you kind of just build this
trust on what they're getting

00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:44.720
and who they're getting it from.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.470
And it's kind of like
a bad relationship

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.697
where you always want
to trust that they're

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:53.780
going to get you the best.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.280
And they usually
do, but those times

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.500
where if you run into
somebody that gives you just

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.591
bad shellfish, it's really bad.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.340
Stay away from it.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.228
I tend not to try
to use them anymore.

00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.840
So as you guys can see, or I
don't know if you guys can see,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.800
it's really starting
just to cook really fast.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.130
The onions are translucent,
the garlic has a smell.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:24.060
Next thing, we have a
little extra white wine.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.200
So white wine, you really want
something that's not sweet.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.311
I like acid wines.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.070
You're starting to look at even
the style of like a Chardonnay

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.526
or Sauvignon Blanc,
those kind of things.

00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.817
Again, just kind of trying
to stay away from sweetness.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.810
And what you're
going to let this do

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.139
is now come up to a boil.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.680
Really what you're trying to do
is burn out that raw alcohol.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.980
All right.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.105
You're going to get that
flavor, you may get drunk,

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.444
I don't know.

00:05:52.444 --> 00:05:54.360
But the idea is just to
burn out that alcohol.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.742
So that's up to a boil now.

00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:00.700
The last thing we're
going to add to this sauce

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.690
before we start on
the rest of it again,

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.959
is all the liquor from
cooking the mussels and clams.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.000
When you're cooking your
mussels and clams again,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.624
save the juice.

00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:10.470
It's really good.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.790
One thing you want to do is,
before you cook your shellfish,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.450
try to soak it in water.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.034
Or let them kind of purge
out any extra sediment

00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:18.700
that's in there.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.600
Otherwise you're going to end
up with something really gritty.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.650
And after that, after
we cook it, we also

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.750
strain it again just to
make sure there's no grit.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.785
So I'll add that in.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:27.691
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:28.982
JASON HALVERSON: What was that?

00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:32.492
AUDIENCE: What did you add
to cook in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.700
JASON HALVERSON: Just the
wine, or just the same wine

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.971
that we used for the sauce.

00:06:35.971 --> 00:06:37.220
AUDIENCE: Was there any water?

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.720
JASON HALVERSON: No water.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.380
Water acts for me
like it's always

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.250
great to have and use
when you're cooking.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.960
It's kind of that,
it dilutes flavors.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.210
So you're going to have to
cook something a little bit

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.651
longer just to make that happen.

00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:53.290
So again, literally, we're going
to let this come up to a boil.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.250
We'll turn it down.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.583
You just really want to let
these flavors come together.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.370
It takes about 10, 15 minutes
in a batch about this size.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.440
So give it a taste and make
sure it's what you want.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.430
The next thing we're going
to make is the pasta.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.310
So anybody ever made pasta?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.990
Anybody?

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.490
Yeah?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.200
A lot of fun.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.790
I love making pasta.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.590
The pasta we're going
to make, no eggs.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.090
OK.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.790
So really kind of a hand
rolled style pasta dough.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.340
What we have here in the
bowl, two different flours.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.091
We have Double 00 flour
and Extra Fancy Durum.

00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.590
So the combination,
what you'll see,

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.730
just makes for a different
texture of pasta.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.890
We like this one really
dense, because what

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.230
happens when you cook it,
especially in the sauce,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.400
it starts to absorb the sauce.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.540
Just kind of making
things taste better.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.090
With that what we have here
is a combination of water,

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.080
just like we talked
about, and squid ink.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.460
Squid ink, not a lot of
flavor necessarily in it.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.710
You're not gonna necessarily
get this super brininess,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.260
but you definitely
get this color,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.885
which kind of associate with.

00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:56.760
More so just going to
add all these together.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.176
IRENE NOKAN: Is
there a reason why

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:01.400
you prefer to add the
squid ink with the pasta

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.467
versus in the sauce?

00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:04.508
JASON HALVERSON: I like,
that's a great question.

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:08.440
First and foremost,
when I'm eating it,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.830
I've had bad experiences
where I eat it as a sauce,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.310
and then for some reason I
smile and I have black teeth.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.210
Not so hot.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.810
It gets kind of weird.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.660
I look like that
guy, which is no fun.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.550
So it actually kind of helps
tame the whole I guess,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.520
identity of the squid ink.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.128
So I'm going to
kind of cheat here.

00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:34.929
We're going to use
the KitchenAid.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.470
We're going to start
with the paddle.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.280
I don't know if you
guys can see it.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.421
More so just to kind of
bring the dough together.

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:48.170
IRENE NOKAN: And for
those who don't know,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.030
what is Double 00 flour,
and where can you get that?

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.446
JASON HALVERSON: You can get
it, most of these ingredients

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:56.630
you'll be able to find really
easily at a Whole Foods readily

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.130
available.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.526
It's an extra milled flour.

00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:03.700
Its has a different gluten
and different absorption

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.520
rate than something
like an AP flour.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.860
You can absolutely
make it with that,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.420
this just helps with
again, the textures,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.740
the density, things like that.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.480
So let's see if I can't--

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.992
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:21.200
JASON HALVERSON: I've also
found it at a Whole Foods.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.050
Obviously we have our
own purveyor for it,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.340
but for the small amounts,
instead of buying a huge jar,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.397
I've definitely seen it
at a Whole Foods for sure.

00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:32.730
IRENE NOKAN: And for those
who didn't hear the question,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.700
it was where do you
source the squid ink.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.610
JASON HALVERSON:
Hand that to you.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.271
This is great.

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:47.610
In case you guys are wondering,
this is Ryan over here.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.623
He usually tells me what to
do, so this is kind of nice.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.990
IRENE NOKAN: Is he with
you in the kitchen, too?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.460
JASON HALVERSON: He's usually
yelling at me in the kitchen.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.210
IRENE NOKAN: Yeah?

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.420
JASON HALVERSON: But, so
really what's going to happen

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.620
here is this dough's
going to come together.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.800
If anybody, again,
has made dough--

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.420
I'm going to try to
churn it somehow,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.922
I'm looking at the
screen back there--

00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:15.630
usually a dough will
come together really

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.730
fast with this one with no egg.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.000
You really actually want
it as dry as possible.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.060
It becomes really difficult to
work with when it's super dry,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.750
but the outcome is way better.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.310
Obviously if you
add too much water,

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.709
it just becomes really
elasticky and kind of a mess.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:35.250
What's fun about these pastas
is they hold their shape really

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.140
well when the texture's right.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.050
So that's kind of what
we're looking for.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.654
So this is actually going
to take a little while.

00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:46.570
It will come together.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.267
That's what it does.

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:50.100
But to kind of move
with it, what we've done

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.775
is actually made
the pasta itself.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.862
It's a nice big
black sheet of pasta.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.340
Started this week,
we're fortunate to have

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.950
a pasta machine,
which makes working

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.020
with pasta a little bit easier.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.890
And what we've done, we've just
rolled it out into a sheet.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.160
So rolled out to say, just
over an eighth of an inch.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.320
And what we do is we
just cut little squares.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.876
It's fun.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.340
One of the reasons
I like making pasta

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.390
is there are so many different
shapes you can kind of go with.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.640
Even if it's not really a
shape, you made it yourself,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.189
so it's kind of cool.

00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:37.730
It's organic.

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:44.773
So just cutting
into little squares.

00:11:49.864 --> 00:11:51.280
And then what we're
going to do is

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.738
we're going to use
a little gnocchi

00:11:52.738 --> 00:12:01.944
board to kind of
make a shape, which

00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:03.110
you can find at most places.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.550
William Sonoma, Sur la Table,
Amazon, all those places

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.159
you can find them.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:11.700
As you guys can tell, this one's
been used just a little bit,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.621
makes a lot of pasta.

00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:14.620
You get a lot of ridges.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.290
You get ridges out of this,
you can start to make shapes.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.610
So what we do is with that
being somewhat of a square,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.950
we'll aim at rolling
from corner to corner.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.000
So what you're going
to do is push and kind

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.100
of roll, which is
fun for the shape.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.814
So push and roll.

00:12:30.814 --> 00:12:32.480
And that's kind of
what you end up with.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480
I got lucky on that one.

00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:37.960
IRENE NOKAN: You made
that look fancy so fast.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.026
JASON HALVERSON: I did.

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:40.470
I got lucky.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.559
So really again, you can
make all sorts of shapes.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:45.850
If it comes to being where
you don't have one of these,

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.350
it's not going to
be something where

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.440
you can't make this pasta.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.950
If you have a counter, which
I hope most of you guys do,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.320
you're making the pasta somehow,
roll it straight on the board.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.350
You're not gonna
really lose much.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.290
It's just kind of fun.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.280
Really just kind of build, I
guess, your repertoire of pasta

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.640
making.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.590
AUDIENCE: Use a fork.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.756
JASON HALVERSON: Use a fork.

00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:08.360
Absolutely.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.890
If you guys didn't hear, the
suggestion was to use a fork.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.190
Italian grandmothers use forks.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.731
I love Italian grandmothers,
and they make really good pasta.

00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:19.670
So absolutely go for it.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.960
But that's what you can do.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.422
What's fun is in the
case of what you'll

00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:25.880
see with this dish is if you're
going to have friends over,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.796
you can make most of
this dish all in advance.

00:13:27.796 --> 00:13:29.700
It becomes really easy.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.810
Almost feel like a
Sara Lee or someone

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.950
like that trying to tell
you guys how to do this.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:40.130
But feel free to make the pasta
head and just to be ready.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.850
So with this pasta, we'll have
a pot of boiling water, which

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.933
we don't have set up here.

00:13:43.933 --> 00:13:46.070
We made pasta already.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.770
Make sure it's up to a boil,
lightly seasoned with salt.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.560
And the reason I
say lightly seasoned

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.000
is because the sauce itself
is going to have salt. Again,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.374
you can always
add salt, you just

00:13:54.374 --> 00:13:56.940
don't want to hit that point
of something being salty.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.050
You'll boil it for
about three minutes.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.320
You'll still have a little
bit, it'll be al dente.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.340
You'll still have a
little bit of a bite.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.340
Just kind of adding to the
right texture for this dish, so

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.030
basically, after you're
done blanching the pasta.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.070
See where we're at here.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.030
This is what it looks like.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.630
It's going to be a
nice, sturdy pasta.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.060
It's really, it's what it is.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.790
We'll start that.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.300
Get this out of the way.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.200
Again, being a shellfish
pasta, what we're going to do

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.190
is I'm going to show you guys
all the seafoods that we use.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:33.910
I love seafood.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.910
Anybody here
allergic to seafood?

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.628
I hope not.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.310
Might not like me.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.852
So again, to start
mussels and clams,

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:51.060
we cooked them in white wine.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.982
This is exactly what
we use for the sauce.

00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:54.440
Chef Deedee back
there actually did

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.720
a great job of cooking the
pasta or the shellfish.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.080
Thank you for doing that.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.040
Appreciate it.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.770
So again, it's covered or a
hot pan, all the shellfish,

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.849
white wine is covered.

00:15:03.849 --> 00:15:05.390
You're going to wait
until they open.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.890
That's it.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.820
They're ready to
go at that point.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.520
After that, we separated
it from the liquid,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.540
and all we're going to do is
take them out of the shell.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.235
If they're not open, don't
try to fight them open.

00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:17.610
If everything else
is open, don't

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.440
try to break them
open to get it out.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.120
That's not necessarily a good
sign of a good shellfish.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.310
So that was the mussels.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.701
The clams, the exact same thing.

00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:30.200
Just kind of pulling
these guys out.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.850
There you go.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.896
So we have that.

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:46.770
Don't know why I did
this, but everything can

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.430
kind of go in the same bowl.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.388
It's all going to go in
the same place anyways.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.765
So then after that
we have our calamari.

00:15:55.765 --> 00:15:56.600
I love calamari.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.520
I can eat it fried,
baked, fried again.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.147
Love the stuff.

00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:05.980
And again with this,
make it as you see fit.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.910
With this we're going
to just do rings.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.950
It's pretty straightforward,
just cutting straight across.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:19.650
Nothing fancy with this.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.858
You can absolutely get fancy.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.330
Again, another way, too, if you
don't have calamari, calamari

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.980
steak, you know what I mean.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.660
The possibilities
are pretty endless.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.890
Kind of based on what you
have, what you want to eat.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.320
We've done this version of a,
or this dish with a version

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.910
of lobster before.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.356
That was super fancy,
especially for pasta.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.900
And we'll do one more.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.462
Just make-- oh, go ahead.

00:16:58.462 --> 00:17:00.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.700
JASON HALVERSON: We usually do.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.180
They're fun to throw in there.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.990
They're just kind of waving
all around, which is fun,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:12.190
but just in this instance,
we don't happen to have them.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.569
So another one of my
favorites, shrimp.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.390
I love shrimp.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.420
We won't even talk about
fried or anything again.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.254
That's a given.

00:17:21.254 --> 00:17:22.545
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:23.400
JASON HALVERSON: Mhm.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.483
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
about your restaurants.

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:27.720
So you've got a couple.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.087
What's the difference?

00:17:29.087 --> 00:17:29.920
JASON HALVERSON: Oh.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.461
Ryan, you want to
take that one over?

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.570
RYAN: Sure.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.687
This is perfect.

00:17:37.687 --> 00:17:40.020
I don't know how many of
people have been up to the city

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.020
or been to Stones Throw.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.290
Stones Throw was our
first restaurant.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.820
When we both were at Michael
Mina and different situations

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.200
in the past, we decided
to go open that.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.060
Think of it if you took a
Michael Mina style restaurant

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.960
and plopped it into
a neighborhood.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.820
A little more affordable,
not as complicated,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.390
a lot more comfortable
in the style

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.960
of environment and service.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.035
Had that for about
a year and a half,

00:18:04.035 --> 00:18:05.910
and then decided to open
a second restaurant.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.130
So Trestle has been open
for maybe four months now.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.460
Completely shifted
directions on that,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.750
and that is a prefix
three course menu for $35.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.660
It's the only thing
we offer where

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.067
you get a choice between
two items on each course.

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:22.650
You can add a pasta
course if you want

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.310
for $10, but the similar style.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.517
I mean, his food,
it's got a style.

00:18:29.517 --> 00:18:32.100
You will recognize if you come
to one or the other restaurant,

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.100
there is a stylistic
similarity between the two.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.080
Stones Throw affords us a little
more complexity in dishes.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.920
We have more staff.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.749
We have more space,
a larger menu,

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:43.040
so we can do things that are
a little more complicated.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.020
Also the price difference
helps when you charge $35,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.470
you're kind of a little
restricted in what you can do.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.680
But you'll see the
same thought process

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.821
behind the food, service,
the experience at both spots.

00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:58.320
And we're opening
another restaurant

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.880
at the end of the year.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.454
So we're staying busy.

00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:02.370
JASON HALVERSON: Yeah!

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.998
IRENE NOKAN: Exciting.

00:19:03.998 --> 00:19:06.260
AUDIENCE: What's the concept
of the third restaurant?

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.520
RYAN: Interesting question.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.894
We're sharing-- oh.

00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:13.310
The question is
what's the concept

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.420
of the third restaurant.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.801
We're sharing high
level details.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.210
Yes.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.999
So it's at the 100 Van
Ness building, which used

00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:24.290
to be the old AAA headquarters.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.998
It's on the corner of
Van Ness and Hayes.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.630
Almost like right next
to Vanessa and Market.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.410
And we're doing two
concepts in there.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.060
One is going to be a
cafe and a sandwich shop.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.840
So we're partnering
with a coffee roaster

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.040
from Los Angeles called LAMILL,
doing an interesting coffee

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.680
program, tea program, and then
kind of artisinal sandwiches.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.010
We've been running one of
them on UberEATS, actually.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.710
Just recently we do a
chicken parm sandwich.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.870
That's pretty awesome.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.440
And then the other
is going to be

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.880
kind of a hybrid between fine
dining and fast casual service.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.180
It's no reservations.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.310
There's some interesting
tech components

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.050
we're trying to put into it.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.965
And you should get
the feel like you're

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:07.320
in one of our restaurants,
but without the same sequence

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.940
of service in a
two hour setting.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.220
You should be able
to get in and out,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.636
you're in the
theater area, you're

00:20:11.636 --> 00:20:13.550
next to the civic center.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.210
So that's the general
gist of where it's going.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.440
Probably in a few weeks, we'll
announce a little bit more.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.440
JASON HALVERSON:
I like your style.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.190
IRENE NOKAN: I remember
reading that there

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.990
was a sort of charity
component to Stones Throw

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.790
that you were encouraging
patrons to come and bring

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.890
canned food in.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.680
Do you still do that?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.452
RYAN: We do, so-- are you ready
to keep going with the dish?

00:20:35.452 --> 00:20:36.160
I don't want to--

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.610
JASON HALVERSON: Keep going.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.864
RYAN: So, yeah, so from
kind of month two on when

00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:42.780
we started Stones Throw,
he and I got together

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.738
and we talked about it.

00:20:43.738 --> 00:20:46.140
We really want to do a
charitable event or component,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.670
so we do what we call Eat Like
a Chef, Drink Like a Song.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.200
So since February
of 2014, every month

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.180
we invite a guest
chef to come in,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.370
and we do a five course
tasting menu the last Monday

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.550
of every month.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.309
We do half the menu,
they do half the menu.

00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:00.850
And all the proceeds
go to a charity.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.220
We pick one charity per year.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.230
So last year it
was the food bank,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.940
this year we chose Ronnie
Lott's All Stars Helping Kids.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.550
And then we kind of
evolved from there

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.970
with Ronnie Lott being on board.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.490
I'm hoping most of you
know who Ronnie Lott is.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.087
Hall of Fame, 49er, Super
Bowl hero, et cetera.

00:21:16.087 --> 00:21:17.420
JASON HALVERSON: Yeah, for sure.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.810
RYAN: Cut off a finger in a game
to win a Super Bowl, et cetera.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.840
We've kind of introduced
athletes into the mix.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.550
So we had last
month was Boulevard

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.110
was the guest restaurant, Joe
Montana was to guest athlete.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.010
And the idea behind
the event is it's

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.500
designed for people like us.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.270
It's younger
professionals who don't

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.860
want to go to a gala
dinner, who don't

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.890
want to spend $500 a plate.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.540
And the idea was we can
teach the next generation how

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.857
to give back by saying, you
can come for $60 a person,

00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:42.940
have a five course dinner.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.310
Whereas, if you go anywhere
else in San Francisco for dinner

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.559
like I did last night, you'll
spend way more than $60.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.350
And here all the money
goes to the charity.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.975
So year to date, this year we've
already donated through $30,000

00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.100
just from doing eight events
or nine events for it.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.620
And we have two more
up coming, so if you're

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.120
looking for an
interesting event,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.660
this month is Kim Alter from
Dana Patterson's group Plum

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.280
Haven.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.056
She's opening a new
project on her own.

00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:08.430
And then Michael
Mina is actually

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.839
doing the one in November to
finish up the year for us.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:12.630
IRENE NOKAN: Great.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.990
Thank you.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.330
JASON HALVERSON: Super exciting.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.980
It's a lot of fun.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.990
So back into the dish right now.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.240
We've gotten to the point
where we're basically ready.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.460
Let's sample the whole thing.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.342
If you were going to do this
for a party, you're ready to go.

00:22:27.342 --> 00:22:30.140
You ready to cook for your
friends without sweating a lot,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.551
which is nice.

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.800
And we'll kind of just bring
it all back together just

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.910
to make sure that
we're all there.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.490
So try to make sure
this is the right place.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.190
So again we've made the sauce,
we have pasta, it's blanched.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.170
It's ready to go.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.926
All the shellfishes that we
want, love, ready to eat.

00:22:51.926 --> 00:22:53.800
The same piri piris,
we're just going to kind

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.510
of refortify that flavor.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.654
The more sliced garlic.

00:22:57.654 --> 00:22:59.070
And you guys are
going to see what

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.810
we're going to deal with
that here in a second.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.790
Touch of butter and lemon juice.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.500
Lemon juice is going to just
clean the whole dish up.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.040
You guys will see
here in a second.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.050
And then the last one, which
we didn't really get to.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:17.490
For me, pasta dishes can
become extremely heavy, very

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.470
kind of mundane to eat, I guess.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.670
So one of the things
that I really love

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.230
is kind of a more
fresh component.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.940
So what we have here is
what's called peacock kale.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.357
We took out the stems, kind
of made small little bites out

00:23:32.357 --> 00:23:32.856
of it.

00:23:32.856 --> 00:23:34.700
What it does is it
lightly wilts, obviously.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.074
With the greens,
you guys usually

00:23:36.074 --> 00:23:39.460
want to cook them down and
maybe braise them however so.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.520
This is light enough
or it's sturdy

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.370
enough to where it won't
just kind of break apart

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.370
and/or become a mess.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.410
But it's also light
enough to where

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.160
it's like if you
lightly wilt it, give it

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.220
just a little bit of heat,
it's really pleasurable to eat.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.910
It also holds like sauces and
things like that really well.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:02.210
So hot pan is what we have here.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.550
And add just a touch of oil.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.826
A lot of people are actually
afraid to cook with oil.

00:24:05.826 --> 00:24:08.200
Not in the sense of like afraid
I'm not going to use oil,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.770
but usually the problem
with cooking at home

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.103
is people don't use like enough.

00:24:13.399 --> 00:24:15.190
Not that you need to
fill the whole bottom,

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.850
but it definitely helps
in the cooking process.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.300
So hopefully I'm
using this right.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.270
So with the pan more so on
the higher side of heat,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.740
slice garlic.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.660
OK?

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:35.670
It has this nice sound, you know
you're doing something right.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.930
And what we're going
to do is not quite,

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.850
we're not going to burn it,
but we're going to toast it.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.308
And what that does is it's
going to add this kind of really

00:24:45.308 --> 00:24:46.719
distinct flavor.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.060
That's really kind of
just distinct, especially

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.490
to this day for us.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.740
And for me that's kind of
like the way I like to cook.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.900
You're trying to layer a lot of
flavors via what salty, what's

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.310
sweet in a dish, what's
the richness, what's

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.916
the acid component.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:12.290
It's almost like
formula cooking,

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.772
but it's just the idea of how
do you balance out a dish.

00:25:15.772 --> 00:25:17.230
So as you guys can
see, it's really

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.160
starting just to get brown now.

00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:24.300
We're going to go just
a little bit longer.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.758
Just kind of to
the point where you

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:28.530
don't want to necessarily
walk away from it.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.570
IRENE NOKAN: Do you have
any go to ingredients

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.496
to elevate a dish's flavor?

00:25:34.496 --> 00:25:36.140
Like, your favorite?

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.620
JASON HALVERSON: My
favorite, like honestly,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.620
onions, as dumb as that sounds,
actually add a layer of flavor.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.142
That's kind of just the most
apparent, that and shallots.

00:25:50.142 --> 00:25:52.600
And then I'm a huge spice freak,
not in the sense of things

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.120
being spicy, but just spices
and spice blends and things

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.720
like that.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.180
So what we've done is we've
added the shellfish or all

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.021
the sea food.

00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.937
We're going to add in a
couple of our chilies.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.470
Again, more so however
you want it to taste.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.445
Again, you want it
spicy, get crazy.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.530
Kind of breaking them in here.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.765
Give that a stir.

00:26:25.765 --> 00:26:27.140
Now we're going
to add our sauce.

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:33.807
Giving myself a
little steam bath.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.020
We're going to add in our pasta.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.820
Again, this is already cooked.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.360
So now we're just looking
to kind of warm it through.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.630
We're gonna add just,
everybody close your eyes

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.290
for two seconds, just a
just a touch of butter.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.060
I'll save one in there.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.434
You guys didn't close your eyes.

00:27:09.434 --> 00:27:11.600
IRENE NOKAN: Why do you add
it at the end like that?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.725
JASON HALVERSON: So what
you're going to try to do,

00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:15.290
butter is fat, fat emulsifies.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.706
So what we're
trying to do is make

00:27:16.706 --> 00:27:20.350
this like a rich,
kind of glazy pasta,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.059
which helps with the addition.

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:23.600
The sequence of
steps with it kind of

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.380
helps make its own sauce as
opposed to having a big pot

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.830
of like this creamy sauce.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.706
You're kind of just making a
sauce in itself or in the pan.

00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:38.140
They're adding
chilies back they're.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.410
It's going to hit you guys
here in a few seconds,

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.630
so if this side starts
coughing, you guys are safe.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.212
I promise.

00:27:49.372 --> 00:27:50.830
If you guys really
take a look it's

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.352
like, before it was
just liquid, now it's

00:27:53.352 --> 00:27:54.685
starting to have this viscosity.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.090
One more chili.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.100
Does everybody see that?

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.060
Now it's more of like a sauce in
here as opposed to just water.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.946
Oh, it gotcha.

00:28:30.946 --> 00:28:35.510
[LAUGHING]

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.820
Pinch of salt. Taste your food.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.930
Make sure it's what you like.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.237
AUDIENCE: Do you
need a taste tester?

00:28:44.237 --> 00:28:45.320
IRENE NOKAN: Do you need--

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.398
[LAUGHING]

00:28:47.398 --> 00:28:48.398
JASON HALVERSON: Always.

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:52.991
It's going to be good.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.614
So the last two things
to go in to the point

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:02.030
where we're almost
there are going

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:08.360
to be the greens and, not
the cooking oil, lemon juice.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:15.229
For me I add the kale first,
because I want to just give it

00:29:15.229 --> 00:29:16.520
just a little bit to wilt down.

00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:24.640
With the kale being raw,
I've already tasted it.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.181
I know I just want
a touch more salt,

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:27.960
because of what the
flavor of this is.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.740
This burner doesn't like that.

00:29:57.635 --> 00:29:59.010
And as you guys
can notice again,

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.676
that starting just
to break down itself.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.870
anybody's offended
by butter, I'm sorry.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.262
AUDIENCE: Can I ask,
so this, everyone keeps

00:30:17.262 --> 00:30:19.720
saying it's very simple, but
when I think about making this

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.240
at home, I think, this is
more like a Saturday night

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.820
kind of dish, I think.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.653
JASON HALVERSON: I like
your Saturday night.

00:30:25.653 --> 00:30:27.555
[LAUGHING]

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:29.180
AUDIENCE: Do you have
things, like kind

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.500
of go to favorites that you
make at home that are easy?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.040
JASON HALVERSON: I'm super
simple when I'm at home.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.810
Like for me, I love
roasted chicken,

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.050
as dumb as that sounds.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.220
It's like the day you make
the perfect roasted chicken,

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.182
it's kind of that
oh, yeah, I'm going

00:30:42.182 --> 00:30:45.080
to make it again and again.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080
I love simple foods.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.500
I love one pot dishes.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.220
Stew is my favorite.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.120
Actually, kind of my go to,
two go tos in that style.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.590
Anybody been to Olive Garden?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.230
Cheesy, I love Olive Garden.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.910
I make that soup all the time.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:02.520
I'm a jerk.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.930
I love that stuff.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.350
It's potatoes, it's
sausage, it's kale,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.440
it's rich, it's hearty,
like that kind of thing.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.700
White bean stews, the
base to it is great,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.040
whether you want to go
like chorizo and pekios,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.445
or you want to go sausage
and lots of wine, who knows.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.320
It's there, you know.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.550
And that's kind of my
favorite part about cooking.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.450
Got a bowl, by chance, chef?

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:31.530
Thank you.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.890
Thank you.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.820
Thank you.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.950
IRENE NOKAN: Just to
add to that question,

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.960
for those of us
here in the room who

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.820
often have a lot of work
demands and family demands

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.290
and don't have a lot of
time to cook at home,

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.620
do you have any
recommendations or tips for how

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.100
to go about that more
efficiently so we can do it

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.805
in less time?

00:31:51.805 --> 00:31:52.100
JASON HALVERSON: Hire me.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.033
IRENE NOKAN: Hire you?

00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:56.187
Oh, hey, all right.

00:31:56.187 --> 00:31:58.020
JASON HALVERSON: For
me, I always love, it's

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.811
always fun to cook.

00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:01.810
And so at the restaurants, we
do what's called family meal.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.340
Family meal being the time
where everybody gets together.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.450
It's right before service.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.084
We cook dinner for
ourselves, basically.

00:32:09.084 --> 00:32:10.500
The fun thing about
it is it's not

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.970
the idea ever of necessarily
cooking something that's

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:14.824
fresh that day.

00:32:14.824 --> 00:32:16.490
The example of a
roasted chicken is hey,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.245
we may take a roasted, a
bunch of roasted chickens.

00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:20.120
You know what I mean?

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.909
It's the case.

00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:22.200
Great, we have roasted chicken.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.610
Let's eat.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.109
I'm happy.

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:24.390
I'm excited.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.640
We're not going to eat it all.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.150
So what we did is
we just basically

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.860
prepped at that time
for the next day.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.315
So if we pick the chicken after
that, it may be chicken soup.

00:32:32.315 --> 00:32:33.190
You know what I mean?

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.990
Chicken and potato, chicken
and kale, chicken and beans,

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.650
I don't know.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.020
Whatever anybody's excited for.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.221
So that's kind of
how we like to cook.

00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:40.720
I mean--

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.595
IRENE NOKAN: So maybe
you could do a big meal

00:32:42.595 --> 00:32:43.810
like on Sunday, and--

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.270
JASON HALVERSON: Exactly.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.100
IRENE NOKAN: --stretch it out.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.141
JASON HALVERSON: Exactly.

00:32:46.141 --> 00:32:49.547
IRENE NOKAN: The uses of
it, anyway, over the week.

00:32:49.547 --> 00:32:52.130
JASON HALVERSON: So here are the
dishes done, lots of seafood.

00:32:56.277 --> 00:32:58.110
This is for everybody
to share, just in case

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.022
you guys were wondering.

00:32:59.022 --> 00:32:59.400
[LAUGHING]

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.608
IRENE NOKAN: I don't think
that's going to be enough.

00:33:01.608 --> 00:33:05.535
[LAUGHING]

00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:07.640
JASON HALVERSON:
But that right there

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.180
is just a fun bowl of pasta.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.177
So that's it.

00:33:12.177 --> 00:33:13.510
IRENE NOKAN: That looks so good.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.623
Thank you so much.

00:33:14.623 --> 00:33:18.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:20.810
JASON HALVERSON: You
can have the first one.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.492
IRENE NOKAN: Oh, thanks.

00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:24.749
Do we have time for questions?

00:33:24.749 --> 00:33:26.040
JASON HALVERSON: Any questions.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.831
IRENE NOKAN: Great.

00:33:26.831 --> 00:33:28.227
Does anyone have any questions?

00:33:28.227 --> 00:33:30.060
JASON HALVERSON: I'm
always scared of these.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.009
[LAUGHING]

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:32.300
AUDIENCE: It's a good question.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.890
I went to Stones
Throw a while ago,

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.060
and I remember fondly
that they had an option

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.425
to give a suggestion
for a dessert.

00:33:40.425 --> 00:33:41.300
JASON HALVERSON: Yes.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.760
AUDIENCE: Just wondering
what came of that.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.370
JASON HALVERSON:
So the question is,

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.680
or I guess, to
expand the question,

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:54.900
at Stones Throw what's really
fun is I have a pastry chef.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.500
She's great, but what makes
it fun for people to come in

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.880
is our desserts.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.530
And so our dessert program is
after you finish your dinner,

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.886
you can have dessert.

00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:09.167
[LAUGHING] What we
do-- It's so scary.

00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:10.500
What we do is we draw up a menu.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.570
On the bottom of the menu, our
program is childhood favorites.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.460
What was your favorite
childhood dessert?

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.280
Mine was like not
necessarily dessert,

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.821
but mine was peanut
butter and jelly.

00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:21.659
I love peanut butter
and jelly, still do.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.150
What we ask for is a suggestion.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.469
What's your favorite
childhood dessert?

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.487
We ask for your e-mail
or your phone number.

00:34:28.487 --> 00:34:30.070
We'll give you a
call if we choose it.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.782
Come in, try it.

00:34:30.782 --> 00:34:33.800
See what you think of our
rendition of a dessert.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.076
So it's constantly evolving.

00:34:35.076 --> 00:34:37.159
Part of it has to deal
with the season, part of it

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:42.699
has to deal with kind of just
what's going on at that time.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.360
But if we choose
it, you come in.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.220
You try it.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.969
Hopefully, you kind
of relive a little bit

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:52.540
of a childhood, a little bit
of your childhood, I guess.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.410
Current desserts right now
are peanut butter and jelly.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:01.560
So we do vanilla, sugar,
[? Doucet ?] beignets.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.840
We do it with a little bit of
candy peanuts, peanut cream,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.780
Concord grape gel,
and chocolate cremu.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.130
So the idea is really just
grab a donut, kind of get dirty

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.330
with it, and enjoy it.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.320
Strawberry cheesecake is
one of them right now.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.016
We have the blackberry crisp.

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.890
And again, these are
all kind of our version,

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.060
so it's not necessarily
going to be something

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.092
where you get a plate
and it's, oh, it's

00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:26.050
a blackberry crisp, thanks.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.110
Not necessarily that
straightforward,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.530
but it makes it fun for us.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.140
So it's always evolving.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.040
We have 2,000 suggestions.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.210
There's a lot of people
with a lot of suggestions,

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.750
which is fun.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.260
But that's kind of what we do.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.440
So anything else?

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.456
IRENE NOKAN: Do you have
a question right there?

00:35:46.456 --> 00:35:48.580
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about making the pasta,

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.470
because I saw during, when
you were making the pasta,

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.870
there were two different
hats that you choose.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.330
What's the difference
between those

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.987
for like blending the
flour and the squid ink?

00:35:58.987 --> 00:36:00.320
JASON HALVERSON: Say that again.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.150
My apologies.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.700
AUDIENCE: So I remember
during the presentation,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.230
there was a time
that you changed

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.280
the head of the blender.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.830
JASON HALVERSON: Yes.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.913
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between those two?

00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:12.230
JASON HALVERSON: So
one was a paddle.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.640
One is the dough hook itself.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.150
So the paddle, the dough
hook there is really no,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.460
there's nothing to it.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.370
It's the hook.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.370
It's going to grab something
that's already made

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.220
and move it around.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.680
The paddle, itself,
the reason we

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.520
did that is because you have a
lot of raw ingredients, which

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.228
is going to help bring
them all together.

00:36:30.228 --> 00:36:34.140
We got it to a certain
point where it's there,

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.380
or that it actually
started to come together.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.909
And then you're going to
want to just kind of check

00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:39.450
the moisture.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.740
But as you can tell
it's dough now.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.240
What we try to do
with the hook then

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.650
is use the hook to kind
of knead the dough.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.960
Kind of starting all the
glutens and to make the dough

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.790
come together, to give
it some structure.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.660
For this dough, it does
take a little while

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:02.140
to come together, which
makes the dough what it is.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.650
If it was super, we could
add a ton of water in here,

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.710
it would come together
in two seconds.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:11.139
But then you're going to have
this really soft pasta that's

00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:13.430
more like an overcooked noodle
before you even cook it.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:17.467
So that's kind of how
the two work together.

00:37:21.862 --> 00:37:23.570
AUDIENCE: If you don't
have a KitchenAid,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.196
is it very hard to
make your own pasta?

00:37:25.196 --> 00:37:26.278
JASON HALVERSON: It's not.

00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:27.530
It's more like a workout.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.687
[LAUGHING]

00:37:29.687 --> 00:37:32.020
I've actually worked in a
kitchen where I wasn't allowed

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.980
to use this, which was fun.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.800
I got a really big right arm.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.070
So no.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.150
It's actually a
little bit more work.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:47.640
You tend to, it just takes
a little bit more work.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.460
That's it.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.627
Anything done by hand,
honestly, kind of the motto

00:37:50.627 --> 00:37:52.960
is it's going to take a little
more work no matter what.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.720
So it's honestly a lot
of fun to make pasta

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.720
by hand, especially this style.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.870
Again, with this, I think
you guys have the recipe

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.080
to the pasta dough.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.417
If you want to make it or
you didn't have squid ink,

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:07.500
it's the exact same thing.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.916
All you're doing is adding a
touch of water to this flour.

00:38:09.916 --> 00:38:12.030
It's two ingredients,
flours and water.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.700
And pretty straightforward
from there.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.450
IRENE NOKAN: And can
you talk a little bit

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:22.340
about the advantages of fresh
pasta versus a dried pasta?

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.510
JASON HALVERSON: I'm
not biased either.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:29.120
So fresh pasta,
we'll start here.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.220
Dried pasta, generally,
we're buying it.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.470
I don't have to make anything.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.310
It's kind of nice.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.280
What's really actually nice
about dry pastas for me is

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.660
there's a little bit
more time cooking.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.100
So for me, if there is more
time to cook something,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.780
I get to do a little bit more
in terms of flavor and texture.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.190
And you're going to notice
those kind of things.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:53.080
So if I had grandma's
tomato sauce,

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:58.679
I might cook the dried pasta for
a little while 3/4 of the time

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:00.220
that it's supposed
to say on the box.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.010
I might take and add
in some grandma's sauce

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.367
and use that to cook it more.

00:39:04.367 --> 00:39:05.950
All of a sudden, my
pasta has absorbed

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:10.760
more of that sauce as opposed
to water, butter, and cheese.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.220
So that's kind of
one huge aspect.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.250
With fresh pasta, you
can manipulate it more so

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.250
in the style of what it is.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.510
Sheets, raviolis, things
like that, you can't really

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.390
do that with a dried pasta.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.510
So there's a lot of things.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.590
It's really kind of
just due to the scenario

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.610
in which you're in.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:28.080
IRENE NOKAN: Great.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.580
Thanks.

00:39:31.122 --> 00:39:33.080
AUDIENCE: I guess going
off with that question.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.320
So there are still called fresh
pasta from grocery stores.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.850
What's the difference
between those fresh pastas

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.989
versus if we make them at home?

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:44.530
JASON HALVERSON:
One costs you $6.99,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.780
and the other one
costs you nothing.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.860
It's the same process.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.330
They're really just doing
it in the industrial size.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.590
Honestly, there are some
great products out there.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.120
People have making stuff.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.180
What's fun, I think,
nowadays, there's

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.770
kind of the market for
people wanting the example

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.185
to cook a great meal.

00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:06.060
You know what I mean?

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.726
They don't have the
capacity necessarily

00:40:07.726 --> 00:40:10.050
to make everything from
scratch themselves.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.950
And so you have this market that
people are putting their heart

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.980
into a product for you.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.600
So if you like to do that,
take advantage of that.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.350
Have a good time.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.933
It makes cooking a
little bit more fun

00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:23.690
and a touch more desirable
when you're not having

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.930
to stress about everything.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.460
Like, hey, if I go buy
a fresh sheet of pasta

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.572
and I want to make raviolis,
all the power to you.

00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:29.280
Have fun with it.

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:32.720
IRENE NOKAN: All right.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.850
Well, thank you, again, Chef
Jason Halverson for joining us.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.400
Hope to see you again here, too.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.983
JASON HALVERSON:
Thanks for having us.

00:40:39.983 --> 00:40:42.880
[APPLAUSE]
