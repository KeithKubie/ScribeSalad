00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:05.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.803
MARK THOMPSON: Thank
you so much, thank you.

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:09.800
Thank you, David.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.550
And for those of you
who don't know David,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.400
David is really one of the
pioneers of executive coaching,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.620
really one of the people
who I think have written

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.250
so thoughtfully in inspiring
ways about where we

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.240
can find a life that matters.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.720
And that's what's so terrific
to have an opportunity

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
to talk with all of you
about today here s Google.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.090
I feel like I've been in a
Google office every week.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.940
I was just in Singapore
and London and New York,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700
and I'm on my way to "Joburg."

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.650
I mean, this is the front
desk at "Joburg" Google.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.420
It's howzit!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.460
And so I feel so welcome
when I come here.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.960
And I love coming to Google,
because it's a particularly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.900
poignant time for me, because
I started on a passion play

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.125
about 20 years ago, where I
was in a late night nightcap,

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:54.990
I'll admit.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.580
It was 1:00 o'clock
in the morning.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.140
We were in Switzerland.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.230
And we were jet
lagged and exhausted,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.000
and I was talking to a
couple of famous Googlers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.160
It was Larry and Sergey.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.020
They were at the
World Economic Forum.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.800
And we were all just
gushing about having

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.814
met someone iconic in
our lives that we never

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:11.730
thought we would meet.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.950
It was one of his last
public appearances.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.620
It was Nelson
Mandela, and we were

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.710
thinking about how this
guy should have been

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.400
the most angry man in Africa.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.750
And what did he
do with his life?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.050
He decided to reinvent a life
that mattered for millions

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.730
in rethinking the way
that he could have impact

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.250
and a sense of
belonging for a culture,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.410
and that set me on a path that
would be life-changing for me.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.710
I had been building
businesses most of my career

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.690
as an entrepreneur,
and I decided

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.639
that I wanted to pursue
this question of how

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.930
to create a life that mattered.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.490
Could we find the DNA?

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.060
Could we find some
ingredients by interviewing

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.430
enough successful,
high-achieving people

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.420
around the planet, and could we
unlock some of those secrets?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.590
Please come and sit down.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.380
I'm loving the opportunity,
also, to be on live streaming.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.080
And for those of you who did
get books and didn't get books,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.746
I'll make sure that
you get free copies,

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:08.340
so just ping me through
the Google Network.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.674
And for those that I
might see in other cities,

00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:12.340
please let me know
if you're interested.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.256
I'd love to share with
you all of the research

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:17.599
that we learn about how to
create a life that matters.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.390
And so here's where I
want to go with that.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.056
I want to start with
just a little piece

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.280
of archival footage,
here, of just the first 60

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.422
seconds of the first interview
we did starting in 1998.

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:28.380
And I'm going to bring
you to present, and then

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.254
share with you 8 of the
principles out of the 36

00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:31.920
that we learned.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.840
And the eight that I
picked is because they

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.140
are the most, I think,
hidden from our souls

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.010
and from the public.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.801
They are the ones that
aren't talked about,

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:41.760
the ones that have
the biggest impact.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.890
And let me share with
you Herb Kelleher, kind

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.662
of a famously happy
guy, who seems

00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:48.120
to have created a life that
matters even though he's really

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.620
just running a discount airline.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.074
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:50.573
- Anything?

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:53.706
- To tell you the truth,
I realized [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.950
And they said, we can't have you
handle anything that's really

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.329
meaningful, but we like you.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.787
So what job are we going to
give you where you don't really

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.210
have to do anything meaningful.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.960
And you can't really
screw up the company,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.670
[INAUDIBLE] chairman,
president, ceo.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:15.390
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.940
MARK THOMPSON: Hey, how are you?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.820
So it was amazing to be able
to meet people like Herb who,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.190
in a sadly unusual way--
when you meet CEOs,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.870
aren't necessarily
the most happy people.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750
And when you talk
to him, you could

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.800
see how that filters
through the organization.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.190
How many of you have ever
been on Southwest Airlines?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.940
Of course, yeah, we've
all had to do that.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.450
I was coming here on
Southwest Airlines,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
and I had the typical safety
talk that you get on Southwest.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.030
Now, these people can't
be paid all that much--

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.530
not in money, at least.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.810
But why is it that they're
just a little happier,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.880
a little bit more engaged,
maybe a little insane--

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.920
have you noticed this?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.740
We're rolling out on the
runway, and the flight attendant

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.510
was giving us the safety talk.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.380
Nobody's listening.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.070
We're all reading our devices.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.560
He starts to
pretend to be angry.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.520
He says, guys, if this
plane falls out of the sky,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.410
would you like to know
the documentation?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.326
You can hear the thud.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:10.784
People are dropping everything.

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:11.700
What's this guy up to?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.491
He says, OK, here's
what's going to happen.

00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.300
If there's a change
in cabin pressure

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.579
or there's a crisis
in the air, there's

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.245
going to be the little
yellow masks that

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:19.209
pop out of the ceiling.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.240
Now, folks, those
are oxygen masks.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.590
Now, don't start to ask, why is
my mask smaller than his mask?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.947
Why is my mask
inconveniencing the meeting

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:29.030
that I'm supposed to hold?

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.300
No, grab the mask!

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.210
Put it on yourself first, and
then put it on your child.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.106
Then if you have
more than one child,

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:37.230
you might want to stop to
consider which one really

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.399
has the most potential.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:42.690
And that's what I want to
talk about here, because this

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.340
is how, when you
talked to Herb-- when

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.780
we did that interview, he
drank, I think, a full Scotch.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.307
The bottle was empty by the
time we were talking two hours.

00:04:52.307 --> 00:04:53.640
Didn't seem to affect him a bit.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.306
He went through two
packs of cigarettes.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:58.290
He was blowing it off screen.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.090
He said, Mark, people do not
decide and choose explicitly

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.200
and intentionally to
live a life that matters.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.440
We have to take a
moment and recalibrate.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.007
We're not Nelson Mandela.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.840
There's probably many
times during your life

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.930
where you redefine
what success means

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.880
and what that definition
of success is.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.440
So let's look at
the factors that we

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.400
discovered in this research.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.190
And one of them had
to do with the fact

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.770
that in a world that's
so volatile and changing,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.350
we're all on this mission to
find a sense of belonging;

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.660
to create a life that matters.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.210
And the primary
principle that seemed

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.480
to flow through all of these
came out of a research project,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.210
as I mentioned.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.180
And the project started
with "Built to Last."

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.310
I don't know if you ever
heard of "Built to Last."

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.800
It was one of those great
books, one of those many books

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.170
that was a bestseller,
and half of it was true.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.420
And I had the opportunity
to be a part of the research

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.160
team at Stanford that was
working on this book--

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.784
part of that slave
labor that was doing

00:05:48.784 --> 00:05:50.340
all of the conjoint analysis.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.680
And Jerry Wind at
Wharton joined us,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.480
Howard Moskowitz at Harvard.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.160
Bonita Thompson
led the research.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.880
She's a behavioral psychologist
who worked with Jim Collins.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.790
And we then went on
a survey of people

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.060
who we thought had an
impact for 20 years or more.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.160
In other words, the
cohort that we went after

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.960
were not people who were one-hit
wonders or short-term success

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.590
stories.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.330
We're talking about
people who had impact

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.730
for at least two decades.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.760
These were people who had been
living a life that matters.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.280
And they might be celebrities,
they might not be.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.300
Many of them were.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.850
I did have a very
eclectic experience.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.239
It started with Nelson Mandela.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.030
I had the opportunity
to meet Maya Angelou.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.740
I did many programs with her.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.340
The Dalai Lama, met the
famous Googlers and the folks

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.260
at Microsoft from
the very early days.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.960
It just shows how-- this
is going back to 1998,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.110
when Larry bought YouTube
and was talking about that

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.730
at the forum--

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.200
into the present day.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.330
And the adventure ended up
finding these criteria--

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.650
36 criteria in 2,000
interviews that we did.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.190
And then we did a
survey in 110 nations

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.880
to try to force rank
what were these criteria

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.400
on the definition of success?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.190
And what we found was that one
of the great core competencies

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.830
of people like yourself
who've achieved

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.200
is that you start
to work at putting

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.180
your demons in a place
where you can perhaps

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.130
harvest the energy from them.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.520
It's a bit about mastering
fear and ambition.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.210
Let me share with you a little
bit what I mean about that.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.640
What we found was
that people who

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.740
have been able to find
a connection with a life

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.520
that matters tend to
be great at failure.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.380
Winners lose often, and they
lose more often than losers,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.360
because losers are
usually trying to avoid

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.030
the risk of making mistakes.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.440
Winners-- people who have
impact year in and year out--

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.620
are usually experts at
learning, at iteration,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.534
at being able to profit from
failure and from change.

00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:51.200
And I don't know about
you guys, I often

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.120
feel this way in all of my work.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.540
I always have way too much
more to do than I possibly can,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.870
and short cuts never
apply when we do this.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.332
So here's the first
principle at work.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:04.790
We found that anyone
who had really

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.070
swung for the fences
in high achievement

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.620
had also failed
big time, and they

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.226
were experts at trying to
harvest their failures.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.600
Let me give you
just one exercise

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.470
that we can all apply in how
we rethink any sort of disaster

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.470
that we've ever been in.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.100
So Richard Branson, who was
one of the early sponsors

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.970
of this book, had
a tragedy occur

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.610
where he had been collecting
30 years of his notes

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.770
in the family home
on Necker Island,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.200
and it burned down four
years ago, quite famously.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.510
A bolt of lightning
came through the roof.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.450
He'd been sleeping on
the beach, and the house

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.950
was filled with people.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.690
And his 90-year-old
mom, Eve, was

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.940
able to escort, actually,
everybody out of the house

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.130
when this big
explosion occurred.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.130
And she's still bragging
about it to this day--

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.100
Eve is.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.370
And he said, I learned something
really profound that day.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.250
Obviously, I was really worried
about people being hurt.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.780
But then I realized how
helpless I was in that disaster.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.820
I was down on the beach.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.040
He was starting to
run to do the rescue,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.560
and he realized he
wasn't fully clothed.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.340
He was barefoot.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.724
He ran straight into a cactus.

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.390
It wasn't a pleasant
experience for him.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.720
And he realized something that
informed 30 years of his work

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.060
that had gone up in smoke,
and that is that if you did

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.850
want to restart a life or
a career or a business,

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.360
do you think you would do it
in exactly the same blueprint

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.194
that you had leading up
to that point of disaster?

00:09:26.194 --> 00:09:27.860
In other words, one
of the greatest ways

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.920
to think about looking
forward in your life

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.550
is to restart the old life.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.020
In other words, would you
have the same blueprint

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.550
for that house that you rebuild?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.610
Would you have that same
work plan for your career,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.270
or would you do
things differently?

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.100
Would you think about every
aspect or process of your work

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.580
or career in the same way?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.220
I don't think so.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.750
One of the best ways we can
think about our goal setting

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.960
every year is to say, what
if I were to start over?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.410
What would I do differently?

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.840
How can I avoid just paving
the cowpath, as they say?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.930
Would it be the same team?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.180
Where is really, truly the value
creation in our life and work?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.030
Think about that restart when
you're doing your goal setting,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.580
rather than just thinking
about incrementing yourself

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.960
into the next thing you work on.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.500
Now, I'm going to give you
some more tools to unpack this,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.250
but I wanted to start
there, because a lot

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.040
of the work that we do and
a lot of the effort that we

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.550
put into the work that we do
ends up being through inertia.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.290
And I hate this quote with
Edison talking about failure--

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.670
10,000 ways that it didn't work.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.440
But the truth of the matter
is that when we make effort

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.350
and we are feeling like
we're having a setback

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.380
or we're humiliated from that
effort, the truth of the matter

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.800
is that people who are
continuing to have impact

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.110
continue to do that and
learn from that experience,

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.060
rather than allow
themselves to be weighed

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.610
under the pressures of it.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.650
That whenever he
gets criticized,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.320
he thinks about the
experience he has, like this--

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.610
Virgin, we have more experience
than our name would suggest.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.900
That it's about iteration.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.240
It's about the capacity to
be able to fail and move on.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.050
The second principle that
we learn from this group

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.610
of high achievers--

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.420
like yourself-- was that--
is there anyone in this room

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.919
who has ever wanted
to do something

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.460
important in their
life or work where

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.310
others didn't approve of them?

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.240
Of course, we've all had or
continue to have-- constantly--

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.580
what we call the silent scream.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.700
What is it in your life
or work that others

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.190
who love you, who
want to protect you

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.760
are trying to suppress, or would
hope that you'd make something

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.430
of yourself so that you'd
take another path in your life

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.450
and work?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.030
This ends up being a very
common pattern for all of us,

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.540
and usually we tolerate it.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.470
In fact, we end up fueling it,
because we do the second piece

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.670
of the silent scream.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.300
The first piece ends up being--

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.219
we're allowing others to,
perhaps, deny that part

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:50.510
of our life that we care about.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.150
And then secondly, we will
often hide that passion as well.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.864
It's our secret.

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:57.780
It's what we don't want
other people to trash,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.370
because it's
something that we love

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.680
and something that we treasure.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.250
And then the irony of all
this is that, quite frankly,

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.770
people who love
you can see right

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.350
through the silent
scream, right?

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.480
The truth of the
matter is it loses out

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.220
around all the edges--

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.430
that when we do coaching with
high achievers like yourself,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.060
we find all the time that there
is that silent scream that's

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.540
worth being aware of.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.560
It's worth trying to
build a plan of safety

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.060
around that silent scream.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.500
We're going to
talk more about how

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.520
to develop a safe way to
pursue your silent scream,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.710
but here's a glimpse
at how we found

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.140
this cohort around the world,
in 110 nations, started

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.710
to deal with this.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.220
We didn't find any person
who was doing something

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.670
extraordinarily well who didn't
have a portfolio of passions.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.790
There isn't just one thing
to do with our lives.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.530
Usually there was
a domain expertise

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.380
that was driven by an
obsession, but there was always

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.420
a portfolio of passions.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.720
Other parts of that silent
scream that you tap--

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.900
that feeds you, that restore
you, that allow you to recover,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.330
that allow you to become
resilient, that allow you to,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.670
in a sense, create a more rich
and full life that matters.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.160
There's an obsession,
I think, now,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.340
with expertise and being
very precise about just

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.435
what one area that we focus on.

00:13:13.435 --> 00:13:15.060
And what we found is
that people who've

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.540
had enduring lives of
creativity and contribution

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.130
have a silent scream
that contributes

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.430
to a portfolio of
passions, and it's

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.860
about putting a
spotlight on what

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.580
those are for you in your life.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.500
The third area that
I found a bit ironic

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.990
is that people who
are high-achieving

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.220
have a paradoxical combination
of both hubris and humility.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.140
Now, there was hubris,
you have to have--

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.700
people like my
friend Gail Devers.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.650
She went to four Olympics.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.650
Now, this woman, on the fourth
Olympic, got a gold medal,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.450
and she lamented
the fact that she

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.200
hadn't broken the world record.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.440
Seriously, Gail?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.180
I mean, four Olympics?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.070
And what we found was
that on the one hand,

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.970
she has this enormous
hubris to believe

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.670
that she can do so well at
something and the humility

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.969
to realize that I always
want to get better,

00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.510
and that nothing
that I achieve can't

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.740
be done without and through
the efforts of others--

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.970
that it's a combination
of hubris and humility

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.300
that drives people
to have high impact.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.109
We talked to Sally Field
early on in the interviews

00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:17.900
that we were doing.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.275
She's one of the
few women who've

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.280
worked for 40 years on stage
and screen, Emmy and Academy

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.480
Award-winning actress.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.340
Started out in
meaningless roles,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.134
ended up doing very meaningful,
high-contribution work.

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.800
Listen to how she
describes her journey.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.466
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:33.110
- The only thing
you have power over

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.460
is to get good at what you do.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.877
That's all there is.

00:14:35.877 --> 00:14:36.710
That's all there is.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.860
There ain't no more.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.870
And the only time--

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.910
the only way you
become a leader--

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.450
or any such highfalutin
terminology--

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.270
a role model, a
leader, give back-- is

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.827
to have something to give back.

00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:50.660
The only way you have
something to give back

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.460
is go do something.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.650
Get off your rear end
and go do something.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:00.500
And that doesn't mean I'm
going to go build housing

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.730
for the underprivileged.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.397
That's good too, but
go become a doctor,

00:15:04.397 --> 00:15:05.480
a lawyer, an Indian chief.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.670
Go work your tail off
and achieve something

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.840
for yourself-- some
specific thing.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.670
But be excellent
at what that is.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.810
That's the only way that
you can be a leader.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.990
Who wakes up one day and says,
hm, shall I go to school,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.800
or shall I be a leader?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.340
Let's see, what
shall I do today?

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.870
I think I'm going
to go out and lead.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.140
- Nobody thinks that way.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.080
- It's a non-thing.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.340
It's a non-thing.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.410
That happens by accident after
you've pursued and struggled

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.272
and kicked yourself around
the block 400 gazillion times,

00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:43.730
and one day you look at it and
you say, OK, I've done that.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.355
I've done that.

00:15:44.355 --> 00:15:48.080
And people are turning to
you and saying, lead us.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.580
Huh?

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:52.030
MARK THOMPSON: On more
than one occasion,

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.430
I was delighted to
have been really put

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.410
in my place when I
asked questions like, so

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.240
how did you find that
leadership journey

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.290
as a woman on Hollywood?

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.330
And she said, are you nuts?

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.510
That's not how we go about
a journey that matters.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.910
It's not about you.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.990
It's about each of
us, individually,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.920
finding that silent scream,
and reaching in and having

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.730
the humility and the hubris
to make choices about moving

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.420
towards that mission.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.800
And if it's ever not a
struggle, then good for you.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.950
But what the people who are
feeling their silent scream

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.460
feeding them ends up being
a very powerful combination

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.410
of hubris and humility.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.940
I met Steve Jobs in high school.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.730
I was a freshman.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.040
He was a senior.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.470
There was a summer at
Homestead High school

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.060
where we met each
other in a place--

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.643
well, I shouldn't
even tell you, but I

00:16:38.643 --> 00:16:41.680
was in the principal's
office with him.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.110
And I won't tell you why
we were there so long

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.930
or had such an
opportunity to bond,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.450
but I will tell you that
it was interesting to hear

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.220
him talk about his dreams.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.730
And at that time where I
was in my life, all that was

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.270
was frightening to me--

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.154
to hear his hubris and his sense
of ambition and creativity.

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:00.820
There's no way I was
going to chase him.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.490
This is not a story of me
spending time in that garage

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.810
and becoming a billionaire.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.630
There was no way
I could possibly

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.359
surrender, at that point, to
the seduction of what he already

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:14.060
had, which was clarity
about that silent scream.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.560
Later, I would
have the privilege

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.589
of meeting him as
Steve 2.0, because

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.260
at that point in my career--

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.810
by 1999, I was chairman
of a company that

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.550
invented this little thing.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.550
Anyone know what that is?

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.470
Yeah, Mp3 player.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.137
Right, exactly.

00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:32.720
I'm very proud of the fact that
while other technology has all

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.020
turned over in
the last 25 years,

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.400
nobody would think that it
would still be on your device,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.483
but it's on pretty much
everybody's device today--

00:17:39.483 --> 00:17:41.290
still, the Mp3
player, the audio.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.497
I was chairman of that
little startup company,

00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:45.080
and I was giving a
speech at Stanford,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.110
and Steve Jobs was going
through his resurrection,

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.440
and he came up to the front.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.930
He said, Mark, you're an idiot.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.180
This is a geeky piece
of crap, and we're going

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.530
to crush it in about two years.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.740
You want to come work for me?

00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.590
What a recruiting.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.970
This was Steve 2.0.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.721
Don't let that attitude
ever be an excuse.

00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:06.803
I don't know how many
leaders tell me, well, Steve

00:18:06.803 --> 00:18:07.650
behaved that way.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.780
I said, well,
there's an outlier.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.852
Once we disrupt four
different industries,

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:13.560
then maybe we have
the privilege of being

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.030
that kind of personality.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.980
But even he had started
to recognize that it

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.720
wasn't about him anymore.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.420
He was going to have
to recruit A-players

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.640
from so many different
fields that it was always

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.830
about staying hungry and
staying foolish enough.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.437
That this time he wasn't going
to lose his company again.

00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:30.270
But it's interesting
to see-- and I say this

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.853
with the greatest
of love and respect,

00:18:31.853 --> 00:18:33.810
because I had an
opportunity to work with him

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.210
over a three-year period.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.780
He'd come a long
way as a leader,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.910
but when you think about--

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.294
what was it, just
last week Apple

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.210
became the most valuable
company in the world?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.959
Broke a trillion dollars.

00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.500
They had already been the most
valuable company in the world,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.140
but it wasn't until
2011 and his passing

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.120
that the company went
on to become the most

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.680
valuable in the world.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.580
And it was interesting how
his transformation certainly

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.500
contributed to the
inertia in that company,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.630
but he didn't turn all of
his wounds into wisdom.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.860
This guy did.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.820
Chuck Schwab-- being
fiercely independent,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.670
having this hubris,
but then also being

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.730
set back by dyslexia.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.322
When I met him, he talked
about how there was no way

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.280
that he could have built
a company if it hadn't

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.524
been by finding people who had
the strengths that he lacked.

00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:22.440
And it turns out, at
Stanford Business School,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.320
he ended up being one of the
people who most quickly scaled

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.910
a business out of
business school,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.340
because he never thought he was
the smartest guy in the room.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.510
He always chose to recruit a
team around him that could do

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.880
the things that he couldn't.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.290
He put his life's work--

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.720
his silent scream--
turned it into passions,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.630
and then instantly recruited
a team to that dream.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.120
Who else could contribute
to that dream and those sets

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.520
of passions in ways
that they owned,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.190
in ways that they could
make a unique contribution

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.829
of their own independent impact?

00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:54.370
Listen to how Chuck
talks about this.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.020
This is another
piece of archival.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.120
- How'd do you go
about coping when you--

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.670
you went on to college
and started your career?

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.740
How did you get through college?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.690
- I got through college
by a lot of luck,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.110
and sometimes, I
think, even mirrors,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.650
because I flunked English A
a couple times at Stanford,

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.670
and it was a very debilitating,
depressing thing for me

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.070
to do that, because I always
thought I was pretty bright,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.850
and I didn't realize
how incompetent I

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.780
was in the skill of writing.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.080
In some respects, the positive
side of this learning issue

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.240
thing was probably
my early recognition

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:40.897
that I wasn't strong in every
component of reading, writing,

00:20:40.897 --> 00:20:41.980
all those kinds of things.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.680
That I needed to have other
people who could help me out

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.130
in different parts of the
business that I was developing.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.590
A lot of people
who are brilliant

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.810
will say-- who are
brilliant entrepreneurs--

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.760
think they can do everything.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.190
And they don't develop
the team that they

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.442
need to have in order to
accomplish the various levels

00:20:59.442 --> 00:21:01.150
that you're going to
reach in your growth

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.430
curve as a successful company.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.670
And so at every level
that Schwab has moved to,

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.070
I've been able to,
I think, recognize

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.530
my strengths and my deficits
and build up around me

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.690
with great people
in the deficit area.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.970
And I think that probably
has been the single most

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.060
important benefit
that I received

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.380
from having this learning
issue early on in my life.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.540
So it's a little perverse
in some respects,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.927
but at least that's the
way I rationalize it.

[END PLAYBACK]

MARK THOMPSON: One of the
best bosses I ever had.

00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:38.510
Spent 12 years
working at his side.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.720
Really informed
the way I decide.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.870
Now, whenever I think about
what I want to do next,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.280
I always think about who.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.930
Don't just think
what, think who.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.550
Think about the
community of people

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.470
who might share
that value, might

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.840
be able to contribute
to it in ways

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.370
that would be
profound for them as

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.070
well in their own
unique characteristics.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.690
This works as well
in organizations

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.880
as it does with your
individual passions.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.380
Always recruit a team to
that dream that you have.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.700
And he did this in
such a beautiful way.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.850
And with dyslexia, now,
he's one of the leaders

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.670
who was really changing the
way we think about learning.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.250
He's got a wonderful foundation
called All Kinds of Minds,

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.220
finding geniuses everywhere
with every type of learning

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.610
that's out there.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.532
I suffered a disability
early in my life--

00:22:24.532 --> 00:22:25.990
an eyesight
disability-- which made

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.700
it profoundly difficult
for me to read

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.930
even up until middle school.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.930
So whenever I'm introduced as
a "New York Times" bestselling

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.350
author, I always go, you
talking about me, David?

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.240
Because that was
always my struggle.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.390
I could tell stories well,
but that eyesight issue

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.060
made it difficult with motor
skills and certain cognitive

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.419
processes until I got
through adolescence.

00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:47.710
And it was one of the things
that called me to the work

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.810
that I do today in terms
of executive coaching,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.060
because I always
felt that everyone

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.710
had their own form of genius.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.320
That maybe they're A and
B-players, but truthfully,

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.090
it's more about A-alignment--

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.460
finding the things that we
are profoundly gifted at,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.510
and be able to contribute that
with other people around us.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.695
Turn your wounds into wisdom.

00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:08.320
Principle number
five-- it's important,

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.110
and I'd love for you to ask
yourself this question, if you

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.660
could, today.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.960
The people who have lives filled
with happiness and joy, people

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.890
who had lives that are
filled with meaning

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.170
take a moment each
day or each week

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.990
and shine a spotlight on who
and what in their life and work

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.106
is working.

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:28.480
And one of the
takeaways I'd love

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.060
for you to do when
you leave here today

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.220
is to think of
somebody to thank.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.300
I've got Karen May here--

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.940
People Development
at Google-- who's

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.530
encouraged me to do
this work and encouraged

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.350
me to go around the world with
Googlers to think about this.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.809
I have David, as
a dear friend now,

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:44.600
who's developed these
last couple of years.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.790
You'll be getting a note.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.040
I still have every note
that Chuck Schwab and Steve

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.330
Jobs ever wrote me.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.590
I'll never throw that away.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.290
Just think about the last note
that you wrote to somebody.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.190
Write one.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.360
Send that email.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.580
It doesn't take that much
effort to thank someone,

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.350
and it makes a
profound difference

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.930
cognitively and emotionally
in how it touches you.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.750
Some people call that gratitude,
but that sounds corny to me.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.660
I'm really talking about who
and what works in your life.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.700
It was really Richard
Branson, who's

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.430
continued to support this
work for my co-author,

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.870
Bonita Thompson, and my
daughter, who's a half-Googler.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.510
The work that she did at
an internship here at 18

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.344
changed her life.

00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:22.760
I want to thank
you guys at Google

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.250
for having such a profound
impact on my daughter,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.990
because she's now a STEM major.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.090
She went from being a
political science major,

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.210
which she was planning
to go to school--

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.690
she's now Berkeley math, and
she's pursuing a Haas degree

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.760
next, so thank you
for the contribution

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.644
you made to her life.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.810
See how good that feels,
to be able to say something

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.570
like that?

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.730
The principle of having a
place that's safe to tinker

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.420
came up over and over
again at all 110 nations,

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.829
no matter who we
talked to as achievers.

00:24:52.829 --> 00:24:54.620
There was always a safe
place for a garage.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.300
And I call this a
garage, because if you

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.674
think about Silicon
Valley, we're

00:24:57.674 --> 00:24:59.570
filled with garages
which don't have cars.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.653
I don't know about you,
but when I was growing up,

00:25:01.653 --> 00:25:05.510
I never visited a garage
that had a car in it.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.120
What would you put a car--
unless you're inventing a car,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.620
why would you put
a car in a garage?

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.440
This was a safe place to
tinker and create a new dream

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.817
or build something, or
do that craft project.

00:25:14.817 --> 00:25:16.400
And you know, if it
wasn't good enough

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.235
to show the world, (WHISPERING)
nobody needed to know.

00:25:19.235 --> 00:25:21.110
If it wasn't good enough
to leave the garage,

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.760
it didn't leave the garage.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.740
And so what's interesting,
in organizations

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.770
and in the businesses that I've
helped build and in the lives

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.346
that I've helped support--

00:25:29.346 --> 00:25:30.470
you need a place to tinker.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.529
Where's your garage?

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:32.070
It's amazing.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.611
Just across the Bay,
at Pixar, I work

00:25:33.611 --> 00:25:34.910
with Jim Morris over there.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.010
It's amazing to see how
they have safe places

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.839
to tinker on massively expensive
creative projects like films.

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:43.130
At Pixar-- as you know, if
you read Ed Catmull's book--

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.600
I think one of the very best
leadership books around--

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.558
and thinking about creating
a life that matters

00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:49.550
is to read "Creativity, Inc."

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.040
Because he talks about that
place where you brainstorm,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.220
and it's completely safe.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.650
This is a brainstorming room.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.700
And you never criticize
anybody's ideas

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.200
in that brainstorming room.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.680
You plus it up.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.754
You add to it.

00:26:01.754 --> 00:26:03.920
If you're going to be
critical, you're out of there.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.380
You've got to be able to build
on, on pile in a new way.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.250
So where is your community, or
your mastermind for the dream

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.417
that you want to follow?

00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:14.000
Is there a safe place to do that
and have people come and pile

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.140
on ideas?

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.516
And then, at least
at Pixar, they

00:26:16.516 --> 00:26:18.015
realize they have
to run a business,

00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:20.060
so then they take it
to another room to say,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.010
OK, now we're going to
deconstruct the crime,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.860
here, set priorities, which
are-- that's miserable.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.490
I hate setting priorities!

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.630
No entrepreneur wants to decide
which goes and which stays

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.509
and what's done now
and what's done next.

00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:33.050
And then they have
a third room where

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.310
they operationalize things.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.460
That's the business school that
has to be practiced in order

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.760
to run a business.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.460
So try to think about
a sense of place.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.660
As humans, the
environment does win.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.300
We do this at Google in terms
of having creative spaces.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.940
But remember, if you could
have a place that you designate

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.910
that's safe to create, safe to
incubate, and safe to deliver,

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:55.910
that's really important.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.640
We found it coming up
over and over again.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.850
Another principle that
we found in this cohort

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.490
of high achievers
was that they--

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.340
like we talked earlier
about the silent scream--

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.060
anyone here have a secret
fear that they've run across?

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.830
We all have different
phobias and fears

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.900
that we've had to face.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.630
Can I give you a
stupid one for me?

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.240
And it's pretty safe
to tell this crowd

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.202
about just having a fear of
heights and roller coasters.

00:27:24.202 --> 00:27:26.660
I still, even to this day,
never been on a roller coaster--

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.439
not of any
consequence, at least.

00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:30.980
And this was hard when I became
a daddy, because I would walk

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.750
my daughter to the
Matterhorn at Disney,

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.250
and I'd hear the
screams of delight,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.907
and I heard her
screams of delight.

00:27:35.907 --> 00:27:37.490
She looked like this
little one, here.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.160
And we'd walk closer
and closer, I'd

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.810
be melting down and feeling
my hands getting sweaty,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.730
and by the time we got just
up to deliver her and put her

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.460
on the ride, I'd say,
daddy's got to take a call.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.760
Mommy's going to ride with you.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.550
And that's what
we'd do every time.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:56.382
She saw through
that very quickly.

00:27:56.382 --> 00:27:58.340
Well, one of the things
that I'm embarrassed to

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.730
say that I didn't really
discover until this year--

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.410
an understanding in
this data that I've

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.950
been collecting for 20 years,
and it was around this idea

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.280
that often, people who are high
achievers-- they may or may not

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.970
face a fear down, but they
almost never think about it

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.000
as being a potential source of
joy if we could prepare for it.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
What if there was some
way that we could somehow

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.820
prepare for this difficulty
in our life in a way

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.890
that there just might be
some shred of joy that

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.800
comes from it, that might
be an unlock for me?

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.080
And there ended up being one
for me in this particular case.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.737
I decided that yes, OK, I was
going to be ambitious here.

00:28:34.737 --> 00:28:35.820
I was going to toughen up.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.220
I was going to face my fear.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.570
I was going to take a
group of my clients.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.590
It was the founder Pinterest,
the CEO of HP and the staff.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.200
We rented a zero G
plane, and we went up

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.840
in the so-called vomit comet.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.510
And what they do is
they rent 10 miles

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.970
by 100 miles of
the stratosphere,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.790
and they do 15 parabolas.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.700
And down you're doing
3Gs, and up you're doing--

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.430
well, zero G.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.990
And it was some
macho thing in me

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.970
that said, oh, I
just have to do this.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.591
Forget the roller
coasters or the skydiving.

00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:09.840
I'm going to prepare for this.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.256
Now, I'm 20 years older than
everybody who's on the plane,

00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:13.980
so I trained
rigorously for this.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.590
I started studying, why is
it that you get nauseous?

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.170
Mark, why do you get vertigo?

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.670
It's interesting, I'd
never leaned into my fear.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.690
I'd never studied, what
do we know about people

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.140
who have fear of heights?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.430
Why do I have this fear?

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.420
How could I address this fear?

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.450
I guess I could go to
therapy, but then that

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.470
would be just a cycle.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.010
I wasn't really coaching myself.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.950
I wasn't a very good student.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.830
So I deconstructed this fear.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.600
Now, I'm not saying
I conquered it.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.984
I don't that's true.

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:42.900
I think what you do is
you actually manage it.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.240
But I never thought
that I might harvest it.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.940
So I ended up going
up in the vomit comet,

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.900
and I was thinking
this all along.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.790
I was thinking about
the roller coaster ride.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.220
I'm not going to be like
Ryan was in that movie.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.860
But I was going to try to
find a way to go into zero G.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.100

MARK THOMPSON:
Well, that was fun.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.430
I would do that every
day of the week.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.530
Something that apps--
that was doing something--

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.477
I can't imagine anything
more frightening than to deal

00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:22.060
with looking out
into the stratosphere

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.730
and looking from dark to
light and plunging like that.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.920
I stayed on the course.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.430
I stayed very disciplined
about what they asked me to do,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.870
but I never expected
to enjoy it.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.460
What fears do we have in our
life that are holding us back

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.490
that there might be just
the shred of an unlock

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.174
that we are worthy of leaning
into and learning more about?

00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:45.840
That's something I
never thought I would

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.190
explore for myself before.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.720
And I would see it.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.720
I observed it, and I've
been hearing people tell me

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.480
this for 20 years and
never internalized it

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.787
until this year-- or found
a way to exercise it.

00:30:57.787 --> 00:30:58.870
You learn throughout life.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.910
I'm hitting my
60th birthday here

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.230
and finding a new joy that I
missed for that last 60 years.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.670
Now I'm feeling greedy.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.750
What else have I missed
about what makes life special

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.730
and what makes life
so rich and creative?

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.130
And this is what is unique
about this cohort of people

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.250
that I found who
continue to re-evaluate

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.860
how to create a life that
matters and look at success.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.560
So let's deconstruct that
one level further, here,

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.880
in the final piece.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.140
I want to ask you folks--

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.870
if a loved one came to you not
knowing anything about what

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.260
you do for a living,
but they're loved ones.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.150
Could be a child or a parent--

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.690
and asked you, what's your
definition of success?

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.040
What would you tell them--
just at the highest level?

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.770
What would be your
definition of success?

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.440
Anyone here, there's
no right answer.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.840
Anyway, David, what would be
your definition of success?

00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:55.060
DAVID: That the people I
love love me and are better

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.660
human beings because of it.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.910
MARK THOMPSON: Is that a
lovely definition of success?

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:59.795
Give him a round of applause.

00:31:59.795 --> 00:32:00.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.150
That's beautiful.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.859
That's beautiful-- that the
community that I care about

00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:07.400
is better off because
we're together,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.030
and that you've contributed
to that community.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:09.470
Anyone else?

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.303
What would be another
definition of success?

00:32:11.303 --> 00:32:12.125
Yes.

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:14.600
AUDIENCE: A combination
of strong connections

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.165
with people in my life and
fulfillment in my career--

00:32:18.165 --> 00:32:19.290
MARK THOMPSON: Fulfillment.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.650
AUDIENCE: --and hobbies.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.330
MARK THOMPSON: And being able
to do some of those passions

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.538
that, maybe, we talked about.

00:32:23.538 --> 00:32:24.892
Maybe a fewer silent screams?

00:32:24.892 --> 00:32:26.100
Give him a round of applause.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.045
That's a great definition--

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:27.544
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:27.544 --> 00:32:30.400
--that you could find, another
part of your life that you--

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.202
yes.

00:32:31.202 --> 00:32:32.350
AUDIENCE: Happiness.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.391
MARK THOMPSON: Happiness!

00:32:33.391 --> 00:32:35.002
What a concept to
come with success?

00:32:35.002 --> 00:32:37.210
And there would be dividends
of both of these others.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.960
That's a great definition.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.920
Give her a round of applause.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.420
Success.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:41.686 --> 00:32:43.060
Any other definitions
of success?

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.810
Anything else that
comes to mind?

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.270
She was doing her hair back
there, so you won the bid.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.684
What would be your definition?

00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:55.308
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
not my definition,

00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:58.787
but a definition associated
with the probability

00:32:58.787 --> 00:33:01.780
of wealth, fame, prestige.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.100
MARK THOMPSON: Yes, exactly.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.180
So this is an interesting
point that we'll make.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.860
So if you looked up the
definition of success

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.240
in the dictionary,
which actually

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.160
didn't occur to me
to do 20 years ago

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.530
when we started the research.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.470
But our Wharton team
said, we're going

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.420
to publish this book
with Prentice Hall.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.940
We got to do the research.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.870
Look in the dictionary!

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.090
That was the definition
in the dictionary.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.780
But that's it.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.460
The definition that
we heard from people

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.800
who had high impact
in their lives

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.010
and had developed lives
that truly mattered for them

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.600
and others didn't have
wealth, fame, or goals

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.080
actually on the list.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.190
So what we teach our kids
or feel conflicted about--

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.730
one of the reasons the silent
scream is so profound--

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.230
is because we have
a double standard

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.760
on how we define success--

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.120
in every language, by the way.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.780
If you can find another one,
I'll send you a nice bonus.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.969
If you can find a way that
the definition of success

00:33:55.969 --> 00:33:57.010
is defined anywhere else.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.900
It's a punishing, evil
definition of success,

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.140
frankly, because it's
not how successful people

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.780
who've had lives that
matter long periods of time

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.920
define success.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.420
In fact, the
definition of success--

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.880
I shouldn't be surprised,
and I hear this at Google,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.770
wherever I go in the
world, and I've now

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.659
asked people live
and in meetings

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.560
like this, 15,000 people.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.010
They define success the same
way that you did in this room.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.230
And it ends up being
characterized this way.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.469
And the thing I want
to say about this

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.920
is also for you to
notice you should never

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.196
assume that you know somebody's
definition of success.

00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:33.570
There's more than
one definition.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.403
I'm not sure that your
definition of success

00:34:35.403 --> 00:34:38.179
might have been the same
even five years ago.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.050
But check in to find out what a
person's definition of success

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.550
is.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.929
You might be profoundly
touched by how they frame it.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.429
Knowing that about
David, or knowing

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:50.844
that about how you sense this
connection with your passions

00:34:50.844 --> 00:34:52.469
makes a difference
in your relationship

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.469
with that person-- how
they define that success.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.310
There's not just
one way to do it.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.632
What we found was that
there's three categories

00:34:59.632 --> 00:35:00.840
of the definition of success.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.030
All three of these were
present in everyone

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.280
who had had impact
for 20 years or more.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.930
They had a sense of purpose
or a cause-- something

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.239
that they were associated
with that was greater

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:12.030
than themselves, but
that they believed in;

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.660
that they cared about.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.440
They had a sense of
passions and connection.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.300
They had a sense
of who they wanted

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.830
to be with through
their purpose,

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.290
but also through their hobbies
and through their passions

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.560
and through the work
that they wanted to do.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.030
And then they also had a
way of actually wanting

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.410
to deliver on the goods.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.727
I mean, it's one thing
to be purpose-driven,

00:35:31.727 --> 00:35:33.310
but it's hard to
really earn the right

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.685
to do that unless
you can deliver

00:35:34.685 --> 00:35:36.360
on some of your promises.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.650
But this was what we'd
call the genius of the end,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.420
rather than the
tyranny of the OR--

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.384
that when you're
feeling out of balance,

00:35:42.384 --> 00:35:44.800
it's not just because you can't
do enough of the one thing

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.642
that you love.

00:35:45.642 --> 00:35:47.350
It's because we're
often not doing things

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.840
that we can see connected
to something bigger than us

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.570
or a community bigger
than us and that

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.250
also feeds our passions.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.020
The passions are about
things that we do on our own.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.150
They're not about winning.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.983
They're about doing
something we believe in,

00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:02.070
that we want to refine.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.050
It's something that we
want to be a part of.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.060
Performance has to
do with our ability

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.770
to deliver on those things.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.180
And what I'd love
to do right now

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.020
is just serve you a set of
definitions around passion

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.792
so you can mine this
a little deeper.

00:36:15.792 --> 00:36:17.500
So what we found is
that there are really

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.772
six dimensions of passion.

00:36:18.772 --> 00:36:20.980
And the reason I have Maya
Angelou and Warren Buffett

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.440
up here is because when I
went to visit Maya Angelou,

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.100
she talked about how most of
us don't live our lives feeling

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:27.930
all three of these.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.245
That it's easy to maybe focus
on one but not the other two.

00:36:31.245 --> 00:36:32.870
That when we're
feeling out of balance,

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.180
it's because we haven't
decided wait, OK,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.540
so how is this connected
to something bigger than me

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.350
or longer-term?

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.660
Some people might even
call this a legacy.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.660
And this could be a community.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.800
It doesn't have to--
it could be a company.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.570
It could be a customer--
just something

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.486
bigger than ourselves.

00:36:47.486 --> 00:36:49.090
Passions are for you.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.711
Performance is how we deliver
and express all of those.

00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:53.960
So let's go through purpose,
passion, and performance.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.460
But one thing about
Warren Buffett--

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.590
Warren Buffett won't accept a
job inquiry from an individual

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.425
unless they qualify
for all three of these.

00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:02.800
He says a lot of
people will have

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.470
a sense of how they've served
a business or a purpose

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:06.580
in the past.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.250
They'll express, maybe,
how they've delivered

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.850
in terms of performance.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.820
But when it comes to
passion, most people

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.730
put that off and don't integrate
that in with their work.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:18.850
That passion is not
something you should put off

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.120
to another time, It needs to be
a part of your everyday work.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.740
He said to put off your passions
is a little bit like saving up

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.690
sex for old age.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.210
It's a really bad idea.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.152
We should be living
full-out, right now.

00:37:33.152 --> 00:37:34.360
I said, good for you, Warren.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.820
I want to be that way
when I'm 80, right?

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.630
The Oracle of Omaha says that
we should be living full-out,

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.620
and so does the poet, as
she expresses her life.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.650
So let's look
quickly at passion.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.840
Passion, we found--
this portfolio

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.820
of passions we
talked about-- you

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.010
can look at this set of
passions in the sense

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.550
that one of the ways to evaluate
whether you're doing something

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.180
you're passionate about is that
you will lose sense of time.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.940
[INAUDIBLE],, the
social scientist,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.937
would call experts
of their field,

00:38:05.937 --> 00:38:07.520
whether they were
artists or chemists,

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.811
and say, how long have you
been working on the project?

00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:10.840
Don't look at a watch.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.660
They could never say.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.700
Your unconscious
competence-- you'll

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.374
lose that when
you're in the flow.

00:38:16.374 --> 00:38:17.290
Ever been in the flow?

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.550
You're doing
something else, and it

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.617
starts to contribute to
answering the question.

00:38:20.617 --> 00:38:22.200
As soon as you let
go of the problem--

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.400
you're running,
you're reading, you're

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.320
doing your favorite knitting--

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.100
then it starts to flow for you.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.980
So when you watch
the flow, that's

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.440
usually an indication
of passion.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.070
We tend to have a bias when
it comes to defining failure.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.880
That generally, when
you're doing something

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.990
you're passionate about,
it's not a failure.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.210
It's a learning.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.170
We redefine it.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.980
I used to run and play
music in high school.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.230
I don't run anymore, because
I wasn't that good at it,

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.440
so I failed at that.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.315
But I'm still playing
the horn, even though I

00:38:50.315 --> 00:38:51.322
wasn't very good at it.

00:38:51.322 --> 00:38:52.030
But I'm learning.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.080
I'm getting better and better.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.530
I'm still trying to
be creative that way.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.330
We tend to be proactive
and do the things

00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.595
we're passionate about first.

00:38:59.595 --> 00:39:00.970
We like to think
we're objective,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.581
but we have decision bias.

00:39:02.581 --> 00:39:04.330
The things that get
at the top of the list

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.674
are generally the ones that we
feel the most passionate about.

00:39:07.674 --> 00:39:08.590
I'm geeking over this.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.340
Because I'm not a
behavioral psychologist,

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.540
I really wanted to look at
how the behavioral data--

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.340
when we did a forced ranking
and we asked people in this

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.550
conjoint analysis to determine
what they really cared about--

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.680
these were the
dimensions of passion.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.590
That passion is something
you'd secretly do for free.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.780
Now, I know Google
is a business,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.750
but we're all hopefully driven
not just by the clock, right?

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.340
We're driven with
doing something--

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.170
some aspect of the day.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.530
I mean, life is short, but
some days are very long, right?

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.540
Not everything we do
is something we love,

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.940
and it's not what I'm
really proselytizing here.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.410
What I'm saying is
that there needs

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.410
to be some aspect of the work
we do that feeds us, even

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.230
without traditional
compensation.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.240
You bore people when
you're passionate.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.870
So you go to a party, and
if somebody asks me about

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.490
my daughter-- please
don't make this mistake--

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.920
I will not shut up.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.420
You'll be looking at me, saying,
I'm so happy for you, Mark.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.400
They're looking at their watch.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.780
They feel the aging process.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.090
They don't know how to get
out of the conversation.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:06.820
Mark is still geeking over it.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.060
You're not politically correct
or socially conscious--

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.520
entirely-- when you're
in a state of passion,

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.855
when you're living your passion.

00:40:13.855 --> 00:40:17.320
Now, this is an important way
to deconstruct relationships,

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.590
because it's good to know what's
flipping somebody's switch

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.080
so that you can either
feed that for them

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.330
or help align them
with that on a project

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.317
or help associate with them
if you share that passion.

00:40:28.317 --> 00:40:29.650
This is another dimension of it.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.233
You definitely bore
people when you're

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:32.530
passionate about something.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.659
And it's also something
that you would hope that,

00:40:34.659 --> 00:40:36.700
in history, that you'd
like to be remembered for.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.010
It usually is the
thing that, gosh, I'd

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.680
love to say that the passions
that I've been living

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.770
and the purpose I'm feeling
could somehow be remembered;

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:49.070
that somehow would be a part of
my legacy, that could somehow

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.510
maybe make a difference, and it
would make a life worth living.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.520
I do spend some considerable
time up at Nike,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.760
and what's the slogan at
Nike that's most famous?

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.711
AUDIENCE: Just do it.

00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:05.210
MARK THOMPSON: Wouldn't you
love to have a slogan like that?

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.751
Everybody, in any language, it
always comes back "Just do it"

00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:08.720
in English.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.010
Why is that so compelling?

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.740
Cuts through the clutter and
the bullshit of our lives

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.420
and the pressure
and the denial that

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.910
comes from other people about
what we really want to do.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.796
We just want to do it, but we
don't want to just do anything.

00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:24.897
We want to do
something that matters.

00:41:24.897 --> 00:41:27.230
I love the current positioning
that they have right now.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.960
They talk about trying to find
your inner athlete, whether you

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.340
are an athlete or not, and
to play to be remembered.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.770
I think what we'd
all love to feel

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.790
is that somehow the
impact and the creativity

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.310
and the meaning that
we found in our life

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:43.770
would mean that we had
played to be remembered.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.360
That we were writing
our own future.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.230
That would be, perhaps,
the most profound way

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.540
to think about our lives.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.567
I'd like you all to just
stand up for a moment.

00:41:53.567 --> 00:41:55.150
I asked you the
definition of success,

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.460
and I just want to make a
closing request of you all,

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.320
and then we'll do some Q&amp;A.
I asked you, a moment ago,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.990
your definition of success.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.120
And you were processing
this and hoping

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.180
I wasn't going to call
on you, and as you

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.550
were doing that, I'd
like to now invite

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.160
you to think about the fact
that the success that you've

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.770
achieved is not entirely yours.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.447
It's also because there's
a contribution from others.

00:42:23.447 --> 00:42:25.030
That there's other
people in your life

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.310
and your work that have
helped make you successful.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.900
Isn't that right?

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.310
It's not just about you.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.560
So could you try to
picture in your mind,

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.390
for a moment, someone
in your life or work

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.260
who's somehow contributing
to the success

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.370
that you've enjoyed
in your life?

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.370
Can you get that
picture in your mind?

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.680
If that person was
trying, somehow,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.770
to get through Google security
and was being arrested

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.540
at the front door,
do you think you

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.150
could make a noise so loud
to alert them all that they

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.890
should let he or she in?

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.710
Do you think you could make
a noise so loud in this room

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.190
that you could indicate how
much you love this person?

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.870
1, 2, 3, and then
on the count of 3,

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.220
you're going to give
me a noise so loud

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.470
that you're going to have
them released from security.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.190
1, 2, 3, go!

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:08.210
[SCREAM]

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.190
OK, very nice.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.970
Please sit down.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:10.810
That's great.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.770
That's great.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.580
They're letting
them through now.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.871
Could you check on that, Mitch?

00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:15.937
Yeah.

00:43:15.937 --> 00:43:17.770
I wish I had had somebody
there this morning

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.790
when I was trying to get in.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.772
The reason I did that is
because there are so few times

00:43:23.772 --> 00:43:25.230
in our life and
work that we really

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.450
show that level of
gratitude to the people that

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.770
mean the most to us.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.660
Would you promise me one thing?

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.370
That when you leave
here today, that you

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.487
could let those few
people who qualified

00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.070
for you at that
mental list of success

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.910
know that you gave
them a shout-out today,

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.770
as corny as that may be?

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.120
That'll make your day better.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.786
That'll make you feel
profoundly better,

00:43:43.786 --> 00:43:46.411
and it's what the most
creative, high-impact people do.

00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:47.160
Thank you so much.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.310
I'd love to take questions.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:48.810
Thank you.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.870
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mark.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:55.500
Thanks.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.810
So yeah, there's
the three P's, and I

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.912
feel like certain ones come
easier to me than others, and--

00:44:00.912 --> 00:44:02.120
MARK THOMPSON: Damn straight.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:02.640
So--

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.723
MARK THOMPSON: Absolutely.

00:44:03.723 --> 00:44:07.060
AUDIENCE: --getting stuff
done or performance, sure.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.772
But there's the passion
and then there's the--

00:44:10.772 --> 00:44:11.730
MARK THOMPSON: Purpose.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:12.855
AUDIENCE: Purpose, oh yeah.

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.670
So the purpose one--

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.630
I can think through it,
but it's not natural.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.700
How does it come to you?

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.180
Is it really a thought process,
or it's really centering

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.824
and comes from the heart?

00:44:26.824 --> 00:44:28.740
Have you heard of people
struggling with that?

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.281
MARK THOMPSON: Yes,
absolutely, and I

00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:33.420
think we have to reaffirm
what we believe in

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.880
and re-evaluate that, probably,
at many different points

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.460
in our life and in our career.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.670
What we found is that the
process that many people go

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.690
through is to try to get a sense
of what their purpose might be

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.380
by looking at their career
over time and seeing,

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.460
what are the proudest
moments that you have?

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.019
In your personal life, what
were the proudest moments

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:54.560
that you had?

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.210
What were the ones that give you
the most energy on reflection?

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.730
Lay it out in a timeline.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.670
And one of the ways that
you can observe that list

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.370
is to start to deconstruct,
what'd be the three or five

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.240
reasons, in terms of purpose of
that work that you were doing--

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.640
frame it that way--

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.780
that it gave you that response?

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.440
Let's start with what
gives you a sense of pride.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.620
Now, I'm grossly oversimplifying
a much deeper process

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.354
that we can talk about,
but the idea is to say,

00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:25.020
are those areas of
your life that you're

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.290
the proudest about feeding a
sense of purpose in any way?

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.847
They may also be feeding
a sense of passion

00:45:30.847 --> 00:45:32.430
and some of the
things that you'd just

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.364
like to do for your own sake,
and it helps separate it

00:45:35.364 --> 00:45:37.530
from a moment from achievement,
because usually when

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.613
you answer this question
of proud of most moments,

00:45:39.613 --> 00:45:42.060
you probably already tick
the box for performance.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.400
We're-- especially
Western society--

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.010
very much trained towards
outcomes and achievement,

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.570
and we're programmed for that.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.160
That's part of
the silent scream.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.220
If there's something
that we love

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.980
that's not achievement-oriented,
that's probably

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.240
in the silent scream category.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.000
It's one of those hard
things to resurrect

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.990
into your active portfolio
of passions that you have.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.430
AUDIENCE: It's very easy to
define success, looking back.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.461
So, I don't know,
if Larry started out

00:46:07.461 --> 00:46:09.210
with the mission of
organizing the world's

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.787
information or Zuckerberg
started out with organizing--

00:46:12.787 --> 00:46:13.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.780
MARK THOMPSON: The revisionist
history of the past, right?

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:16.405
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:16.405 --> 00:46:20.460
So looking forward, how do
you define your mission,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.680
or how do you know what
you are passionate about?

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.346
Because honestly, I
don't know what I am

00:46:24.346 --> 00:46:25.800
passionate about at this point.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.174
MARK THOMPSON: You know, it's
because of a lot of inertia

00:46:28.174 --> 00:46:30.540
that we often lose
track of what we feel

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.320
that we're most
passionate about,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.057
which is why I would love to--

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.390
I can send to you-- and you'll
also find it in the book,

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.500
or if you didn't get
a copy of the book,

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.520
we can send that to you.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.200
I'd be happy to send that free--

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.930
the criteria around
passion, because you

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.180
can explore some of those
areas that speak to you;

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.060
those areas that you
find that you are talking

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.820
about a little bit too
long with a loved one,

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.820
the category of areas where
you find yourself spending time

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.840
when you're not working.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.900
Is there something you're
naturally being gravitated to?

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.364
What are those areas
that you are not

00:47:00.364 --> 00:47:02.280
putting a spotlight on
now because they're not

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.135
achievement-oriented
or outcome-oriented?

00:47:04.135 --> 00:47:05.760
Is there anything
that you particularly

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.710
look forward to in the work
that you're doing right now?

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.610
What aspect of it do you hate?

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.530
What aspect do you
love about that?

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.480
I often go through
a process where

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.360
it's more interesting to
look at what you hate and see

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.382
why you hate it.

00:47:19.382 --> 00:47:21.090
And you think, that's
a really dumb idea.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.270
Why would we look at the things
that we consider a failure

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.440
and hate the most?

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.892
Because what's
shocking is if you

00:47:26.892 --> 00:47:28.350
share that with
three other people,

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.766
they may not agree with you
as that's the worst thing that

00:47:30.766 --> 00:47:31.740
ever happened to them.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.945
What's so shocking in the work
that I do among high achievers

00:47:34.945 --> 00:47:37.320
is that I'll just assume that
the things that people love

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.720
are this and that things
that they hate are that,

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.480
and I'm wrong every single time.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.190
A person might say,
gosh, well, what

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.480
I hate about this is that nobody
knows that I did the work,

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.580
and I'm not getting recognition.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.720
And so I don't feel
significant here

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.970
unless I have a speaking part.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:56.100
And the next person over,
who's a high achiever,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.930
will say, what I
hate most about this

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.420
is I have to get up every
time and speak about this.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.000
I can't stand being
in front of a crowd.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.600
So to deconstruct what it
is that you hate so much--

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.132
I call this ballast.

00:48:09.132 --> 00:48:11.340
If you were to look at the
high points in your life--

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.360
the proudest moments--

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.220
and the worst
moments in your life

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.080
and just spend an
extra moment looking

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.730
at why you hate the things
you hate, if you flip that

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.060
into energy, if you flip that
into why it's holding you down,

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.190
you'll get the
insight into something

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.065
that could be really
miraculous in your life.

00:48:28.065 --> 00:48:33.090
So my wife, who's my co-author
on all of this work--

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:34.930
her brother died when he was 21.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.510
He was already
taken-- he was already

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.420
bicycling over to NASA--
a savant, a genius.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.060
And you might ask three people--

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.880
obviously, the loss of
a brother when you're 18

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.920
and he's 21 particularly
would be so profoundly

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.000
impacting your life.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.090
And you'll almost find as
many reasons in this room

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:56.540
why that's a bad thing as
there are people in this room.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.590
But for her, the greatest loss
was the lack of contribution

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.150
that he would have.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:03.577
The world lost a genius.

00:49:03.577 --> 00:49:05.660
That's probably not the
first thing the next three

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.100
people would say.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.900
So what did that do to inform
what she cherishes and believes

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.644
in?

00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:12.810
I'm going to spend my life--

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.840
I realized that's
what I care about.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.000
I'm projecting it on all
the other important people

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.960
in my life.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.540
So she spends her
life trying to create

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.860
a life that matters for others.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.400
For me, I was held back because
of a developmental disability.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.802
I never, now, assume a person's
intelligence or capacity

00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:31.010
until we actually work
together to try to unlock what

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.280
that is, because everybody
has a certain form of genius.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.530
And the most key
part of innovation

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.175
is to try to unlock
that particular genius.

00:49:39.175 --> 00:49:40.550
I have endless
patience for that,

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.630
because if I didn't, I
wouldn't believe in myself.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.861
It's a personal projection
of that passion.

00:49:46.861 --> 00:49:47.360
Yeah?

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:52.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you for this
very inspirational talk.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.230
So the common
definition of success

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.510
is money, fortune, fame,
power, and all that,

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.270
and I can tell
from your talk you

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.845
and your friends probably
enjoyed a lot of that.

00:50:01.845 --> 00:50:02.470
But meanwhile--

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:03.570
MARK THOMPSON: No,
we're all losers.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.069
We're just--

00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.175
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but Meanwhile, do

00:50:06.175 --> 00:50:08.600
you agree that a majority of
people just don't have those?

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.050
Majority of people are
just common people?

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.841
MARK THOMPSON: Yes.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.790
AUDIENCE: My son also
goes to Homestead High,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.280
and I try to inspire him.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.930
Hey, look at Steve Jobs.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.830
He was so great, [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.790
He said, dad, he was
just an exception.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:22.029
I'm a normal kid.

00:50:22.029 --> 00:50:22.820
MARK THOMPSON: Yes.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.020
AUDIENCE: And that makes sense.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.524
So--

00:50:25.524 --> 00:50:27.190
MARK THOMPSON: It's
a fair point, right?

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.815
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:27.815 --> 00:50:30.130
Do you think that,
for common people,

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:33.840
it's also important to find
that satisfaction and content

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.339
from just doing normal things?

00:50:36.339 --> 00:50:37.130
MARK THOMPSON: Yes!

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.137
AUDIENCE: Just be
content with what we got?

00:50:39.137 --> 00:50:40.220
MARK THOMPSON: Absolutely.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.990
AUDIENCE: Just for a
paying job at Google--

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.975
MARK THOMPSON: If
that's what you value.

00:50:42.975 --> 00:50:43.565
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:43.565 --> 00:50:44.790
Yeah.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.790
Yeah, you're definitely
a very normal,

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.900
under-privileged Googler.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.320
Because that sets the
bar a certain place

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.892
that is maybe, a
little, also privileged.

00:50:57.892 --> 00:50:59.600
The point of all this
really is that it's

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.634
for each and every one of us to
find our purpose, our passion,

00:51:02.634 --> 00:51:03.300
and performance.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.133
The only reason I use
the famous examples is

00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:08.360
because you know them
and because I was shocked

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.940
at how inadequate each and every
one of them were to the task

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.023
that they were faced with.

00:51:12.023 --> 00:51:14.780
And yes, maybe they are the
long tail or the unicorn,

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.387
but each and every one
of us are a unicorn.

00:51:18.387 --> 00:51:20.720
Really, what we should be
looking at-- the standard that

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.178
we were setting, the standard
that you're setting at Google

00:51:23.178 --> 00:51:23.960
for your son--

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.700
is that he live a
life that matters--

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.040
to him.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.090
Nobody else can make
that decision for him.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.430
And that's the silent scream.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.500
So your job is to say--

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.860
not to talk about Steve
Jobs, because he's actually

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.245
a terrible role model--

00:51:40.245 --> 00:51:43.770
is to talk about what's
so special about him

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.890
that he lays up at
night thinking about,

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:48.750
that he's afraid to
talk to you about,

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:52.050
that you could empower so
he could be lighting up

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.180
the sky with that work.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.980
It may not be
politically correct.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.300
He may not become a
doctor or a lawyer.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.720
But he might end up
being the best creator.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.790
He might be the best inventor.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.840
What could you feed--

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.792
Jane Goodall would
lose the daughter.

00:52:06.792 --> 00:52:07.750
She was four years old.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.650
She'd wander off, and she'd
look for hours for her daughter,

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.191
and her daughter
would be found there

00:52:12.191 --> 00:52:13.710
and she was looking
at the lizards.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.300
She was looking at the bugs.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.610
Well, that wasn't a
politically correct profession

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.250
in a family that had
all doctors and lawyers,

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:21.660
and she became Jane Goodall.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.650
So there's a shred of a place
of joy and contribution,

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:29.940
and that's what we, as parents,
are so challenged to find.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.159
Yes?

00:52:31.159 --> 00:52:32.700
AUDIENCE: There was
a quote earlier--

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.850
something about winners
and losers, and winners

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.590
lose more than losers.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:38.760
MARK THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.260
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
how would you define losers?

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.020
MARK THOMPSON: Yeah,
no, it's not a fair--

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.760
I'm glad you pointed
it out, because I'd

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.230
be supremely disappointed if
I didn't get called on that,

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.900
so thank you.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.275
Give her a big
round of applause.

00:52:49.275 --> 00:52:51.384
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:51.384 --> 00:52:52.800
So if there's any
great exception,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.810
I think, to the way
this is presented,

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.920
you'd never talk about
winners and losers.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.880
The reason I did that, though,
is for a very specific reason.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.480
And that is that if you
talk to people who--

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.160
if you didn't know
that they had had

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.860
some celebrity or
additional success,

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.990
you'd find that they
spent more airtime talking

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:13.470
on their failures than
on their successes,

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:17.520
that they were learning from
iterating towards an outcome

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.639
that they were seeking.

00:53:18.639 --> 00:53:20.430
The point I was really
trying to make there

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.819
is that we fail more
often than we succeed

00:53:22.819 --> 00:53:25.110
if we're really trying hard
at something we care about,

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.340
and that's OK.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.400
In fact, that's the only way
to fail forward to success.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.940
Usually 10 times
more losses than wins

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.490
for people who are trying
to do something meaningful.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.499
Yeah?

00:53:39.499 --> 00:53:42.040
AUDIENCE: If you feel like you
don't have a silent scream, is

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:48.010
it better to A, hope it comes
organically, B, cultivate one

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.670
that you want to have, or
C, just give up on the idea

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:52.600
that you'll matter?

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.576
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.520
MARK THOMPSON: It sounds like
a standard Google bubble test.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.870
Isn't there a D?

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.520
All of the above, or
none of the above?

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.210
It doesn't have to be
so much a silent scream.

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:11.865
I mean, the good news might
be, do you enjoy your work?

00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:12.740
AUDIENCE: Moderately.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.940
MARK THOMPSON: Moderately.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.606
AUDIENCE: I enjoy
everything moderately,

00:54:15.606 --> 00:54:17.492
so there's nothing
that's a peak or a low.

00:54:17.492 --> 00:54:18.950
MARK THOMPSON: OK,
so it's a matter

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:22.190
of starting to notice whether
there's peaks or lows,

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.530
starting to notice the things
that really irritate you

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.990
the most, because there might
be the germ of something you

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:28.370
really care about there.

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.860
So I have good
friends who are just

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.160
offended if they see bad code.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.610
I have friends who are offended
if they see a bad ad written.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.380
These are insights
into-- maybe she

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.590
should be spending some more
time doing copywriting on ads.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.170
And that's not something
you've ever been offered

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:46.850
in your life, most likely.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:49.370
It's so amazing to me,
being a late parent

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.860
and having my daughter go to
a great school like Berkeley,

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.140
but it's interesting asking the
kids, what do you want to do

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.764
and why do you keep
changing your mind?

00:54:55.764 --> 00:54:58.910
It's because, dad, we
never got asked a choice.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.470
We were never offered
an opportunity

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.327
to test new ideas out, right?

00:55:02.327 --> 00:55:04.160
That's not what you're
really allowed to do.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.530
Pass the AP test, right?

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:07.850
Get the performance done.

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.730
So things do end up
getting mediocre.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.560
I like everything
moderately well,

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.884
because I did get
A's in those classes.

00:55:14.884 --> 00:55:17.300
But you really haven't been
offered this opportunity, now,

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.550
to step back for a moment
and look at the things that

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.200
are your highs and your lows.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.910
You'll start to
see some of them.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:26.120
And if you do some more reading
about "The Passion Test,"

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.400
you're going to find
that some of those areas

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.790
do activate you
more than others.

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:31.100
Some you're better at.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.500
Some of those speak to you more.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.720
And that that might be a
way to start to find a way

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.365
to lean into those ideas.

00:55:38.365 --> 00:55:39.240
Thank you, everybody.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:39.960
Appreciate it.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.800
Thank you.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.300
Thank you.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.650
[APPLAUSE]
