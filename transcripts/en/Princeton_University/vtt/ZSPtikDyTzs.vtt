00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.209
CHANYOUNG PARK: My film shoot was 
a really magical experience

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:20.032
because my crew actually ended up becoming
this mini version of my film, in real life.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.393
ALEX FORD: The more you experience, 
the more stories you can tell ...

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:37.010
so why restrict yourself because you might
get a little bit less sleep at night?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.610
EMMA MICHALAK: That's what I think 
is the greatest thing about film.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:52.945
It gets you to be more in touch with 
the deepest, most human parts of yourself.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:08.642
I came to Princeton and jumped into
studying literature and the arts.

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:12.770
CHANYOUNG PARK: I changed my major about 
four times, until I settled on film production.

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:14.818
ALEX FORD: I actually came 
into Princeton being pre-med.

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:17.954
CHANYOUNG PARK: I was studying French 
and I ultimately went abroad.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.649
ALEX FORD: There was a snowstorm 
for a week, and I didn't leave my room 

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.650
and I watched 21 movies in 5 days.

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:26.931
CHANYOUNG PARK: I literally went 
to the movie theater every single day,

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:30.465
sometimes three times a day
if I was feeling a little crazy.

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:33.409
EMMA MICHALAK: I've taken everything from 
poetry to fiction to screenwriting.

00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:35.993
ALEX FORD: I watched "12 Years a Slave," 
then right after that

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:38.064
I watched "How to Train Your Dragon."

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.106
EMMA MICHALAK: That intersection of all 
those mediums informed the way I've developed

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.543
as a creative artist and filmmaker
and screenwriter and actor.

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.105
CHANYOUNG PARK: I really developed 
this relationship with films.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.816
ALEX FORD: I think I want to do this for real, 
I think I actually want to be a filmmaker.

00:01:54.328 --> 00:01:57.992
CHANYOUNG PARK: I took a class with 
P. Adams Sitney and really loved him 

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:03.737
because he just didn't care about anything
but was totally brilliant, and actually

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.191
he was the first person who 
taught me how to "read" film

00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:11.257
as an art medium, 
not as a content device.

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:14.695
EMMA MICHALAK: I was fortunate enough to 
get paired with Professor Christina Lazaridi

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:19.544
who I am now thrilled to call a mentor
and I would even say, a friend.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.073
She's wonderful, 
she's a creative genius.

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:25.240
ALEX FORD: I've been pretty close 
to Su since my sophomore year.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:27.432
She's been my adviser every year.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.553
She's somebody who's actually made me
believe a lot in myself,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.152
and she said, "The reason I'm hard on you 
about things is because I believe that

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:37.064
you can actually be a great filmmaker."

00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:39.272
So I started applying to internships

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.936
and all of a sudden I ended up getting
an internship at Dreamworks,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.416
That kind of just fell out of the sky, and 
I worked there every summer since.

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.514
EMMA MICHALAK: I got an email that 
Terrence Malick was coming to visit campus.

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.370
I went to the screening that he did a 
brief talk afterwards.

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:55.961
I kind of overheard that there 
was going to be a lunch,

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:59.176
and we just talked to Terrence Malick 
for a little bit over lunch,

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:02.203
and I got an email shortly afterwards
that went a little something like,

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.808
"You may have talked your way into a job
with Terrence Malick."

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.392
I'm going to be down in Austin at his
production outfit, working

00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:12.824
in the editorial department on Radegund, 
which is his upcoming feature film.

00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:18.169
[Singing in French]

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:28.713
CHANYOUNG PARK: My thesis film is a short comedy 
that I shot in the south of France this past summer

00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:34.378
based off of my friend, an American student
who is half Vietnamese and half French

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:39.273
who has this really ambiguous 
racial appearance.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.073
As a Korean international student,
I totally feel that hybridity

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:47.882
is becoming more and more relevant
to today's society so

00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:55.673
that's why I chose to tell this topic in a comic 
form, but nonetheless with a lot of pathos.

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:08.522
ALEX FORD: So I went to Haiti with my dad 
after the earthquake that happened in 2010.

00:04:08.843 --> 00:04:11.546
He's a doctor, so he went 
to do some operations.

00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:15.346
It was against my will, because I was 
kind of a spoiled brat back then 

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:19.995
but going there was probably one of the 
most life-changing experiences I've ever had.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.644
I worked in a medical warehouse.

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:25.738
I met somebody named Madness,
and he and I bonded. 

00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:28.554
That's really what the film is about.
It's about this friendship.

00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:31.563
It's about this belief in dreams.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:38.042
EMMA MICHALAK: My thesis is called "In the Garden,"
and it is a feature-length screenplay.

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:43.213
I wrote 30-35 pages and then completely 
scrapped it because I did not like the idea.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:46.858
So then I thought about what's in a name,
and what it means to be named Eve.

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:51.178
My screenplay is about three 
women around the world

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:54.026
who are each named 
iterations of "Eve."

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:03.499
CHANYOUNG PARK: No one should be able 
to shoot a 25-minute film in three days,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.811
in their third language, in a foreign country
where you know, like, 10 people max.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.540
ALEX FORD: So I went to Haiti last June.
I held auditions there.

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:16.875
I got the script translated into Haitian Creole,
I worked with some Haitian producers.

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.628
Everything was held in a foreign language.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:23.019
It was a really difficult journey
of communication

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:31.531
CHANYOUNG PARK: When we shot the last scene ever 
for our film I had a moment of complete breakdown.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.891
I went over to a corner in the garage
and I just started crying

00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:40.395
because I was so tired. 
All this gratitude hit me at once.

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:45.644
My host mother, my professor, my two teachers,
they were all hugging me,

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:51.346
just kissing me everywhere, and telling me
how proud they are of me,

00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:53.294
how they admired the process, and all that.

00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:57.484
That will always remain
such a poetic moment for me.

00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:01.707
EMMA MICHALAK: In an ideal world, 
I would like to have it produced.

00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:05.325
I'm not sure whether I would be 
directing it, or in it.

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.172
I'm hoping over the next couple 
of years to get funding for it,

00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:11.228
and get it realized -- get it made into
the feature film that it is.

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:24.988
STUDENT 1: It was awesome, I was so happy
to be here for the first screening!

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:26.408
STUDENT 2: My main man!

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:31.033
ALEX FORD: I'm very excited to tell 
my stories, and I think that the best way

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:33.167
for me to do so
is to write and direct.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.328
CHANYOUNG PARK: I've found my life passion, 
at least for now, which is filmmaking

00:06:38.553 --> 00:06:40.745
so I want to continue 
after graduation.
