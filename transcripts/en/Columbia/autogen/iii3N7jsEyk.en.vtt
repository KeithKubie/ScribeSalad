the slope of the secant line that we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
the slope of the secant line that we
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.079
the slope of the secant line that we
just talked about is called the first

okay okay okay so if you take a function

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830
okay okay okay so if you take a function
 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.990
okay okay okay so if you take a function
f of X and you differentiate it you'll

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
f of X and you differentiate it you'll
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420
f of X and you differentiate it you'll
get a different looking function called

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430
get a different looking function called
 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.800
get a different looking function called
F prime of X and that in it that's a new

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
F prime of X and that in it that's a new
 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.080
F prime of X and that in it that's a new
function if you put the value of x into

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
function if you put the value of x into
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.800
function if you put the value of x into
this new function then this new function

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
this new function then this new function
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.200
this new function then this new function
will give you the slope of the original

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210
will give you the slope of the original
 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.260
will give you the slope of the original
function not the original function

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270
function not the original function
 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.810
function not the original function
itself okay okay take a function f of X

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820
itself okay okay take a function f of X
 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.240
itself okay okay take a function f of X
if you differentiate it or find its

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
if you differentiate it or find its
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.820
if you differentiate it or find its
derivative you will get a new function

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
derivative you will get a new function
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.020
derivative you will get a new function
which we call F prime of X and if you

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
which we call F prime of X and if you
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.420
which we call F prime of X and if you
take the value a particular value of x

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
take the value a particular value of x
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.300
take the value a particular value of x
that you had put into this function and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310
that you had put into this function and
 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.080
that you had put into this function and
you put it into the derivative then this

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
you put it into the derivative then this
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.890
you put it into the derivative then this
new function will give you this slope of

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
new function will give you this slope of
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.270
new function will give you this slope of
the original function at that point at

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
the original function at that point at
 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.930
the original function at that point at
the chosen point X rather than the value

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
the chosen point X rather than the value
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.040
the chosen point X rather than the value
of the original function okay that's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050
of the original function okay that's
 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.690
of the original function okay that's
true by definition but it's just

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
true by definition but it's just
 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.930
true by definition but it's just
something to keep in mind okay and it'll

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940
something to keep in mind okay and it'll
 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.030
something to keep in mind okay and it'll
become a little clearer once we see some

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040
become a little clearer once we see some
 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.530
become a little clearer once we see some
examples okay just some notation there

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540
examples okay just some notation there
 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.110
examples okay just some notation there
are lots of different ways of denoting

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120
are lots of different ways of denoting
 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.140
are lots of different ways of denoting
the derivative and so and they're all

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150
the derivative and so and they're all
 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.790
the derivative and so and they're all
interchangeable and you should just get

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800
interchangeable and you should just get
 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.000
interchangeable and you should just get
used to seeing them in their myriad

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010
used to seeing them in their myriad
 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.120
used to seeing them in their myriad
forms okay and if you are you know

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130
forms okay and if you are you know
 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.870
forms okay and if you are you know
remember we're learning math driving

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
remember we're learning math driving
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.490
remember we're learning math driving
around in the back of the pickup truck

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500
around in the back of the pickup truck
 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.120
around in the back of the pickup truck
so when you do that it gets a little

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130
so when you do that it gets a little
 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.640
so when you do that it gets a little
annoying to have lots of different names

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650
annoying to have lots of different names
 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.590
annoying to have lots of different names
for the same thing

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600
 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.280
but it's it's a good way to apprehend

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290
but it's it's a good way to apprehend
 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.420
but it's it's a good way to apprehend
reality and you know so just just become

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
reality and you know so just just become
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.280
reality and you know so just just become
fluent in the different names okay so

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290
fluent in the different names okay so
 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.930
fluent in the different names okay so
this is f prime of X or F prime or Y

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
this is f prime of X or F prime or Y
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.010
this is f prime of X or F prime or Y
Prime you'll see a common one is dy of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020
Prime you'll see a common one is dy of
 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:03.370
Prime you'll see a common one is dy of
DX or dfx over DX yes I'll probably use

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380
DX or dfx over DX yes I'll probably use
 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.600
DX or dfx over DX yes I'll probably use
them interchangeably you'll see that the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610
them interchangeably you'll see that the
 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.950
them interchangeably you'll see that the
literature will use it interchangeably

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960
literature will use it interchangeably
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.250
literature will use it interchangeably
so that's my excuse there are there sort

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260
so that's my excuse there are there sort
 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560
so that's my excuse there are there sort
of cultural antecedents to these things

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570
of cultural antecedents to these things
 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.190
of cultural antecedents to these things
so you know f prime is the one that you

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200
so you know f prime is the one that you
 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.530
so you know f prime is the one that you
that you must see with economists dy/dx

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540
that you must see with economists dy/dx
 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.690
that you must see with economists dy/dx
is more what you see with pure

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700
is more what you see with pure
 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.980
is more what you see with pure
mathematicians and these other ones you

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990
mathematicians and these other ones you
 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.140
mathematicians and these other ones you
don't see that often but you see a

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150
don't see that often but you see a
 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:46.660
don't see that often but you see a
little bit okay okay so that derivative

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670
little bit okay okay so that derivative
 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.550
little bit okay okay so that derivative
i just gave you all the different

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560
i just gave you all the different
 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.550
i just gave you all the different
notation its interpretation is always as

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560
notation its interpretation is always as
 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.250
notation its interpretation is always as
the slope okay it's the slope of the

applications you might interpret it as

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280
applications you might interpret it as
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.590
applications you might interpret it as
something slightly different it's still

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600
something slightly different it's still
 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.200
something slightly different it's still
the slope you might think of it as the

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210
the slope you might think of it as the
 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.010
the slope you might think of it as the
rate of change of F of x for some unit

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020
rate of change of F of x for some unit
 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.330
rate of change of F of x for some unit
change in X that really is the slope or

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340
change in X that really is the slope or
 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.930
change in X that really is the slope or
in economic and financial applications

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940
in economic and financial applications
 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.400
in economic and financial applications
you might think of it as the marginal

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410
you might think of it as the marginal
 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.190
you might think of it as the marginal
value of x you'll see this term marginal

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200
value of x you'll see this term marginal
 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.220
value of x you'll see this term marginal
value of x so if you've had no economics

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230
value of x so if you've had no economics
 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.490
value of x so if you've had no economics
or finance before this is a new term and

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500
or finance before this is a new term and
 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.470
or finance before this is a new term and
it always means the derivative of F

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480
it always means the derivative of F
 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.670
it always means the derivative of F
of X okay and therefore it always means

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680
of X okay and therefore it always means
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.300
of X okay and therefore it always means
the rate of change of F of X for a unit

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310
the rate of change of F of X for a unit
 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:07:01.190
the rate of change of F of X for a unit
change in X okay okay so here's an

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200
change in X okay okay so here's an
 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.500
change in X okay okay so here's an
example that you'll see in economics

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510
example that you'll see in economics
 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.530
example that you'll see in economics
quite a lot cost functions suppose that

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540
quite a lot cost functions suppose that
 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.220
quite a lot cost functions suppose that
instead of f of X i have a function c of

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230
instead of f of X i have a function c of
 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.010
instead of f of X i have a function c of
q q is now the independent variable it

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020
q q is now the independent variable it
 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.900
q q is now the independent variable it
takes the place of X and C is is the

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910
takes the place of X and C is is the
 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:37.300
takes the place of X and C is is the
function and it has this formulaic form

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310
 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:45.950
and it might look something like this q

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960
and it might look something like this q
 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.630
and it might look something like this q
might be the quantity produced and this

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.640
might be the quantity produced and this
 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.430
might be the quantity produced and this
is the total cost as a function of

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440
is the total cost as a function of
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.320
is the total cost as a function of
quantity produced actually it probably

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.330
quantity produced actually it probably
 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.520
quantity produced actually it probably
won't look like this in other words I

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
won't look like this in other words I
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.180
won't look like this in other words I
didn't check to see what Q cubed minus

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.190
didn't check to see what Q cubed minus
 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.930
didn't check to see what Q cubed minus
10 q squared plus 4 TQ looks like and in

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940
10 q squared plus 4 TQ looks like and in
 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.440
10 q squared plus 4 TQ looks like and in
fact I can be sure that it doesn't look

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.450
fact I can be sure that it doesn't look
 

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.910
fact I can be sure that it doesn't look
like that

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:13.920
like that
 

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.260
like that
it should go up it should go up as cue

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.270
it should go up it should go up as cue
 

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.730
it should go up it should go up as cue
goes up but you see that's that's the

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740
goes up but you see that's that's the
 

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.990
goes up but you see that's that's the
power of calculus because because you

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000
power of calculus because because you
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.690
power of calculus because because you
you can you know once once you have

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:29.700
you can you know once once you have
 

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.600
you can you know once once you have
facility with calculus and you see a

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
facility with calculus and you see a
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.740
facility with calculus and you see a
function you don't have to graph it to

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:36.750
function you don't have to graph it to
 

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.140
function you don't have to graph it to
see what how it behaves under different

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.150
see what how it behaves under different
 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:45.950
see what how it behaves under different
circumstances okay okay the marginal

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:45.960
circumstances okay okay the marginal
 

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:57.100
circumstances okay okay the marginal
cost seek prime Q is is going to be the

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.110
 

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.860
the slope of this function so just

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:00.870
the slope of this function so just
 

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.690
the slope of this function so just
suppose that the function does look like

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700
suppose that the function does look like
 

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.490
suppose that the function does look like
this what's interesting about this

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500
this what's interesting about this
 

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.350
this what's interesting about this
function is its derivative is going to

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360
function is its derivative is going to
 

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.450
function is its derivative is going to
look interesting right and I'll show you

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:10.460
look interesting right and I'll show you
 

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.730
look interesting right and I'll show you
so let's just draw what that derivative

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740
so let's just draw what that derivative
 

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:28.820
so let's just draw what that derivative
would look like

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:28.830
 

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.780
okay Desiree do you want to help me or

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:33.790
okay Desiree do you want to help me or
 

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.560
okay Desiree do you want to help me or
did somebody else want to help me

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.570
did somebody else want to help me
 

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:43.820
did somebody else want to help me
somewhere here what would be the slope

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:43.830
 

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.570
so okay so here is the slope first of

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:48.580
so okay so here is the slope first of
 

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.960
so okay so here is the slope first of
all is the slope positive or negative

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:50.970
all is the slope positive or negative
 

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.000
all is the slope positive or negative
positive is it a big positive number or

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.010
positive is it a big positive number or
 

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.030
positive is it a big positive number or
smoke it's a big positive number right

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040
smoke it's a big positive number right
 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.960
smoke it's a big positive number right
so we're probably somewhere up here

00:09:59.960 --> 00:09:59.970
so we're probably somewhere up here
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:06.440
so we're probably somewhere up here
whoops hope I don't destroy this okay

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.450
whoops hope I don't destroy this okay
 

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.690
whoops hope I don't destroy this okay
you're frowning so here this okay so

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:12.700
you're frowning so here this okay so
 

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.690
you're frowning so here this okay so
think of the tangent line at this point

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:15.700
think of the tangent line at this point
 

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.500
think of the tangent line at this point
right yeah the tangent line goes up like

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:19.510
right yeah the tangent line goes up like
 

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.820
right yeah the tangent line goes up like
that right and that has that's a steeply

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:23.830
that right and that has that's a steeply
 

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.350
that right and that has that's a steeply
upward sloping line so that has a very

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360
upward sloping line so that has a very
 

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.460
upward sloping line so that has a very
large positive slope okay and so that's

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:32.470
large positive slope okay and so that's
 

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.670
large positive slope okay and so that's
why I've got a plot somewhere here for

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680
why I've got a plot somewhere here for
 

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.400
why I've got a plot somewhere here for
low values of Q this slope is very going

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:38.410
low values of Q this slope is very going
 

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:45.570
low values of Q this slope is very going
to be very high okay at this point okay

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:45.580
to be very high okay at this point okay
 

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.240
to be very high okay at this point okay
this is why I got a point ER so i don't

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.250
this is why I got a point ER so i don't
 

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.820
this is why I got a point ER so i don't
have to stretch like that at this at

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:50.830
have to stretch like that at this at
 

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.900
have to stretch like that at this at
this point what's the slope of the

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:54.910
this point what's the slope of the
 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:02.820
this point what's the slope of the
function zero right so 0 is down here so

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:02.830
function zero right so 0 is down here so
 

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.220
function zero right so 0 is down here so
i know that it probably looks like this

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.230
i know that it probably looks like this
 

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.449
i know that it probably looks like this
but i don't know what's going to happen

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:09.459
but i don't know what's going to happen
 

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:13.530
but i don't know what's going to happen
after this point whether it'll go up go

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:13.540
after this point whether it'll go up go
 

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.519
after this point whether it'll go up go
down right so after the point 0 what's

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:20.529
down right so after the point 0 what's
 

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:24.570
down right so after the point 0 what's
the slope here negative right so that

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.580
the slope here negative right so that
 

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.010
the slope here negative right so that
means it's going straight through like

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.020
means it's going straight through like
 

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:34.949
means it's going straight through like
that okay here what's the slope zero

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959
that okay here what's the slope zero
 

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.730
that okay here what's the slope zero
again so somewhere there I've got to be

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:38.740
again so somewhere there I've got to be
 

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.630
again so somewhere there I've got to be
coming back

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640
 

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.900
okay and then here the slope is positive

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:45.910
okay and then here the slope is positive
 

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.080
okay and then here the slope is positive
so it's going to be up here and then

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.090
so it's going to be up here and then
 

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.930
so it's going to be up here and then
here it's zero again this is going to be

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:51.940
here it's zero again this is going to be
 

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.560
here it's zero again this is going to be
like that and then the slope is negative

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:57.570
 

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.920
okay i know that was a little quick if

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:01.930
okay i know that was a little quick if
 

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.050
okay i know that was a little quick if
you have not met this kind of analysis

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:04.060
you have not met this kind of analysis
 

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.829
you have not met this kind of analysis
before I'm going to do it one more time

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839
before I'm going to do it one more time
 

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:09.660
before I'm going to do it one more time
so you get a sense of it this is this

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:09.670
so you get a sense of it this is this
 

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.880
so you get a sense of it this is this
relationship between the function and

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
relationship between the function and
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.320
relationship between the function and
it's derivative is very central okay and

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.330
it's derivative is very central okay and
 

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.630
it's derivative is very central okay and
I don't care if you don't learn how to

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:18.640
I don't care if you don't learn how to
 

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.530
I don't care if you don't learn how to
differentiate but I do want you to

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:22.540
differentiate but I do want you to
 

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.870
differentiate but I do want you to
understand at least graphically the

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880
understand at least graphically the
 

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.850
understand at least graphically the
relationship between a function and it's

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:26.860
relationship between a function and it's
 

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.470
relationship between a function and it's
derivative okay because that'll get you

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480
derivative okay because that'll get you
 

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.079
derivative okay because that'll get you
a long way that getting that intuition

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:34.089
a long way that getting that intuition
 

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:37.769
a long way that getting that intuition
behind it is really important it's not

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:37.779
behind it is really important it's not
 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.519
behind it is really important it's not
important to understand the formulas ok

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:41.529
important to understand the formulas ok
 

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:46.860
important to understand the formulas ok
ok so let's let's do it for a simpler

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:46.870
ok so let's let's do it for a simpler
 

00:12:46.870 --> 00:13:07.570
ok so let's let's do it for a simpler
kids

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:07.580
 

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:14.840
let's go back to X and f of X and

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:14.850
let's go back to X and f of X and
 

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:23.630
let's go back to X and f of X and
suppose that I have the following

with the pink should Kathy right okay so

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040
with the pink should Kathy right okay so
 

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.949
with the pink should Kathy right okay so
I'm going to ask you because you were

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959
I'm going to ask you because you were
 

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:43.010
I'm going to ask you because you were
frowning when this happened so this is

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.020
frowning when this happened so this is
 

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.050
frowning when this happened so this is
my function and I'll describe this in in

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060
my function and I'll describe this in in
 

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.720
my function and I'll describe this in in
English let's say this is a function

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:50.730
English let's say this is a function
 

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:57.760
English let's say this is a function
that starts out steep and upward sloping

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:57.770
that starts out steep and upward sloping
 

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:03.769
that starts out steep and upward sloping
for values of x close to zero steep and

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779
for values of x close to zero steep and
 

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:08.570
for values of x close to zero steep and
upward sloping and it's its stead stays

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:08.580
upward sloping and it's its stead stays
 

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.610
upward sloping and it's its stead stays
very steep but it gets less and less

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620
very steep but it gets less and less
 

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:18.470
very steep but it gets less and less
steep as x increases until let's say it

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480
steep as x increases until let's say it
 

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.140
steep as x increases until let's say it
gets to the value of five at the VAT

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.150
gets to the value of five at the VAT
 

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:26.000
gets to the value of five at the VAT
where x is equal to five it's not steep

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.010
where x is equal to five it's not steep
 

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.220
where x is equal to five it's not steep
at all it's not upward sloping at all

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.230
at all it's not upward sloping at all
 

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.180
at all it's not upward sloping at all
it's flat and after that its downward

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.190
it's flat and after that its downward
 

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.740
it's flat and after that its downward
sloping so for values of x between 0 and

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:36.750
sloping so for values of x between 0 and
 

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.829
sloping so for values of x between 0 and
5 its upward sloping for values of x

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839
5 its upward sloping for values of x
 

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:47.930
5 its upward sloping for values of x
above 5 its downward sloping okay okay

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940
above 5 its downward sloping okay okay
 

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.500
above 5 its downward sloping okay okay
so let's put that up and I want your

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:51.510
so let's put that up and I want your
 

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.730
so let's put that up and I want your
Kathy to tell me what this slope would

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740
Kathy to tell me what this slope would
 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.579
Kathy to tell me what this slope would
look like sorry that has to get up there

00:14:58.579 --> 00:14:58.589
look like sorry that has to get up there
 

00:14:58.589 --> 00:15:05.070
look like sorry that has to get up there
a little bit higher

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:05.080
 

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:18.079
ok

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.089
 

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:27.000
okay so Kathy for values of x less than

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.010
okay so Kathy for values of x less than
 

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.850
okay so Kathy for values of x less than
five we know that the function is upward

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:29.860
five we know that the function is upward
 

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.970
five we know that the function is upward
sloping will this if I had to plot the

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:35.980
sloping will this if I had to plot the
 

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.670
sloping will this if I had to plot the
slope here for values of x less than

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680
slope here for values of x less than
 

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.420
slope here for values of x less than
five will the number be a positive

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:42.430
five will the number be a positive
 

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.870
five will the number be a positive
number or a negative number or 0

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880
number or a negative number or 0
 

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.990
number or a negative number or 0
positive right and if it's close to zero

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000
positive right and if it's close to zero
 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.670
positive right and if it's close to zero
is it going to be a big positive number

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680
is it going to be a big positive number
 

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.470
is it going to be a big positive number
or a small positive number in other

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480
or a small positive number in other
 

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.550
or a small positive number in other
words you so by positive you mean that

00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560
words you so by positive you mean that
 

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.030
words you so by positive you mean that
its upward sloping is it very upward

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040
its upward sloping is it very upward
 

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.509
its upward sloping is it very upward
sloping here or is it only a little bit

00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519
sloping here or is it only a little bit
 

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:08.340
sloping here or is it only a little bit
upward sloping is it gradually upward

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:08.350
upward sloping is it gradually upward
 

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.610
upward sloping is it gradually upward
sloping it'll be a big positive number

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:11.620
sloping it'll be a big positive number
 

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.090
sloping it'll be a big positive number
right so it's going to be up here now at

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.100
right so it's going to be up here now at
 

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.019
right so it's going to be up here now at
the value x equals 5 what's the slope

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:19.029
the value x equals 5 what's the slope
 

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:23.579
the value x equals 5 what's the slope
going to be zero so that's probably a

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:23.589
going to be zero so that's probably a
 

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:29.639
going to be zero so that's probably a
point on this function the F prime of X

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:29.649
point on this function the F prime of X
 

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:36.480
point on this function the F prime of X
4 values greater than 5 we said that the

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:36.490
4 values greater than 5 we said that the
 

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.930
4 values greater than 5 we said that the
function is downward sloping and it gets

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:39.940
function is downward sloping and it gets
 

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.189
function is downward sloping and it gets
more steep as x increases so downward

00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199
more steep as x increases so downward
 

00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:47.670
more steep as x increases so downward
sloping means it has a negative slope so

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680
sloping means it has a negative slope so
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.960
sloping means it has a negative slope so
it's probably something like that and

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:50.970
it's probably something like that and
 

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.610
it's probably something like that and
looking at this it's probably a straight

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:53.620
looking at this it's probably a straight
 

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:59.759
looking at this it's probably a straight
line so the function that describes the

00:16:59.759 --> 00:16:59.769
line so the function that describes the
 

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:04.650
line so the function that describes the
slope of the function above ie its

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:04.660
slope of the function above ie its
 

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:12.569
slope of the function above ie its
derivative here is a straight line okay

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:12.579
derivative here is a straight line okay
 

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.230
derivative here is a straight line okay
if you plot if you if you plug the value

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240
if you plot if you if you plug the value
 

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.579
if you plot if you if you plug the value
5 into f of X you'll get some number

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:20.589
5 into f of X you'll get some number
 

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:25.529
5 into f of X you'll get some number
whatever that number happens to be

00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:25.539
 

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:29.279
if you plug the value 5 into its

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:29.289
if you plug the value 5 into its
 

00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:35.159
if you plug the value 5 into its
derivative you'll get the slope of the

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:35.169
derivative you'll get the slope of the
 

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:39.619
derivative you'll get the slope of the
original function everybody see that

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:39.629
original function everybody see that
 

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:43.549
original function everybody see that
this is what I need you to internalize

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559
this is what I need you to internalize
 

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.799
this is what I need you to internalize
okay it doesn't have to be in the next

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:46.809
okay it doesn't have to be in the next
 

00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:49.259
okay it doesn't have to be in the next
two minutes but in the course of the

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:49.269
two minutes but in the course of the
 

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:52.859
two minutes but in the course of the
next year or so yes oh yeah by

00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:52.869
next year or so yes oh yeah by
 

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:58.080
next year or so yes oh yeah by
definition when it's going down it has a

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.090
definition when it's going down it has a
 

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:05.580
definition when it's going down it has a
negative slope that's right so at that

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:05.590
negative slope that's right so at that
 

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.889
negative slope that's right so at that
point it has a slope of zero because

00:18:07.889 --> 00:18:07.899
point it has a slope of zero because
 

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:13.919
point it has a slope of zero because
you're flat so generally if you know if

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:13.929
you're flat so generally if you know if
 

00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:16.379
you're flat so generally if you know if
you're if you start up in the positive

00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:16.389
you're if you start up in the positive
 

00:18:16.389 --> 00:18:19.379
you're if you start up in the positive
territory if you start out with positive

00:18:19.379 --> 00:18:19.389
territory if you start out with positive
 

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:25.409
territory if you start out with positive
slope and then you hit a point where

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:25.419
slope and then you hit a point where
 

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:30.509
slope and then you hit a point where
you're flat for most functions that

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:30.519
you're flat for most functions that
 

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:33.810
you're flat for most functions that
you'll see beyond that you'll have a

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:33.820
you'll see beyond that you'll have a
 

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.789
you'll see beyond that you'll have a
negative slope for it not to have a

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799
negative slope for it not to have a
 

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:42.330
negative slope for it not to have a
negative slope there it you know it

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:42.340
negative slope there it you know it
 

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.279
negative slope there it you know it
would have to be an unusual function for

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:44.289
would have to be an unusual function for
 

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:48.509
would have to be an unusual function for
example if this was a plateau then this

00:18:48.509 --> 00:18:48.519
example if this was a plateau then this
 

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:50.460
example if this was a plateau then this
slope would go like that and then would

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:50.470
slope would go like that and then would
 

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.680
slope would go like that and then would
hang out at the x axis for a while okay

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:54.690
hang out at the x axis for a while okay
 

00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:08.129
hang out at the x axis for a while okay
yes yeah yes so that goes back to this

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:08.139
yes yeah yes so that goes back to this
 

00:19:08.139 --> 00:19:10.739
yes yeah yes so that goes back to this

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.010
I get a number here 00 is the slope of
 

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:24.210
I get a number here 00 is the slope of
the original function ok yes no no this

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:24.220
the original function ok yes no no this
 

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.150
the original function ok yes no no this
was a simple case where actually I

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.160
was a simple case where actually I
 

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.250
was a simple case where actually I
started out with a quadratic function

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:29.260
started out with a quadratic function
 

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.530
started out with a quadratic function
until they happen to have derivatives

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:31.540
until they happen to have derivatives
 

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.240
until they happen to have derivatives
that are straight lines and you'll see

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.250
that are straight lines and you'll see
 

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.600
that are straight lines and you'll see
why in a second but look here here I had

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.610
why in a second but look here here I had
 

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.910
why in a second but look here here I had
a more complicated function and it's

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:38.920
a more complicated function and it's
 

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.420
a more complicated function and it's
derivative looked less complicated than

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:42.430
derivative looked less complicated than
 

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.280
derivative looked less complicated than
the function itself but nevertheless

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.290
the function itself but nevertheless
 

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.070
the function itself but nevertheless
fairly complicated in general it's

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080
fairly complicated in general it's
 

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.020
fairly complicated in general it's
usually the case that the derivative

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.030
usually the case that the derivative
 

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.440
usually the case that the derivative
will look a little simpler closer to

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:52.450
will look a little simpler closer to
 

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.640
will look a little simpler closer to
linearity than the function itself

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:55.650
linearity than the function itself
 

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.360
linearity than the function itself
remember the derivative the

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:57.370
remember the derivative the
 

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.950
remember the derivative the
interpretation of the derivative is the

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960
interpretation of the derivative is the
 

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.600
interpretation of the derivative is the
rate of change or how the function

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:03.610
rate of change or how the function
 

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.230
rate of change or how the function
changes for a unit change in the input

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240
changes for a unit change in the input
 

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.670
changes for a unit change in the input
variable so very commonly the

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:13.680
variable so very commonly the
 

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.990
variable so very commonly the
instantaneous speed if you're driving

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000
instantaneous speed if you're driving
 

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.290
instantaneous speed if you're driving
from here to DC your every instant you

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:22.300
from here to DC your every instant you
 

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.390
from here to DC your every instant you
have a different speed you know you you

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400
have a different speed you know you you
 

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.310
have a different speed you know you you
there aren't any cars in front of you

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320
there aren't any cars in front of you
 

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.500
there aren't any cars in front of you
you're driving at 70 miles an hour and

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:28.510
you're driving at 70 miles an hour and
 

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.040
you're driving at 70 miles an hour and
or maybe more and then you hear a police

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.050
or maybe more and then you hear a police
 

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.740
or maybe more and then you hear a police
car you're going to drive at 40 okay so

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:34.750
car you're going to drive at 40 okay so
 

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.910
car you're going to drive at 40 okay so
that is so a different instance you have

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:38.920
that is so a different instance you have
 

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.080
that is so a different instance you have
different speed think of that in the

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.090
different speed think of that in the
 

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.900
different speed think of that in the
same vein as a nonlinear function at

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:45.910
same vein as a nonlinear function at
 

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.750

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.070
different points different values of X
you have different slopes

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080
you have different slopes
 

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.870
you have different slopes
okay when you're going very fast you're

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880
okay when you're going very fast you're
 

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.769
okay when you're going very fast you're
getting towards DC very quickly when

00:22:00.769 --> 00:22:00.779
getting towards DC very quickly when
 

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:04.250
getting towards DC very quickly when
your slope is very steep you're you're

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.260
your slope is very steep you're you're
 

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.430
your slope is very steep you're you're
covering a lot of distance in this axis

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440
covering a lot of distance in this axis
 

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.779
covering a lot of distance in this axis
very quickly okay so in general in in

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:14.789
very quickly okay so in general in in
 

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:17.120

any kind mean that's just a speed

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.130
any kind mean that's just a speed
 

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:22.269
any kind mean that's just a speed
example but but in any kind of social

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279

analysis or scientific analysis you'll

00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:25.649
analysis or scientific analysis you'll
 

00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:28.850
analysis or scientific analysis you'll
have phenomena that are related to other

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860
have phenomena that are related to other
 

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.620
have phenomena that are related to other
phenomena that's the functional

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:30.630
phenomena that's the functional
 

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.210
phenomena that's the functional
relationship we talked about in the last

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220
relationship we talked about in the last
 

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.350
relationship we talked about in the last
session and then you'll want to know

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360
session and then you'll want to know
 

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.360
session and then you'll want to know
whether that functional relationship is

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:40.370
 

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.730
you know is it what's the rate of change

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740
you know is it what's the rate of change
 

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.889
you know is it what's the rate of change
of that functional relationship is if

00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:45.899
of that functional relationship is if
 

00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:48.740
of that functional relationship is if
you change X a little bit will you have

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:48.750
you change X a little bit will you have
 

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.560
you change X a little bit will you have
a huge change in Y or only a little

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:51.570
a huge change in Y or only a little
 

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:57.019
a huge change in Y or only a little
change in Y okay so you know as an

here is very gradual my total cost won't

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960
here is very gradual my total cost won't
 

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.399
here is very gradual my total cost won't
rise too much but if I'm here and I

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:19.409
rise too much but if I'm here and I
 

00:23:19.409 --> 00:23:21.560
rise too much but if I'm here and I
increase my output a little bit my total

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:21.570
increase my output a little bit my total
 

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.529
increase my output a little bit my total
cost will rise a lot and there's

00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539
cost will rise a lot and there's
 

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:27.200
cost will rise a lot and there's
probably an underlying technological

but if we're off if this were full and i

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:48.990
but if we're off if this were full and i
 

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.830
but if we're off if this were full and i
added an extra student then i might have

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840
added an extra student then i might have
 

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.830
added an extra student then i might have
to expand to another classroom and so

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840
to expand to another classroom and so
 

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.129
to expand to another classroom and so
Mike my cost let's say would increase

substantially okay yes

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:03.990
 

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.870
no you could do that for every function

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880
no you could do that for every function
 

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.200
no you could do that for every function
in fact you so if you didn't know

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.210
in fact you so if you didn't know
 

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.150
in fact you so if you didn't know
calculus at all and you simply SAT there
