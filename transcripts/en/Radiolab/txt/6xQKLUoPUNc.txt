Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. T. E. N. P. E. R. All right. K. Yup. I want to start with a parental daydream for a second. It's an idea that's been kicking around for me since my kids were born. Okay. Actually the idea itself is pretty old. It goes back to the 18 hundreds right around Napoleon's time to a fellow by the name of John Baptist. Pierre Antwan. Monet evaluates the Lamar Lamarck Giambattista Lamar who according to writers, same keen. He was really one of the first grand theorists in biology. He actually coined the word biology to really? Yup. His big idea, as you might know, is that what a person does in their lifetime could be directly passed to their kids very easily. His famous example was giraffes. Lamarck said, do you want to know how a giraffe got his long neck one day? This giraffe mother draft, let's say he was looking up into tree and saw some fruit and had to stretch her neck and stretch again, whole lifetime of stretching.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And then when she had a baby stretching, got into the baby and then that baby would stretch and stretch and stretching it. Him Give a little more stretching to its baby and eventually over the millennia what you'd get is a creature with a very long neck because they're reaching for the tops of trees. It makes a kind of common sense really. It does. And it does make kind of a a folk sense. He thought it worked with humans too. His example with humans was a blacksmith. He thought that because they're swinging hammers all day, they got big bulking muscles and then they would pass the muscles to their children. The sneaky idea here is that the blacksmiths, the giraffes, they made it happen. They willed the neck to get longer, the muscles to get bigger. And the, the key point is that it wasn't something in born in them. It was something they acquire during their lifetime, which they passed to their kids. Right. And that's wrong. That's not how far we're telling. Now know that that's not the case, but, but wouldn't be nice

Speaker 2:          02:04          if that's how it worked. Let's read the book first and cause you know, now that I've got these two kids right now I find myself thinking like, okay, I know these kids have their genes half for me, half for my wife and I know I can't change those genes and I know fate is going to give them a couple of random mutations in those genes that I have no control over. That is just the cold logic of Darwinian evolution. Yeah. What's offensive? I mean the idea that they could be constrained by their DNA, maybe one of us gave them a bit of DNA that's going to hold them back. It's a terrible thought. This letter right here. Oh, how about this one? And so what you do, I think all parents do this, is that you slip into this Lamarckian delusion that what you do with your kids could somehow rewrite all that that you can somehow by just being nice, them reading them stories or whatever, that you could break

Speaker 1:          03:00          them free of all that. We rewrite their, their their blueprint. Like, I dunno, you don't really say it to yourself that way, but yeah, you can make a deep difference. Yeah. Like you can help them overcome you. Is that cool? Hello? No, you can't. I know. That's what Darwin says. You can't. I know. I know.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Once they're born, their genes are fixed and change does not happen in a generation or two. It happens in really, really, really slowly. Gradually achingly slowly one parent's stretching isn't going to do anything. See, that's the bummer of Darwinian evolution. As a parent, you are a tiny blip and a very, very long story.

Speaker 3:          03:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:50          but this hour we're going to fight this sort of sad sack feeling of inevitability and impotence and rewrite the so-called rules of genetics. That's right. Today on radio lab, we are going to lick some rat, starve some Swedes there. Realized some women. I mean we're not going to do that ourselves. No, but we're going to play the stories where these things actually happen. Yes. I'm Chad. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab stick around. It's going to get messy.

Speaker 3:          04:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:26          okay, so let's get going and stick with your boy the mark just for a second. [inaudible] okay. Cause we were talking to science right across Zimmer and he told us that back in the early 19 hundreds this um, tension between the mark and Darwin got extra tense in a, in a sort of fascinating way. Right. And it all started in Vienna

Speaker 4:          04:46          at this really marvelous place called the VI varium vape. Varium yeah, this was a really radical place at the time because you have to remember that people studying animals up til now, they were basically, you know, studying Lima preserved specimen and so on at the vivarium as the name suggests,

Speaker 5:          05:05          they had lie, man. It was like a zoo. Well it was a zoo where there was all sorts of experiments going on.

Speaker 4:          05:14          You know, the fact is that taking care of animals, trying to keep them alive in a building is not an easy thing, especially if it's 1903.

Speaker 1:          05:24          But luckily for the vivarium and for our story, they had a guy, Paul [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:29          [inaudible] who was he? Um, so he, and when was he? He was born in 1880 in Vienna, Jewish family by all accounts. A pretty good looking guy in, in pictures. He has that, you know that crazy Einstein fuzzy hair thing. Virginia's cut. Yep. He's 22, 23 and you already have this reputation for being amazing at keeping animals alive that otherwise would just

Speaker 2:          05:50          die.

Speaker 1:          05:52          His reputation was that he could get inside the mind of say a salamander. I know just

Speaker 4:          05:58          what I wanted to eat or how much humidity it preferred. Right. He was a born nurturer and he adored animals. He actually named his daughter a less Serta, which is a genus of Lizard. That's the kind of guy he is. So of course the folks at the vivarium asked him to build these terrariums and aquariums and stock them with animals, including a particular in fib Ian, that plays a very big part in the story.

Speaker 1:          06:24          The midwife towed the midwife towed, right? That's right. You're Sam Kean again and here's he says what you need to know about the midwife tote. Basically the midwife toad has a strange habit for toads. Most toads, he says love to stay in the water. They like to hang out in the water and the females like to lay eggs in the water. But with the midwife towed, the female lays her eggs on land and then the male midwife towed, comes along, grabs the eggs and actually kind of sticks them to his back legs, like a bunch of whitish grapes and then hops around with them basically until they hatch. So he's got to live his life as a towed with all this baggage on him

Speaker 4:          07:04          just until they hatch and then til they go off still that's a burden. If he's carrying a big burden there is, your wife can hear this, she cares your kids for nine months and you're like that pork nail towed.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Anyhow, so you've got this Guy Paul camera who's good with animals. He got these toads who hate water and in one day we can imagine he gets curious as he's doing his rounds, he stops by the midwife towed [inaudible] me, looks down at that little male towed with a grape stuck to his legs and he wonders how adaptable is that little guy. I mean he hates water. Females seem to hate laying eggs in the water, but is that the end of the story?

Speaker 4:          07:40          What would happen if I made them go in the water? Could they adapt? I know what I'll do. I'm going to set up a terrarium for them and I'm going to make it hot. Really uncomfortably hot,

Speaker 1:          07:54          but I'm going to give them a base in a water. Nice, cool water and he would basically turn the heat way, way up in music aquariums until they had to go under water. You can imagine these tilts are like, dammit, fine. All right, I'll get in the water. Maybe they'd try and jump back out, but it was still hot so they'd have to jump back in. And since the camera kept the heat up, toads basically had to stay there in this watery place. Did they had not evolved for Darwin's theory would have said, you know, 90% of the toads are gonna die. There's going to be this massacre of toads and only a few lucky ones are going to survive. And those lucky ones, according to Darwin's theory, they would have had to have been born with some random mutation in their gene that gave them an advantage in this situation

Speaker 4:          08:42          and that advantage, whatever it was, because it starts with one individual and then it gets passed onto the kids and then onto their kids. It would take a long, long, long time to through the whole population because generally that's how evolution works. It takes a while. But according to camera, here's what happened. When he heated up the toads, a little cage that hit spend more time in the water as expected. And when it came time to mate, the males and the females, they would mate in the water at first didn't go so well because you know, if you're Atlanto and you're trying to have sex in the water, it's kind of hard. Your slippery partner's slippery. You just have it evolved for this and there's no way you can, at least not quickly. But according to camera, shortly after these toads got into the water, they did begin to evolve fast.

Speaker 4:          09:33          They began to grow these little puffy things on their hands, the these kind of rough scratchy pads, what's known as a nuptual pad, nuptial path. Right. It was just what the males needed so they can grab onto the female and hold tight while they're mating. And they didn't have these on land? No, they did not have them on land. They disappeared in the water. Yup. And how long did it take? Right away, we, in just two generations, these toads seem to have done something that should've taken, I don't know, 50 a hundred generations, maybe more camera thought. Wow. They can respond to the environment. Do we revealing it with experiments? They're not trapped by their genes. Around 1908 he starts publishing all of these results and it's big news and he grabs toads and he hit the road. He hit the lecture circuit and he hit it big.

Speaker 4:          10:24          He was known for going around and giving what he called his big show lectures where he would wow whole audiences of people and in 1923 he actually comes to England. There was a newspaper called the daily express and they have these headlines that come out. It says race of Superman. That's the headline for his talk race. Then below that, right below the headline says, scientists, great discovery, which may change us all. What's he talking about? We're just talking about tote. I thought, it's not just talking about toads anymore. He's gone way beyond toads. Ki extended this idea to people. He thought that you could kind of engineer societies by changing the environment. I just have to read this to you, the results and make it probable that our descendants will learn more quickly. What we know well will execute more easily. What we have accomplished with great effort, we'll be able to withstand what injured us almost to the point of death where we sought. They will find where we began. They will account and this idea won him a lot of fans, including not surprisingly the Soviet, yeah. It was a very attractive theory to them in Moscow because the Soviets may believe in Karl Marx's idea that human beings are an improvable species. That if you can change the conditions around people, you change the people. Your camera was saying, you know, you can do this even on a physical,

Speaker 6:          11:44          but

Speaker 4:          11:46          there are a lot of skeptics and there were from the beginning when camera published his results initially, a bunch of scientists immediately began to say, wait a minute, hold on here. It would be nice if life was like that. But life isn't like that. Life is hard. People can't just will themselves into a more perfect form according to Darwin, life and changes are ruled by chance and fate and to believe anything else that's naive. So this whole toad thing to the Darwinian faction, it didn't scan really. So some scientists began to ask Cameron if they could look at his totes and just take a little peak for themselves and every time Canberra or our said no, they were his specimen, get your own. It was kind of this struggle for a few years. Then world war one came and that kind of disrupted everything. Camera for one was sent off to work as a sensor for the Austrian military and his lab ended up getting destroyed, including all his toads except he had one, he had one remaining midwife towed. So this whole debate, two totally different ways of seeing life. It all came down to this jar with his towed in it and you have to bear in mind that at this point it only had one hand left and right and had been cut off for, for microscopic slides. And so you could only see one nuptial pad and it all comes down to this

Speaker 7:          13:12          and [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:14          all of it was just about to fall apart. What happened? Well, there was a, a uh, expert on reptiles named at g Kingsley Noble, Gladwin Kingsley Noble. What an aim. The guy, it sounds like trouble. Oh, you was for camera. He was mighty skeptical. So he uh, he actually went to Vienna, visited cameras lab when camera wasn't there and he makes a very careful study of this hand. Andy, when he examined it, he noticed that there was a syringe hole there. And he says this isn't a nuptial pad. It looks darkened, but that's just ink. What do you mean ink ink? Like the big ink witting no, like India ink. What? No. Yes, he doctored the toad. That was the implication except camera or tried to defend himself by saying, do you think I'm a dumb cop or an idiot? Because that's what I would have to be if I left a forgery with ink standing around openly in the laboratory where so many of my enemies would have entry. So how did he explain it? Well, he thought it might've been an assistant trying to frame him because he was Jewish and you know, there was kind of antisemitism growing at this time. So he thought that someone had framed him and six weeks after a noble published his results in nature camera or sent a letter to Moscow turning down a job that they'd offered him because it would reflect badly on the Soviet state. And then

Speaker 1:          14:52          following day camera puts on a suit and he walks off into the mountains outside Vienna on a rocky mountain trail and he shoots himself. Chase Lamarckism

Speaker 4:          15:13          pretty much died there.

Speaker 3:          15:20          Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 4:          15:35          so then over the next 70 some odd years, lamarck basically became the poster boy for like the big dumb idea. The idea that you want to believe in,

Speaker 1:          15:47          but that, you know, isn't true, but, but, but there's, but there's, there's like some hope here because, um, okay. All right. This is interesting. Then Carl told us about this research that showed that if, if a mother really couldn't quite remember the details does what a mother imutual for Carl mouse or rat, I'm trying to remember, was it rats or mice? No, it's rats. Rats. Yup. We ended up talking to the guy who did the work. Michael Meaney I think. Yeah. I'm a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill McGill University in Montreal. So here's the backstory. About 30 years ago, I was in undergraduates. Michael was in school and he got interested in a very, very basic question about how things get passed down. Like have you ever had one of those moments where you suddenly are your dad and it catches you off guard? Oh, of course. I mean it's pretty common.

Speaker 1:          16:33          But like here's a, for instance, my dad for my entire life had this thing where if someone was whistling, he'd be so, he would like, they could be whistling six tables over to a restaurant and he would turn around and be like, stop that. Like it was like it was scraping his very nerves and the other day someone was whistling and I was like, stop it and you just hit me. I was like, Oh God, that was hit. It's never appeared until now. And you went like, where did that come from? Is that a genetic hatred of whistling that I just had or did I somehow learn that that in a sort of ass backward way was Michael's question, how does that happen? How do these simple little traits get passed forward?

Speaker 1:          17:07          So, so we started looking at maternal care. Many years later, he and this woman, Francis Champagne, who now works at Columbia University, they decided to explore this question looking at in rats. So we have our rats in the lab and they thought, let's just see if we can figure out how it is that rat mothers pass down their parenting skills. That's right. If you were a great rat, mommy, what would you be doing with your rat baby? You would be looking them quite a lot. Uh, that's what good rap mothers do. They look their babies a lot, but she says, you can tell right away just by looking at some rat moms don't look their kids a lot. There's a normal distribution, right? You got your good parents and you're bad parents would they decided to do first was to try to figure out which rat was which, which interestingly, counting all the lists,

Speaker 8:          17:51          putting this into context, you know you have a rat mom and they have about 16 to 20 babies all at once at once and we're watching 40 liters at a time.

Speaker 1:          18:01          How do you count those? That's 40 that's too hard.

Speaker 8:          18:04          You have to look at one cage. Say, are they liking? Yes. No. Okay. Move on to the next cage. Yes. No, move on to the next cage. Yes. No, you have to do that for five hours a day for six consecutive days. Move on to the next cage. Yes. No. Move on to the next cage. Yes. No.

Speaker 1:          18:19          See, this is the story of science that that doesn't get told no. That just a mind crushing tedium. Yes. Yeah. The next day. Yes. No. Yeah. It drifts into something like a shopping channel. In any case, what they saw the end of all this accounting was, well, first of all, what they saw was this pattern that rat pups who got licked a lot as babies when they grew up, they lick their babies a lot and the rat pups who didn't get licked a lot when they grew up, they didn't lick their babies a lot. So the great rat nightmare comes true with the females become their mothers.

Speaker 3:          18:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:53          I think that makes a lot of sense actually. It's kind of obvious, right? Right. Yeah. I mean we all kind of know this. There are cycles of abuse or whatever. You know, like if you're abused as a kid, you were more likely to abuse your kid. But still you've got to wonder

Speaker 8:          19:08          why. Why would that happen? How do those cycles perpetuate? I mean like with the licking, is it a teaching thing

Speaker 1:          19:15          where you know, the babies become good mothers because they've learned it by watching their mothers, they've seen it and they've repeated the experience, or does it get passed on such a deep level that doesn't even require teaching? What do you mean? So that's the reason of course that we worked with rats because we can get inside the brain. So Michael and Francis looked inside the brains of these rats and what they saw was that the rats had been licked a lot as babies. They had more stuff in their head. What do you mean one more brains up more. What kind of stuff? It brings us more up. More of this particular kind of protein that activates maternal behavior. When rats have more of this protein, they will act more monthly and they, they had more. So we'll think about what makes proteins legit. DNA. Well, yes. Genes and DNA. Yeah. Don't you see some, how the mother's tongue is getting all the way down in there and going yeah. Messing with the baby's DNA. Is that what you're saying? That the licking is changing the baby's DNA. That's what I know. I'm quite saying that cause you know that's, that's out again, that's the rules against the rules. You can't change your DNA. Yeah. You can't touch that. It's off limits. Right. But that tongue is doing something to the DNA.

Speaker 8:          20:25          So what is the licking doing now?

Speaker 1:          20:27          That's, that's our challenge. Do you have any theories for how this tongue is tickling the DNA or whatever it's doing? Um, well so then, so what Michael just launched into this thing. What happens when moms lick their pups is that the puppy comes aroused. The reason they're more aroused that the mom's

Speaker 4:          20:48          licking activates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the pop, he says those two chemicals kick off certain hormonal systems and one of them is called the thyroid system, right? Hormones then get into the brain and they turn on certain neurochemical signals and the neurochemical signal that gets activated during licking is Serotonin as in the mood chemical. Yep. So mom's looking activates serotonin and it's released onto brain cells in the hippocampus. You still with me, I think I'm with you started with the tongue. Four or five steps later. We are in brain cells. So almost instantaneously the mother's tongue has reached into the baby's brain cells. Now inside the cells in the center coiled up little spools is the DNA. So we're getting close to the moment of truth gets there. It is. That's the stuff that makes you you, but that you supposedly can't get to. But here's what I did not know about DNA. According to Francis, it's not just sitting off. They're perfectly preserved. It's in the middle of the cell, it's crowded. You've got all these chemicals around racing by, you know, in the south and very often one of them will just go crashing into [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:08          DNA and it'll stick there like a, like a barnacle or a glob of peanut butter. Exactly. Peanut butter. There we go. What will happen is it'll get stuck to one little part of the DNA and now that little bit of DNA is very difficult to get at. It's basically unusable because it's got the thing stuck to it. Yeah, and these things are called apparently methyl groups. Methyl groups are pretty sticky. They're hard to get off. So imagine the DNA in that brain cell.

Speaker 4:          22:34          All of these chemicals racing by crashing into it sticking. And one of the bits that gets covered up is that little bit that makes the proteins that create a maternal instinct, the bit of DNA that will give this baby when it grows up instincts to be nice to its baby and lick that. And you're saying that part of the DNAs covered up? Yes. And when methyl groups stick to that part of the DNA, the maternal instinct is effectively turned off.

Speaker 1:          22:59          But if you've got a mom who licks you,

Speaker 4:          23:02          mom's looking activate Serotonin, serotonin gets into the brain cells and according to Michael, unleashes a whole series of molecular events inside the cell. The critical part of this is that all these changes wake up, this little gang of proteins known as transcription factors. And if they see methyl groups sitting on that bit of DNA, they are pissed. And so they bring water friends to the party, they all go down to the VNA, surround that methyl and just knock it right off the DNA. That's it. And then they're going to basically rebel at that particular spot. Turn on that gene. So now the genes can make the proteins that make the rats a good mom. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Exactly. That was awesome. Wow. That was amazing. Why? Why are you so thrilled? Well, think about it. This is nature and nurture slamming into each other. Like you know when people, smart people say, you know, there's no such thing as nature. Notice on the interaction at the tail and you're like, what the hell does that mean? Well, this is it, right?

Speaker 8:          24:04          This is real physical, chemical interaction between what's going on in the environment and what's going on with the DNA.

Speaker 1:          24:12          Because you begin with a mother's lick that ends up with a deep, deep change in the baby, not just the good, warm, fuzzy feeling, but a fundamental shift.

Speaker 4:          24:22          Who that baby is and who that baby will be. You're now hearing the Mark's name invoked these days because there are things beyond genes that we pass down to our children.

Speaker 1:          24:36          No, according to Carl [inaudible], gs are still fixed. We can't rewrite our genes. That is impossible so far as we know. But there seems to be this layer on top of the genes, this second channel of heredity. If the genes are the bottom floor, then this layer on top is sometimes called the Epi genome. And that thing can change based on your experiences, which wouldn't you think about it? It has a very lamarckian flavor.

Speaker 8:          24:59          Yeah. I think that's where the Mark's ideas can be woven in and make some sense. So do you call yourself a Lamarckian? Not usually because it upsets people. And I'm Canadian. I don't like to [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:11          [inaudible] plus, you know, the Marc didn't get all the biological details right? I had no idea about DNA or very many of them right at all. But you know, his basic idea seems to be true.

Speaker 8:          25:21          I mean, when you think of camera, there was a report in science, um, outlining a theory about how cameras, toads got these characteristics that invoked the, these epigenetic inheritance and, and imprinted genes. And it made it plausible. Oh, so redeeming him. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:41          Maybe or maybe not.

Speaker 3:          25:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:55          thanks to Francis Champagne and Michael median. Sam Keen, who writes about Paul Camera in his book, the Violin, his thumb. Also, thanks to Carl Zimmer, whose latest his evolution making sense of life.
