00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.688
(digital sounds)

00:00:02.688 --> 00:00:03.666
- This look good?

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.499
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.162
That's a real gun by
the way, so be careful.

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:08.376
- What?

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:10.488
- [Dennis] I said that's
a real gun, so be careful.

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:11.847
- You got a real gun?

00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:12.897
- Well, it's my dad's.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:14.277
- But why would you use a real gun?

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:15.759
This is a silly sketch.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:16.829
- Because (laughs),

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.162
you see Black Rain?

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:18.995
- Jason] Black Rain?

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.099
- The movie.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.522
- [Jason] With Michael Douglas?

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.907
- Yeah, see the guns,
how fake they looked?

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:26.008
- Just take this, I don't--

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:27.175
- [Sarah] Jay.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:29.016
- Hey

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:29.849
- What're you doing?

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.682
What is this?

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:31.515
- What're you doing home?

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:32.838
I thought you were at work.

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:33.747
- Yeah I was.

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:35.401
Charlie had her check up remember?

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.405
Why are you wearing that ridiculous wig?

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:38.238
What, hi.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.071
- [Jason] You know Dennis.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:40.538
- Hi.

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:43.241
- We're shooting a video,

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.903
for a contest, for a comedy website.

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.603
- Alright, well what's the contest?

00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:50.030
What's the prize?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.113
- A tote bag.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.297
(sighs)

00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:55.467
- Jason I just saw this,

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:56.804
where you gonna tell me about this?

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:58.264
- I wanna pay that, I do.

00:00:58.264 --> 00:00:59.334
You know right after this--

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.054
- You owe 30,000 dollars in back taxes?

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:02.887
- I know.

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:03.720
I saw that bill,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.553
- I can't do this by myself anymore,

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:05.386
You have to get a job.

00:01:05.386 --> 00:01:06.913
- I know, I gotta do something about that.

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:07.746
Gotta pay that.

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:08.579
I know.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.412
You know I'm gonna get a job,

00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:10.306
I'm gonna get a job,

00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:11.558
right after we do this,

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:13.196
I'm gonna send out some emails.

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:14.029
- Okay (laughs)

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:16.172
You're gonna send out
some emails and get a job.

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:17.449
What're you gonna do, what's the plan?

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:19.260
- Look, I wanna reassure you that

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.366
totally responsible Jason is here,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.533
and I'm going to grow up starting now.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:28.349
- Shit, man.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:30.877
This is loaded.

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:32.332
I forgot to take the clip out.

00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:33.915
- Oh my God, Jason.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.044
- You're not around a
lot of children, are you?

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.044
(upbeat rock music)
