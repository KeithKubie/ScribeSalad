- I'm like, "I don't want to go
sell these rocks,"

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.006
but I knew a crackhead lady,

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.808
and she was like, "Uh, I'll do
whatever you want me to do

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.677
for it," and I ain't want her
to do nothing for me.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.079
I ain't even have no hair.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.181
I was like, "You can't do
nothing for me yet."

We all come from somewhere,

who nurtures us, protects us,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.529

- Got a lot of brothers
and sisters.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.059
About--a lot of us.

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.728
My dad just--his dick just
didn't stop.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.197
But we all live close
to each other.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.398
You know, different moms, dads.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.966
We called them
"different dads,"

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.768
my mom, my sisters, moms,
my mom type shit.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.737
So we were sharing things,
shoes and everything.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.072
Everybody shared shit.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.407
If you live in a hand-me-down
place,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.409
but--except it wasn't even
completely done,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:20.079
where, like, you shared shit
that you needed that day.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:21.747
So I was--
[laughs]

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.249
so I had a track meet, right,

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.585
and I was like, "Yo,"
I was running track,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.786
and my mom used to always make
excuses

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.321
why I didn't have shoes.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.390
She'd be like, "You run faster
in your socks."

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.593
Which was true; I was, like,
aerodynamic.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.595
I was faster in my socks, but
you gotta have on shoes,

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.797
because you might get stomped
with some cleats,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.399
and we ain't had no insurance
type shit, right?

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.902
So I was like, yo, so one day I
ran with my track shoes

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.905
I did real good, but my shoes
was all fucked up,

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:46.939
because it's my
brother's shoes,

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.508
and they was real fucked up.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.409
So this girl came up, she was
like, "You did so--

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:51.777
you're so good, killed it."

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.312
And I was like--I'm, like, 11
years old,

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.615
like, "Yeah, I was fast."

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.117
And then this kid is like
probably 13, 14

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.353
walked up, "He ain't even race
nobody!"

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.189
And I was like, "It was people
running."

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.290
He go, "He ain't even race
nobody with

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.791
them wack-ass shoes."

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:08.995
And I was like, "Damn, I
just motherfuckin' won.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.931
These some winter shoes, right?

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.466
So, like, yo, I'm determined to
get my own shoes.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.034
I said, I need to get my own
shoes.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.869
I went to my mom; I was like,
"Mom, I need to have--

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.305
Ma, Ma, can I have--
Ma"--

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:20.973
'Cause that's how you ask
in a black house.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.376
You never get it out.
'Cause your mama cut you off.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.512
"You want some shoes?
Go get some goddamn shoes!"

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.648
And I was like--you mumble it.
"I will."

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.684
But you don't know how
you're gonna get 'em.

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.653
So I said, "Okay,
I'ma get some shoes."

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.321
So my boy said, "How are we
gonna get shoes?"

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.223
'Cause I ain't have no job
to make money.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.824
I used to babysit my little
nieces and them,

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.359
my--you know, that's ghetto--

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:43.629
my nieces was like close to the
same age as me.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.498
But one of my uncles,
I babysit for him,

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.166
he wouldn't never pay me
in money;

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.302
he always paid me in crack.
Real simple.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.204
I'm not making it up;
he wanted me to hustle.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.573
See, "But I'ma give you
three rocks.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.041
Go sell these three rocks."
I'm like, "Three rocks?"

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.509
He's like, "That's $30,
my boy."

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:57.677
Like, "Oh, you might be able
to get 20 for 'em

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.011
if we sell 'em."

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:00.346
I'm like, "I don't want to go
sell these rocks,"

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.014
but I knew a crackhead lady,

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.849
and she was like, "Uh, I'll do
whatever you want me to do

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:06.519
for it," and I ain't want her
to do nothing for me.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.221
I ain't even have no hair.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.557
I was like, "You can't do
nothing for me yet.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.394
It hasn't reached its full
potential."

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.699
So my boy said,
"Well, what we could do"--

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.667
Her name was Esse.
He said, "What we could do is,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.837
"we could get Esse;
Esse could take us to Kmart.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.606
We can just give her a rock,"
he said,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.507
"'Cause my cousin is working
security,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.411
and he said we could steal
whatever we want to steal."

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.547
And I said, "Man, I don't want
to get caught stealing."

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.249
I was like, "Just wait your
mama go to sleep.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.883
"You know, she got to work
early any way.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.285
Wait your mama go to sleep

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.586
'cause we was gonna go steal
some stuff."

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.188
And I said, oh, man, I don't
know.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.690
So it's myself, my boy Rock,
and Danny.

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:46.058
So we said, "All right,
we gonna go steal."

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.226
I said, "Let's just take
the bus."

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.561
Like, "You got some bus money?"

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.229
I was like, "We ain't got no
bus money.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.430
Well, Esse got to take us."
I said, "Fine."

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:52.565
So we paid her a rock.
She like,

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.899
"I want all of them at once."

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.134
I was like, "No, we gotta wait"

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.737
'cause a crackhead will
pull off.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.904
So we go into Kmart.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.640
And I was like,
"Where the shoe section?"

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.241
We tried to act like we was
supposed to be in there.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:03.542
We was like, "Where
the shoe section at?

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:07.246
[laughs]
We here for some shoes."

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.582
So--so Danny cousin was like,
"Yo, for real,

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.384
"you can--you can go on
get you some shit,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.419
but just get some
fuckin' shoes."

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.888
What he didn't tell us,
that we--I get my shoes,

00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:17.123
I put 'em on.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.758
The fuckin thing in
the middle,

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.961
so I'm trying to walk out
with the little security thing

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.262
in the middle of it, right,

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:24.563
but I got a nice little
cool walk.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:26.299
It look like they not even
attached.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.835
He's like, "No," he says--

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:31.671
so then he was like, "No, steal
whatever you want."

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.572
So my boy Rock like, "Man, we
really need some shit."

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:34.940
So he's saying big shit like,
"We can leave with

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.342
a microwave out the back."

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.110
I'm like, "Man, we can't no
microwave.

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:40.079
Like, let's just get our shoes
and get outta here.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.282
I feel real fast already.
Right?

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:45.484
So as we leaving,
as we're leaving,

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:47.320
security walks up.
He says,

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.922
"One of y'all stole a Snicker."

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.692
Swear to God. I'm standing
still with the shoes on.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.695
He like, "One of y'all stole
a Snicker."

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.863
So he's like, "No, we didn't.
No, we didn't."

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.432
Rock like, "No, we didn't!
We didn't steal no

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.133
fuckin' Snickers!"
He's cursing.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:02.301
Fuck, 12 years old, cursing.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.437
Give a fuck!

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.138
He starts saying stuff.
"I kill everybody!"

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.874
We like, "You can't kill
nobody."

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:10.343
So he take us to the back.
Now I'm nervous.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.477
I'm like, if they wake up my
mom,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.045
it's like, you got two choices:

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.214
You going to jail or your
parents gotta come get you.

00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:17.516
So Danny like, "I'ma say Esse
my mama."

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.151
I'm like, "You can't get the
rock outside

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:22.621
in time to make her come in."

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.056
So I'm like, "We stuck in
there."

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.524
He's like, "No, my mama
gonna come get me,

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:26.692
but she gonna mess--
she gonna"--

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:29.128
So he calls,
he calls his mom.

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:30.463
His mom comes and get him.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.198
He's getting fucked up
in there.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.500
When I tell you,
she was beating him--

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.068
I was like--beating him to
the point where I was like

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.704
"Don't call my mama."

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.239
So I said, "I'm not gonna call
my mama."

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.674
So I said, "I'm gonna call
my dad,"

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.242
but I hadn't talked to my dad
in forever.

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:46.345
I mean, I had to call
my dad's sister

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.581
to get my dad's new girlfriend
number

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.816
to get my dad's number.

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.352
So finally Tony answers,
which he wanted me to call him,

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.687
'cause he didn't me to call him
"dad"

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.356
in front of his new
girlfriends.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.525
So he was like--
[laughs]

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:01.761
That messed up his "game."
All right.

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.765
So Tony answered,
and Tony was like,

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.533
"What? What's wrong?"
I said, "Come get me."

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:09.201
I was like, "It's Boots."
That's my nigga.

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:10.936
I said, "Boots. Come get me."
He's like, "Where you at?"

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.371
I was like, "They said we're
stealing in the Kmart,

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:13.773
but, Dad, I ain't steal
nothing."

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.040
I was like, "I wasn't
stealing nothing."

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.375
He's like, "I don't care."

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:17.877
He said, "Why you ain't
tell your mama?"

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.278
And I said, "Okay, I'ma tell
her to come get me,

00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:20.379
but I'ma give her
your new number."

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.881
He was like, "I'm on my way,"

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.550
'cause they ain't want
her know that number.

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.051
So I said--I'm sitting there,
right?

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:27.553
So it's just me--

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.054
this is when it's just me
and Rock sitting there.

00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:31.557
My dad came in in the worst
fucking robe ever.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.592
His robe is all raggedy.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.728
He got his curl all dried out.

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:37.797
And he going all, "What you
doing stealing anyway?

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.298
I work for the city."
But I don't know that,

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:40.599
'cause you don't pay
child support,

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:41.700
so I don't know you work
for the city.

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.035
I don't know where you work.

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.637
He's saying stuff I don't even
know.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.272
"I work for the city,
I work these hours."

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.807
I'm like, "I ain't know
none of this till right now."

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.475
So I'm sitting there
looking at him,

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:50.810
and my dad--my dad goes,
"Let's get out of here."

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.211
And he walks over to Rock
and says,

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:53.379
"Come on."
I said, "Nigga,

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.448
I'm your son."
He tried--

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.084
[laughs]

00:06:59.117 --> 00:07:00.453
And Rock tried to get up.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:01.620
I was like, "No, you wait on
your daddy

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:04.623
you don't know," right?

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:05.825
But I ended up leaving.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:07.593
The cool part is,
I had the shoes.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.929
So I walked outta there.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.597
And I cut the wire.
That's all right.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.399
There you go. All right.
And that's the story.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.733
Thank y'all for listening.

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.101
[cheers and applause]

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:18.771
- DeRay Davis, everybody.
