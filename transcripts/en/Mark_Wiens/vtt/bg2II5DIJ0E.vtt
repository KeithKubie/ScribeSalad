00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.160
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.993
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm in Karachi, which is a mega city

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.070
in Pakistan along the Arabian Sea.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.650
This city has some extreme
food, and food in the masses.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.680
And so, today I'm meeting up

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.197
with my friend Ali and Shahrooz,

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:17.290
and they're gonna take me on
a Karachi street food tour.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.920
We're gonna eat some
unbelievable Pakistani food.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600
This is going to be the ultimate

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.468
street food tour of Karachi.

00:00:23.468 --> 00:00:26.218
(rhythmic music)

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.340
We just arrived at the first air crowd.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.540
This place is called Javed Nihari.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.773
We're here to eat a very specialty.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.430
How are you this morning?

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.340
- It's called nihari.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.090
It's like a meat stew.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.050
It's so rich, and this
is one of the best places

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.233
in Karachi to eat it.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.440
There's a couple different
components to the dish.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.460
So, he first scoops on the meat,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.540
then he scoops on the thick, rich stew,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.623
and then some of the red
oil Desi Ghee on top.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270
Everything here is just
massive, and they have these,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.110
they're like podiums
where they cook the food,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.330
where they serve the nihadi,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.100
but then also the bread production.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.430
The star of the hill is the Sheebow,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.330
which is a type of bread
I've never seen before,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450
then the really interesting
part is when he takes it out,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.630
and then I think that's just
a panful of water and a brick.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.070
Just sprinkles it with water,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.380
and then this is the finished product.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.973
That's unique.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.850
We're all here.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.710
We're all ready.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.280
- This is fun.
- This is the crew

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.455
for the day.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:43.960
The Karachi street food tour,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.280
the ultimate street food tour.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.150
Let's tear into the bread first,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.260
and this is that special bread, pull,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.170
and, yeah, that's amazing.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.790
I've never seen water sprinkled on bread.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.350
Now, the nihari, this is the
signature with the bone marrow,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.537
with the meat, a little bit of ...

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:59.240
Oh, it's just ultra tender.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.390
Oh man, and you wanna kind
of balance a little bit of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.367
that stew along with that Desi Ghee.

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:10.367
Oh, wow.

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:16.360
Wow, you can feel the chilis in that,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.320
and then the bread, it is
almost like croissant style,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.590
like pastry dough, and then
the nihari has almost like a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.310
cinnamony-infused taste to it.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.920
You gotta sprinkle it
with ginger, fresh ginger,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.753
and fresh chili.

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:30.777
This is one of the joys of eating nihari.

00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:33.610
(rhythmic music)

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.290
With the lime, that gives
it that refreshing touch,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.123
and the fresh chilis.

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:42.360
That is a generous chunk of the cow brain.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.690
Oh, look at the creaminess of that.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.140
It looks like cottage cheese.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.210
You've got creaminess, on top of richness,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.130
on top of richness, on top of creaminess.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.390
It's so creamy.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.570
This is one of the hardiest breakfasts

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.595
you could possibly have in the world.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.428
(rhythmic music)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.710
That is not a dish you wanna eat every day

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.690
because it's so rich, but once in a while,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.370
that will just satisfy
you like nothing else.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.263
Thank you very much.

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:16.330
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.450
- One of the greatest things
about being a food lover

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.917
in Karachi is that it's such a mega city,

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.060
and it attracts people.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.360
People live here from all
over every single tiny region

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.600
of Pakistan, and so you'll
find food from every region

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.100
of Pakistan within Karachi.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.950
(rhythmic music)

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.325
Where are we heading next?

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:34.341
- [Ali] Burns Road.

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:35.174
- Burns Road?

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:36.250
Okay, and Burns Road is really known

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.316
for its extreme food, right?

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.899
(upbeat music)

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.110
We just made it to Burns Road,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.050
and it's kind of quiet
today I think because

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.700
it's a Sunday, but one
thing you'll notice,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.510
and one thing you'll love
about Karachi are the buses.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.070
They kind of look like
they're on their last leg.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.880
They've been well used,
but the decoration,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.360
they're so artistic.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.410
It's such a culture of the buses.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.210
It's so cool to see, and
as you just drive by,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.036
you can just see so
many different designs.

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:07.953
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.023
Okay.

00:04:10.023 --> 00:04:12.580
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.986
Oh, yeah, wow, this place is just bumping.

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:16.020
- Hey.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.853
- Hey, how are you?

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.020
- How are you?

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.423
Pay for travel, you're
on Google or YouTube?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.790
- This one is the Arabian Paratha,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.320
and yeah, it's similar
to things you'll find

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.300
all across this entire region.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.110
He flattens out the
dough, he fills it with

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.810
that mixture, and then
wraps it up into a pocket,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.050
and into the oil to fry.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.420
It's shallow fried.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.220
I love the one-handed egg
drop, and then he takes

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.610
the spatula, and just like
flattens it into the meat.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.940
So, he just cut it in four pieces.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.940
It's kind of like an entire
mint, chicken omelette

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.990
within the fry bread.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:52.356
Oh, it's hot.

00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.604
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:54.604 --> 00:04:55.910
Thank you.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.380
We didn't have any chairs
at first, but the kind guy

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.691
just brought a chair over.

00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:00.524
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:01.357
- [Shahrooz] Thank you, man.

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:02.730
Thank you very much.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.223
- Okay, convenient.

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:06.293
- [Ali] Did you taste?

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:08.120
- I'm getting literally like whole ...

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.190
It's how they leave the cumin
seeds whole, like, every now

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.260
and then, you get a whole
crunch of a cumin seed.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.933
It's so good.
- So interesting.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.670
This is actually quite Arabic,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.550
but it's very mild in spices.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.600
- [Mark] And he's serving tea, right?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.541
Nice.
- [Shahrooz] Out of a bucket.

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:32.662
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:34.912
(laughing)

00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:39.731
(rhythmic music)

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.330
- He is performing for us.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.103
He's just moving into the road to dance.

00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:48.853
(rhythmic music)

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.103
Wow, that is sweet.

00:06:00.442 --> 00:06:01.460
Thank you, man.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.293
Nice to meet you.

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:03.126
Thank you.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.823
- [Ali] This is Matka kulfi.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.208
- [Mark] Matka.
- [Ali] Kulfi.

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:08.790
- Matka Kulfi.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.570
Kulfi is like ice cream,
but then these are unique

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.880
because they're made and frozen

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.670
into little clay, little cones.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.320
I think I got the pistachio part.

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.873
Oh, wow, this actually is great.

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:27.848
- [Shahrooz] Is it the
cone in there again?

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:28.681
- [Ali] Yup.

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:33.430
- Like reduced-down, kind of
like homemade condensed cream.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.680
Let's trade, I gotta try that saffron.

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.760
Oh, wow, you can really taste the saffron.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.788
It does have a really
pronounced saffron taste to it.

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:47.020
That was really good
actually, a very unique

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.780
ice cream eating experience, Kulfi.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.960
The highlight is just eating it out

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.557
of the little clay cups, cones.

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:53.403
Rabri.
- Rabri.

00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:54.260
- The Rabri here.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.424
okay, there's another thing in
Karachi that we have to try.

00:06:56.424 --> 00:06:57.257
It's called Rabri.

00:06:57.257 --> 00:06:59.260
We're gonna order one here.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.390
It's all milk based.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.730
You can see kind of like some strands,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.730
kind of like some strands in it as well.

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.285
Oh, wow.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:13.013
It really has like a
condensed milk taste to it

00:07:13.013 --> 00:07:17.940
but, at the same time, has
almost like string cheese

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.170
in the middle of that like

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.840
condensed milk, yogurty sweetness.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.930
- Of course, I was
expecting it to be cold.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.540
It's like sweet curds.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.373
- Rabri Shireen.

00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:27.860
- Rabri Shireen.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.693
(rhythmic music)

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:34.863
That one is kind of like a sweet yogurt

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.940
with little jellies in it.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.450
We're just walking past,
and we just smelled it,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.990
and saw the giant copper pot.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.580
He's serving biryani, and we just decided

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.810
to get a small plate just to try.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.840
We're all just gonna sample it,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.423
but this is such a cool
place underneath a tree.

00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:54.048
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:54.048 --> 00:07:56.881
(rhythmic music)

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.533
And he conveniently has
some tables out here too.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.880
Just try that rice first.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.240
It's such a long grain,
such a fluffy rice,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.476
and what I can taste,

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:16.547
it tastes like it has a
dry lemon flavor to it.

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:19.570
What's really good to me about this

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.700
is that dry lemon flavor,
the aromatic foundation

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.790
of this biryani.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.130
And this is just such a cool spot.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.143
I mean, you see the big, copper metal pan,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.853
people are hanging around.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.773
This is a great spot.

00:08:33.773 --> 00:08:34.950
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.210
Very good.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.043
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:39.793
(rhythmic music)

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.079
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:50.912
Liaquatabad (speaking in foreign language)

00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:53.192
Okay, that's the name of this area.

00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:55.942
(rhythmic music)

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.930
This area is so congested,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.250
and there's so much action going on.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.070
I mean, it's one of those
areas where just everything

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.990
is exciting, and something

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.050
is fascinating everywhere you look,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.533
the energy, the excitement.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.220
Their shit's called Nali biryani.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.030
Now, Nali is the bone marrow in biryani.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.080
We already actually sampled
some biryani earlier

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.050
this morning, but this is Nali biryani,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.493
so it's bone marrow biryani.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.880
He just took like shovel
fulls of the bones,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.290
these are beef bones, and dumped them into

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.880
the spices which are already simmering.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.880
It just like shattered
into the giant pots.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.013
Wow, that smells unbelievably good.

00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:46.869
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.560
And now, that's just gonna simmer away

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.720
until the rice is fully cooked,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.070
and everything has mingled
together in the pot.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.190
So they're making the
biryani down the road,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.537
but then you walk down the road here,

00:10:07.537 --> 00:10:09.387
and this is where they're serving it.

00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:12.370
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.520
As he's dishing it out, with
every spoon that he grabs,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.570
he hits the spoon on the side of the pot.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.330
He hits the side of that pan so fast,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.010
like my eye cannot even follow it.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.280
I'm like trying to film,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.820
I mean, I'm looking in my
screen filming, and I cannot

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.690
actually follow him hitting
the spoon on the side.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.880
It's something to quickly mention

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.740
as they dish out our biryani.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.173
There are two spots.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.210
They both have, I believe,
started around the same time,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.430
but both serve the Nali biryani.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.887
The more well known spot is
actually across the street here,

00:10:41.887 --> 00:10:43.830
but they happen to be closed on Sunday,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.530
but then they built this
like indoor dining room,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.272
but this place, what's
this place called, Ali?

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:50.602
- [Ali] Mudri Biryani.

00:10:50.602 --> 00:10:51.501
- [Mark] Mudri Biryani.

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.334
- [Ali] Mudri Ali Biryani.

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:53.322
- I think they're serving our plate.

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:57.239
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.000
It's not even a plate, but
this is an entire metal saucer,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.750
but, wow, the heaviness (laughing).

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.610
Before we empty out the bone marrow,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.320
let's just try that
rice, that fragrant rice.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.480
You can see it's fluffy.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.327
There's chilis in here.

00:11:15.327 --> 00:11:19.157
We saw those chilis floating
around in the sauce.

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:21.407
(laughing)

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.124
Oh, the black pepper in there.

00:11:28.124 --> 00:11:29.930
That's the first spice that I notice.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.680
Hassam is gonna help us with the bones.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.630
Oh, there it comes.

00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:38.214
(rhythmic music)

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.420
- [Shahrooz] Dude, I can't
believe that actually works.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.830
- I'm just amazed at how
much marrow just came out.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.130
That just splattered all over the biryani,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.680
and they're still getting more.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.770
Just like pure, butter
whiteness just coming out

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.560
of that bone, and we still got one more.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.023
Okay, I gotta try it.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.751
It's just like dripping with oil.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:08.001
(laughing)

00:12:09.594 --> 00:12:10.427
- It works.

00:12:10.427 --> 00:12:11.530
- Like a worm just fell out.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.900
- Gotta hit it hard, man.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.000
- Gotta hit it harder?

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.630
Rice is kind of flying.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.590
I can hear pieces rattling in there.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.133
Oh, there it comes.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.180
My fist is getting sore, but I guarantee,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.580
this is one of the most fun meals

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.780
you will ever have in your life.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.130
I'm kind of like just
splattered in spice and rice.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.963
- [Ali] Wow.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.343
- More is coming out.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.492
He's looking at (laughing).

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:40.325
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:42.575
(laughing)

00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:45.240
And you can see the whole spices.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.950
There's cinnamon, and I noticed

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.580
the star anise in there too,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.250
but we gotta make a marrow
bite that counts next.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.150
Let's go in, guys.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:56.120
- [Shahrooz] Oh, hello.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.740
It's still so hot.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.860
- [Mark] It's so delicate.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.020
Marrow bite.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.853
- [Men] Cheers.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.022
- No way.

00:13:08.022 --> 00:13:10.272
(laughing)

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.490
- The marrow makes butter feel tough.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.980
That's how soft and melt
in your mouth it is,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.380
going from solid to liquid on your tongue.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.380
I need a marrow chunk bite on that bite.

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:25.252
(rhythmic music)

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.200
- Biryani is one of my
favorite, favorite dishes

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.040
in the world.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.700
That is easily the best.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.700
It cannot be described how
much flavor was in every bite.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.007
- [Mark] Ali, what did you think?

00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:42.020
- It was amazing, and I'm
not very regular with marrow,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.800
but I think marrow and biryani

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.909
make a perfect, lethal combination.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.680
- Very best food, biryani in the league.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.940
- It's blown me away.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.140
I have a renewed sense
of energy right now.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.110
We tried to pay.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.254
They would not accept payment.

00:13:55.254 --> 00:13:58.283
They wouldn't take money from
us, so they gave it to us.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.580
Huge thank you to this spot.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.750
That is amazing biryani that
will just blow your taste buds.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.163
Wipe the sweat and the marrow
coming out of my pores.

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:11.362
(laughing)
Oh man.

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:15.150
That was a game changer,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.594
a biryani game changer in Karachi.

00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:21.144
(rhythmic music)

00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:23.718
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:23.718 --> 00:14:25.062
Video.

00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:26.750
- You add this channel.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.980
- Yes, I will add it, I will add it.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.813
Great, nice to meet you.

00:14:29.813 --> 00:14:30.900
- [Young Man] Thank you very much.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.400
Thank you very much.

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:37.210
- We are all Pakistani,
left to all 20%, all people.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.043
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:38.930
- Very much.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.000
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.833
- Okay, see you.

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:42.690
- Awesome, really, have a great day.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.523
- Thank you.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.410
- So many friendly people,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.960
and we had to actually stop to ask around

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.060
because there's so many
alleys, you can get lost.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.010
It's a maze back here,

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.020
but the next dish is supposed

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.190
to be somewhere around the corner

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.254
that we're gonna try to find.

00:14:56.254 --> 00:14:58.738
(rhythmic music)

00:14:58.738 --> 00:15:00.210
- These are vegetable salad,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.160
and he puts masala on top of this.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.921
After having so much (speaking
in foreign language),

00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.754
and biryani--

00:15:04.754 --> 00:15:05.587
- [Mark] We need some vegetables.

00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:06.843
- [Ali] We need some vegetable.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.723
- And he is a master slicer.

00:15:12.568 --> 00:15:14.031
He chops up the cucumber.

00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.864
It's (chopping sound).

00:15:14.864 --> 00:15:18.540
He's a machine slicer,
just amazing, amazing

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.510
chopping skills, and what's
amazing is how he cuts the onion

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.800
in like a floral blooming shape.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.340
Street Karachi vegetable salad,

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.690
it felt like the right thing we should do

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.610
after eating that much
bone marrow in the morning.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.976
We need some vegetables.

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:36.726
(rhythmic music)

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.860
He has some of the most
amazing knife skills

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.150
I've every seen.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.380
That is what you call
a hand-chopped salad.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.580
One more thing I just noticed,
the vegetables are sitting

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.000
here on the cart, but
he's using a wind screen.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.910
This is a car wind screen,
piece of glass, a windshield

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.350
to hold the chopped
vegetables as the counter top.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.650
The countertop is a windshield.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.939
This is a first for me.

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:17.689
(rhythmic music)

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.430
okay, let's try some of this salad.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.453
The plate is in the cart.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.513
Quite a few people surrounding us,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.940
but let's try this salad.
- It's so awesome.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.013
- I got an onion and one of the cucumbers.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.790
The masala and the lime juice,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.123
and it is so incredibly fresh tasting.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.533
These carrots are almost red, so sweet.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.580
That combination of the
masala and the fresh squeeze

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.833
of lime, though, that's what makes it.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:56.666
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:57.499
Amazing.

00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:58.332
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:58.332 --> 00:17:00.620
That was one of the, by
far, the coolest salad ever,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.670
but what a man, what skills.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.600
Actually, we didn't even
make it to the right place.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.050
The place that we're going
to which serves fish katakat

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.140
is actually right next door here,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.606
and you can here the clanking of the pan.

00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:16.856
(sizzling)

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.390
But it's usually made
with a variety of meats,

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.440
and especially organs and brain,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.640
but this one is made with fish.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.970
The aromas, and the steams,
and the smoke just pouring

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.570
off of that gridle, and
then he makes a fresh batch,

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.440
serves it, like as soon as it's ready,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.540
he serves the entire thing
and starts the process again.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.063
Wow, this is next-level food.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.180
I think I got some chili smoke
to the eyes on that batch,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.110
but this is the stall, this is the place,

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.560
and then across the street,
they have a seating section.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.500
Hey.
- Hey, brother.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.650
- [Mark] Hey, how are you?
- How are you?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.540
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.
- I was just

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.683
watching your video in the morning,

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:18.730
and I was thinking how can I ...

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.040
you're not coming to Pakistan.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.218
- [Mark] Thank you very much.
- It was a surprise for me.

00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:23.318
- [Mark] Awesome to meet you.
- It's a complete surprise

00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:24.151
for me.

00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:24.984
- [Mark] Thank you, thank you.

00:18:24.984 --> 00:18:25.880
What is your name?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.121
- My name is Solmon, brother.

00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:28.280
- Alman.
- Solmon.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.113
- Solmon.
- Yes.

00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:30.140
- Great, very nice to meet you.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.580
- I was watching your
video in the morning.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.497
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.994
- We met the owner,
really threatening man.

00:18:41.994 --> 00:18:44.638
He's like one of a kind here too.

00:18:44.638 --> 00:18:46.630
He's the only one that
makes the fish Katakat.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.100
It's served with chapati, so
we'll just try the fish first

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.536
before we dig into the extra chutney.

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:55.369
(rhythmic music)

00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:00.970
Oh, wow.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.120
Oh, that's masterful because
the fish is deep fried,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.550
but then refried on the hot plate,

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.556
it has this like crunch around it.

00:19:07.556 --> 00:19:08.466
- Unbelievably good.

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:09.453
(laughing)

00:19:09.453 --> 00:19:11.910
- That's just like a
fish, spice-full mashup.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.730
Oh, look at that chutney, next bite.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.400
It looks like coriander and chilis,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.833
and you can smell the mint,
I believe, in there too.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.440
It's like full of herbs, actually.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.550
You think it's just pure chili,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.740
but it's actually full of herbs.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.593
We got a refill.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.040
The ultimate bite, fish,
then scoop up some onions

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.360
on top of that, extra
onions, and finally that

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.340
unbelievable chutney.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.227
That chutney, you could
drink it, it's so good.

00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:43.977
(rhythmic music)

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.150
And one more shout out to the
salad man across the street,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.160
so friendly, so genuine.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.890
His cart is right in front.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.277
He walked over here, and gave
us an entire plate of salad

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.530
just with a smile on his face,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.180
and just dropped it on our table,

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.707
and he has such fresh vegetables.

00:20:01.707 --> 00:20:04.457
(rhythmic music)

00:20:09.753 --> 00:20:10.750
I could not be happier.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.603
One of the greatest herb
chili sauces I've ever had.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.930
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.141
Chutney is amazing.

00:20:22.141 --> 00:20:24.912
(laughing)

00:20:24.912 --> 00:20:26.440
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.030
That dish just blew my
taste buds away again,

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.800
and that chutney, paired
with that chutney,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.193
you will not go wrong.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.440
Karachi is just exceeding, blowing away

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.200
my culinary expectations.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.210
Oh, first we're buying what?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.060
- We are buying Sherwanis.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.700
- Oh, yes.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.140
Okay, we're buying some clothes first.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.730
We're going shopping for clothes first,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.692
and then Ali has set up
something very unique.

00:20:52.692 --> 00:20:55.130
It's gonna involve some
livestock and some milk.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.880
(rhythmic music)

00:21:09.382 --> 00:21:12.132
(rhythmic music)

00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:19.860
Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.810
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.047
- [Store Owner] Come again,
and again, and again.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.920
- Start blogging, man.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.753
Start blogging.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.830
This may be one of the
greatest clothing investments

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.860
I have ever made in my life.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.530
I just feel like I'm floating.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.170
This has to be the most
comfortable outfit I've ever worn.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.040
It's so breezy and airy, and
this is exactly the outfit,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.526
the look we needed for the
next spot that we're going.

00:21:43.526 --> 00:21:46.276
(rhythmic music)

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.900
Step outside of the car and
just immediately the aroma,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.260
you can smell the buffaloes.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.341
This is Asia's biggest
colony of buffaloes.

00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:07.410
It's a colony because it's an entire city,

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.040
and basically, every house,
every home, every person here

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.620
deals in buffaloes, raises buffaloes,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.160
then this is where a lot
of the dairy comes from,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.060
and one of the reasons I
was so excited to come here

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.130
is because milk and dairy is so important.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.813
It's essential in Pakistan
and Pakistani food cuisine.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.370
Wow, I think we're gonna milk the buffalo.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.773
Thank you for inviting us.

00:22:32.168 --> 00:22:34.418
I just stepped in some poo.

00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:44.866
Wow.

00:22:45.771 --> 00:22:48.021
(laughing)

00:22:50.293 --> 00:22:51.924
He just sprayed me in the face.

00:22:51.924 --> 00:22:54.339
(laughing)

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:59.059
Wow, that is a new experience
I've never had before.

00:22:59.059 --> 00:22:59.892
(laughing)

00:22:59.892 --> 00:23:03.550
(rhythmic music)

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.383
In my ear.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.090
That milk is actually really good.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.610
That's as fresh as possible.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.677
That is a totally new experience.

00:23:10.677 --> 00:23:12.130
I have never had that kind

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.090
of culinary experience in my life.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.920
The milk is so sweet, actually.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.870
Thank you for that.

00:23:18.574 --> 00:23:20.090
- You really have to squeeze.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.110
- [Mark] Are you getting it?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.613
- Yeah, but they're squeezing hard, man.

00:23:28.313 --> 00:23:29.618
(laughing)

00:23:29.618 --> 00:23:31.830
Dude, it's so sweet.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.090
He's squeezing hard, and that's

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.350
such a technique.
- [Mark] I gotta try

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.303
squeezing it.

00:23:36.303 --> 00:23:37.183
- [Shahrooz] But it's so sweet.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.370
- [Mark] Oh, yeah.
- [Shahrooz] It's crazy.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.150
- Wow, just get a little trickle.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:43.983
It's really hard.

00:23:43.983 --> 00:23:46.240
You gotta squeeze, your forearms.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.930
That's the freshest milk mustache

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.530
you will ever have in your life.

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:51.627
- And the buffalo colony.

00:23:51.627 --> 00:23:54.490
(rhythmic music)

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.950
- We're gonna sit down here now in front

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.623
of the buffalo colony,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.540
kind of relax, and I
think we might try Mahal.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.373
They're bringing out some fruit,

00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:03.800
but I think we might try some butter.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.490
A quick banana in the meantime.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.330
I think that fresh milk was
even sweeter than the banana.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.324
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:12.157
This one is the fresh butter.

00:24:12.157 --> 00:24:13.583
- [Man In Background] Butter.
- [Mark] Butter.

00:24:13.583 --> 00:24:14.416
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:15.249
- [Men] Yogurt.

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:16.610
- Yogurt.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.210
Hook up some of the butter
in the chapati right now.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.643
That's just unprocessed, pure butter.

00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:30.200
(rhythmic music)

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.033
Wow.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.780
That is a mouthful of butter.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.293
It's so rich, but so pure tasting.

00:24:42.532 --> 00:24:44.170
Wow, wow.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.000
That is the best yogurt you'll ever have.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.170
It's sour, and that's it.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.100
There's also a vegetable dish,

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.280
which I think this is just a bonus.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.450
I don't think this includes dairy,

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.037
some kind of a local vegetable.

00:24:54.037 --> 00:24:57.090
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.923
Thank you.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.268
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:02.268 --> 00:25:03.351
It's so good.

00:25:04.195 --> 00:25:07.112
(group chattering)

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.893
It's rich and creamy, a little
bit of cardamon in there.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880
Thank you very much.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.732
Thank you.

00:25:16.732 --> 00:25:19.910
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.060
As we were leaving, they
informed us that within

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.060
this colony, there's 700 to 800
thousand cows and buffaloes.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.850
That's a magnificent amount,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.330
but what's amazing is that
it's right within Karachi.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.840
It's an entire colony, and
that it's so decentralized

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.410
because every family just owns an amount,

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.370
and has a little dairy farm.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.410
Huge thank you to Mr. Shakir
for showing us around,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.819
and to Ali for setting it up.

00:25:48.819 --> 00:25:50.610
(rhythmic music)

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.300
We experienced an ultimate
Karachi traffic jam.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.580
It took three hours.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.960
We were stuck in a traffic
jam for three hours

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.920
it took to drive here.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.060
It's called Dua Restaurant.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.733
It's like a football-field
sized seating area.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.710
They have a massive barbecue section,

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.430
and a massive Karachi station,
but this entire restaurant

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.273
is going up in a billow of smoke and fire.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.770
What an atmosphere.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.930
There are just cooking meat

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.663
for the entire sports field in the front.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.305
Wow, what a spot.

00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:30.222
(speaking in foreign language)

00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:51.560
This is one of the most
impressive assembly-line

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.780
cooking stations I have ever seen.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.853
They are just flying on the Karachis,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.860
just like bubbling like
a lava, curry sensation

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.163
in the Karachi, and that
goes straight to your table.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.290
The mixed grill has just arrived,
and I just have to pick up

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.850
this platter for you
to fully appreciate it.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.621
It is like the size of a baby carriage.

00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:17.680
(laughing)

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.050
Look at this.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.810
This one is the Fran
Karachi, so I'm gonna start

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.510
with this since it's right in front of me.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.980
You can just see the little prawns,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.613
the Desi Ghee on top of
the chilis, and the ginger.

00:27:36.962 --> 00:27:39.958
(laughing)

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.720
Oh, wow.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.113
Oh, it's so spice-ish.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.310
You can taste all of the
dried spices in there,

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:52.140
the cumin, the chilis, the
little prawns, the ginger.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.200
We were just talking, there's no recipes.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.251
I mean, they have a
recipe, but no measurement.

00:27:56.251 --> 00:27:58.000
He literally just takes that spatula,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.090
and just like sprinkles in the spices,

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.480
and gets it perfect every single time.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.590
That knowledge, that experience, wow.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.670
That is masterful.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.507
Okay, next I gotta try the mutton Karachi,

00:28:12.507 --> 00:28:14.657
and the mutton Karachi
is very famous here.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.250
Unbelievable tender.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.557
You taste a little bit
of a tomato-y flavor,

00:28:20.557 --> 00:28:22.530
but they mashed up those
tomatoes inside of it.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.560
Again, the harmony of spices.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.393
It looks like kingfish.

00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:28.300
I believe it's kingfish grilled,

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.053
and they just grill it
over a raging hot fire.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.434
That dry spice blend,

00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:38.547
and just like grilled
until smoky perfection.

00:28:38.547 --> 00:28:41.297
(rhythmic music)

00:28:42.994 --> 00:28:45.301
(group chattering)

00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:46.134
Oh, yeah.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.240
Taste that with a tomato.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.503
Wow.

00:28:53.537 --> 00:28:55.204
The food here is just spectacular.

00:28:55.204 --> 00:28:57.954
(rhythmic music)

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.400
That is sensational.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.600
Again, I'm just blown away by Pakistan,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.900
the food culture, the people, and Karachi.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.950
Man, what a day it's been.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.700
Now, once you finish your
meal, and if you look around,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.070
there's people across the playing field

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.930
that are in the position,
but once you're finished

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.117
with your meal, I wouldn't
say it's mandatory,

00:29:25.117 --> 00:29:28.820
but, yes, it is mandatory
to get into the position

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.543
where you elbow down on the pillow,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.750
and this is my first time in the position

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.640
in the right clothes, in the right attire.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.860
This is one of the most
comfortable positions

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.330
after you eat that you will
ever have in your life.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.119
My good friend, Ali, knows that very well.

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:50.846
- That's my conditioned position.

00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:51.679
(laughing)

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.495
That's my default position.

00:29:53.495 --> 00:29:54.530
- [Mark] Default position.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.431
- Yeah.

00:29:55.431 --> 00:29:56.264
(laughing)

00:29:56.264 --> 00:29:57.097
I don't even have to make an effort.

00:29:57.097 --> 00:29:59.730
I actually automatically
go into this position.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.430
- Yeah, I saw him just kind
of slide into that position

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.899
after he took his last bite.

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:04.732
(laughing)

00:30:04.732 --> 00:30:06.930
And now you can actually
have a conversation, and just

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.110
socialize, and lay around
for the rest of the evening.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.590
It's been an action-packed day.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.000
It's already midnight right now.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.620
We've been eating since 8:30 a.m.,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.780
and an unbelievable day, incredible food.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.780
Karachi, you have been
very, very good to us.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.410
I wanna say a huge thank
you to Ali and Shahrooz

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.330
for showing me around Karachi,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.630
and thank you to Ali from
Landmark Communications,

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.190
and Landmark Travel for
preparing everything,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.190
for organizing everything
for this Pakistan trip.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.330
It's been absolutely one of the most

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.503
rewarding trips of my entire life.
