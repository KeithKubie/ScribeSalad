LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.490
Today, I'm going to be chatting
with Fred Chung, whose job here

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.810
at Google is really
making your life easier.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.890
He's one that helps strategize
how we speak with developers,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.390
so that we can build
better products

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.429
and you can build better apps.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.720
I've been looking forward to
this day for quite awhile,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.000
actually.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.355
FRED CHUNG: Likewise.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:18.670
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Because it's always

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.480
good to speak with good
developer advocates.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.265
FRED CHUNG: And
thanks for the coffee.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:22.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
you're very welcome.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.266
It's good coffee, too.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:23.860
And it's real.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.895
So tell us about yourself, and
what brought you to Google,

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.020
and what you've been doing.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.185
And how'd you get to
what you do today?

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.393
FRED CHUNG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:34.557
A bit of background
information about myself.

00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:36.140
Before Google, I
used to be a software

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.479
engineer in the enterprise
integration space.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
you really wrote code.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.840
That's not marketing.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.881
FRED CHUNG: I wrote code.

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.050
[INAUDIBLE] works.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.040
And when I joined Google,
I was a sales engineer

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.980
working with
AdWords API clients,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.470
helping them integrate
with AdWords,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.285
using the AdWords API, which
is a SOAP-based technology.

00:00:57.285 --> 00:00:58.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
all remember SOAP, right?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.450
FRED CHUNG: Yeah,
we had a lot of fun.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.610
And then I moved to Android
as a developer advocate,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.860
back in the Android 2.0 days.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.941
LAURENCE MORONEY: 2.0.

00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.440
Wow.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.940
Way back.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.585
FRED CHUNG: Do you
remember the code name?

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:12.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Eclair.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.120
I never forget a dessert.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.420
FRED CHUNG: Absolutely.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080
We've made a lot of progress
both on the platform

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.390
and the app ecosystem front.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.080
I remember one of the first
presentation assignments

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.480
was to go to Barcelona, a
conference in Barcelona,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.170
and talk to the audience
about what is Android.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460
Back then, it was a relatively
new mobile operating system.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.800
We had to tell them that,
OK, it's got a camera.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.970
It's got a few sensors.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.460
We have a lot of fun back then.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.215
And since then, things
have evolved dramatically.

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.960
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Have come a long way.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.900
FRED CHUNG: Based
on what we've seen

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.880
developers have done
in the past few years,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.475
it's been amazing to see
the sophisticated apps that

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:56.100
are coming out.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.935
LAURENCE MORONEY: And also, with
the more sophisticated devices

00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.450
and the things that
they can do, consumers

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.600
are a lot more demanding
for new types of apps

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.452
and new, sophisticated
requirements

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:06.660
that developers have to meet.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.922
It's quite a challenge, right?

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:08.630
FRED CHUNG: Yeah.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.140
On Android, as you know, we
have not only film and tablets,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.560
we also have Android Wear
on your wrist, Android TV,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.770
and Android Auto
in your vehicles.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.500
So these things represent
a lot of new opportunities

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.320
for developers.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.162
And we're in an exciting time.

00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:26.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.400
Developers being able to
meet these new sophisticated

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.064
requirements need
a lot of support.

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.480
And I think that's where your
role comes in as a developer

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.020
platform manager.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.560
So as people are going on
to the Android platform

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.247
and going on to the
Google platform,

00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:40.330
they need to learn how to
do all these new things.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.788
And that's where
you fit in, right?

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.205
So tell us a little bit about
what a DPM actually does.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:47.880
FRED CHUNG: Yeah, DPM stands
for Developer Platform Manager.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390
Let's talk a little bit
about developer platform,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.030
what does it mean.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.300
If you look at Google, we offer
quite a few developer products

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.430
that allow third-party
developers to build

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.980
innovative solutions-- for
example, Google Maps API, which

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.530
allows mobile application
developers, Android, iOS,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.130
and web-based developers
to easily integrate maps

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.910
into their solutions.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.420
Or Google Play
Game Services that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.750
allow game developers to
build more engaging games,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.710
to give you-- spend
time with them.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
that common functionality,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.700
like high-score tables and
that kind of stuff, too.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.533
FRED CHUNG: Yeah, leader
boards, and quests,

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.340
and stuff like that.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.890
But the point is, we look at
the collection of API products

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.760
and platform and tools
as a developer platform.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.280
FRED CHUNG: And as a
developer platform manager,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.970
I work very closely with the
Android product and engineering

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.420
teams to help them figure out
the developer outreach strategy

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.560
for their products.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK,
so it's like you're

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.410
advocating on behalf of the
developer with our engineering

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.995
team, as well as vice versa.

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:53.920
FRED CHUNG: Yes.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.460
We actually see developer
advocacy as a two-way street.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.650
Not only do we want to
use relevant opportunities

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.790
to educate and
inspire developers

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.690
on certain new features,
best practices,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.420
and third-party
integrations, we also

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.080
want to use the opportunity
to listen to developers.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.990
In fact, we have multiple
channels available

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.089
both online and offline.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.320
So if we're online, in
the case of Android,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.669
we have +androiddevelopers
on Google+.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.835
LAURENCE MORONEY: And that's
a really big community.

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.980
FRED CHUNG: Yes,
with a lot of traffic

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.990
and activities on a daily basis.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.430
And that's very exciting.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.280
And in the offline
world, we also

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.610
work with Google
Developer groups.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.210
We partner with them from
time to time to run events.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.834
And that's a great avenue
for us to get feedback

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:43.500
from developers.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.458
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:46.752
So if developers out
there are watching this,

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:49.210
really want to give us feedback,
they can go to those ways.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.760
They can go to
the Android+ site.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.290
They can go to a Google
Developers group.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.870
We've got newsgroups,
that kind of thing.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.280
FRED CHUNG: That's right.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.402
And if you've built
interesting solutions,

00:04:56.402 --> 00:04:58.360
let us know through one
of these channels, too.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.169
We would love to learn
about the innovations.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: We always
hear about this thing

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.530
called developer experience.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.660
And a good developer
experience is very important.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.550
What is that to you?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.383
What is developer
experience, and what do we

00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:13.822
do at Google to provide a
great developer experience?

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:16.650
FRED CHUNG: Developer
experience is a very broad area.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.410
And in particular, we care
about things such as API design.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.290
We want to make sure the
design that goes into the API

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.940
makes sense to developers.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.660
They have to conform
to certain semantics

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.750
that developers
are accustomed to.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.130
For example, we recently
extended the notification APIs

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.540
in the support library,
to support not only phones

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.610
and tablets, but also Android
Auto and Android Wear,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.960
these new form factors.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.570
We want to make sure the design
conforms to certain standards.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.000
So that's why we have things
like car extender and wearable

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.990
extenders in the
support library.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
we build a core API

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.322
but then are able to
extend that consistently,

00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:00.530
as new devices come on board.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.363
FRED CHUNG: Exactly.

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:04.570
And when it comes to
educating developers,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.900
we want to make sure that
we have adequate content,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.860
both on
developer.android.com, which

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.790
is our official documentation
site that educates developers

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.012
the best practices and APIs
associated with features.

00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:20.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: And there
are some great samples on there

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.810
as well that folks can
download and dissect and learn

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.330
from that.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.038
FRED CHUNG: Yeah.

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:27.940
We want to build educational
samples that help developers

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.600
appreciate certain features.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.135
And also, we want to
highlight best practices.

00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:35.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: We spoke
a little bit earlier about

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.870
how new sophisticated
requirements are coming online.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.850
What is it that makes
development difficult nowadays?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.085
What are the challenges
that developers may face?

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:46.900
FRED CHUNG: Getting the
user experience right

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.760
is an important thing that
developers need to be aware of.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.660
And I think that's
one of the challenges

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.220
that developers these
days have to face.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.000
So for example, these
different screen sizes--

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.930
you don't necessarily want to
say you have an existing phone

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.490
app.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.390
You don't want to
shrink it to your watch.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.760
And likewise, you don't
want to just stretch it

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.960
on your big-screen TV.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.890
You really want to rethink
the user experience that go

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.360
on to these new form factors.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.420
If you have access to a
designer, work with them.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.450
And if you don't have
access to a designer,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.330
on our documentation
site, we have

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.090
some design-focused content.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.680
And we have also engineers and
design content on our YouTube

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.550
channels as well.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.875
And isn't it also within Android
Studio as you're building,

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:39.074
there are templates for the
different design form factors?

00:07:39.074 --> 00:07:39.740
FRED CHUNG: Yes.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.290
Let's talk about Android Studio.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.707
Android Studio is the de facto
IDE for Android developers.

00:07:43.707 --> 00:07:45.748
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
all love Android Studio.

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:47.040
FRED CHUNG: Yes, we do.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.470
So in Android
Studio, we have added

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.390
templates for new projects.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.730
So if you're in a process
of creating a new project,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.650
you can selectively add
additional capabilities.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.700
For example, you can add watch
support for Android Wear,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.320
Google Glass support
to your application.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.910
So the idea of this
is that developers

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.080
get to focus on
their core expertise

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.020
and let us work
on the boilerplate

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.929
by automating the
generation process.

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:15.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.610
And if the developer
experience is good,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.818
the consumer's experience
is going to be good, right?

00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:20.530
FRED CHUNG: Yes.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you've been
working as a developer platform

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.430
manager with Google for a while.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.230
And you've worked
with developers,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.790
and you see all these
great opportunities that

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.370
are out there for developers,
be it web, and cloud,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.780
and wearables, and mobile.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.360
And I'm sure it can be quite
confusing for developers

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.460
to be focused onto
where to get started

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.280
on the next great opportunity.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.520
What would your advice be?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.120
FRED CHUNG: I think mobile
platforms is definitely

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.100
one important area
that developers

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.880
should think really hard about.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.410
And when you look at mobile
applications, a lot of them

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.540
are actually powered by
some sort of cloud back end.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.530
So it would be good to look at
these two areas simultaneously.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
then also forgetting,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.450
while all this is going on,
there's also emerging markets.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.470
And cloud and mobile is
huge in emerging markets.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.520
So do you have advice
for developers thinking

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.340
about getting into
these emerging markets,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.370
looking for the next user base?

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.050
FRED CHUNG: So I
think emerging market

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.940
is in particular a
very interesting area,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.900
because consider how
users in emerging markets

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.180
are accessing the internet.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.490
They're using their phones and
tablets instead of desktops.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well, there's
also-- in emerging markets,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.630
they may be
accessing via phones.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.634
But there's potentially
disconnected scenarios.

00:09:37.634 --> 00:09:39.050
A lot of these
emerging companies,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.230
they don't have the same level
of network infrastructure

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.600
as maybe eastern Asia, or
western Europe, or United

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.680
States and Canada have.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.712
So there's unique challenges
for a developer building

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:50.670
for that kind of thing.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.420
FRED CHUNG: The
implication for developers

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.390
is that when you architect
your applications,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.790
you need to think
about these scenarios.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.450
You want to make sure that
your application maybe

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.760
support offline capabilities,
or make sure your applications

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.720
to perform efficiently
on a network,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.552
on the memory, and the CPU.

00:10:12.552 --> 00:10:13.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.360
And there's-- I understand
you've put together a lot

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.300
of material to help
developers with that,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.450
some DevBytes around that.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.800
So what were they called again?

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.540
I can't remember the--

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.920
FRED CHUNG: Yeah,
so the team has

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.035
put out a series of DevBytes
called Android Performance

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:27.535
Patterns.

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:29.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Performance
patterns, of course.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.810
Performance matters.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.434
FRED CHUNG: Performance
matters, right?

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.702
So always keep
performance in mind

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.535
when it comes to creating
your applications.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:37.743
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:41.520
So anything else that you'd like
to talk to developers about,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.860
or you'd like to hear
from other developers?

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.570
FRED CHUNG: If you think about
designing for a platform,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.580
designing for an API,
it is a hard task.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.820
It's difficult.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.390
And it's hard to get it
right on your first try.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we want
to get it right for developers.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.031
FRED CHUNG: And admittedly,
we don't get it right

00:10:58.031 --> 00:10:58.670
all the time.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.200
And that's why we want
to listen to developers.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.100
We actually see advocacy
as a two-way street.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.160
Not only do we want
to educate developers

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.280
on certain best
practices, but we also

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.560
want to use the opportunities
to learn from developers--

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.420
their pain points, their
difficulties, their challenges,

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.710
their improvement
suggestions on the product.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.070
And then a big
part of what we do

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.500
is to work with internal teams,
product, and engineering teams,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.760
to provide the feedback that we
hear from developers so that we

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.050
can improve the products.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've
learned so much, Fred.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.140
Thanks.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.790
And it's been great to
hear about how Google

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.800
is a two-way street in advocacy
and how we're listening

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.670
to feedback from developers.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.926
And developers, please
take advantage of that.

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:42.550
All the avenues that
Fred has mentioned

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.340
are in the description below.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.320
They'll also be right at
the end of this video.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.600
We'd love to hear from you.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.560
We want to build
better APIs, and we

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.470
want to build a better
platform that will

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.179
allow you to build better apps.

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.470
Thanks for watching this far
in this episode of "Coffee

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.294
with a Googler."

00:11:56.294 --> 00:11:58.210
And thanks most of all
for Fred for being here

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.370
and being our
special guest today.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.161
FRED CHUNG: Thanks for
having me, Laurence.

00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:04.160
