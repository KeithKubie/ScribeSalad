00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.860
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.000
So here's the box score from
the celebration on Monday.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.012
Class average improved
considerably.

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:32.530
A number of people moved
from the sad face

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.060
to the smiley face.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.630
I would still tell anybody who
is down over here that the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.850
final exam is coming, and if you
perform well on the final

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670
exam, we'll take a look
at the overall

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.920
performance of the semester.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.020
So get in and talk to us, if
you want to, to see what we

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.300
can do to help you
succeed here.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.790
But it takes a little bit of
effort on your part as well.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.980
I think that's all
I want to say.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.620
There will be a weekly test, a
weekly minor celebration on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.210
Tuesday, as normal.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.280
So today we're going to start
the last of two units.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030
We have two units left before
the end of the semester.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.860
And this one is biochemistry.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.310
And it's one of these
integrative topics that's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280
going to bring together a lot
of the material that we've

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850
looked at in the past.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.690
And biochemistry overview, it's
the chemistry of living

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.740
organisms. And the first thing
to point out is that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.630
biochemistry is governed by the
same laws that apply to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.720
inanimate matter.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.290
And apropos of that, I'd like
to read something that was

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.500
written by the Nobel Prize
winner, Richard Feynman.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.590
"If in some cataclysm, all of
scientific knowledge were to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.260
be destroyed, and only one
sentence passed on to the next

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.960
generations of creatures, what
statement would contain the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
most information in
the fewest words?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.900
I believe that it is the atomic
hypothesis, or the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.300
atomic factor, whatever you
wish to call it, that all

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.290
things are made of atoms. Little
particles that move

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.780
around in perpetual motion,
attracting each other when

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.450
they are a little distance
apart, but repelling upon

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.680
being squeezed into
one another."

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.670
So that's the first thing
to point out.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030
That it's the same chemistry
that we've been

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.250
learning up until now.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.910
And in fact, I think I've got a
a slide that captures the--

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.920
there's the Feynman quote,
the last part of it.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.940
Second thing is, by way of
introduction, you see a boom

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.090
around us today in biotech.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.800
And what is the biotech?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.750
It's the molecular biology, it's
the commercialization of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.950
molecular biology.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.220
Biology, when I was your age,
was classification, taxonomy,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.160
naming things and figuring out
what bin they fit into.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.770
Today it's not that.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.250
It's molecular biology.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.820
Well, what's the molecular
science?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.940
Molecular science is chemistry,
and it's solid

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.870
state chemistry.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.110
Biology is solid state
chemistry.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.610
We are solid state devices made
of soft matter with an

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.830
endoskeleton that's ceramic,
and so on.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.610
But we are solid
state devices.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.710
So this is solid state chemistry
and material

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.210
science, and that's why we
talk about it in 3.091.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.870
And why now?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.060
Why is the biochem revolution
only now?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.140
Well, it has to do
with complexity.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.170
You can think about complexity
from the standpoint of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.690
materials, and in fact, lay
out the ages of man.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.880
The Stone Age.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520
The Stone Age precedes
the Bronze Age.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.270
Why?

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.170
Because stone is found
in nature naturally.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.070
To use stone requires only to
cut it and change its shape.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.700
But you make bronze, you have
to engage in chemical

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.890
processing.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.550
There's a chemical conversion
that requires a higher level

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.990
of societal sophistication.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.690
And then iron follows bronze.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.990
Why?

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.720
Because iron melts at a higher
temperature, so you have to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.310
have a higher level of
technology in order to make

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.840
the furnaces and to conduct
the reduction reaction to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.600
extract iron.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.390
And then comes polymers.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.240
Polymers, the birth of
synthetics, come when?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.650
First polymers were around,
what, 1829, when the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.960
pharmacist was playing
with the styrene.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.350
And then it explodes in
the 20th century.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.900
And then mid-century
we get silicon.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.360
And silicon is even more
sophisticated, because we had

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.220
to understand quantum mechanics
to even understand

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.470
that we needed silicon.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.080
We could convert beach sand into
silicon back in 1500, but

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.140
who knew what to do with
silicon in 1500?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.510
And then finally comes the end
of the 20th century, and now

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.200
we're dealing with this stuff.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.930
So that sort of puts things
in perspective.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.290
So what we're going to do today
is start the treatment

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.480
of biomolecules.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.110
And the first thing I want to
say, is we're going to be

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.080
talking about macromolecules
but not polymers.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.690
So all polymers are
macromolecules, but all

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.790
macromolecules are
not polymers.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.910
What's the difference?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.910
In polymers, we have a common
repeat unit, whereas in the

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.250
life sciences, Mother
Nature is a polymer

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.110
engineer gone wild.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.160
She takes different functional
groups and puts them at every

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.850
stage along the way, as opposed
to polyethylene, where

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.990
it is the same functional
group at every stop.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.600
So it is exploded polymer
chemistry,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.170
macromolecular chemistry.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.560
So there's four classifications
of

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.430
biomolecules.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.790
The proteins, carbohydrates,
lipids, nucleic acids.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.370
And we're going to look
at three of the four.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.180
We'll start today
with proteins.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.450
We will study lipids and nucleic
acids, but in the time

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.200
allowed, we're going
to lose the sugars.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.330
So you'll take 7.012 or
something to satisfy the

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.980
Institute biology requirement,
you'll go much

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.110
more deeply into it.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.850
But I think you're going to
have very good preparation

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.170
after three lectures here, and
you'll be able to put together

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.870
a lot of the material that
we've looked at prior.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.220
So the first thing we're going
to look at is proteins.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.290
Proteins are macromolecules,
and they're formed by

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.600
polymerization of monomers
known as amino acids.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.760
So before we can talk about
proteins, we're going to first

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.230
look at amino acids.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.140
So let's do that.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.020
And amino acids are substances
that have the following

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.120
skeletal structure.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.970
I'm going to start a
new board for this.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.330
So this is the basic skeletal
structure of the amino acid.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.790
It's got a central carbon,
sp3 hybridized with

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.580
four struts on it.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.830
Down in the lower left corner,
we have the amino group, which

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.006
is nitrogen and two hydrogens.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.400
So there's one, two, three bonds
off the nitrogen, and I

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.380
want to emphasize but it's still
got this unpaired set of

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.630
electrons, which we know makes
this thing a Bronsted base.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.040
And it's going to have a site
here for proton attachment.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.650
And that's a big feature
here in amino acids.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.450
So this is the amino group.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.195
And it acts as a
Bronsted base.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.140
So it's a proton attachment
site.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.090
Second strut is hydrogen
in every amino acid.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.410
The third site, over here, is
the carboxylic acid end, and

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.830
that's carbon with a double
bond, and one, two, three,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.710
four, all right?

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.840
Every carbon needs four
struts, and the

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.600
fourth one has the OH.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.530
And this is the H that
can fall off.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.720
So this is the proton
donor here.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.580
This is carboxylic acid end.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.490
So this is three of the four
ends of the carbon bonds are

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.400
fixed in all amino acids.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.990
And then the fourth one is
free to be specified.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.160
This is all R.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.950
R is a placeholder.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.320
It stands for the substituent.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.200
This is the substituent.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.450
And this is nature's choice.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.350
So you can put anything here.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.560
There are hundreds
of amino acids.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.480
There are only 20
seen in protein.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.120
But anything that goes up here,
with this structure, is

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.890
an amino acid.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:36.970
I don't care.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.120
You could put a cyanide up
here, for all I care.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.740
It'll still qualify as a amino
acid if these other three

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.610
sites are filled in the
following matter.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:53.160
So 20 seen in amino acids.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.000
20 of those in amino acids.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.340
And now I want to look at the
substituents and break those

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.940
into categories.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.900
So there's four categories
of substituents.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.150
In other words, the 20 here
can be broken into four

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.400
categories.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.150
Four categories of R.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.000
And we can group those by their
chemical properties.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.850
The first group, I took this
from one of the other texts.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.210
Yeah, this is from one
of the other texts.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.210
So there's the 20 amino acids.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.030
So I'm now highlighting some of
the ones that are nonpolar.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.440
So what do you see there?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.080
The nonpolar ones,
you see for R.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.140
The R group is above here.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.350
so?

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.790
This is just plain hydrogen,
which is nonpolar There's a

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.410
methyl group, CH3, so
that's alanine.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.770
Here's a methylene with two
methyls, so this is alanine,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.300
and so on and so forth.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.250
So the different groups
hang off that R

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.610
position at the top.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.450
So these are nonpolar, and this
also is characterized by

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.480
being hydrophobic.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.490
So that end becomes hydrophobic
when we use

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.990
nonpolar group.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:12.140
The second option is to have
polar substituents.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.505
And some of them even have
hydrogen bonding capability.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.680
That's the second category.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.740
And of course those are going
to be hydrophilic.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.650
The third group is charged.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:42.350
The third group actually has a
charge end, which becomes a

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.120
negative ion in aqueous
solution.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.210
And these are going to be
strongly hydrophilic.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.360
And also--

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.610
[BREAK IN VIDEO]

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.900
PROFESSOR: Number nine, number
nine, number nine.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.310
Can you hear?

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.930
Yes?

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.620
Yeah, that's good.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.505
Hydrophilic and acidic.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.600
The acoustics here today are
very different, huh?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.290
We're missing a few bodies.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.960
We need to put the crash test
dummies in here, and then

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.030
we'll have the same
acoustic sound.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.370
All right.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.840
And then the fourth category
gives you a cation, R plus, in

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.390
aqueous solution, which
then, strongly

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.540
hydrophilic and basic.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.350
So we'll go through.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.250
Now, our bodies can synthesize
only 10 of the 20 amino acids,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.740
and then the other 10 we
have to get from diets.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.770
So when you look at some of
these fad diets, you might

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.700
want to check and make sure
you're getting all of the

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.080
proper nutrients.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.530
Now another of the structural
features of amino acids that's

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.570
important is chirality.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.520
Chirality is a feature
of amino acids.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.320
And what is chirality?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.680
I'll show you by
way of example.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.220
Chirality talks about
handedness.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.750
Comes from the Greek
word for glove.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:31.210
So let me show you molecules
that have the chirality that

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.730
distinguishes them.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.070
So I'm going to give an
example with alanine.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.020
With alanine, the R-substituent
group is equal

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.910
to the methyl, CH3.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.250
So I'm going to put CH3 up here
for the substituent, and

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.550
then the other three stations
are as we know them to be.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.520
So there's the amino group,
there's the hydrogen, and

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.370
here's the carboxylic acid.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.210
And note, look at the compact
notation here.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.110
We write COOH.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.300
This O is not bonded to
the O next to it.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.230
Both O's are bonded to
the carbon, but this

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.110
is compressed notation.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.420
COOH, and then this.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.060
So this is alanine, and I could
just as easily write the

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.240
molecule in the following
manner.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.110
I would still satisfy the
requirement that I have an

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:24.810
amino group, a hydrogen group,
a carboxylic acid group.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.800
Actually, if I want to get
really fancy in chemistry, I

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.650
could write it this way.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.760
COOH, and everybody knows H
can't bond to two species.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.130
In fact, it's the carbon here.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.130
But it's OK.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.940
It's compressed and in the
methyl group up here.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.000
And what you notice is that the
molecule on the left is

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.800
distinguishable from the
molecule on the right.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.860
These are not the same molecule,
even though the same

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.850
substituents are here, and the
other features are preserved.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.610
This cannot be superimposed.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.940
So you could distinguish
these two.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.000
If I just threw them on the
floor, you'd be able to pick

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.950
them up and say, one has
the amino group in this

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.890
orientation, and if I put the
other one, with the methyl

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.790
above and the hydrogen below, I
will have the amino group on

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.090
the other side.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.990
And these things also are
optically active.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.650
And through their optical
activity, we

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.690
give them their names.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.620
And so let's take a look here.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.250
All right.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.050
This is just a little bit
more of the amino acids.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.070
And actually, one of our former
3.091 TAs, Andrew

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.740
Magyar, who just defended
his PhD thesis.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.100
I was on his committee, and he
did a splendid job, and used

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.000
his 3.091 principles to get
through his advanced biology.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.300
This is a list which is going
to be part of the PDF that

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.380
I'll post. But there are 20
amino acids, and as you know,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.750
there are 26 letters in the
alphabet we use in English.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.520
And so if you want to write them
in compressed form, you

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.250
just use one of these letters.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.190
There's the three-letter
notation as

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.250
well, so ALA is alanine.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.230
And in the past, I used to have
contests in 3.091 to ask

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.190
students to give me the
airports, if these were

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.570
three-letter airport codes.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.300
You see, it always comes around
Thanksgiving, and

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.660
people are busy heading to--

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.950
and it turns out that 19 of
the 20 amino acids have

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.240
airport codes that correspond to
the amino acid three-letter

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.720
abbreviations, with the
exception of glutamine, GLN.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.750
There's no airport that
has GLN as its thing.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.890
That's a piece of trivia that
will get you the last wedge in

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.710
Trivial Pursuit.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.970
And then this is the one-letter
abbreviation.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.100
So Andrew has put them
in this form.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.690
So there again, I have the
basic, the acidic, the

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.550
aliphatic are the ones
that are nonpolar.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.260
And this is another
way to look at it.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.290
And here's the base structure,
and here's the whole thing in

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.540
monochrome.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:44.900
All right.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.030
So that's part of the thing.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.260
OK.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.760
So here's what I'm
talking about.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.040
The mirror plane.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.250
So this box can be mirrored
as shown.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.310
But as soon as you put a
distinguishing mark in the

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.220
lower right-hand corner here,
the box on the left is not

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.730
superimposable to the
box on the right.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.610
They are distinguishable.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.350
And so these things will
have different chemical

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.440
reactivities, not melting point
boiling point, but how

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.880
they react with other
molecules.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.460
So here's the chirologics.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.110
Your gloves are chiral.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.590
If you try to put your
right-handed glove on your

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.570
left hand, it's a poor
fit, whereas the

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.800
flask here is achiral.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.840
And now here are some molecules,
just to show you

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.300
how this translates
into chemistry.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.500
So this molecule is chiral, this
molecule is not chiral.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.310
And it has to do with the number
of positions that are

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.560
distinguishable.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.880
And how does this fit into the
grand scheme of things?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.660
It's sort of a form of
stereoisomerism, isn't it?

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.140
Remember, we looked at the
geometric isomers.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.440
Here's an example.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.730
This is dichloroethylene.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.890
We looked at butene.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.030
But here we've got cis-isomer,
here we've got the

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.750
trans-isomer, where the
chlorines are on opposite

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.990
sides of the double bond here.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.610
They're on the same side of
the double bond here.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.170
These are types of
optical isomers.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.970
These are the mirror images,
the same functional groups,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.560
but in this case, in one
orientation, the plus

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.390
enantiomer, here's the
minus enantiomer.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.630
They're called enantiomers
because it comes from the

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.970
Greek word for mirror.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.350
So we're using the Greek word
for glove and the Greek word

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.710
for mirror.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.820
Now we'll talk about the optical
activity, and then

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.660
we'll take a few notes.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.520
So what's the optical
activity?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.800
It turns out that if you put
these in aqueous solution,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.840
they will cause the
polarization

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.260
vector of light to rotate.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.730
So here's a cartoon that shows
a light source with

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.340
unpolarized light, and then
the light goes through a

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.670
polarizer, which then
forces only

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.420
vertically polarized light.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.590
In other words, the electric
factor is in the vertical

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.630
orientation.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:01.320
And so now this electric
vector enters this tube

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.300
containing an aqueous solution
of something

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.310
that has optical activity.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:13.280
And the degree of rotation is
proportional, obviously, to

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.220
the concentration of the chiral
species, and also the

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:16.960
path length.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.860
So if you have a dilute solution
on a long path, or a

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.640
concentrated solution on a short
path, it's the number of

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.650
collisions.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.730
And ultimately, you have a
degree of rotation, et cetera.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.380
And so based on how the electric
vector changes is how

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.090
we got the names for the various
enantiomers, because

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.220
we've got to name
them somehow.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.550
Otherwise we can't distinguish
one from the other.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.140
So it turns out that the way
I've drawn this one, with the

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.680
amino group in the lower right,
and the carboxylic acid

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.990
group in the lower left, causes
the electric vector to

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.310
rotate clockwise.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.450
So I'm going to write h nu, just
so that you know, or if

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.470
you want to put the electric
vector or something.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.650
It rotates page to the right,
and so the Latin word for

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.700
right is dexter.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.400
So this is called
dextrorotatory.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.290
This is the dextrorotatory
enantiomer.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.410
So now you've got really nice
terminology to use at the

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.170
table over the Thanksgiving
turkey, all right?

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.640
So this is the D-form, D-circle,
or, as every

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.320
right-handed person knows when
speaking to a left-handed

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.290
person, this is the positive
direction, OK?

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.930
And now this one causes
an anti-clockwise, or

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.070
counterclockwise rotation
of light in an

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.970
aqueous solution of this.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.010
And rather than use sinister,
which is the Latin word for

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.220
left, and it has all these
negative connotations, they

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.345
went to the Slavic, and
shows levorotatory.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:52.040
So this is levorotatory, L-form,
or minus N, with

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.370
apologies to the left-handed
people in the audience.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.870
That's what it's called.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.130
OK.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.900
So these are called enantiomers,
and hence, you

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.510
understand the choice
of Man in the Mirror

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.350
for the opening music.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.200
So 19 of the 20 amino
acids are chiral.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.860
The only one that's non-chiral,
the only

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.910
non-chiral amino acid,
is glycine.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:22.820
Glycine has hydrogen
as a substituent.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.070
So now you have hydrogens above
and below, an amino acid

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.730
here, and carboxylic
acid here.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.130
And this one is achiral.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.120
This is achiral.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.300
So the other 19 so that's 95%
of the amino acids, are

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.920
chiral, and they exhibit this
interesting behavior.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.220
Now the other interesting
piece is that only the

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.200
L-enantiomer--

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.680
by and large, there a few
exceptions that you can find.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.710
There's some research
on this, trying to

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.240
find, always the exception.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.040
But by and large, only the
L-enantiomer of amino acids

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.650
are found in proteins.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.920
So there's no preference in
nature for synthesizing one

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.440
over the other, but somehow,
somewhere, a long time ago,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.950
there was a preference given
to the L-enantiomer.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:13.740
And so all of us have the
L-enantiomer present in the

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.560
proteins in our bodies.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.570
So I'm going to say only, but
you know that there's always

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.780
going to be some
exception here.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.980
But by and large, only the
L-enantiomer of amino acids

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.230
found in proteins.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.650
And you're going to see the
protein synthesis in a moment,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.720
and try to figure out
why that happened.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.740
By the way, carbohydrates,
which we're not

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.990
going to talk about--

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.280
carbohydrates are
chiral as well.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:56.480
And in sugars, only the
D-enantiomer of amino acids

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.960
found in sugars.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.660
And you'll see later, this is
all important in terms of a

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.680
lock and key mechanism.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.070
And there are some L-sugars.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.470
L-sugars you know as
invert sugars.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.330
And our bodies don't recognize
invert sugars.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.760
Our body apparatus requires
that there be D-sugars.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.230
There's some science fiction
novella I read many years ago

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.950
about this group of people
that's marooned on the

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.260
proverbial desert island, and
it's lush with vegetation, and

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.090
they're eating all of these
fruits and vegetables and

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.420
wasting away.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.890
And at the end of the novel, it
comes to be known that this

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.910
island, because it was isolated,
somehow, back in

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:49.000
time, the plant life there had
the opposite enantiomer, and

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.630
so their biological apparatus
didn't recognize anything.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.160
They were eating all this stuff,
and it was just going

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.800
right through them with
no nutrient value.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.170
So if you're ever
marooned, check!

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.050
Find out which enantiomer
you're eating!

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.480
Otherwise you're wasting
your time.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.380
Honey has the L-sugar, because
bees have a different

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.530
biological apparatus.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.720
Now, when we synthesize these
things chemically, we can get

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.260
both enantiomers coming out of
the synthetic apparatus unless

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.500
we take pains not to.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:32.700
And so when both enantiomers
are present, we call that

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.420
specimen, that's term racemic.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.090
So you have both the
dextrorotatory and

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.190
levorotatory present.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.570
Now, normally we take the five
minutes at the end to talk

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:47.460
about chemistry in the world
around us, but this is, you

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:53.090
know, day before Thanksgiving
holiday, and we've got a

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.770
natural entry point here.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.770
I want to talk about what the
consequence here is for human

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.770
health that drives directly
from chirality.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.240
About 40 years ago, there was
a drug developed in Europe

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.900
called thalidomide.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.060
And it was developed by a German
firm called Chemie

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.310
Gruenenthal.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.690
If I can just spell it.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.240
And it was developed as
an anticonvulsant.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.950
And it was a sedative, and it
had fantastic properties.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:36.050
Namely, that it was something
that you could use in

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.430
treatment of people who are
very depressive, but they

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.330
couldn't kill themselves
with this.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.940
If you tried to overdose with
thalidomide, you would simply

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.230
go into a sleep, and then
you could be rescued

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.650
Well, that was its original
intention.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.570
Just by accident, it was
discovered by various people

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.460
who were using it that it was
a very fine palliative for

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.670
morning sickness.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.490
And so women started using it
in the first trimester of

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.080
their pregnancies in order to
calm their morning sickness.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.840
And so there were calls for the
importation of this drug

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.520
to the United States.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.980
And the FDA said no.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.980
And of course there was an
outcry from women's groups

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.920
that said, oh, the FDA is just
a bunch of men that are

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.140
insensitive to women's
health issues.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.440
Let's speed this stuff up,
let's get it over here.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.470
They're using it in Europe.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.840
What are we doing?

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.490
It turns out that this was
during the time of President

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.580
John Kennedy, and he had
appointed the first woman

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.920
director of the FDA.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.890
And she said, it hasn't been
tested thoroughly.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.600
We're not importing it
to the United States.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.580
People got on airplanes,
they used post

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.710
office, what have you.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.040
They brought it into the United
States, and it was used

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.620
widely in the United States,
And then subsequently was

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.020
discovered that this is a
teratogen, which causes severe

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.450
mutation of the DNA,
and children

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.330
being born minus limbs.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.190
There were grotesque
deformities.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.690
And so the position of
the FDA was right.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.190
So you say, well, but didn't
they test this stuff?

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.400
And they did.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.530
Well, didn't they test
it on animal models?

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.160
And they did.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.470
Turns out the animal models
that they used lacked a

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.760
certain enzyme that's present
in our bodies, that converts

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.750
thalidomide downstream into
something that's a teratogen.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.750
It's a really, really
sad story.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:29.920
It turns out now, knowing what
we know, only one of the

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.540
enantiomers of thalidomide
causes birth defects.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.880
Not both.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.580
So racemic thalidomide was
loaded with both palliative

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.250
and toxic components.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.780
And so this is a powerful
lesson of getting the--

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:52.780
avoiding the toxic enantiomer.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.400
And also, there may be
people here who are

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.710
opposed to animal testing.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.530
And I understand
your concerns.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.120
But we're far from being able
to sit with the Shroedinger

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.650
equation and a supercomputer
and predict the metabolic

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:09.940
activity of these drugs.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.950
And so this is the dilemma
for people.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.180
Do you want to test it or not?

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.530
Do you want to get
these things--?

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.880
It's actually coming back now,
in the treatment of HIV-AIDS.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.820
It's being used as part of
a cocktail with other

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.760
medications.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.800
But now we know not to give the
racemic form, but only to

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.010
give a particular enantiomer.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.970
Another one that is a chiral
molecule is Ritalin, which is

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.840
used, among other things, for
the treatment of ADHD.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.420
And there are some negative
side effects

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.400
of the use of Ritalin.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.350
And again, it's being discovered
that it's only one

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.970
of the enantiomers that has
the negative side effects.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.740
And so the whole question of
chiral molecules is a very,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.690
very hot topic in chemical
research.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.380
And so, how do you how direct
the synthesis to get to one

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.550
enantiomer and not the other?

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.840
Catalysis.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.610
Again, which is something that
is very important and not very

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.580
well understood.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.700
Highly empirical, still.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.970
So all of those lessons
that we've

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.490
learned are very important.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.160
I think there's a cartoon here
that actually shows--

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.680
all right, so here's
the example.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.010
This is a molecule
that's chiral,

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.990
and it's very primitive.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.760
You've got a square and
a triangle and a

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.000
circle and so on.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.170
And you see, both of these
have the same chemical

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:20.990
properties.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.370
But when you're looking at this
in terms of biological

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.360
activity in the human body, you
can think about a lot of

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.930
these interactions
as lock and key.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.990
Now, there aren't these
little holes here.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.100
It's not putting a square peg
in a round hole versus what

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.070
are they really trying
to model here?

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.100
They're trying to model the
types of secondary reactions.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.470
So for example, there could be
a polar center here, and this

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.670
could be charged negatively,
and this could be charged

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.180
positively, and so they will
be attracted coulombically.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.250
Maybe this has a polar end,
and this has a dipole, and

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.450
they'll be attracted.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.690
Maybe this is nonpolar, and this
is nonpolar, so they all

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.930
fit, whereas if you turn it
around, you've got something

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.320
that's positively charged
here, and this thing's a

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.730
dipole, there's no adhesion.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.450
So that's where this
lock-and-key

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.610
idea comes into play.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.510
And so what we're going to do
later on is to figure out how

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.420
to match things up in terms of
dipole-dipole interactions,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.810
coulombic interactions,
and so forth.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.810
OK.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.160
So what are the properties
now?

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.300
Let's look at the properties
of these things as just

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.120
straight chemicals.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.840
So we had amino acid, I had the
solid neutral form of the

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.980
amino acid.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.230
What are its properties?

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.880
Not the protein.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.580
Properties of the amino acid.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:44.830
OK.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.922
So first of all, they are solids
at room temperature.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.720
And why would we do that?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.470
Well, because look.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.600
You've got hydrogen bonding
capability here, and that

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.830
hydrogen bonding capability
allows it to form bonds great

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.230
enough to overcome
thermal energy.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.920
Molecules like this, do you
think they form crystalline

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.840
solids or amorphous solids?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.340
They're small enough that--

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.770
this one looks a lot like
methane, doesn't it?

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.890
Looks like methane with a
couple of extra things.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.120
But from a distance,
it's a sphere.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.440
maybe A little bit oblate,
but it's a sphere.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.000
So these things form crystalline
solids as opposed

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.030
to amorphous solids.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.690
Their optical properties,
I've already shown you.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.940
They're colorless.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.260
They're not good absorbers.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.480
Where's the covalent bonds
with tight electrons?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.850
So there's no reason to have
excitation and color.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.590
And then, they're moderately
soluble in water.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.930
And that water chemistry
is what we're

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.690
going to turn to next.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.850
So now I want to look at how
they behave in water.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.660
And where I'm going with this
is to show you the first

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.610
stages of how we
animate matter.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.480
Because I talk about
inanimate matter.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.880
We are animate matter.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.760
Where does the animation
come from?

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.320
What's the chemical origin
of our animation?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.570
How is it that I can do this?

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.750
See, you're looking
at changes in the

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.080
conformation of a polymer.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.510
That's all you're doing.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.580
You're saying, well, how--

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.000
he's moving fast. What's
the Debye frequency?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.390
It's 10 trillion
times a second.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.510
10 trillion times a second the
atoms vibrate in my body, and

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.950
the speed at which I'm rotating
my hand, compared to

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:43.690
10 trillion times a second,
very slow, right?

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:48.250
Which actually explains why we
talk at the speed we do.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.270
And why is it that a human
being can only run--

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.820
or not only run, but runs at the
speed that he or she does?

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.690
It has to do with
the chemistry.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.430
With the Debye frequency, and
what the skeleton can do--

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.905
I mean, why aren't human
beings 40 feet tall?

00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:07.890
I mean, stand back here
and-- all right--

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.770
we're going to create
this universe.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.440
Why are we this tall, and
not 40 feet tall?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.090
Because make a skeleton 40 feet
tall would be chemically

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.320
very difficult.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.180
It's all chemistry.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.490
The rest, as we know,
is stamp collecting.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.310
OK, so now let's look at
the properties of the

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.430
amino acids and water.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.760
So I'm going to write them again
in a different form.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.500
So here I'm going
to put the H2N.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.150
Here's the amino acid N.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.040
Here's the central carbon.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.170
And I'm going to put the
hydrogen, instead of writing

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.520
it down here, this
is the carbon

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.990
with its little hydrogen.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.410
This is the carboxylic
acid N, and then the

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.070
substituent group is above.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.130
So this is again the thing.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.040
By the way, there are two
carbons here, agreed?

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.190
And the central carbon is also
known as the alpha-carbon.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.010
This is the alpha-carbon.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.800
That's the beta-carbon, I bet.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.140
All right.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.400
So now what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to dissolve this

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.510
in water at neutral pH.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.150
And what happens?

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:13.160
What happens is that once this
thing solvates, the proton

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.930
falls off the carboxylic end and
comes over and attaches to

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.530
that electron pair at
the amino acid end.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.150
And we end up with this,
at neutral pH.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:29.680
H3NCHCOO, and the substituent
is a spectator here.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.860
Well, I lost a proton, so this
is locally negative.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.000
And I gained a proton with
its charge over here.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.490
So this is locally positive.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.670
I conserve charge.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.010
This is not neutral and this is
not neutral, but it has a

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.010
negative end and a positive end,
and it's not a dipole.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.030
I mean, this is negative
ion-like and

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.270
this is positive ion-like.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:34:01.160
So let's say, net neutral
locally positive and negative.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.090
And just as we've fallen in
love with some German

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.790
terminology for words like
bremsstrahlung, we have a

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.460
German word for this one.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.910
This is like a twin ion, or it's
like a hermaphrodite dual

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:15.810
gender, so this is called
zwitterion.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.960
It's got both genders,
if you like.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.240
It's positive and negative.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.090
OK.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.600
So there's zwitterion.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.160
And this is the way
that we start to

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.800
introduce the dynamic behaviors.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.800
So now I'm going to show
you how to make

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.750
something come to life.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.680
So what we're going to do, is
we're going to show how this

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.020
zwitterion can respond to
changes in its environment.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.870
And we're going to invoke in
order to do is to say that to

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:54.496
impart animation, we invoke the
le Chatelier principle.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.030
It's sort of like Newton's
third law for chemistry.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.180
You know Newton's third law.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.220
Every action, there's
a reaction.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.620
So le Chatelier was a French
engineer, but his name is

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.070
associated with an important
chemical principle.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.460
And it basically says that if
you disturb a chemical system,

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.530
the chemical system will respond
in such a way as to

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.250
minimize the disturbance.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.910
So the example I'm going to give
is, I'm going to start

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.350
with a neutral pH, and I'm
going to change the pH.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.950
And then the zwitterion is going
to respond to minimize

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.730
the disturbance.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.560
In other words, if I drop the
pH, zwitterion is going to try

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.460
to raise the pH back to
what it was before.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.640
And in doing so, I think you're
going to start to see

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.260
how we can get animation.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.760
So it's sort of like that
a chemical disturbance--

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.490
this is the le Chatelier
principle.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:50.610
Chemical disturbance
is mitigated

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.745
by a chemical response.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.920
So here's the example that
we're going to use.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.320
We're going to say, let's
take something and

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.440
radically change the pH.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.230
So let's drop the pH.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.320
So drop a pH means, the
proton concentration

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.570
is going to go up.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.730
So how would zwitterion respond
if it wants to reduce

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.750
the proton concentration?

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.410
Well, it's going to try to
gobble up the protons.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.710
Well, how's it going
to do that?

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.400
Well, we know that there's
a proton attachment site.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.590
Look, there's a proton
attachment site at the

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.830
carboxylic acid end.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.310
How do we know?

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.410
Because it used to have
a proton there.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.090
So it's going to go and vacuum
up protons to try to bring the

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.120
pH back to what it was before.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.540
So let's look at
that reaction.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:48.120
So here's H3NCHCOO minus plus.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.170
So this is neutral zwitterion.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:54.410
And what it's going to do in
response to the increase in

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.910
proton concentration is try
to gobble these up.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:01.605
And the following
is the result.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:09.340
That proton is now going to
attach here, and cap that

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.360
negative end.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.840
So now we've got a proton on
this end, and we've added a

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.710
proton at the other end.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.380
So what's happened to the
neutrality of zwitterion?

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.340
It's lost!

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.190
Now zwitterion is net positive,
but we've started

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.300
gobbling up protons.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.410
So this reaction is called
protonation.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.950
And the reverse reaction
is deprotonation.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.270
And this is messy, all these
darn characters.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.480
So I'm going to write the
neutral zwitterion as just HA.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.810
There's the proton here,
and the rest of this

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.350
stuff is just details.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.360
So that's A.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:56.210
So HA plus H plus gives me this
thing here, which is HAH

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.270
plus there.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.650
Isn't that cleaner?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.940
That's a lot easier to read.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.640
And we can write an equilibrium

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.900
constant for that reaction.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.640
I'm going to call
this reaction 1.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.200
In reaction 1, I can write K1.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.630
And it's written, the convention
is that you always

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.840
write the reaction
constant for the

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.220
deprotonation reaction.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.860
So I'm going to write the
reaction constant for this

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.220
reaction from right to left.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.990
So that's going to be this.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:32.830
H plus over HA divided by
concentration of HA H plus.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.570
And then we're going to bring
Sorensen to the party, and

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:40.150
take logarithms, and make
it nice and clean.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.210
As we know, when Sorensen
enters the room, he

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.540
straightens things out.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.290
And so this will then become PK,
and if I take the log base

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.950
10 of this, I'm going to end up
with minus log base 10 of

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.070
H, which then will be PH.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.310
And then this flips over with
the minus sign, and becomes

00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:03.030
log base 10 of the ratio of
protonated zwitterion over

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.020
deprotonated zwitterion.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.920
And this is known as the

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.690
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.250
And what does it answer?

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.620
It answers the question, you
tell me what the pH of the

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.110
system is, and I'll tell you
what the ratio of protonated

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.920
to deprotonated is, because
the PK is the

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.760
function of the R group.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.230
So different R groups have
different PKAs, and they'll

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.480
respond differently.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.400
Some are very aggressive, and
some are not so aggressive.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.740
And look at what happens.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.800
At one end, when we have neutral
pH, we have all of the

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.600
zwitterions sitting here.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.940
And as we go to higher and
higher pH, more and more of

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.960
the neutral zwitterion converts
to the protonated

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.390
zwitterion.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:53.830
And in the extreme, when I've
got very, very high proton

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.220
concentration, I will protonate
all the zwitterion.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.700
I'll protonate it out
of existence.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.520
And the only amino acid that
exists is fully protonated.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.150
So I've got a sliding scale from
100% deprotonated to a

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.490
100% protonated.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.300
Well, somewhere along
this scale is 50-50.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.140
And what happens when I've got
equal amounts of protonated to

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.890
deprotonated?

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.520
That means the concentration
of protonated equals the

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.200
concentration of deprotonated.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.850
I have the log of 1, which is
0, and that's the pH at PK1.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.650
So now you see physically
what PK1 means.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.810
It's the pH at which you're
halfway in between, which

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.470
makes sense.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.000
If I wanted to characterize
something, it has values

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.360
between 0 and 100, I'd give you
the value at 50, and you

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.170
know, it varies around 50.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.760
Either 50 plus 50,
50 minus 50.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.010
So that's what the PK is.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.130
Good.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.600
Now let's do the same thing
for the opposite side.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.310
Let's, instead of a sudden drop
in pH, let's look at a

00:40:54.310 --> 00:41:01.190
sudden rise in pH.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.450
Now you see, just to
finish the point.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.070
Look at what happens here.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.750
What I'm trying to show you is
that this change in pH caused

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.070
this molecule to change.

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.130
you I mean, this could
be in your stomach.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.350
And now you drink some coffee,
or you drink some cola, and

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:25.210
the pH goes way, way down,
because you've drunk something

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.310
that's acidic.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.430
Well, there are functional
groups in the lining of your

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.580
stomach that are going to
now start protonating.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.440
And when they protonate, they're
going to change.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.830
This could have been bonding
to something, right?

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.490
COO minus could've been bonding
to some other molecule

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.860
that's locally plus.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.430
When the proton comes
in here and caps it,

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.210
that bond is broken!

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.230
And that's the beginning
of animation.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.900
So that when I drink something,
and all of a

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.170
sudden, my stomach
goes into action.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.660
Well, we're going to have
to process this stuff.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.520
Have to turn on some
switches here.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.450
It's not my brain
that's doing it!

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.360
It's not that the brain gets
all these sensor signals.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.800
We couldn't function that way.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.620
We're functioning just by these
things acting right

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.810
there at the site.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.920
This is the origin
of animation.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.090
I'm telling you that this
is the secret of life.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.490
I can't tell you the
meaning of life.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.520
You have to go somewhere else
to answer that question.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.470
But I can tell you where
life comes from.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.890
There it is.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.220
So now, sudden rise in pH, this
means that the proton

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.740
concentration goes way down.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.360
See, zwitterion is like one of
these friends you might have.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.510
Do you have any friends
that are, what do

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.350
you call them, rescuers?

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.810
You know, if they see anything
wrong, they're the ones that

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.980
get involved?

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.180
They've got to help
everything?

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.190
In the extreme, they're
quite meddlesome.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.690
Well, this is what zwitterion
is like.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.190
See, zwitterion sees a sudden
drop in pH and goes, I'm

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.340
zwitterion!

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.540
I can help!

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.000
I know what to do, because
I'm zwitterion!

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.310
I fix things!

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.840
And I'm conflict-averse,
I don't like this!

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.190
OK.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.640
Imagine you are zwitterion.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.610
So here's zwitterion, sitting
there, minding its own

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:09.890
business

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.170
[BREAK IN AUDIO]

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.040
PROFESSOR: --for a minute.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:11.300
Why?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.100
Because it's in a neutral
pH solution.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.410
Minding its own business.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.140
That's a chemical joke.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:17.510
All right.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.910
So there's zwitterion,
just sitting there,

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:19.900
minding his own business.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:27.100
And all of a sudden, the pH
rises, and the proton

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.270
concentration drops.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.500
So now we've got an abundance
of hydroxyls.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.080
We're in an aqueous solution.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.080
So the zwitterion looks around
and says, I've got to fix

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.360
this, but there's no hydroxyl
attachment site!

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.070
So the zwitterion can't gobble
up the hydroxyls.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.470
So what's the zwitterion
do instead?

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.380
Instead, it starts
shedding protons.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.070
Because if it sheds protons,
then what can happen is, if it

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.900
forms this plus proton, then
the proton can react with

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:57.160
hydroxyl to form water, and then
shoot the pH back to near

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.680
neutrality.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.810
So let's dump the proton here,
and we'll just end up with H2

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:08.530
and CHCOO minus with
the R group.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.930
So this is deprotonation in
order to address the sudden

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:12.880
rise in pH.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.860
And now we can write a K2.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:20.640
Let's call this reaction 2,
and with K2, since it's a

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.880
deprotonation reaction right
away, we can just go ahead and

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.400
write, this is going
to be H plus.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.130
And what's left?

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.240
This is just a denuded,
deprotonated zwitterion, just

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.760
the A minus, all over
neutral zwitterion.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.250
And it looks like this.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:43.190
And we can invoke Sorensen and
get PK2 equals pH plus log

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:47.620
base 10 of the neutral
zwitterion over the

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.390
deprotonated zwitterion.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:51.150
And there you go.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.000
And then, of course, that
50-50 concentration of

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.570
deprotonation, the pH gives
you the value of PK2.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.300
And now, at one end,
I get deprotonated.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.710
The other end, I get
fully protonated,

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.650
right in the middle.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.830
I get the 100% zwitterion.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.010
I said at neutral pH, but
that doesn't mean 7.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.875
It means the pH at which this
particular species is stable.

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:17.680
And that's different from
7, and it's somewhere in

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.970
between, isn't it?

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.790
Because if I go to very
acidic solutions, I

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.930
will start to protonate.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.830
If I go to alkaline solutions,
I'll deprotonate.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.110
So somewhere in between.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.420
And that somewhere in
between is called

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.260
the isoelectric point.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.470
The isoelectric point
is the place at

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.660
which we get the neutral.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.560
So that's HAmax.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.710
The concentration of this is
maximal at the isoelectric

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:51.780
point, and that's called P sub
I, and that's given by PK1

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.516
plus PK2, divided by 2.

00:45:55.516 --> 00:45:57.620
And that's it.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.200
You don't have to run it.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.580
We're done.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.450
Thank you.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.540
OK.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.900
So this is the simple story.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.395
It gets more complicated if, for
example, the R group can

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:09.290
protonate or deprotonate.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.240
So now we got two or
three-ring circus.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.020
It gets more interesting.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.270
But this is the start, and
there's some homework problems

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.670
that will help you
muddle through.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.010
OK.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.710
So I think this is a good place
to switch into the final

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:20.290
five minutes.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.520
So here's the titration curve.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.650
I'll show that at the beginning
of the next lecture.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:23.950
OK.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.700
So now let's talk
about kinetics.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.050
And the extreme in kinetics,
I said, is an explosion.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:33.560
And we're coming upon December
6, which is the anniversary of

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.260
the largest explosion in the
history of the world before

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.390
the nuclear age.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.880
And it occurred in 1917, and
Halifax Harbor, Canada, at

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.030
that time was a British colony,
and therefore Canada's

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.110
foreign policy was dictated
by Britain, which was

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.300
involved in a war.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.170
And there was a French supply
ship and a relief ship, and

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.420
they collided in
Halifax Harbor.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.220
This is what the French
supply ship had on it.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.750
Notice 20,000 tons of TNT.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:03.810
At 8:45 AM, the Mont-Blanc
is hit by the Imo.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:08.590
But the TNT was not ignited,
and instead we ended with

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.450
sparks and a fire.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.310
By the way, this is TNT.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.170
If you look, this is toluene.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.520
Toluene is methylbenzene.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.840
It's just the methyl group.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.060
And this is trinitrotoluene.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.810
And if you go to Wikipedia,
Wikipedia gives this formula,

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.320
which is wrong.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.810
The methyl group is
missing here.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.920
Just a word to the wise.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.870
Be careful when you use
that tool, I put

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:33.760
in quotation marks.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.680
Because it's worth about as much
as you pay for it, which

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.730
is why we teach you to use
the bibliographic things.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.800
OK, so there it is,
right here.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.720
I didn't make this up.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.760
Look at this.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.730
Completely wrong.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.110
Anyway, so what happens?

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.330
"The crew of the Mont-Blanc,
aware of their cargo,

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.830
immediately took the lifeboats,
screaming warnings

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.160
that no one heeded.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.500
They rode for Dartmouth"--

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.970
this is across the channel
from Halifax--

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.890
"leaving the now furiously
burning ship to drift towards

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.150
Halifax, propelled in that
direction by the Imo's impact.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.790
The Mont-Blanc drifted by a
Halifax Pier, brushing it and

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.310
setting it ablaze.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:14.120
Members of the Halifax
Department responded quickly,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.430
and were positioning their
engine up to the nearest

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.440
hydrant when the Mont-Blanc
disintegrated in a blinding

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.340
white flash, creating the
biggest man-made explosion

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.970
before the nuclear age."
It was 9:05 a.m.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.330
on a Thursday morning.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.260
"Over 1,900 people were
killed immediately.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.460
Within a year, the figure
climbed to well over 2,000.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.490
Around 9,000 were injured,
many permanently.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:38.280
325 acres, almost all of North
End Halifax was destroyed.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.230
Much of what was not immediately
leveled burned to

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:43.850
the ground, aided by what are
stockpiles of coal in cellars.

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:46.630
As for the Mont-Blanc, all
3,000 tons of her were

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:49.040
shattered into little
pieces that were

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.580
blasted far and wide.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.530
The barrel of one of her cannons
landed three and a

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.850
half miles away.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:56.810
Part of her anchor shank,
weighing half a ton, flew two

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.800
miles in the opposite
direction.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.730
Windows shattered 50 miles away,
and the shock wave was

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:06.300
felt even in Sydney, on Cape
Breton Island, 270 miles to

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.470
the northeast.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.030
"There was about 20 minutes
between the

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.180
collision and the explosion.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.450
It was enough time for
spectators, including many

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.600
children, to run to the
waterfront to watch the ship

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.750
burning, thus coming
into close range."

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.160
I mean, they were little kids,
and it's a fire, and the fire

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.020
engines are coming!

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.010
It's fun!

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.585
It's more interesting than
going to school, right?

00:49:29.585 --> 00:49:33.010
"It was enough time for others
to gather at windows.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.880
Office workers came to the
windows, and with the

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:40.380
explosion, the glass shattered
and blinded them.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.630
"Not surprisingly, the hospitals
weren't able to cope

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.040
with so many wounded.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.950
There was also a desperate
need for housing, and the

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.150
misery was compounded"--

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.190
are you ready for this?--

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.810
"by the blizzard that struck
the city the following day,

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:55.340
dumping 16 inches of snow
over the ruins.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.270
"With astounding speed, relief
efforts were set in motion.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.210
Money poured in from as far away
as China and New Zealand,

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.840
Canadian Government gave--"
blah, blah, blah.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.310
"But most Haligonians"--

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.630
which is what you call a
denizen of Halifax--

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.620
"most Haligonians remember the
generosity of the state of

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.860
Massachusetts, which donated
$750,000 of money and goods,

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.470
and gave unstintingly in
volunteer assistance through

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.440
the Massachusetts Halifax
Relief Committee."

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.810
People from the hospital
district here got on trains,

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.740
and went up there to assist,
especially from Mass Eye and

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.920
Ear, to assist the people
that had been blinded.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.320
"Starting in 1971, to this day,
Halifax sends an annual

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.930
Christmas tree to the city
of Boston in gratitude."

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:43.390
And there are specifications on
what the tree should look

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.170
like, and how big it should be,
and so on, and they bring

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.070
it over to Boston Commons.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:52.490
So if, in the days that come,
when you get back from

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.820
Thanksgiving, if you happen to
be across the river and you

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.020
see something that's about 45
feet high and it looks like it

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.960
came from Canada, this
is what it is.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.780
And it's all about the
Halifax explosion.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:06.090
OK.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.120
There you go.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:07.430
All right.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.460
Well, have a nice weekend.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.600
We'll see you on Monday.
