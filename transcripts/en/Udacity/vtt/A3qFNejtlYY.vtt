00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.368
Therefore, when we have this test statistic that measures whether or not there

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:10.269
are significant differences between three or more samples. We have to construct

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.823
this statistic so that as within-group variability increases the test statistic

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:20.108
decreases. Becomes more in favor of the null, meaning that the sample means are

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:25.322
less likely to be different from each other. And this statistic should also

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:29.165
take into account that as between group variability increases, the test

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:34.838
statistic increases. The sample means are more likely to be different from each

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:40.550
other. We can do this by making a test statistic. Let's call it f. A ratio of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.878
the between group variability and within group variability. Which should be in

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.857
the numerator, and which should be in the denominator?
