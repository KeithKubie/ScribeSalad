00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:13.490
A time-honored method of settling disputes,
trial by combat became an institution in Europe

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.820
during the Middle Ages.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.369
Although it fell out of fashion for many,
beginning with the Enlightenment, it remained

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.680
a popular means for European nobility to settle
matters of honor well into the 19th century.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.550
While most duels were fought by men, occasionally
a ladies’ disagreement would get out-of-hand,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.920
and the resulting “petticoat duel” would
commence.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.800
One of the earliest of these recorded was
between Diambra de Pettinella and Isabella

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.910
de Carazzi in Naples in 1552, when the two
couldn’t agree on which of them should win

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750
the heart of Fabio de Zeresola.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.489
While the outcome remains unknown, the battle
between them was memorialized in the painting

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.760
of Jose de Ribera, Duela de Mujeres (1636).

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.079
Over the years, lady duels were fought between
actresses challenging each other’s craft,

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.470
society mavens over who should take precedence
at an event, and two ladies, Madame Astie

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.110
de Valsayre and “Miss Shelby”, even clashed
over whether American or French doctors were

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.110
superior.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.930
As noted in an article published in Le Petit
Parisien on March 17, 1886,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.530
Mme Astié de Valsayre, known for having published
several books, has just been to Waterloo for

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.630
a fencing duel with an American, Miss Shelby.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.450
During a debate on the superiority of French
female doctors over American female doctors

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.600
she had thrown her glove in the face of Miss
Shelby.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.710
France was victorious.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.950
During the second engagement the American
was lightly wounded on the arm.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.420
Witnesses have stated that everything happened
according to the rules.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.630
Fighting just until someone drew blood (as
opposed to the death or to the pain) was common

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.740
with lady duels.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.420
For instance, in 1792, after one Mrs. Elphinstone
insinuated Lady Almeria Braddock was significantly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.260
older than she was, the pair battled first
with pistols and then with swords in London’s

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.420
Hyde Park.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.550
The result?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.630
Their pistol shots missed, but the matter
ended as soon as Lady Braddock inflicted Elphinstone

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.560
with a light wound to the arm with her sword.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.920
After receiving the wound, Mrs. Elphinstone
agreed to write a formal apology.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.349
Perhaps the most famous “petticoat duel”
of them all was fought topless.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.170
This likewise was supposed to be fought only
to first blood, but, apparently, between the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.220
seriousness of the dispute and the ferocity
of the combatants, both ladies were ultimately

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.220
injured.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.099
It began in the summer of 1892, when two Austrian
noblewomen, the Princess Pauline Metternich

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.110
and the Countess Anastasia Kiielmansegg, were
at each other’s throats over the matter

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.780
of the floral arrangements for the Vienna
Musical Theatrical Exhibition (the Princess

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.720
was the Exhibition’s Honorary President
and the Countess was the President of the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.910
Ladies’ Committee).

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.819
Deciding the dispute could only honorably
be settled by armed combat, the women travelled

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.099
to the Vaduz on the Swiss frontier to duel
it out.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.031
Attended by their seconds, Princess Schwarzenberg
and Countess Kinsk, as well as the medically-trained

00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:06.000
Baroness Lubinska, on the advice of the Baroness,
the two duelists first stripped to the waist

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.690
before the battle.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.190
More than mere bravado, and certainly not
for any salacious purpose, the Baroness had

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.099
the ladies remove their clothing due to the
possibility that small strips of cloth could

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.980
be trapped in any sword wounds, and might
thereby lead to the contraction of sepsis,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.850
something she’d seen happen before in the
aftermath of duels.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.239
Caused by, in pertinent part, a bacterial
infection of the bloodstream, the body’s

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.739
immune response can sometimes ultimately damage
organs or other tissues, and, in some cases,

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.349
lead to organ failure and even death.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.550
As the fight was to begin, the few males that
were present (all servants) were sent to stand

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.660
far away with their backs to the battle.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.409
The fight itself was reportedly relatively
short.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.629
Both ladies made a few thrusts and feints
with their rapiers, resulting in princess

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.490
Pauline cutting countess Anastasia’s nose.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.010
With first blood drawn, and supposedly in
some shock over having done so, the Princess

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.049
dropped her defenses.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.629
Rather than cease fighting, the Countess subsequently
stabbed the Princess in the arm.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.569
At the sight of the blood, it is reported
that both seconds fainted (see: Why Women

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.480
Fainted So Much in the 19th Century), and
hearing the ladies’ cries, the chivalrous

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.190
(or curious) footmen and coachmen supposedly
attempted to rush to their “aid.”

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.619
Since the Princess drew first blood, most
considered her the winner, although some felt

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:28.529
that the glancing blow wasn’t as worthy
of recognition as the Countess inflicting

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:29.650
a deeper arm cut.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.400
Regardless, at the urging of their two seconds,
shortly after both were injured the duel ended

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:49.559
and the ladies 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:05:03.899
made up.
