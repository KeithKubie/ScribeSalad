[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.474
LINO CATTARUZZI: OK,
so let's get started.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:12.140
This is special.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.130
We will talk, in
particular for me.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.440
I want to introduce
you to Loic de Kerdrel.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.820
Loic is a very good friend.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.910
I'm going to make
a disclaimer first.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.100
Actually, he's my
marriage witness.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.734
And we've known each
other for 16 years?

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:29.650
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yeah.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.730
LINO CATTARUZZI: Roughly.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.815
I'm not going to give all
the details on how we me

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:33.314
each other.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:34.690
So don't worry.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.972
We met in Argentina on 31st
of December in a party.

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:43.430
And we have many
friends in common.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.720
And then we grew over
time on our friendship.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.170
And now I wanted him to
share a little bit with you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.030
his track record,
what he has done

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.710
in business, and
of course, share

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.980
some advices and things to you.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220
So Loic, I would
really like to start.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.610
First, thank you
for making the time

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.340
and coming here and joining us.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.830
And second, do you mind sharing
a little bit of who you are

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.245
and what is the
company you created?

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:11.521
LOIC DE KERDREL: OK,
hello to everybody.

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.020
I apologize.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.290
My English isn't perfect.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.470
But I will do my best.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.280
LINO CATTARUZZI: If
not, you say in French.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280
Most of them understand.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.370
LOIC DE KERDREL: OK.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.480
No, I will try in English.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.630
I like challenges.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.730
Thank you, Lino,
to invite me here.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.910
I was supposed to be on holiday
with my family for a week.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.780
But Lino wants me back
to work, apparently.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.350
No, I'm very happy to be here.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.550
It's very interesting for me to
visit Google office to see the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.600
how it works here.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.440
And I'm very, very happy.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.780
So roughly, I
created with a friend

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.820
a company called
Adverline in 1999.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.229
So it's quite a long time ago.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.020
LINO CATTARUZZI: You
were very, very young.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.030
LOIC DE KERDREL: I
was very young then.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.840
It was not my first job.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.090
I had worked two years
before in a company

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.290
called ICI, Imperial Chemical
Industries-- so nothing in

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.740
common with technology.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.900
But at that moment--

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.889
I don't know--

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.370
It was the beginning
of internet.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.300
Everybody was
setting up companies.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.610
So I was really getting
bored in this big company.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.520
And I thinking, I should
dive into this new movement.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.230
So first I joined a
startup who was copying

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.480
eBay, more or less, in France.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.430
And it was sold rapidly
to another company.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.230
So I decided to
create Adverline.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.640
So we had an idea.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.600
I had an idea it was that
every day lots of new websites

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.350
were created in France.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.050
And most of them couldn't
make money, basically.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.850
They were all dreaming
of making money.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.280
But they were too small.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.380
The audience was too small
to make money, basically.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.870
So we thought, OK, if we could
gather all these audiences

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.210
together, it would
make a big audience.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.940
And we could sell the
advertising space.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.280
It was a very simple idea.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.980
And at that time, Google
AdSense was not really here.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.480
So--

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.410
LINO CATTARUZZI: Wait.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.495
Somebody thought the idea
was good here as well there.

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.840
LOIC DE KERDREL: It
was maybe in the US.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.680
But in France, AdSense
was not here at the time.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.700
So we first started to
develop a technology to--

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.110
it was kind of an
ad-serving technology

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.300
that make it easy for a
webmaster to subscribe.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.676
And I bought-- some advertising
pages in a geek magazines

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:47.800
with a very simple message.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.110
It was, webmaster, subscribe
Adverline and make money.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.610
And we had lots of success with
this very simple advertising

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.660
campaign.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.520
Hundreds of websites
every week were

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.010
subscribing because they
had basically no solution

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.525
to make money.

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:03.400
LINO CATTARUZZI: And
that was year 2000, '99.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yeah,
2000, I would say.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.580
And so we were ready to--

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.280
we have the stock of
advertising space set.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.120
So we started to sell it to
advertising agency, basically.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.709
And the strategy was
to set a low price.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.470
So we created a
microbilling solution

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.460
to enable this website,
some of these websites

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.670
to put a paywall,
basically, on the pages.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.350
It was a very easy way
to create this paywall.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.469
Yeah, very, very easy way.

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.760
LINO CATTARUZZI: So as money
and advertising disappear,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.570
paywall was the solution
you came up with.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.861
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes, paywall,
but it was macrobilling.

00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:58.130
So it was basically, you had
to dial a premium phone call.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.859
You get a code.

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:01.150
You enter the code on the page.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.800
And you get the content.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.980
So it helped us to go through
these two years, 2001, 2002,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.790
where the market was
very, very difficult.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.550
And in 2003, when the
market started again,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.680
we had no more competitor
on the advertising part.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.395
They were all dead,
basically, in France.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.550
That moment, it was
a very special moment

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.640
because the market started
to be really bullish.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.546
And we had a very,
very strong growth.

00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:37.440
And in some areas, we didn't
have enough space to sell.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.980
So we thought, OK, we don't
have enough space to sell.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.690
So we're going to
create this space.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.070
So we started creating space and
creating websites, basically.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.310
And we became publishers
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.730
But the first website
was Zone-ASDL.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.125
It was a comparator--

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.750
LINO CATTARUZZI:
Price comparison site.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.390
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yeah, price
comparison site for ISP

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.940
because we had
lots of advertisers

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.930
at that time who are fighting
for market shares in France.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.880
And then, because we had
a very strong growth,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.560
I met someone who proposed
me to make an IPO, basically.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.040
It was really weird.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.650
I met the guy.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.150
He said, oh, you
should make an IPO.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.500
Or really, how does it work?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.752
I had no idea, basically.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:22.460
Well, you always have
experts everywhere.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.960
So he explained
me how it worked.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.250
And we take-- people
who knew how it worked.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.510
And one year after, we
were raised 15 million euro

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.540
through an IPO.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.440
And basically, it was to
accelerate the movement

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.560
towards publishing
because at that moment,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.410
Google was really
ready with AdSense.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.469
And so the--

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:47.010
LINO CATTARUZZI:
That was 2007, 2008?

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.950
LOIC DE KERDREL:
No, it was 2006.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.721
LINO CATTARUZZI: '06, OK.

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.220
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Our strategy, which

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.630
was to use the
long tail basically

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:02.300
of a website to put it back
in the advertising market.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.970
Google wasn't on the cake.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.580
We had to find out
quickly a new business.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:18.160
So I thought being a master of
your website was the solution.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.180
So we raised that money.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.510
And we invested in
websites that were

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.510
some of were in our network.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.170
We have a very strategic
vision of which websites were

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.670
accelerating more than others.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.950
So we invested maybe
in 10 websites.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.080
Sometimes, it was
a minority stake.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.020
Sometimes it was
a majority stake.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.865
We acquired societe.com.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.510
I don't know if you know it.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:53.105
In France, maison.com-- more
or less than 10 websites.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:08:02.630
And we continued the
development until 2012.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.520
And we sold the
company, actually,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.925
to a French big group.

00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:14.440
And I'm still CEO
of that company.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.760
So it's now four, five
years after when I sold it.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.650
I thought I would stay
two years and leave.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.807
Finally, I'm still here.

00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:21.890
I don't know how it comes.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.864
But I'm still here.

00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:24.405
LINO CATTARUZZI:
They still like you.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:26.225
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:26.725
I--

00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:27.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.525
LINO CATTARUZZI: They
maybe don't like you?

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:30.774
LOIC DE KERDREL: I don't know.

00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:31.700
But I'm still here.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.470
It was four years ago.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.549
I got married.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.120
I make three babies
in that time.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.437
So I didn't waste my time.

00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:40.520
LINO CATTARUZZI: I guess
it's not that common to--

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.735
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:43.610
LINO CATTARUZZI: I guess
it's not that common

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.320
that you find somebody with the
track record and the expertise.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.240
So even if they wanted
to find somebody else,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.480
I'm not sure will have the
competencies, experience,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.220
and the insights.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.219
LOIC DE KERDREL: Well,
it's a very big challenge

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:00.770
for big groups that don't have
the internet culture to-- when

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.064
they invest in smaller
startups like us,

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.730
it's very complicated
to integrate them.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.970
That's a very big problem.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.050
And I still don't know.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.140
Me, really, I'm ready
to go, actually.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.040
But I'm really scared of what
they would do with the company

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.464
after that.

00:09:14.464 --> 00:09:15.380
I'm very attached to--

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.904
LINO CATTARUZZI:
More or less care.

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:17.570
You really care.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.980
You really are attached.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.430
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Yes, but I think

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.840
it's a very big
challenge for big groups

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.090
to integrate because they
have a process, big process.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.340
And we are a very--

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.945
a giant company.

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.230
It's a very big challenge.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.190
But part of independence,
you let to the company.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.700
And if you don't
have the founder, who

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.270
will take the lead after it?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.205
It's a bit complicated, I think.

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:42.080
It's not always easy.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.650
LINO CATTARUZZI: So let me
ask you a couple of things

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.640
into the description
you did on Adverline.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.350
Let's talk about
the tough moments

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.200
because it's 2000, 2001.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.640
The stock market goes down.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.230
There's no funding.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.280
By the time, there was
not a lot of believe

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.150
into online advertising, right?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.620
And then your main source--
or only source of revenues

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.260
goes away.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.030
And then you come creatively
with another solution

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.650
that lets you survive.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.000
What were the toughest moments?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.580
And what did you learn?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.460
LOIC DE KERDREL: Well, I think
the tough moments were first

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.310
the creation.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.430
We did a business plan.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.000
We went to see a
business analyst.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.990
Very few people, even very
bright and smart people,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.750
the best educated people,
but old generation,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.180
probably like me now, they
said, but do you really

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.410
believe in this internet?

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.280
I mean, we had these
type of answers.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.710
And it was really amazing.

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:43.840
So it was a bit tough because we
had to start it without money.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.550
Then after the
second tough moment,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.680
you said it was when
the bubble exploded.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.970
And we had no more money.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.325
And we had to find solutions.

00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:52.240
And basically, we
were a small team.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.180
We were maybe 12 people.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:01.680
And we had to shrink to
six people, maybe, I guess.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.995
We nearly didn't get
paid, me and my partner.

00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:08.622
I slept in the office
room more than a year.

00:11:08.622 --> 00:11:09.580
So it was really tough.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.580
When I felt that the
market was starting again--

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.080
because we had two
business angels,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.020
I thought, OK, I want now.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.190
I'm ready to fight again.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.170
But I don't want to fight for--

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.010
because we had lost the
majority of the company.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.840
So I was not ready to
fight to suffer again

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.530
for less than the majority.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.730
So I offered the
two business owners

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.480
to buy the shares for
basically the price I bought.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.000
They bought them
price of 5% per year.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.810
And they accepted.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.030
So I sold my flat,
which was my only--

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.870
I had a small flat
in Montmartre.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.505
I sold it to buy it.

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:54.139
And plus, I borrowed
a bit at the bank.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.930
LINO CATTARUZZI: You
became homeless to buy

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.620
your own company.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.494
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes.

00:11:57.494 --> 00:11:58.139
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.180
LOIC DE KERDREL: Exactly.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.310
But that was the time I slept
in the office, actually.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.155
And--

00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:06.000
LINO CATTARUZZI: Well,
that's consistent.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.920
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.560
But it was totally crazy.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.680
I would never suggest
people to do that.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.774
It was really crazy.

00:12:16.774 --> 00:12:18.190
LINO CATTARUZZI:
And I don't think

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.420
your wife will appreciate if
you propose something like that.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.836
LOIC DE KERDREL:
No, it was crazy.

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.640
But at the end of
the day, it was--

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.410
two years later, we went public.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.860
So of course, the value
was not at all the same.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.070
You can imagine the share.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.790
But so it was crazy.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.970
But it worked, actually.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.097
That's how we went public.

00:12:38.097 --> 00:12:40.305
And we had 100% of the
capital with my partner, which

00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:42.220
is quite rare in our industry.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.570
Most of the people
who go public,

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.449
they are already diluted by
many VCs and business angels,

00:12:49.449 --> 00:12:49.990
and all this.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.323
LINO CATTARUZZI: Well, you were.

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:52.990
It's just you had
the vision to trust.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.540
And you trusted your business
so much that you bought again

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.320
your shares.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.510
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yeah,
I think it was crazy.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.280
And we were lucky, I think--

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.699
not only lucky but also lucky.

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:04.115
LINO CATTARUZZI: Yeah, the
more I work, the luckier I get.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:06.790
LOIC DE KERDREL: I don't know,
but I wouldn't do it today,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.300
I'm sure.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.705
LINO CATTARUZZI: OK,
so I think that--

00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:12.205
and I have some
inside information--

00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:16.130
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes, and just
to complete the tough moments,

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.160
as I said, the company
is a very tough moment

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.590
as well because you sell it.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.612
And you don't know if
it's stupid or not.

00:13:22.612 --> 00:13:24.570
Now I'm really happy to
have sold it, actually.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.810
But it's a very tough
moment because you have to--

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.730
you have the
impression that you're

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.367
selling your son or something
that belongs to you.

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:34.700
LINO CATTARUZZI: It's emotional.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.180
LOIC DE KERDREL: It's
very, very emotional.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.530
It's a very hard moment.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.650
Even if you basically
get money, OK, so you're

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.924
happy to get money.

00:13:42.924 --> 00:13:44.340
And [INAUDIBLE]
says, so what now?

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:50.056
And it's a very, very tough
moment in terms of emotion.

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:52.420
LINO CATTARUZZI: So
let's for a second assume

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.680
that anyone here or
anyone watching the video

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.726
are going to start
their own company.

00:13:57.726 --> 00:13:59.350
Would would be the
two or three advices

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.860
that you will give
them to make sure

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.556
that they maximize their
chance of being successful?

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:07.180
And I hope it's not
sell your apartment

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.935
to invest in your own company.

00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:10.270
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, no.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.400
Really, it's very hard to
give advices because me,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.800
lots of people gave me very
bad advices, basically.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.493
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:22.370
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, it's true.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.050
Very smart people always
told me, OK, I know.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.110
Your business plan is OK.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.360
But you should wait two years.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.490
The market is-- so I think
the advice would be not

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.140
to listen too much to advices.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.495
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:34.870
LINO CATTARUZZI:
Except this one.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.896
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, no,
and to follow your faith.

00:14:39.896 --> 00:14:44.740
You really need to have the
faith in something, in an idea,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.405
and you have to be really
willing to create your company.

00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:52.030
If you're not really
ready, if you just

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.950
want to create your
company because it's

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.400
fashionable to create a
company, because it's cool,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.020
you must be ready to suffer.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:04.240
And if you really have a vision
and faith and a big will,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.390
you will not feel the
bad moments, basically.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:18.180
My advice is you have
to follow your idea.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.970
Your idea must be strong, not
very smart, but very strong

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.470
in you.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.260
My advice as well is
you have to take risks.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.720
But so the sooner,
the better, I would

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.260
say because for example, me
today, I have three children.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.990
I would not take the same risk.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.700
It was not a problem for me to
sleep in my office two years.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.900
I had nothing.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.990
I had this little flat.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.860
So if you fail,
it's not a big deal.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.120
You fail, you lose--

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.450
so the sooner, the
better, I think.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.821
Don't wait that your product
is perfect before you go.

00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.184
Me, now, I invested in
many companies and I--

00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:57.850
LINO CATTARUZZI: No,
that's comes after.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.510
Don't talk about that.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.610
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Yeah, some people

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.526
who wants to have something
perfect before go.

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:02.040
No, you go.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.280
You go, and you repair on board.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.290
You repair on board.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.550
So that's my advice.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.410
My advice as well would be to--

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.590
it was for me, very important
to share the experience

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.310
with someone.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.520
You must have a
dream or a vision.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.415
And you have to share it with
someone because it's very--

00:16:20.415 --> 00:16:24.240
between the tough moment, if
you are alone, it's very--

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.100
it's a long journey.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.730
So it's very tough to be alone.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.320
Me, I could not have been alone.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.380
So I have a very good friend.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.880
He has--

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.540
LINO CATTARUZZI: You can
name him if you want.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.081
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Yeah, Charles Costa.

00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:35.910
He's a very good friend.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.530
He has a very good
temper as well.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.060
You have to share the
adventure with someone

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.090
who have the same value as you,
someone who will not kill you

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:53.340
for money, for example, or
someone who say, OK, this

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.010
is a bottle.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.200
This is not an orange.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.300
Because in some situation,
people say, no, sorry.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.060
It's not a bottle.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.800
It's an orange.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.410
You have to share value
with your partner.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.109
As well, for difficult moment,
it's nice to have a partner

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.435
and as well to share.

00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:15.780
If you have the best moment, if
you're alone, it's quite sad.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.290
So it's better to share.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:25.319
And then after, if
you have a good team,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.040
I would say the hard thing is
to get good people with you

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.120
on the boat, which is
not such a beautiful boat

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.190
at the beginning.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.577
And you need to have
quality people along.

00:17:36.577 --> 00:17:37.410
How do you get them?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.050
Because you know that all the
best, they either go to Google

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.260
or set up their company.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.294
So how do you do?

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.960
LINO CATTARUZZI: We
are happy with that.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.220
We are happy they
come to Google.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.250
LOIC DE KERDREL:
That's a big problem.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.833
So how you do?

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.330
So you have to share your dream.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.070
You have to be very enthusiastic
to make nice people come

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.882
on board with you.

00:17:55.882 --> 00:17:58.810
And you have to
be nice to people

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.600
so that good people join
your adventure, basically.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.850
LINO CATTARUZZI: I'm going
to ask you a little bit now

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.380
on your angel investments.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.880
And then start thinking about
questions if you want to make.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.440
And then I'll give
it to you guys.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.720
So while you sold
the company, you

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.520
are still are the
CEO of the company.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.100
But now, well, the bank
account is a little bit better.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.770
And you are expanding
your reach now.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.670
What is in your mind?

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.600
What are you doing?

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.320
How would you like to approach
future investments and things

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.560
like that?

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.850
LOIC DE KERDREL: Well,
it's a big question.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.846
When you sell your company,
what am I going to do next?

00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:37.845
And it's a big question.

00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:40.260
And you're too young to retire.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.960
You have not updated
your dreams because when

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.810
you create your company,
when you were 25--

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.290
I don't know-- maybe you dream
of going surfing on a beach

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.380
if you had enough
money to stop working.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.409
When you sold your
company, you're nearly 40

00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:59.700
and say, I don't want to go
anymore surfing on a beach.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.701
Nobody is there.

00:19:00.701 --> 00:19:01.200
So what--

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.220
LOIC DE KERDREL:
I'm too fat anyway.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.360
So it's too late.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.830
You have not
updated your dreams.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.510
It's kind of a trauma.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.969
So it's very hard
to re-adapt yourself

00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:20.010
to what am I going to do.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.880
So first, I started to
invest in companies.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.625
But it's a bit frustrating
investing because you invest.

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:29.250
And it's like--

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.291
LINO CATTARUZZI: They
don't always give you money

00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.240
LOIC DE KERDREL: No,
no, we were quite lucky.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.800
I mean, I have invested.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.930
One of my first investment
was sold to Google.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.530
It was a company
called Moodstocks.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:47.045
It was a visual
recognition software.

00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:48.050
It was sold to Google.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.140
So we had good adventures.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.348
LINO CATTARUZZI: I had
nothing to do with that, guys,

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:52.839
by the way.

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.630
LOIC DE KERDREL: But
it's a bit frustrating

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.505
when you are an entrepreneur.

00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:58.645
You want to lead your
own boat, basically.

00:19:58.645 --> 00:20:01.920
And you don't want
to put money in--

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.630
it's like buying
a forest and wait

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.340
five years so the trees grow.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.710
For me, it's not enough.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.280
So I think I will
create something else.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.310
I'm not sure exactly what.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.026
But--

00:20:16.026 --> 00:20:18.410
LINO CATTARUZZI: Well, I know
some of your side business

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.534
and your personal passions.

00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:21.950
LOIC DE KERDREL: I had few
projects, actually, yes.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.820
I have few project.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.620
But for sure, I would start
again something, big or not,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.190
but nice.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.177
LINO CATTARUZZI: Guys, do
you have any questions?

00:20:33.177 --> 00:20:34.760
LOIC DE KERDREL: I
hope you understood

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.635
what I said because--

00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:36.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.090
LOIC DE KERDREL: --it
was a bit, you know.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.494
LINO CATTARUZZI: No,
no, they have a chip.

00:20:40.494 --> 00:20:41.410
It's Google translate.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:41.940
So don't worry.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.898
They've got everything.

00:20:42.898 --> 00:20:44.500
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.360
But maybe on your
current company.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.706
You were saying that
you started making money

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:58.108
from other streams of--

00:20:58.108 --> 00:20:59.536
getting other
streams of revenue.

00:20:59.536 --> 00:21:02.728
How did [INAUDIBLE] that?

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.942
How is it working today?

00:21:04.942 --> 00:21:08.140
Is it the main source of revenue
now that [INAUDIBLE] activity?

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.350
Or are you also still kind
of [INAUDIBLE] of AdSense?

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.168
Or how is it working today?

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:15.690
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, so
the advertising network

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.110
have changed.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.260
We are not anymore
on the long tail.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.220
We contract with big websites.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:31.311
So we have moved from the
small websites to big websites,

00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:31.810
basically.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:37.870
So we have a more traditional
advertising network business.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.490
Still, I would say, nearly half
of the business of the company.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.500
But its a tough business
because now in France,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.720
you have to be quite big.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.510
We have 25 million
unique users in France.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.715
And I would say it's the
minimum not to lose money.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.940
The growth is quite low.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.960
The microbilling is
still a good business.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.640
But we have adapted it as
well because PayPal now

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.530
is everywhere.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.092
LINO CATTARUZZI: You don't
need to call anymore.

00:22:16.092 --> 00:22:17.550
LOIC DE KERDREL:
We have adapted it

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.350
to put more service
with the billing

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.350
because just billing, now big
companies are in this market.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.840
So we try to put a layer
of service with a voice,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.410
basically.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.170
You guys are on
this market as well.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.769
You are everywhere, huh?

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:36.060
But it's still a good business.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:41.870
And I believe in billing
services through voice.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.880
And publishing is still good.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.890
And we have one website that
make the money for the others,

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.390
I would say.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:59.160
We have a leader in--

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.770
societe.com is still
making good money.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.280
Basically, we are selling--

00:23:07.462 --> 00:23:08.670
LINO CATTARUZZI: Information.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.503
LOIC DE KERDREL:
--information on companies,

00:23:10.503 --> 00:23:12.270
financial information
on companies.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.250
We buy raw information.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.410
We clean it.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.630
And we sell it in retail.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.600
LINO CATTARUZZI: And
with Google [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600
I think a mic, yes.

00:23:29.462 --> 00:23:32.763
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much,
first of all to come here.

00:23:32.763 --> 00:23:35.650
I want to [INAUDIBLE] what
are the things, the key things

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.400
that you are looking
at when you decide

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:45.109
to buy or to buy a stake
in a business very fast?

00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:48.010
LOIC DE KERDREL: Well, I'm
not sure it's very rational,

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.560
I would say.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.150
There's a large part
of instinct that I

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:59.670
feel through the exchange,
the talk with the founders.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.280
And I invest very early stage.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.070
So I would say knowing
the statistic is

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.420
you invest in 10 companies.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.260
And one goes very well.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.554
And most of the others
died, basically.

00:24:13.554 --> 00:24:14.970
That's supposed
to be a statistic.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.370
For us, it's not a statistic.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.575
We are much better
than this because I

00:24:18.575 --> 00:24:19.870
invest with my partner.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.915
And we would say we have one
company, which is in difficulty

00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.630
out of maybe 15 companies.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.610
But most of them, they
are in good shape.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:34.730
So I would say instinct of
the determination I have in--

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.105
LINO CATTARUZZI:
In the founders.

00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:37.563
LOIC DE KERDREL:
--in the founders.

00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:39.570
I would say it's the first--

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.222
it's my first key.

00:24:43.222 --> 00:24:44.930
LINO CATTARUZZI: And
the business itself.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.800
LOIC DE KERDREL: And of
course, the business,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.830
you need to be in a
market that is coming.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.980
I don't invest in where
there's no market,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.829
basically, where it's too soon.

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:58.370
The time to market
is very important.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.730
For us, for example,
we were very lucky

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.980
because of the time to market.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.645
It was not a strategy.

00:25:02.645 --> 00:25:03.740
It was luck, basically.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.350
But two years before,
we would have died.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.370
Two years after,
it was too late.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:12.990
So the time to market
is very, very important.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.810
But basically, the
profile of the founder

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.516
is very important because
you have to adapt all time.

00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:24.320
If you have someone who is too
sure of where he wants to go,

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.550
it's not good because you
need people who are very fast,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.800
who are ready to
change very fast,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.590
can adapt their business
model very fast.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:39.500
So I don't invest in people
who are too sure of themself,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.330
basically, because you
need to be humble, I guess,

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.640
when you start a company.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.950
Yeah, it's part of
instinct, I would say first.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.970
And of course, I know a
bit of market as well.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.590
I invest many on
internet businesses.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.304
So I know--

00:26:02.304 --> 00:26:03.970
LINO CATTARUZZI: A
lot of the ecosystem.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.200
LOIC DE KERDREL: Few
things, few things-- and I

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.070
try to invest not on a
single person or businesses.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.990
So I like to have at
least two partner.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.780
Three partner is good.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.190
I like a technical guy, a
business guy, and a design guy,

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.690
for example.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.770
It's fantastic.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.880
That's the best
typology, I would say.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.000
I don't have my five
rules for investment.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.750
I don't have this.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.380
In five years, I
will have a good view

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.090
if I am a good investor or not.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.500
For now, it's too soon.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.880
We had two companies
that was sold already.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.072
Good--

00:26:52.072 --> 00:26:53.280
LINO CATTARUZZI: Multipliers.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.860
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.030
And I'm still optimistic
in most of them.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.790
LINO CATTARUZZI: We'll bring
him back again in five years.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.957
And then he will tell us.

00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:05.040
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes, yes.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.420
I would come.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.020
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.250
So what are the main
difference between entrepreneur

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.380
20 years ago and today in tech?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.492
And do you think the
same entrepreneur

00:27:17.492 --> 00:27:21.238
will have more chance of
success today or in the past?

00:27:21.238 --> 00:27:24.640
LOIC DE KERDREL: OK, well,
it's a good question.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.270
For me, it's much harder today
than 20 years ago because

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.720
20 years ago, there
was a big, big thing.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.530
Internet was new.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.450
So this disruption was so huge.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.320
You don't find this
disruption today.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.170
I mean, so even someone stupid
would jump into the water

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.590
and would follow the current
and would do something,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.115
I would say.

00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:46.990
It's a bit of a joke.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.955
But it's not totally a joke.

00:27:48.955 --> 00:27:54.530
If you were in the right moment,
now I find it very difficult.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.030
Why?

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.330
Because all the smart
people going out

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.790
of big university,
big business school,

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.896
they all create companies.

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:04.270
They all read the
same newspaper.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:08.322
LINO CATTARUZZI: Or
they work for Google.

00:28:08.322 --> 00:28:10.030
LOIC DE KERDREL: Or
they work for Google.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.830
It's true.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.360
I receive maybe 10
business plan every week--

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.730
people who want to raise money.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.505
Quality of people is amazing.

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:24.916
The business plan are fantastic.

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:28.840
And so it's very
hard to find space.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.330
You have so many bright
people, smart people

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.140
who create company today.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.470
I mean, I'm sure they will
not all success for sure.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.290
So I find it more difficult
now than 20 years ago

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.290
because you have
much more people.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.670
And you don't have
such a big disruption.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.790
Maybe I was saying
to Lino, I would

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.322
say abrupt change
is very interesting.

00:28:48.322 --> 00:28:49.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.154
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yeah,
abrupt change, for me,

00:28:51.154 --> 00:28:55.090
is probably the big disruption
in my opinion, in my opinion.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.840
But the other
disruption are extension

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.097
of previous disruptions, I
would say, like mobile or video

00:29:03.097 --> 00:29:03.680
and all these.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.000
But big companies
are already there.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.910
You have to go.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.440
It's very nice when
you go in a market--

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.110
not mature and a
bit chaotic, where

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.730
big companies,
big organization--

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.380
it's not easy for them to--

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.370
so I would say blockchain is
perfect for this, I would say.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.318
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
actually, my husband

00:29:23.318 --> 00:29:24.779
was related to blockchain.

00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:27.015
What do you think
about the whole--

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.470
people say it's a bubble.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.410
Some people say it's
a new technology.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.871
So what do you think about
the future of blockchain?

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:36.190
LOIC DE KERDREL: Well,
people had the same idea

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.650
with the internet.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.480
Very smart, educated people told
me that internet is a bubble.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.610
So I hear the same
with blockchain.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.300
So I think, wow.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.770
That's probably something good.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.440
And that's why I want to
dig in this direction.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.154
I think there is
something really--

00:29:56.154 --> 00:29:57.820
I don't understand
very well blockchain,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.850
to tell you the truth.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.090
I don't understand
everything in blockchain.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:05.140
But I feel that this is
something very, very disruptive

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.220
that will change
a lot of things,

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.310
like a new dimension of
business-- interesting,

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.811
I think,

00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:11.726
AUDIENCE: Can I just--

00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:12.593
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:14.757
This is more on a personal note.

00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:17.884
But do you remember if you had
a moment where you thought,

00:30:17.884 --> 00:30:19.330
OK, this is it.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.150
I've made it.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.670
I'm successful now, whether
it's founding a company

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.000
or selling it.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.688
Or does it not work like that?

00:30:25.688 --> 00:30:27.400
LOIC DE KERDREL: No,
and I have a problem

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.160
with the word "success."

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.840
Success for me is
something really weird.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.080
I don't know if you have
read this in the newspaper.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.150
You have Albert Einstein.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.250
He wrote a note of paper
that was sold $1 million

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.720
in an auction yesterday
or the day before.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.320
And it was a little word
on success and happiness.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.580
And he said
basically that he had

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.780
found the secret of
happiness that it was not try

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.190
to find success at all price.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.870
So success for me,
it's something--

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.370
so we had--

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.800
I don't really
feel I had success.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.870
For me, success is to achieve
your goal, and try to be happy.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:17.470
That's the only success you may
have in life, in my opinion.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.620
So if you are lucky
to make your business

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.379
and to put it successful,
maybe develop it,

00:31:25.379 --> 00:31:27.320
sold it, make money.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.240
It's nice.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.246
So it's kind of a success.

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:34.030
You have many little
success every day.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:39.085
So I never had the idea of
having made the success.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:48.250
For me, it was an obligation
to create my company

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.410
because I hate orders.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.970
I don't like hierarchy
and this depends on it.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.466
So I had no choice, basically.

00:31:54.466 --> 00:31:57.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.359 --> 00:31:59.650
LOIC DE KERDREL: So that's
why I created a new company.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.340
So it was not a success.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.950
It was a survival thing.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:08.554
LOIC DE KERDREL: So in a
way, I survived, in a way.

00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:09.970
LINO CATTARUZZI:
Oh, you did well.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.094
You survived well.

00:32:11.094 --> 00:32:13.760
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, my idea was
that we were lucky, very lucky.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.220
I was saying, we
were very lucky.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.320
It's not only luck.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.540
But we were very lucky
in all the stories.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.540
And I think I'm a
very lucky person.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.320
But luck is, of course, being
rapid in grabbing opportunities

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.430
for sure.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.180
So I grab opportunities
if I can, of course.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.626
LINO CATTARUZZI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:32.626 --> 00:32:34.042
AUDIENCE: So your
company has been

00:32:34.042 --> 00:32:35.251
bought by the French "Poste."

00:32:35.251 --> 00:32:36.333
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes, yes.

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:39.150
AUDIENCE: So speaking about
change of culture and hierarchy

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.179
from owning your company to
being CEO of a company, which

00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:43.470
has been bought by "La Poste"--

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.410
LOIC DE KERDREL: Yes, yes.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.368
AUDIENCE: What do you--

00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:47.110
LOIC DE KERDREL: No, it's a--

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.880
well, I negotiated, in the
deal, to keep my office

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.870
far from the office.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.298
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:58.300
LOIC DE KERDREL: And it
was part of the deal.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.234
They respected that.

00:32:59.234 --> 00:33:01.150
LINO CATTARUZZI: I worry
that they watch this.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.872
Or this is to
preserve the contract.

00:33:02.872 --> 00:33:04.556
LOIC DE KERDREL:
No, no, I'm very--

00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:08.120
and it's a big challenge
for companies to--

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.350
"La Poste," for example,
they want to, of course,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.460
to have a digital
culture because they

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.750
have a big problem.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.000
The stamps business, which is 20
billion euro turnover in France

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.890
is decreasing 10% a year.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.520
Wow.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.400
What do you do?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.550
You have to find solutions.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.940
The strategy is to buy
companies, digital companies

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.770
to prepare the future.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.330
But how do you do?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.400
They integrate that.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.220
They have not, in my opinion,
answered this question.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:43.927
And the fact that we're still
here, what's going to happen?

00:33:43.927 --> 00:33:45.010
When we're going to leave?

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.080
Because the culture
is so different.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.840
And we fight to keep
our culture, basically.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.350
We fight to a certain
extent, basically.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.230
We fight.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.790
And we say, we think it's
a good idea to let us very,

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.500
very far from you if you
want to keep the good people.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.920
They're going to leave if you
put too much hierarchy, too

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.026
much of processes.

00:34:09.026 --> 00:34:11.150
LINO CATTARUZZI: But they
succeeded in this, right?

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.219
You still could have
your own culture.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:13.635
LOIC DE KERDREL: They succeed.

00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.051
But it's a big
challenge for them.

00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:17.440
It's a big, big challenge
because I read something

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.560
about the L'Oreal
CEO today, who said

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.790
that digital culture come from
the ground, not from the top.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.760
You can't say, I want my group
to have a digital culture now.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.550
And you say, do it now.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.679
It doesn't work like this.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.429
It grows from the ground.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.790
So big challenge, I would say.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.300
But they're not too bad.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.362
They're not too
bad in doing this.

00:34:43.362 --> 00:34:46.793
LINO CATTARUZZI: Any
last questions, guys?

00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:47.715
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:48.739
LINO CATTARUZZI: No?

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.864
If not, we're going to do
something very important.

00:34:50.864 --> 00:34:55.710
We're [INAUDIBLE] Loic to be
a mentor for Google as well.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.699
Thank you, Nicola,
for the T-shirt.

00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:58.990
So we're going to give you one.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.780
LOIC DE KERDREL: I
love that, you know.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.700
Thank you very much.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.200
LINO CATTARUZZI:
Next time he comes,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.379
he can mentor a few startup
scene here in the MENA region.

00:35:06.379 --> 00:35:07.670
LOIC DE KERDREL: I love Google.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.160
I bought shares.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.200
I love Google.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:12.042 --> 00:35:13.500
LINO CATTARUZZI:
Thank you so much.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.650
LOIC DE KERDREL:
Thank you, Lino.
