00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.170
don't know what it is or they think of the sales

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.530
in marketing tool. But you can build any kind of app

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.060
on Salesforce. In this first tutorial we're going to answer some of

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.900
the basic questions you might have such as, what is Salesforce?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.270
What can I do with it? What kind of jobs can

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.580
I get if I learn how to use it? Once we

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.630
answer that, we're going to quickly discuss the structure of the course.
