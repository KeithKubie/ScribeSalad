PARKER KUSHIMA: Well,
it was really cold.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.800
It was like low
40s that morning.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.460
And I think we did
a pretty good job.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.660
It was a struggle.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.760
It had to go up and
down a couple of times.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.780
And there was a lot of
maneuvering the poles around.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.689
A thing that we all
say is like no one's

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.230
going to be like criticizing
it, whether it's perfect or not,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.510
but it's more of like a
symbol of like us being here,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.550
and we're celebrating
our heritage.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.330
ZOE TOLEDO: Each fall, to mark
the starting of Native American

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.940
Heritage Month, we
raise the tipi.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.335
The tipi is part of the
Plains Indians tribe,

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:44.280
and we raise it to kind
of physically symbolize

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.694
that a native
population is here.

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:48.360
BRIGID EHRMANTRAUT:
It's a very good way

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.460
for people to walk
past and see something

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029
that's identifiable as
belonging to a native culture.

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:54.570
JAZMYN BLACKBURN:
It's very important

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.330
to celebrate the people who
share a certain identity,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.680
especially in the United States,
that has a variety of people

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.070
of different identities.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.640
So, it's great to dedicate
the month of November

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.810
to that cause.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330
And the tipi is just sort
of a symbol for all of that.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.310
We have other events
throughout the month.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730
We have dinners and
speakers coming in.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.230
So, the tipi is really just
a way to kick all of that off,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.622
and to get the student
body excited about it.

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.080
BRIGID EHRMANTRAUT:
We have a Night

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.190
of Native Cuisine at Whitman
College Dining Hall tonight,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.980
that we're very
excited about, where

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.320
we've been working with
the dining hall staff

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.650
to prepare various
interesting native foods.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.870
That should be wonderful.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.740
It's usually one of our
best-attended events.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.650
And a lot of people
who might not otherwise

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.570
think to attend
one of our events

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.967
go to that because it
is in the dining hall

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:43.800
and it's open to all
Princeton students.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
We have a number of
other events planned,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.430
as well, throughout the term.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.720
We usually have speakers
and musical events.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.520
ZOE TOLEDO: I had always
known that I really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.690
wanted to encourage and pursue
my culture, my community,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.370
and I knew that, in coming to
Princeton, that this culture

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.669
and community would
be small and intimate.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:14.180
My freshman year, it was Emery
Real Bird, Class of 2017,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.030
and Chance Fletcher,
and I, Class of 2018,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.890
we all met together and
we went to this conference

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.560
at Brown University.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.270
And it was the Ivy Native
Council Conference.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.990
And it was there that we saw and
we met all the native students

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.170
in the Ivy League, students who
shared similar stories as us,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.040
similar aspirations,
similar interests.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.870
And it was the energy
from that, that we

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.460
came back and reinstated Natives
at Princeton, previously known

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.100
as Native Americans
at Princeton.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.870
The first thing that
we did, as a group,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.830
was change the name to
Natives at Princeton.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.590
And this is meant to place an
emphasis that there's not just

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.770
indigenous peoples
in the United States,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.380
there is indigenous
First Nations,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.940
there is indigenous
people in South America.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.899
So, we are all
native to somewhere.

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.190
JAZMYN BLACKBURN: There's
sort of this blanket identity

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.232
of being African American,
and that you come from Africa,

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:08.940
and you're black.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.200
And that's all
very good and well,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.890
but that completely eliminates
the native indigenous identity

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.500
of the Caribbean, that my
family is very proud of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.590
and that I come from.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.387
So, having this group here,
to kind of lift that up

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.470
and to celebrate that,
rather than kind of hide it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.500
under a blanket identity,
that the United States tends

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.922
to lean towards, is really

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:29.130
important to me, personally,
and just sort of finding

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.370
my identity at Princeton.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.120
PARKER KUSHIMA: It is
really, I feel like,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.720
all encompassing, and it's
like the symbol of, it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.710
a home on campus
for native students,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.970
it's a gathering place, it's
a place where people can feel

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.400
comfortable learning
about new cultures,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.800
and it's a place where
people can feel comfortable

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.460
sharing their culture.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.870
So, I think that,
as a symbol, it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.680
stands as like just
our way of spreading

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.050
our culture with everyone here.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.800
