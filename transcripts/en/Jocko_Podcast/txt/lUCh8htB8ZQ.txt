Speaker 1:          00:00          In the discipline equals freedom field manual. The section fear reads, how do you overcome feel fear of failure step go. But a previous entry reads, I don't want you to overcome fear of failure. I want you to be afraid of failure. Mind elaborating. Yeah, clearly there's a dichotomy here. I know it's my favorite word apparently according to Dean lister. Yes, I agree. There is a dichotomy here because fear is something good that you should take advantage of. So it's kind of good to be afraid because it keeps you on edge. Agile keeps you from slacking. It keeps you preparing as much as you possibly can and all that stuff is good. But at the same time, yes, if you go too far to the other end of the spectrum, fear gets a hold of you and you can't overcome it. So you freeze or you cower or you runaway.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And none of those are good reactions. So what I obviously failed to communicate well in the book, discipline equals freedom field manual is the dichotomy between these spectrum, the spectrum of fear that you can have. So if you have no fear whatsoever, no fear. Well guess what? You get cocky. You can get arrogant. Um, if you have too much fear, you can't even get out of the gate. You just freeze. You hesitate. So like all dichotomies, you got to balance those two. The, and the way you balance those two is to try and do things that make you feel fear. Right? And try and do things that, that make you feel fear. So that way you get used to it. You can overcome it, you can deal with it, you can utilize it. If you have a fighter, you ever hear UFC fighters that I'll come afraid every time I get in the ring.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Yeah, pretty much everybody. Yeah. Pretty much everybody I'm afraid. Cause you're, you're afraid you're gonna get knocked out. You're afraid. This is, you're afraid that you're afraid I'm gonna lose in front of all my family and friends and all that. So everyone's afraid. So what does that fear do? It drives you to train harder, drives you to prepare. It drives you to keep your hands up and your chin down when you're in the cage. So yeah, there's a healthy level of fear. It can also get, get the best of you. So keep it balanced. Yeah, we talked about this and I think Sam Harris talk about at first as far as the first I heard it made a point not to go too deep into it, but the, where you know, like this. Okay. Fear, uh, how do you overcome fear step go. Right. It's essentially like take action, be brave in the face of fear, right?

Speaker 1:          02:30          But if there's no fear, it's kind of like, hmm, you're not really being brave. You're not, you know, kind of thing. Well that's true too. Yeah. So consider that, that notion, right? So you say, yeah, I want you to be afraid of failure. Oh yeah. Be Afraid of failure, but you still got to step. You still got to go. You still gotta be brief, you know, kind of thing. So they do actually kind of compliment each other. Really. Um, unless you think like, oh yeah. Overcome fear, meaning like, I'm not scared of it anymore. It's literally not figured that it's always fear, but it's more, it's less about the fear being, you know, reduced to zero. It's more about being brave, training yourself to be embraced with here. Yeah. Embrace the fear and the, and so to continue with that thought, in order to embrace the fear, what do you do? You step. Do you go into it? So there you go. There's your answer. Cool.
