00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.120
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.760
discuss the series of events that made it
possible for you to watch Crash Course. And

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
also made this studio possible. And made the
warehouse containing the studio possible.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.449
A warehouse, by the way, that houses stuff
for warehouses. That’s right, it’s time

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.389
to talk about the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:21.900
Although it occurred around the same time
as the French, American, Latin American, and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.600
Haitian Revolutions - between, say, 1750 and
1850 - the industrial revolution was really

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.359
the most revolutionary of the bunch.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.119
Past John: No way, dude. All those other revolutions
resulted in, like, new borders and flags and stuff.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.060
Present John: [sigh] We’ve studied 15,000
years of history here at Crash Course, Me

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.560
from the Past. And borders and flags have
changed plenty, and they’re going to keep

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.500
changing. But in all that time, nothing much changed 
about the way we disposed of waste or located

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.060
drinking water or acquired clothing. Most people lived
on or very close to the land that provided their food.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.650
Except for a few exceptions, life expectancy
never rose above 35 or below 25. Education

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
was a privilege, not a right. In all those
millennia, we never developed a weapon that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.579
could kill more than a couple dozen people
at once, or a way to travel faster than horseback.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:10.069
For 15,000 years, most humans never owned
or used a single item made outside of their

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:15.400
communities. Simon Bolivar didn’t change that and
neither did the American Declaration of Independence.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.579
You have electricity? Industrial Revolution.
Blueberries in February? Industrial Revolution.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.239
You live somewhere other than a farm? Industrial
Revolution. You drive a car? Industrial Revolution.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.680
You get twelve years of free, formal education?
Industrial Revolution. Your bed, your antibiotics,

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.729
your toilet, your contraception, your tap
water, your every waking and sleeping second:

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.380
Industrial Revolution.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.340
[theme music]

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.240
Here’s one simple statistic that sums it
up: Before the industrial revolution, about

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:59.299
80% of the world’s population was engaged
in farming to keep itself and the other 20%

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.200
of people from starving. Today, in the United States,
less than 1% of people list their occupation as farming.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.580
I mean, we’ve come so far that we don’t
even have to farm flowers anymore. Stan, are

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.820
these real, by the way? I can’t tell if
they’re made out of foam or digital. So

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.440
what happened? TECHNOLOGY! Here’s my definition:

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.890
The Industrial Revolution was an increase
in production brought about by the use of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.400
machines and characterized by the use of new
energy sources. Although this will soon get

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
more complicated, for our purposes today,
industrialization is NOT capitalism - although,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.070
as we will see next week, it is connected
to modern capitalism. And, the industrial

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.560
revolution began around 1750 and it occurred
across most of the earth, but it started in

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.220
Europe, especially Britain. What happened?
Well, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700
The innovations of the Industrial Revolution
were intimately interconnected. Like, look,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.040
for instance, at the British textile industry:
The invention of the flying shuttle by John

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.430
Kay in 1733 dramatically increased the speed
of weaving, which in turn created demand for

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.650
yarn, which led to inventions like the Spinning
Jenny and the water frame. Soon these processes

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.840
were mechanized using water power, until the
steam engine came along to make flying shuttles

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.760
really fly in these huge cotton mills.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.480
The most successful steam engine was built
by Thomas “They Didn’t Name Anything After

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.110
Me” Newcomen to clear water out of mines.
And because water was cleared out of those

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.040
mines, there was more coal to power more steam
engines, which eventually led to the fancying

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.290
up of the Newcomen Steam Engine by James “I
Got a Unit of Power and a University Named

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.520
After Me” Watt, whose engine made possible
not only railroads and steamboats but also

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.570
ever-more-efficient cotton mills.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.920
And, for the first time, chemicals other than
stale urine (I wish I was kidding) were being

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.880
used to bleach the cloth that people wore
- the first of which was sulfuric acid, which

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.430
was created in large quantities only thanks
to lead-lined chambers, which would’ve been

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.770
impossible without lead production rising
dramatically right around 1750 in Britain,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.350
thanks to lead foundries powered by coal.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.270
And all these factors came together to make
more yarn that could be spun and bleached

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.600
faster and cheaper than ever before, a process
that would eventually culminate in $18 Crash

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.080
So, the problem here is that with industrialization
being so deeply interconnected, it’s really

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.079
difficult to figure out why it happened in
Europe, especially Britain. And that question

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.880
of why turns out to be one of the more contentious
discussions in world history today.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.790
For instance, here are some Eurocentric reasons
why industrialization might have happened

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.750
first in Europe: There’s the cultural superiority
argument that basically holds that Europeans

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.030
are just better and smarter than other people.
Sometimes this is formulated as Europeans

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.660
possessing superior rationality. By the way,
you’ll never guess where the people who

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.540
make this argument tend to come from - unless
you guessed that they come from Europe.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.900
And then, others argue that only Europe had
the culture of science and invention that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.430
made the creation of these revolutionary technologies
possible. Another argument is that freer political

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.000
institutions encouraged innovation and strong
property rights created incentives for inventors.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.960
And, finally, people often cite Europe’s
small population because small populations

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.919
require labor-saving inventions. Oh, it’s
time for the Open Letter?

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.370
An Open Letter to the Steam Engine. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.660
today. Oh, it’s a TARDIS. Truly the apex
of British industrialization.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.380
Dear Steam Engine, You know what’s crazy?
You’ve really never been improved upon.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.910
Like this thing, which facilitates time travel,
probably runs on a steam engine. Almost all

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.720
electricity around the world, whether it’s
from coal or nuclear power, is just a steam engine.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.740
It’s all still just water and heat, and
it speaks to how truly revolutionary the Industrial

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.880
Revolution was that since then, it’s really
just been evolution. Best Wishes, John Green

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.080
So, you may have heard any of those rationales
for European industrialization, or you may

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.470
have heard others. The problem with all of
them, is that each time you think you’re

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.050
at the root cause it turns out there’s a
cause of the root cause. To quote Leonardo

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.660
DiCaprio, James Cameron, and coal mine operators,
“We have to go deeper.”

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.720
But, anyway, the problem with these Eurocentric
why answers, is that they all apply to either

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.260
China or India or both. And it’s really
important to note that in 1800, it was not

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.660
clear that Europe was going to become the
world’s dominant manufacturing power in

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.440
the next hundred years. At the time, China,
India, and Europe were all roughly at the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.340
same place in terms of industrial production.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.540
First, let’s look at China. It’s hard
to make the European cultural superiority

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.600
argument because China had been recording
its history since before Confucius, and plus

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.000
there was all that bronze and painting and
poetry.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.139
It’s also kind of difficult to make a blanket
statement that China was economically inferior

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.230
to Europe, since they invented paper money
and led the world in exports of everything

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.860
from silk to china. I mean, pre-Industrial
Revolution, population growth was the surest

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.110
sign of economic success, and China had the
biggest population in the world. I guess that

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.790
answers the question of whether they’re
digital.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.120
It’s also difficult to say that China lacked
a culture of invention when they invented

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.330
gunpowder, and printing, and paper, and arguably
compasses. And China had more free enterprise

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.560
during the Song dynasty than anywhere in the
world.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.310
Some argue that China couldn’t have free
enterprise because they had a long history

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.440
of trying to impose monopolies on items like
salt and iron. And that’s true, but when

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.340
it comes to enforcing those monopolies, they
also had a long history of failure. So really,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.210
in a lot of ways, China was at least as primed
for an Industrial Revolution as Britain was.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.060
So, why didn’t it happen? Well, Europeans
- specifically the British - had two huge

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.900
advantages: First, Coal. When you trace the
story of improved transportation, or communication,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.180
or industrial efficiency, or better chemical
manufacturing, it always comes back to coal,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.120
because the Industrial Revolution was all about
using different forms of energy to automate production.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.280
And England had large supplies of coal that
were near the surface, which meant that it

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.110
was cheap to mine, so it quickly replaced
wood for heating and cooking and stuff. So

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.350
that encouraged the British to look for more
coal. The only problem with coal mining, aside

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.260
from it being, you know, like, deadly and
everything, is that the coal mines flooded

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.270
all the time. I guess coal mining is also
a little problematic for, like, the health

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.850
of, you know, like, the planet.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.010
But, because there was all this incentive
to get more coal out of the ground, steam

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.919
engines were invented to pump water out of
the mines. And because those early steam engines

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:52.569
were super inefficient, they needed a cheap
and abundant source of fuel in order to work

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.270
- namely, coal, which meant they were much
more useful to the British than anyone else.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.330
So steam engines used cheap British coal to
keep British coal cheap, and cheap British

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.919
coal created the opportunity for everything
from railroads to steel, which like so much

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.820
else in the Industrial Revolution, created
a positive feedback loop. Because they run

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.770
on rails, railroads need steel. And because
it is rather heavy, steel needs railroads.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.460
Secondly, there were Wages. Britain (and to
a lesser extent the Low Countries) had the

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.139
highest wages in the world at the beginning
of the 18th century. In 1725, wages in London

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:26.339
were the equivalent of 11 grams of silver
per day. In Amsterdam, they were 9 grams.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.860
In Beijing, Venice, and Florence, they were
under 4. And in Delhi, they were under 2.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.950
It’s not totally clear why wages were so
high in Britain. Like, one argument is that

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.380
the Black Death lowered population so much
that it tightened labor markets, but that

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.599
doesn’t explain why wages remained low in,
like, plague-ravaged Italy. Mainly, high wages

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:45.360
combined with cheap fuel costs meant that
it was economically efficient for manufacturers

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.680
to look to machines as a way of lowering their
production costs. To quote the historian Robert

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.140
Allen: “Wages were high and energy was cheap.
These prices led directly to the industrial

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.740
revolution by giving firms strong incentives
to invent technologies that substituted capital

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.200
and coal for labor.”

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.640
Ugh, Stan, I’m a little worried that people
are still going to accuse me of Eurocentrism.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:08.580
Of course, other people will accuse me of
an anti-European bias. I don’t have a bias

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.300
against Europe. I love Europe. Europe gave
me many of my favorite cheeses and cross-country

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.279
skiing and Charlie Chaplin, who inspired today’s
Danica drawing.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:20.950
Like, the fact of coal being near the surface
in Britain can’t be chalked up to British

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.420
cultural superiority. But the wages question
is a little different because it makes it

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.020
sound like only Europeans were smart enough
to pay high wages.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.130
But here’s one last thing to consider: India
was the world’s largest producer of cotton

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.210
textiles, despite paying basically the lowest
wages in the world. Indian agriculture was

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.270
so productive that laborers could be supported
at a very low cost. And that, coupled with

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.300
a large population, meant that Indian textile
manufacturing could be very productive without

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.640
using machines, so they didn’t need to industrialize.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.510
But more importantly from our perspective,
there’s a strong argument to be made that

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.700
Indian cotton production helped spur British
industrialization. It was cotton textiles

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.440
that drove the early Industrial Revolution,
and the main reason that Britain was so eager

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.029
to produce cottons was that demand was incredibly
high. They were more comfortable than woolens,

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:05.109
but they were also cheaper, because cottons
could be imported from India at such a low cost.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:10.040
So, Indian cottons created the market and
then British manufacturers invested in machines

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.730
(and imported Indian know-how) to increase
production so that they could compete with

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.640
India. And that’s at least one way in which
European industrialization was truly a world

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.100
phenomenon. For those of you who enjoy such
highly contentious and thorny, cultural historical

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.080
debates, good news. Next week, we’ll be
talking about capitalism.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.960
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you then.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.740
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.640
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. We are ably

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.130
interned by Meredith Danko. And our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.050
Last week’s phrase of the week was "The
New England Revolution." That was challenging.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.970
If you want to suggest future phrases of the
week or take a guess at this week's, you can

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.630
do so in comments, where you can also ask
questions about today’s video that will

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.570
be answered by our team of historians.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.290
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
