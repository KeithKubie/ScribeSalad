attention to the people that could
 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.670
attention to the people that could
understand those patterns were the

understand those patterns were the
 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220

brain or how to almost take advantage of
 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.950
brain or how to almost take advantage of
those evolutionary principles and we use

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960
those evolutionary principles and we use
 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.540
those evolutionary principles and we use
that as a starting point and we layer

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
that as a starting point and we layer
 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.219
that as a starting point and we layer
our music on top of that from there

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229

what's really important about our

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999
what's really important about our
 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.599
what's really important about our
company is that we are science first so

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609
company is that we are science first so
 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.969
company is that we are science first so
what that means is we take it seriously

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
what that means is we take it seriously
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.240
what that means is we take it seriously
and every single thing that we do we try

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250
and every single thing that we do we try
 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.880
and every single thing that we do we try
to validate with science one of the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890
to validate with science one of the
 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.740
to validate with science one of the
really exciting things about our focus

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750
really exciting things about our focus
 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.510

medications it's with the same kind of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
medications it's with the same kind of
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.600
medications it's with the same kind of
scientific rigor that we also apply for

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610
scientific rigor that we also apply for
 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.270
scientific rigor that we also apply for
our relax or meditation and our sleep

ADHD studies contain how do we replicate

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560
ADHD studies contain how do we replicate
 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.480
ADHD studies contain how do we replicate
the same kinds of intense focus that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490
the same kinds of intense focus that
 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.870
the same kinds of intense focus that
these drugs do but on demand and in a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
these drugs do but on demand and in a
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.390
these drugs do but on demand and in a
more controlled environment so when you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400
more controlled environment so when you
 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.000
more controlled environment so when you
take you know these different kinds of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010
take you know these different kinds of
 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.800
take you know these different kinds of
medications they last for a certain

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
medications they last for a certain
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.480
medications they last for a certain
period of time and that's not always

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490
period of time and that's not always
 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.210
period of time and that's not always
needed sometimes you just need 30

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220
needed sometimes you just need 30
 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.700
needed sometimes you just need 30
minutes or an hour maybe two hours of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
minutes or an hour maybe two hours of
 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.500
minutes or an hour maybe two hours of
intense focus and then when you're done

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510
intense focus and then when you're done
 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.250
intense focus and then when you're done
you can stop and really what we're doing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260
you can stop and really what we're doing
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.610
you can stop and really what we're doing
is we're using fMRI EEG data to help us

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
is we're using fMRI EEG data to help us
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.410
is we're using fMRI EEG data to help us
validate that this is something

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
validate that this is something
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.080
validate that this is something
that can peak that state on demand with

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
that can peak that state on demand with
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.120
that can peak that state on demand with
no use of drugs and just the neural

phase locking in our music and the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349
phase locking in our music and the
 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.660
phase locking in our music and the
reason I'm passionate about it is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
reason I'm passionate about it is
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.360
reason I'm passionate about it is
because there are so many people in the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
because there are so many people in the
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.150
because there are so many people in the
world and let alone just America that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
world and let alone just America that
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.170
world and let alone just America that
are having challenges with a DD ADHD

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
are having challenges with a DD ADHD
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.870
are having challenges with a DD ADHD
right now we prescribe so much

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880
right now we prescribe so much
 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.199
right now we prescribe so much
medication to kids that's very close to

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209
medication to kids that's very close to
 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.920
medication to kids that's very close to
cocaine and what's happening is we're in

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
cocaine and what's happening is we're in
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.710
cocaine and what's happening is we're in
the cycle of prescribing now I'm not

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720
the cycle of prescribing now I'm not
 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.410
the cycle of prescribing now I'm not
trying to erase those drugs and I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
trying to erase those drugs and I'm
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.809
trying to erase those drugs and I'm
trying to what we're trying to do is

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819
trying to what we're trying to do is
 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.240
trying to what we're trying to do is
actually give someone another option

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
actually give someone another option
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.140
actually give someone another option
because right now you have ADHD you have

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150
because right now you have ADHD you have
 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.240
because right now you have ADHD you have
these problems you're a parent you just

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
these problems you're a parent you just
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.520
these problems you're a parent you just
want your kid to study to focus to do

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
want your kid to study to focus to do
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.800
want your kid to study to focus to do
well and what often other options do you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
well and what often other options do you
 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
well and what often other options do you
have it's a really big deal because if

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
have it's a really big deal because if
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.199
have it's a really big deal because if
we can help people have another option

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209
we can help people have another option
 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.780
we can help people have another option
we could be a preliminary step we could

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
we could be a preliminary step we could
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.130
we could be a preliminary step we could
be a combination or it could be a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140
be a combination or it could be a
 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.680
be a combination or it could be a
replacement altogether and have someone

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690
replacement altogether and have someone
 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.120
replacement altogether and have someone
be able to control this advanced focus

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130
be able to control this advanced focus
 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.759
be able to control this advanced focus
on demand is extremely important because

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769
on demand is extremely important because
 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.060
on demand is extremely important because
of that reason I think as we move

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
of that reason I think as we move
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.910
of that reason I think as we move
forward as a culture it's really about

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920
forward as a culture it's really about
 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.949
forward as a culture it's really about
just having choices at the end of the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959
just having choices at the end of the
 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.009
just having choices at the end of the
day and what brain FM is is a brand-new

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019
day and what brain FM is is a brand-new
 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.410
day and what brain FM is is a brand-new
choice that people have to be able to

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420
choice that people have to be able to
 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.590
choice that people have to be able to
have that effect that they're looking

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600
have that effect that they're looking
 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.840
have that effect that they're looking
for so brain FM we create functional

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
for so brain FM we create functional
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.610
for so brain FM we create functional
music to help you focus relax and sleep

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
music to help you focus relax and sleep
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.289
music to help you focus relax and sleep
better it's all backed by science

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299
better it's all backed by science
 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.930
better it's all backed by science
research and evidence in the continual

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940
research and evidence in the continual
 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.430
research and evidence in the continual
improvement of that so what that

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
improvement of that so what that
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.349
improvement of that so what that
basically means is how do we produce

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359
basically means is how do we produce
 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.720
basically means is how do we produce
music that is designed from mental

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730
music that is designed from mental
 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.330
music that is designed from mental
states from the ground up and what we do

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340
states from the ground up and what we do
 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.099
states from the ground up and what we do
is we actually start with a mental state

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109
is we actually start with a mental state
 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.250
is we actually start with a mental state
in mind and we have a brain protocol and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260
in mind and we have a brain protocol and
 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.410

we craft music around that so in the end

the same time to get there into that
 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.839
the same time to get there into that
state and then as long as you're

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849
state and then as long as you're
 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.700
state and then as long as you're
listening to the music stay in that

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710
listening to the music stay in that
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.660
listening to the music stay in that
