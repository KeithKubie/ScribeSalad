00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.790
MAN (VOICEOVER): Susie's here.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.620
We've been building a wicked
Corvette for her, man.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.670
A beautiful C4 car.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.880
Susie, how you doing?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.710
I'm doing wonderful,
I'm excited.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.170
Feeling good?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.380
She's a cool lady.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.830
The car is amazing.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.830
I hope she digs it, man.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.620
Come on baby, bring
out that Vette.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.290
And yes, it's
really the same car.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.670
Oh my god.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.250
Oh my god, she's gorgeous.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.000
It's-- more beautiful
than I imagined it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.250
She's all yours.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.580
MAN (VOICEOVER): We wanted to
update Susie's beloved Vette.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.170
But we kept all that
head-turning 80s charm.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.420
The car is still fast as
it was back in the day.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.250
So we concentrated on her looks.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.710
Now we did a few things
like replace hoses and belts

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.750
and tuned it up, added a
beautiful Borla exhaust setup.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.920
But that's about it.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.580
And that banana
yellow paint might

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.580
have been hot back in 1987.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.920
But for the new millennium
we turn Susie's Vette

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.000
into a tangerine dream.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.750
Ryan added black accents
in all the right places

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.880
to make her look sleek,
fast, and totally unique.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.540
New wheels and tires and a
fully customized interior

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.750
complete this
totally cool, fully

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.210
updated 80s street machine.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.580
MAN: Some of the obvious stuff
that we did, we completely

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.790
changed the rear end.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.750
The whole back
bumper of the car,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.460
we wanted to update it to
the ZR1 styled rear bumper.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.460
It's just a really pretty
back end look to it.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.290
And Ghetto Bob here, I'm going
to give some monster kudos.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.960
All right.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.790
The rear wing on this car
was something that you loved.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.580
But it never was
really very correct

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.790
in its original installation.
- Right.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.620
That's the same old wing,
it's just been modified.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.290
Right.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.920
It's flatter, and it's cut
out for the [inaudible] that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.500
you used to hit all the time.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.120
So it's how it should have
been built the first time.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.620
Exactly.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.960
That's how it should it
come first the first way.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.170
RYAN: Matches the body
lines much better.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.330
SHANNON: Right.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.830
SUSIE: I love that black.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.830
That's a surprise.
RYAN: Yep.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.250
SHANNON: Yeah.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.500
SUSIE: That is-- I
didn't even imagine that.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080
Black and orange
go together so well.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.460
SUSIE: So well.
MAN: Yes they do.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.750
RYAN: Especially
with that much glass

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.790
all the way around
the top of the car.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.330
SUSIE: Yes.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.170
RYAN: There's so many oranges
that have been overdone.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.460
And this orange is
usually forgotten.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.000
Because most people
don't apply it right.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.960
They apply it over
the wrong color

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.170
and it just comes out kind
of dingy and almost brown.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.920
This one, we applied it
over the correct color.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.750
It came out bright and vibrant.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.250
It's almost like a butterscotch.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.580
It really accentuates
all the body lines.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.040
And with all the glass, the huge
glass hatch top, even the glass

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.500
roof, and all the
windows around it,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.380
there was so much
black already there.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.380
SUSIE: Right.
- I just took advantage of that.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
Brought the black across the
hood and across the back.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.210
And it lowers the
whole top of the car.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.540
It just squishes it even more.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.000
Oh, it looks even
faster than it was before.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.710
MAN: Exactly.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.330
We added a whole
new set of wheels.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.710
You had some old school
gold wheels on it.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.170
SUSIE: Oh, gold wheels.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.210
RYAN: Which were very
proper back in the day.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.380
SUSIE: In the-- yes.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500
But we took it
into a modern car.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.670
So we added these
insanely gorgeous

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.330
gloss black wheels on it.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.960
We went with a Cooper
tire RS3 set up on it.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.120
They're like a summertime tie.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.710
They're really sticky.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.000
So for a car like this,
it'll handle phenomenal.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.710
And trust me, these
guys have been building

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.750
tires for 100 plus years.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.880
They're absolutely phenomenal.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.210
I love their product.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.420
So car sticks to the
ground like amazing.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.420
- Yeah.
- And you got to see the inside.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.920
Oh!

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.380
You're not going to
believe what happened inside.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.420
- I know, I know.
- Inside got even crazier.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.170
[gasps]

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.000
How does that feel in there?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.670
Like I'm never
getting out of it.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.670
How do you like that
dark, dark wood in there?

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.920
I love it.
MAN: It's beautiful.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.000
SUSIE: Beautiful.
It's classy.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.670
RYAN: It's not real wood.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.250
So it's not going to fall
apart and delaminate over time.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.080
SUSIE: It's beautiful.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.880
MAN: This is the
first C4 we've done.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.920
And when it came
in, it was a lot

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920
of sitting around
staring at it, wondering

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.580
what are we going to do.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.960
And this car has now made a
serious believer out of us.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.790
And I personally love it.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.710
This car is beautiful.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.880
It's not for sale.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.750
MAN: Come on, man!

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.620
I love her more than
the day I got it in 1988.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.790
Amen.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.120
I thought it was
beautiful then.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.620
MAN: It was.
SUSIE: This is more beautiful.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.620
Thank you so much.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.790
You're welcome, darling.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.380
Man, I got to
tell you, there's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.790
nothing like seeing a lady
in love with her Corvette.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.420
She is so happy, man.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.960
Susie and Mike, these two
been married for 50 years.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.460
Most cars don't
even last that long.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.540
So I'm so happy that
we get to put a dot

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.120
on the I in this love story.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.040
Starring Susie, Mike, and
a little orange Corvette.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.830
If you guys are happy, let's
go do a little paperwork

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.750
and get you on your
way to Palm Springs.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.460
So you can scare Mike
on that back road.
