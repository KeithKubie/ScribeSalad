BRADY FORREST: Hi.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:27.838
I'm Brady Forrest.

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.340
Welcome to Ignite.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.480
We're going to have a fun
hour for you to cap off

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400
your day here at Google IO.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
It's going to be unlike any
other session that you were

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.920
in, in that is not
heavily scripted.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.158
It is a bunch of people coming
together that share their

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.640
ideas and passions.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.440
As mentioned, I'm
Brady Forrest.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
I am with O'Reilly, and many,
many years ago, I start now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.538
many years ago, I
started Ignite.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660
I also run Radar and do a
bunch of other conferences.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.020
About 3 years ago, my friend,
Bre Pettis and I wanted

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.580
a geek event for our
friends in Seattle.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.060
And we wanted a place where
they could share their thoughts

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.200
and passions, but very quickly.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.340
Because not everybody
is that interesting!

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.700
And so, to do that, we set
some constraints around it.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.080
But we wanted to make it a safe
place for them to do that.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.760
We wanted to make it fun for
the audience and so all along

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.920
those lines, we invented
a torturous format.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.260
And, we would ply the
speakers with beer.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.580
We would ply the
audience with beer.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.100
I apologize in advance.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.960
We were unable to procure
any for this session.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.940
But each speaker gets just 20
slides, 15 seconds a slide,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.040
for a total of 5 minutes.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.380
The speakers are not in control
of their slides entire time.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.160
So, once they're up here, as
you've seen me do, they

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.660
kind of tap dance as their
slides change, and, in this

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.200
case, we have 10 talks.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.140
We're going to be beginning
with Clay Johnson, learning

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.780
about the ins and outs of DC,
and we are going to be ending

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.420
with, "Where the Hell is
Matt?" And "A Great

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.058
Dance Around the World".

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:14.118
If you want to Tweet about it,
share your your thoughts on it,

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:17.228
look up information about this
later, use the hash

00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:17.360
tag, Ignite IO.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.658
I won't be checking Twitter
during this; I'll be too busy

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:27.046
hoping that Powerpoint doesn't
crash just so you know.

00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:29.318
If you've never heard of
Ignite, Ignite's in over a

00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:31.018
100 cities around the world.

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.440
It's spread far.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.460
It's spread wide.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.738
And if you want to throw
your own, just let me know.

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:38.358
There are thousands of
Ignite videos on line

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.380
at IgniteShow.com.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.538
And it is super easy
and fun to start.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.080
You really just need to borrow
a microphone and about 20

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.338
geeks, which I'm sure anyone
here could round up.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.538
Now, I'd like to welcome
up our first speaker.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:03:00.838
He is based in DC.

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:02.618
He's one of the people charged
with basically trying to

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:04.278
make our government
more transparent.

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:05.900
He does this through
Sunlight Labs.

00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.818
Please welcome up their
CTO, Clay Johnson.

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:14.958
CLAY JOHNSON: How
are you guys doing?

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:15.098
No, no, no no!

00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:16.538
Come on!

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:16.658
This is Ignite!

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:18.340
This is Ignite!

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:21.358
That's what I'm talking about!
67
00:03:21,358 --&gt; 00:03:21,278
I'm Clay Johnson.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:24.338
I direct Sunlight Lab at
the Sunlight Foundation.

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:27.958
My primary job is
fighting Zombies.

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:30.598
I fight Zombies in Washington
DC, where a lot of

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:31.038
them get created.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.860
And we work with
government data.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.778
And I need your help to
fight these Zombies too.

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:42.638
Zombies, for the most part,
are being generated by bad

00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:44.538
information and bad access
to information, generally

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:46.038
by people like this.

00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:50.438
This is Glenn Beck and he
is a Zombie producer.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.638
Also Keith Olbermann, in the
interest of partisanship,

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:54.338
is also a Zombie producer.

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:58.720
And other people who produce
really commercial information.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.278
It's like commercially
process food.

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:02.018
This is Tyson's Any'Tizers.

00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:03.458
They're Dippin' Twists.

00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:07.818
Good for any time.

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:13.138
And I don't know what the fuck
they're made out of, man!

00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:14.778
And it's the same thing
with information.

00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:16.838
If you think about it
information and food

00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:17.800
are pretty similar.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.838
They have these food
chains, right?

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:23.300
So food goes from organic
matter to vegetables, meats, to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.940
people, and facts go data, to
wire services, to bloggers

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.620
and distributors, people.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.138
At the top of both of these
food chains are Zombies!

00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:36.220
And that's what we have to fix.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.318
So what I do is,
I fight Zombies.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.958
What we do, is we get
data out of government

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:43.958
to empower people.

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.860
Now here's a good example of
some Zombies; Don't Steal

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.760
from Medicare to Support
Socialized Medicine.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.772
It's the equivalent of
people saying "Brains.

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:01.278
Brains" So, we
take this data, right?

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:04.898
This is every campaign
contribution, not every one,

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:08.178
but this is a cobalt base file
of every campaign contribution

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:10.878
that every member of
Congress has ever received.

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:13.740
And we make it so that people
can easily say, that hey, maybe

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.620
our health care system is
messed up because of campaign

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.638
contributions and lobbyists
and stuff like that, right?

00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:21.240
So, this is
TransparencyData.com where you

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.940
can easily get all of the
Nelson's campaign contributions

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.380
at the State or Federal of
level over the past 30 years

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.820
and you can get API.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.078
You can do cool things with the
it, like integrate it with

00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:36.740
Gmail, so you can see
who is contributing.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.720
It does a look up for the
sender of the email.

00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:46.458
It also checks for lobbyists,
so you can be aware registered

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:47.278
federal lobbyists
that email you.

00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:51.320
So, in 4000BC, writing
was a trade secret of

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.920
a professional scribe.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.318
It was locked up and
not given to people.

00:05:55.318 --> 00:05:59.838
And, I think something
interesting has changed now.

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:01.790
Instead of writing, it's truth
that's a trade secret of

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.258
professional scribes.

00:06:02.258 --> 00:06:06.058
And, it's up to developers to
really bust down that barrier,

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:10.660
because we have the power to
change Washington, DC through

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.938
giving people better
access to the truth.

00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:17.178
Now these are currently
truth-tellers.

00:06:17.698 --> 00:06:20.740
They're called
"Bloggers" Well, on

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.618
the left you have a Blogger,
next the Blogger, and Social

00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:28.318
Media Expert and, then you have
a Marketing Consultant and some

00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:32.698
dude who got poisoned with LSD
or something like that.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.278
But developers can tell
the truth through code.

00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:39.078
They can start using data to
give people better access to

00:06:39.078 --> 00:06:42.758
the truth and build tools like
for transparency data or tools

00:06:42.758 --> 00:06:45.180
on top of transparency data
to give people access the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.040
sane, rational thought.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.860
You go to this web site here,
the National Data Catalog, and

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.300
say hey, maybe a mine exploded
and you wanted to see the mine

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.458
safety records of all
of the United States.

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:58.278
You can get that data right
here and start saying, hey

00:06:58.278 --> 00:07:01.060
maybe Massey Energy isn't doing
well by its employees, and

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.900
is killing its employees.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.940
You can do the same thing with,
say there's an oil spill.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.420
You can see where people are
getting their oil from, and

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.060
how much foreign oil we
are actually dependent on.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.620
Then you can start tying
all this data together.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.540
This is a web site that one of
our grantees built called

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.578
LittleSis.com that allows
people to tie alll this data

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:25.278
together, and build profiles.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.798
It's a mandatory Facebook
of influential people.

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:28.878
It's pretty awesome.

00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:29.038
So.

00:07:29.038 --> 00:07:31.498
That's a Zombie.

00:07:33.398 --> 00:07:37.100
So these tools help you fight
these people, and make it so

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.498
that your arms don't get
chewed off by a pretty,

00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:45.220
blue eyed Zombie.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.338
So, one last thing, fighting
Zombies makes you money.

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:54.638
GPS, weather, all kinds of
data initiatives coming from

00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:58.720
government have created massive
economies, massive industries,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.120
and this isn't just a social
cause, it's something much

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.420
more significant than that.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.958
So, thank you very much.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:05.638
You guys have been great!

00:08:06.898 --> 00:08:11.998
Let's hear it for Brady.
164
00:08:11,998 --&gt; 00:08:11,698
BRADY FORREST: And thank
you very much, Clay.

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.660
And now we're going to
move away from DC.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.920
All the way back to Mountain
Dew, and Seattle with the

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.278
former Googler, the woman
behind the original

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:26.180
Web Master Central.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.458
Please welcome up Vanessa
Fox, a seeker of truth.

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.000
VANESSA FOX: Okay.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.740
Thank you, Brady.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.330
So, normally, we have these
things in a pub, and you're

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.200
all drunk and its awesome,
and I'm so much better.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.980
But, so, since we're not in a
pub today, we're going to find

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.060
out the meaning of life.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.520
I checked Google first.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.980
The meaning of life, of course,
they say it's 42, which used to

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.720
be really awesome, but now with
the movie coming out, a

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.880
few years ago, everyone
knows the answer is 42.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.040
If you do the Flicker search,
you see that it's old hat.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.280
So, we're not cool anymore
to really know anymore

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.540
the answer 42.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.100
But they also think the
meaning of life is Google,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.640
so that scared me.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.580
So, I thought that I would look
for the meaning of life on

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.332
Bing, because that's
the decision engine.
188
00:09:05,526 --&gt; 00:09:05,3
Sorry Google.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.100
They told me I should look for
what's my dragon name, which

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.678
lead me to a site to find a
dragon name for my dog,

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.660
horse, cat or child.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.398
That was very disturbing.

00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:20.380
I thought, perhaps that I
instead, I would try Yahoo,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.000
another search engine.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.620
It told me to find the
meaning of life on these

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:30.520
3 places, in this order.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.958
And, the bible is the only one
in lower case which I didn't

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.798
know exactly what that meant.

00:09:35.798 --> 00:09:37.398
So I went to Twitter first
and it actually pointed

00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:38.640
me to Facebook.

00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:40.200
And so, I thought, okay.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.720
And the meaning of life is
Robert Pattinson looks like

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.500
a foot, of Twilight fame.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.980
I didn't think this was really
leading me in the direction

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.980
I had been looking for.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.480
So, I thought I'd do another
search on Facebook, What's

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.758
the meaning of Life?

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.960
It told me to YouTube,
back to Google, right?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.518
The number 2 engine is YouTube.

00:09:56.898 --> 00:10:00.260
This is what YouTube said that
the meaning of life was.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.220
This is actually disturbed me
maybe just as much as Robert

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.100
Patterson looks like a foot.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.340
So, I didn't learn the meaning
of life, but what I did

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.840
learn was that people are
crazy on the internet.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.180
And, I was like, OK, maybe
I'm just looking at

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.500
the wrong thing.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.620
Maybe I just really need
to know why are people on

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.720
the internet so crazy?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.520
So, this is the next
search that I did.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.040
And, what I found
was that this.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.038
I do research a serious subject
and what I found find is that

00:10:26.038 --> 00:10:29.120
the author would like to shoot
the pope, or would like to do

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.778
strange things to my
unmentionable parts.

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:33.340
And also, by the way, why
do all the crazy people

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.580
use the caps button?

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.420
And these things seem to be an
equal interest to this person.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.980
So, I thought, well,
that's a good question?

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.380
So, why do all crazy people
use caps on the internet?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.520
And what I found was, does
anyone have a good recipe

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.320
for a red velvet cake.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.060
And, I was like, yeah,
dude I love cake.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.700
I ended on this site, which
with a bunch of people in a

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.400
flame war about whether the
Star Trek characters should

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.200
really be on the cake because
really, was he a navigator?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.358
And ended up with this guy
saying, have you kissed a girl?

00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:06.400
Turn off caps-lock
on your computer.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.700
So I thought I'm going to
really go to the root of crazy

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.260
people and ask them what the
meaning of life is, which of

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.020
course, lead me ChatRoulette.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.484
Then, I looked into
Chatroulette, and I was

00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:19.240
like, you know, I'm
not going after all.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.840
I don't need know the
meaning of life that bad.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.880
So, instead that validated that
people on the internet or crazy

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.720
but also the other thing, of
course, is that we

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.660
all search, right?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.220
You've all been searching,
and you found that people

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.780
wanted to things to your
unmentionable parts.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.820
So, we do 2.9 million
searches a minute.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.900
We use major search engines for
everything. 71% of us use major

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.420
search engines for looking
for health information.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.400
So, life or death.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.180
Are we going to live?

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.980
Are we going to die?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.040
And we're doing searches with
all of those crazy people on

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.260
ChatRoulette, and this is how
we're getting our information.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.340
The same is true with
government information.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.740
A study just found that search
engines was how we get our

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.978
government data that apparently
cause us to be Zombies, so

00:12:00.978 --> 00:12:01.978
that that's a bit scary.

00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:05.580
We used to use the library to
get information, but it turns

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.520
out that the days, that only
13% of people use the library

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.078
as that place to find
information. 58% use it to look

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:18.040
for reference books, but except
that 65% use it to go on the

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.640
internet where all the
crazy people are.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.140
So there is a Slate article
that talked about this.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.600
That we really like to seek and
search, and when we do that, it

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.280
causes the chemicals in our
brain to mimic the state that

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.020
we're in when we're on cocaine.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.460
And so that causes us just to
keep searching more and more.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.700
Sort of, that's how I ended up
seeing that cat crazy guy.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.918
So apparently when you search,
this is what happens.

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:45.298
So this is kind of
article ended.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.058
If humans seeking machines,
we've created the perfect

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.740
machines to allow us
to seek endlessly.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.000
So, what does that mean, right?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.360
So some other experts have
looked it, and said, OK we

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.060
don't get really good search
results, but the reason we

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.786
don't, is because most of the
queries we do are

00:12:59.786 --> 00:12:59.900
a single word.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.978
So its our own fault.

00:13:00.978 --> 00:13:02.998
It's all you guy's fault that
you ended up at the crazy

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:05.500
people, because you just didn't
know how to search correctly.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.058
Some other people are
like, well, maybe

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:08.958
that's not the problem.

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.838
Maybe it's just that there's so
much information out there.

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:14.360
There's not a good way to
catalog it, and we think

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.820
if it's popular or in the
top 10 search results,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.158
it must be accurate.

00:13:17.158 --> 00:13:18.740
Which isn't true.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.400
So what should we do with this?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.980
So, I would say this.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.498
When we search, its like
we're on drugs, so therefore

00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:29.020
we're not going to stop.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.320
We're going to keep
doing it more and more.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.498
And yet, what we're ending up
with is a world full of crazy

00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:37.760
people so what does that mean
for the future of how we

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.100
interact with information?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.160
Thank you.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.640
BRADY FORREST: And we're lucky
to have our next speaker here,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.320
because he was almost eaten
over the North Atlantic.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.100
Please welcome Bradley Vickers.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.820
BRADLEY VICKERS: I'm going to
talk about rowing across the

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.820
North Atlantic ocean from New
York to Thalamus, England.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.160
It's a journey of about
3200 nautical miles.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.780
And, I completed it
in about 71 days.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.460
Just over 71 days with
my 3 other teammates.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.360
And we recognize by Guinness
World Records as having had the

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.320
first landfall to landfall
crossing of the North

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.020
Atlantic ocean.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.140
I think that you can take some
hopefully observations from

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.220
this crossing and apply to
whatever projects you guys

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.740
might be involved with.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.200
The actual expedition took
about 18 months to prepare for.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.820
And part of that was
getting our team together.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.330
The 4 of us had rowed
together in college, and

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.680
we figured, why not?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.760
Let's row across an ocean.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.440
We also had to outfit our 28 by
6 foot ocean rowboat with a

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.400
solar panel and that fueled our
communications and our

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.120
navigation systems and it also
powered our desalinator, which

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.260
converted salt water
into fresh water.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.380
Now the actual crossing
is both the mental and

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.160
physical challenge.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.240
As you can see from the slide
behind me, the transformation

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.540
both physically and
mentally that I underwent.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.260
That last one, I'm loosin' it!

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.640
Get me to shore!

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.620
Part of the physical nature of
this, is we were rowing in

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:28.140
shifts of 2 hours. 2 hours on,
2 hours off. 2 on, 2 off, 2 on,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.848
2 off. 24 hours a day,
someone's at the oars

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:32.440
for 12 of those.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.420
So we're continually
sleep-deprived.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.340
You see Jordan there, in the
corner, sleeping were 1

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.220
eye open in the cabin.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.380
It's a very cramped cabin.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.660
It's about 8 foot by 5 foot, so
you never getting full rest.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.420
You're also having to keep
yourself clean and your

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.160
clothing, because you don't
want to get salt waters sores.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.320
And we were downloading
satellite images of the North

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.280
Atlantic and weather reports
and uploading our blog via

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.540
Iridium satellite phone.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.320
So we need to the eat
during our 2 hours off.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.600
And we had budgeted between 8,
sorry 7 and 8,000 calories

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.820
per rower per day.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.240
It was an immense
amount of food.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.980
I was in charge of planning the
food, and I miscalculated.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.400
Which is not a fun thing
to tell your teammates.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.480
I realize it on day 14 and it
took me until day 17 that I

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.600
worked up the courage
to tell my teammates.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.660
We would lose a
combined 137 pounds.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:48.380
I lost 28, Dylan 32, Jordan,
35 and Greg, 42 pounds!

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.900
Now, ultimately we were
successful in achieving our

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.260
goal which was rowing across
the North Atlantic without

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.420
physical assistance, so we
couldn't be resupplied by food.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.358
We achieved that, and I think
the outlook that we had and the

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:08.638
process we went through can be
applied to getting through

00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:11.880
challenging settings with a
group of people in

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.760
a team dynamic.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.372
We were on a 29 by 6 foot boat
and we couldn't get off, so

00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:18.320
we had to work together.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.178
One of the ways that we
work together is we had

00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:25.340
conversations for the boat, and
we had conversation for land.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.700
If it was constructive,
if it was productive,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.380
it was for the boat.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.760
If it was destructive, or if
we are trying to find out

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.500
whose fault it was, mainly
mine, it was for land.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.760
Hopefully, over a large a
warm meal and multiple

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.620
cold beverages!

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.020
So we kept ourselves focused on
solution based suggestions.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.640
The other thing is our process.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.540
Immediately upon realizing that
we were short on food, we

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.360
inventoried the entire boat, so
we could start dealing with

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.180
some facts and numbers and we
realized if we rationed, we

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.720
could make it to England.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.000
So we had a plan.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.540
And we had that plan, we had
something to focus our efforts

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.700
and our energies towards,
rather than bickering amongst

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.460
ourselves, and we made
progress towards our goal.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.780
And with that plan, we
learned more information.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.580
We learned how we responded
the low calorie intake.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.240
And we constantly readjusted
our plan, but our goal

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.180
remained constant.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.740
And I think that's huge when
you're working on a project.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.318
Don't shift your goal to
meet the settings that

00:18:34.318 --> 00:18:35.558
you find yourself in.

00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:38.038
Constantly adjust your plan and
your own actions that you're

00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:41.700
taking to achieve that goal.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.040
I've really enjoyed sharing my
experience with all of you and

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.040
I hope that you're able to take
these stories and apply them to

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.338
whatever pursuits that you're
in and whether personal,

00:18:53.338 --> 00:18:57.340
professional, whatever passions
they are, I wish you the best

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:10.360
of luck in achieving
your own adventures.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.760
Thank you.

[APPLAUSE]

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.600
BRADY FORREST: Thank you
very much, Bradley.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.180
As I mentioned, there are
Ignites around the world.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.640
And we're lucky to have the
organizer of the Community

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.440
Leadership Summit Ignite here.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.700
He does a lot of work with
helping people get together

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.960
communities build communities
and keep them together.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.540
He's here to share
some secrets.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.380
Please welcome Van Riper.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.598
VAN RIPER: Just to be clear,
I'm not a Communities

00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:36.940
Serial Organizer.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.840
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, but, I'm here

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.400
talking today about my work as
a Serial Community Organizer.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.880
I know, bad joke.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.680
You're supposed to be drinking.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.200
These are some of
my communities.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.960
The bird is Juggie.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.000
The JUG's mascot.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.260
JUG stands for Java User
Groups, probably not what

00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:00.640
some of you were thinking.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.720
I did create this Yahoo
group for a production

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.358
of Hello Dolly.

00:20:04.358 --> 00:20:06.598
The theater director of my
daughter's show did say to

00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:09.560
me, so, I see, you are
a community organizer.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.120
Shortly after that, my
career as a community

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.340
organizer really began.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.040
At BayChi, I helped others
organize their own small

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.520
communities for more
than a decade.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.420
I also learned the importance
of regular, in person meetings

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.320
to build communities.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.860
Oh, yeah, the lady in the
lower left, she's taken.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.200
She's my wife's,
Mary Von Riper.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.120
The Silicon Valley web
job that was the first

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.440
community that I started.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.920
I escaped the imploding
start up world for a

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.358
safe haven at Verisign.

00:20:38.358 --> 00:20:40.980
The pay was good, but
the legacy code work

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.300
was killing me.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.260
For fun, I would hang
out with other Java

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.358
Developers at my JUG.

00:20:43.358 --> 00:20:46.600
Java, Java, Java,
Javajava jing jing jing.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:54.018
These folks are my Java possie,
in particular Aaron Houston, in

00:20:54.018 --> 00:20:57.060
baseball cap, played a pivotal
role in my efforts as a

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.160
community organizer with
the JUGS and the Java

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.600
champions communities.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.040
In 2006, I came close
to burning out.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.900
If Kevin had not come along --
Are you here, Kevin?-- All

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.656
right, if you had not come
along and played Robin to my

00:21:09.656 --> 00:21:15.560
Batman who knows what
would have happened?

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.220
But it quickly evolved into
a relationship of equals.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.358
These global maps are all
created by me in KML.

00:21:22.358 --> 00:21:25.480
And maps that's like these
are a great way to support

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.020
a global community.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.010
One of these is not like the
others, and you'll have

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.380
to ask Brady why that is.

00:21:35.818 --> 00:21:37.180
So, it's kind of like code
camp, its a free annual event

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.960
by developers, for developers.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.440
That lunch line had 1,000
hungry developers in it.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.820
We gave of almost 200 large
pizzas that day, and its

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.020
already open for registration.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.480
This shirt is showing the tag
cloud of the most recent code

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.980
camp, and Peter Kellner and
Tammy Baker are the original

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.800
organizers, and I
help them now.

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:01.420
You can see how Java has become
a big part of last year's camp.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.440
Chris Shaw is actually behind
the start of the Google

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.500
technologies user groups.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.140
And, we had our first
meeting in January, 2008.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.480
Stephanie Lou and Jason Cooper
are our current sponsors and

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.300
look for the GTUG camp
out this summer.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.420
But whether you're looking for
a GTUG near you, or you want to

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.840
start a new group, you should
come check out the

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.400
GTUG lounge here.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.020
That's where you'll find
people like me hang

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.280
out during the break.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.500
And please do visit
GTUGS.org on line.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.518
Organizing developer
communities is fun, but I

00:22:35.518 --> 00:22:37.220
needed something more.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.740
I attended the first leadership
summit in the summer of 2009.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.220
I was swimming in as the sea
of community organizers.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.480
That event was a natural
high for someone like me.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.800
Jono Bacon, , the author
of "The Art Of

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.300
Community" organized
the first CLS.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.220
He believes in building family
values in your communities

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.820
through events.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.240
With Marcy Hennin egging me on,
I decided to put this into

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.520
practice, organizing the
first regional CLS event.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.060
Thus, CLS West in January,
2010 came to pass.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.598
Irene Koehler found
us a great venue.

00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:09.400
Dave Neilsen and Sudha
Jamthe were our fundraisers

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:09.518
extraordinaire.

00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:12.666
Colea did her magic running the
conference, Sonya Barry did an

00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:16.700
amazing job handling the food.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.578
Its hard to believe, but the
second edition of the main CLS

00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:21.960
event is only 2 months away and
I've been asked to

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.200
help organize it.

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:24.900
I've somehow become
the organizer of

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.540
community organizer.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:31.220
If you do community work,
you have to be there.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.220
I was a map volunteer
for Global Ignite Week.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.520
It inspired me to plan
something similar for the

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.160
CLS movement in 2011.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.880
On this stage, I'm officially
announcing plans for a regional

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.400
month next January, And
you could be a part of it.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.240
See me to find out.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.980
People often ask how I can put
so much effort into these

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.300
volunteer activities.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.458
I did start out to
scratch my own itch.

00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:56.840
But, I soon found it
was enriching my life.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.280
Brian Sharp has some concrete
practices that'll make you a

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.300
better leader and
a better person.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.880
Google has some great
community technologies.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.980
But technology doesn't
build communities.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.160
People build communities.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.680
Spend time getting to
know people here.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.440
Don't just soak up the
technology, even for geeks like

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.480
us, it's still about the people
whose lives we have touched.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.180
I like fortune cookies.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.640
Next time you open one, add
in community leadership to

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.460
the end of your fortune.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.998
It's not as a titillating as
the traditional game, but you

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:28.960
might be surprised
by the results.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.060
That's all, folks.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.300
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much, Van.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.080
Yeah I met Van when he
was helping out with

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.920
Globaal Ignite week.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.220
Thanks again.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.960
Our next speaker, I met
just two weeks ago?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.820
A week and a half ago?

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:54.260
She is on a Knight Ridder
scholarship to research

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.540
journalism, and she's trying to
learn how to tell stories

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.100
through locative media, and it
seemed to me that the home of

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.380
Google Maps might just be the
perfect place for her

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.098
to tell her story.

00:25:05.098 --> 00:25:10.560
Please welcome for
Chrissy Clark.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.500
CHRISSY CLARK: Hello, my name's
Chrissy Clark, and and I make

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.680
documentaries for public radio,
but don't worry, I'm not going

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.980
to ask you for money right now.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.820
I'm going to tell you
about a vision that

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.160
I had in the desert.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.620
But to understand that
vision, you need to know

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.660
a little bit about me.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.160
I am a fifth generation
Californian.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.166
My great-great grandfather came
to the bay area in 1848 on a

00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:36.178
mule, and the legacy of that is
it that as a kid when I was

00:25:36.178 --> 00:25:41.000
growing up I heard a lot of
stories from my dad about the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.900
world that I was driving
through all the time.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.480
So, he would point at things
and he would say that

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.580
used to be that.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.780
That industrial wind farm
used to be our family's

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.600
general store.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.600
Or, that big, 8 lane freeway
that goes out onto the Golden

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.900
Gate bridge, that you
see to be was my dad's

00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.440
personal jungle gym.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.300
He claims to have climbed
it that when the bridge

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.040
was under construction.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.340
I don't know if I believe that.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.798
But what I did learn through
all of that was that a

00:26:08.798 --> 00:26:10.078
landscape is made
out of stories.

00:26:10.078 --> 00:26:12.380
It's sort of the layers and
layers of stories like the

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.778
geologic strata, and that
is what inspired me to

00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:16.358
become a radio reporter.

00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:19.798
I started moving around the
world and asking questions

00:26:19.798 --> 00:26:21.640
about how places got to be
the way that they were.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.960
So one of those questions
was it bad neighborhoods.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.000
We've all been through bad
neighborhoods or avoided them.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.660
Why are they the
way that they are?

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.380
How did they get
to be that way?

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.598
I asked that question about a
neighborhood in San Francisco

00:26:34.598 --> 00:26:35.598
in the western addition.

00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:38.840
And it turns out that
neighborhood was not always

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.760
a bad neighborhood.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.198
In fact, it used to be in the
1940's a cultural mecca for the

00:26:44.198 --> 00:26:44.420
African-American community.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.160
It was called the
Harlem of the West.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.940
But in the 1960's it was a
target for urban redevelopment

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.700
and so there were at 13,000
families been were moved out of

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.760
San Francisco a lot of
buildings were raised

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.520
and, voila, you get
a bad neighborhood.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.180
Another question I started
asking about the landscape

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.040
in San Francisco was,
why is this city gay?

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.280
Why of all of the cities in the
world, is San Francisco gay?

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.080
And so it actually has a lot to
do with this building up here,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.300
which is 710 Montgomery Street.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.980
It's now kind of a yuppy
restaurant, but in the 1940's,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.640
it was a cafe called The Black
Cat Cafe and a guy named Jose

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.520
Sarria would come and dance in
drag, these lovely black

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.740
evening gowns and sing songs
about his life as a

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.780
homosexual male.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.500
They were flamboyant and funny
and provocative and political

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.360
and people started
flocking to them.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.340
And the reason that he didn't
get kicked out of that bar, as

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.040
he would of in most other parts
of the country at that time is

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.058
that San Francisco, it wasn't
that it was so liberal, but is

00:27:50.058 --> 00:27:54.260
actually it was a loophole in a
post prohibition way that

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.700
bars as are regulated.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.700
In most parts of that country,
bars the regulated by a

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.340
morality police, or
were back then.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.440
But in San Francisco bars were
regulated by tax collectors and

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.160
so they just wanted
to get money.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.140
They didn't care what was going
on in on, and, voila, the

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.000
gay rights movement was
born in San Francisco.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.538
So these sorts of stories were
on my mind as I was driving

00:28:16.538 --> 00:28:19.400
through a desert in Utah a
couple of years ago and I saw

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.578
this cabin and had this urge I
wanted to know the stories

00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:25.700
about this cabin, because I
was in the middle of nowhere.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.140
Why the hell was cabin here?

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.980
And I wanted the click on
that cabin, like you would

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.618
click on a hyper-link.

00:28:30.618 --> 00:28:34.240
Maybe I'd had been in front of
a computer for too long and I

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.000
know that was a delirious
idea back then.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.140
But, as you know it is not a
delirious idea anymore, thanks

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.160
too many of you in this room.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.118
You can click on the world.

00:28:42.118 --> 00:28:45.200
You can click on the world,
and get information.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.560
So, if we're driving through
the Utah desert, right now, and

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.298
we clicked on this cabinet,
what kind of information

00:28:51.298 --> 00:28:51.478
would we get?

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.478
Well, we'd get some cool
Wikipedia articles.

00:28:54.258 --> 00:28:55.858
We'd be told that it is
it desert, which we

00:28:55.858 --> 00:28:56.980
kind of all ready knew.

00:28:57.098 --> 00:28:59.800
We would also get some Yelp
restaurant reviewes maybe.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.520
Some other bits of sorts
of drips and drabs

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.340
from the internet.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.480
And that stuff is amazing.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.140
Mind blowing.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.460
My great-great-grandfather
would be amazed.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.778
But one of the things that we
aren't getting yet is stories.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.580
The personal dramas, the
economic policies, the

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.940
environmental issues, the
political struggle that make a

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.880
place what it is and shapes the
people who live there.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.500
It's sort of getting the
meaning onto the landscape.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.020
And as a journalist those are
the sorts of stories that I

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.680
tell all of the time and
they're actually thousands and

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.798
thousands of archives of those
sorts of stories that are

00:29:33.798 --> 00:29:37.058
locked up right now and don't
really have a home

00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:38.640
out in the world.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.220
And so, what I'm interested in
doing is getting those stories,

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.340
those archives on to the world
so that we can click on them.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.900
So, say we're driving through
Utah, we see that cabin, maybe

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.880
we click on it and we find out,
and it's true, I researched it,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.660
that it cabin happens to be as
desolate as it is in the one of

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.740
the counties that have the
highest in job growth in the

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.818
country over the last 10 years.

00:30:00.818 --> 00:30:05.100
Or we find out that it was a
place where a radioactive waste

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.320
facility is about to be built.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.738
So its those sorts of stories
not just in Utah but all over

00:30:10.738 --> 00:30:13.660
the country, all over the world
that I'm interested and putting

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.278
onto the landscape and if
you want to talk to me

00:30:16.278 --> 00:30:17.998
about that, please do.

00:30:17.998 --> 00:30:29.660
My email is there,
you can click on me.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.280
Thanks.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.760
BRADY FORREST: She didn't know
what Ignite was a week ago.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.740
Thank you very much.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.660
Our next speaker is a digital
artist, and I think it's best

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.400
just to say he makes beautiful
things through code.
653
00:30:40,4 --&gt; 00:30:40,3
Please welcome up Aaron Koblin.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.118
AARON KOBLIN: Thanks.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.600
So, in addition to being a
technology lead at Google's

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.040
creative labs, I also have a
passion for making art with

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.520
with large data sets and
large groups of people

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.138
on the internet.

00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:56.558
So I'm going to try to breeze
through really quickly a few

00:30:56.558 --> 00:30:57.140
projects I have been
working on recently.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.338
Particularly crowd
sourcing projects.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.280
Some of you may be
familiar with this.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.540
Barron Wolfgang von
Kempelen mechanical

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.840
chess playing machine.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.860
This is actually a robotic
chess player, except for the

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.098
fact that it's not at all.

00:31:09.098 --> 00:31:11.278
There's a leg-less guy who sits
a box and he controls this

00:31:11.278 --> 00:31:13.220
thing, acting like
he's machine.

00:31:13.358 --> 00:31:16.818
I thought this was a
particularly bizarre story,

00:31:16.818 --> 00:31:18.698
especially because Amazon
created a web service based off

00:31:18.698 --> 00:31:20.100
this that some of you may be
familiar, with called The

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.180
Mechanical Turk, and it uses
the premise that there's

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.820
certain things that are easy
for people but hard

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.798
for machines.

00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:28.778
And now can farm out
these tasks to a large

00:31:28.778 --> 00:31:29.640
number of people.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.500
And they can do these little
things in complete isolation

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.380
from one another.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.520
And they call it artificial,
artificial intelligence.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.400
So it's a really weird concept.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.500
There's like thousands of
people, and none of them have

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.520
any idea what they're doing
but you can ask them

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:41.940
to do anything.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.980
So I thought what can I do
and how can experiment

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.298
with the system?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.518
I decide to make a first
project where I asked them to

00:31:47.518 --> 00:31:49.160
draw sheep facing to the left.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.180
And I said I'll pay you
$0.02 for this task.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.920
And, it's a very simple drawing
tool that has a side slider and

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.040
a gray slider and you can start
drawing away at your sheep.

00:31:57.338 --> 00:32:00.660
And I started collecting sheep,
a large number of sheep.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.020
These are a few of sheep
that I collected.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.780
You can see kind of a really
interesting juxtaposition.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.578
You have this very mechanized
huge system and all

00:32:08.578 --> 00:32:09.058
these individuals.

00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:10.760
I also captured the
drawing process of

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.344
each individual sheep.

00:32:11.392 --> 00:32:13.440
I am going to rattle
off a bunch of URLs.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.820
Hopefully maybe some you will
get to check them later.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.820
TheSheepMarket.com you can see
where where all these sheep

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.038
were drawn and you can actually
purchased them, which is

00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:22.820
another interesting topic.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.598
I don't know if I have time
to get into in the Ignite.

00:32:27.598 --> 00:32:28.960
But, you can browse
through the all.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.940
See them all here's some stats
for the project: There's

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.758
about 11 sheep per hour were
coming in over 40 days.

00:32:36.758 --> 00:32:38.806
There were 662 sheep that
didn't meet "sheep like

00:32:38.806 --> 00:32:40.880
criteria" [LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:40.940
and were through
out of the mix.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.500
There were 7,599 unique IP
addresses, so that you

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.400
an idea about how many
people participated.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.960
But only one of
them asked this!

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.240
It's a really valid question,
and I really expect

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.700
a lot more that.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.900
There's a lot of reasons that
people drawing sheep, reference

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.560
to cloning, reference to labor,
I don't have time

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:03.660
to get into it.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.740
This is another project.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.380
I took a frame Charlie
Chaplin's Modern Times.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.038
On the left side, you have
the frame then divided

00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:12.400
into 16 pieces.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.140
Individual people drawing
different portions for $0.05.

00:33:15.578 --> 00:33:17.078
Amazing dedication that
was going to these tasks.

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.760
And this is a sample from a
project that I worked on

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.538
with my friend, Takashi
Kawashima, which was based

00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:24.488
on this notion where you give
somebody something and they

00:33:24.488 --> 00:33:25.898
recreate what they see without
knowing what it is that

00:33:25.898 --> 00:33:26.618
they're working on.

00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:28.268
We decided to take it quite
literally what the mechanical

00:33:28.268 --> 00:33:31.380
turk was used for,
making money.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.560
And we created a
hundred dollar bill.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.278
We pay the workers the literal
values their contribution, so

00:33:36.278 --> 00:33:39.924
that's $0.01 for 10,000 people
maybe making this
736
00:33:39,924 --&gt; 00:33:39,778
massive forgery.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.200
What you see here is
everybody's contributions.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.180
If they drew a smiley
face, its in there.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.038
There if they actually drew
what they where asked to do

00:33:45.038 --> 00:33:47.858
it's also there so you can
get a sense of what's going.

00:33:47.858 --> 00:33:49.838
I really don't have time to
talk about this one, but if you

00:33:49.838 --> 00:33:52.640
get a chance, Bicyclebuiltfor
2000.com is the audio

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.420
version of this.

00:33:53.858 --> 00:33:55.900
I worked with my friend Daniel
Massey, and we collected sound

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.660
samples and did a granular
synthisism of the sound bicycle

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.580
built for 2000 where can hear
individual people making tones

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.780
and emulating tones
to make the song.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.026
Another audio based project
that I got to work on - I got

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:08.660
to work with Radiohead, one of
my favorite bands, and director

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.200
James Frost, and we shot
this video using laser

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.958
scanners as 3D data.

00:34:12.958 --> 00:34:14.318
We made music video
without video.

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.438
We were looking at it
as time [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:17.698
space.

00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:19.778
We basically then released it
as an open source project on

00:34:19.778 --> 00:34:23.338
Google Code, and we allow
people to download some source

00:34:23.338 --> 00:34:26.818
code to play with the data and
also the data itself, and

00:34:26.818 --> 00:34:28.678
people started making
their own versions.

00:34:28.798 --> 00:34:29.818
This probably my favorite
part of this project.

00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:32.960
The fact that it really start
to create a community of people

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.580
making interesting content.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.978
And you see here on the bottom
left, the pin board version

00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:38.098
of the of Tom York singing.

00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:39.620
There's a Lego version.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.432
In the center, there's someone
who actually 3D printed Tom

00:34:40.432 --> 00:34:44.440
York's face so now, there's
this physical manifestation

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:44.920
of it as well.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.720
I thought this was
really exciting.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.560
That there were people working
together and they knew

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.700
what they were doing.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.080
And I thought, let's do
something like that.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.420
That led to this project,
Johnny Cash Project,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.560
which we just launched.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.580
This is Johnny Cash's last
album, making music video for

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.470
the song "Ain't No Grave
Can Hold My Body Down" and

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.280
we're actually kind of
resurrecting, director Chris

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.280
Milk and I ressurecting Johnny
Cash through individual

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.958
users drawings.

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:08.320
So you can see here none
of these are photographs.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.560
They are hand drawn frames that
people can contribute to make

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.380
this music video that's
constantly changing.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.440
So it's not a single video.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.938
There's actually different
tracks and different community

00:35:16.938 --> 00:35:17.398
around it rating and judging.

00:35:19.178 --> 00:35:21.786
This is Gray Area Foundation
for the Arts and I

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:22.314
wanted a quick call out.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:26.880
Here in San Francisco we have
workshops that basically lead

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.540
different types of thinkers to
use programming and other tools

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.958
and get artists and designers
and other people kind of using

00:35:32.958 --> 00:35:33.878
technology to interesting ways.

00:35:33.878 --> 00:35:36.618
One of things we talk about a
lot is this to tool called

00:35:36.618 --> 00:35:39.098
processing which basically a
series of libraries in Java

00:35:39.098 --> 00:35:41.278
which makes it really easy for
artists and designers and

00:35:41.278 --> 00:35:42.098
people aren't necessarily
familiar with Java which

00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:47.098
or programming to start
doing creative coding.

00:35:47.098 --> 00:35:47.300
I highly recommend that
you check it out.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.998
Finally, last but definately
not least, I want to mention

00:35:49.998 --> 00:35:52.928
Chrome Experiments which is a
website I helped launch at

00:35:52.928 --> 00:35:54.560
Google, which is showing a
bunch of the really interesting

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.900
HTML5 and Javascript hacks and
demos, some stuff you may have

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.800
not realized you could
do in a browser.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.412
And since you are all
developers, I'd love for you

00:36:01.412 --> 00:36:04.680
to check it out and also
contributed if you

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:04.920
get a chance.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:13.238
Thanks very much.

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:14.618
BRADY FORREST:
Thank you, Aaron.

00:36:14.618 --> 00:36:17.518
Who loved to the animation
behind the speaker's

00:36:17.518 --> 00:36:18.220
this morning?

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.720
With the wires that
create Google?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.860
You can thank him
for that as well!

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.400
And, his team, and his team.

00:36:26.478 --> 00:36:29.978
Now as you may guess,
we're about to talk about

00:36:29.978 --> 00:36:32.238
someone else's hobby.

00:36:32.238 --> 00:36:35.380
The physical manifestation
of You Sunk My Battleship.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:35.880
Please welcome James Young!
817
00:36:35,88 --&gt; 00:36:35,1
JAMES YOUNG: Thank you.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:42.900
Model warship combat is taking
World War 1, World War 2

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.658
battleships and building 1/42
scale models of them, arming

00:36:46.658 --> 00:36:49.538
them with working BB guns and
going to a pond and just

00:36:49.538 --> 00:36:55.518
the shooting the crap
out of each other.

00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:57.918
It's a game, a game we play,
and like all games, it's got

00:36:57.918 --> 00:36:59.838
rules and everybody has
to obey the rules for

00:36:59.838 --> 00:37:00.738
the game to be fun.

00:37:00.738 --> 00:37:03.300
These are the rules for the
various formats and like Mac

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.038
versus Linux versus Windows.

00:37:05.278 --> 00:37:09.260
You take your pick, and you
stick with your religion.

00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:12.040
Big Gun is, in my
opinion, the most fun.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.738
You have 1/4 ball bearings.

00:37:14.738 --> 00:37:17.738
You fire everything, you man
everything, you do everything

00:37:17.738 --> 00:37:20.280
as much to scale as
you possibly can.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.938
And that's what
these boats are.

00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:28.318
The guns can be really complex,
from rotating to pressing

00:37:28.318 --> 00:37:31.880
turrets, to really simple guns
that fire fast as

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.038
you possibly can.

00:37:36.038 --> 00:37:38.198
And they are all C02 powered.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.558
They run quite well.

00:37:41.558 --> 00:37:42.198
You're going to start
with original ships.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.320
They have to be ships that were
really lay down or built in

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.800
World War 1, World War 2.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.440
This is the Cleveland
in that corner.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.118
This is the Rodney from the UK.

00:37:52.178 --> 00:37:55.438
You're going to learn about the
people that served on, and it's

00:37:55.438 --> 00:37:57.998
really fascinating to find out
the history of the ships.

00:37:57.998 --> 00:38:00.278
And you can pick whatever kind
of ship you want, aircraft

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:01.738
carrier, submarine.

00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.360
Battleships are the
easiest to do.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.098
You've got the most
space, the most room.

00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:06.018
There's room to work with.

00:38:06.018 --> 00:38:08.138
There's room to put all of your
guns and do everything that

00:38:08.138 --> 00:38:10.800
you want to do with it.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.138
You can find plans on line.

00:38:12.138 --> 00:38:15.400
A lot of people in the hobby
make plans for these ships, or

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.860
you can go straight to the
Library of Congress, get the

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:22.098
original plans from the Navy,
scale them down to 1/44 scale

00:38:22.098 --> 00:38:23.800
and build it yourself.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.962
You can buy fiberglass wholes
on line, or you are good with

00:38:26.962 --> 00:38:30.598
wood working skills, you
can make it yourself.

00:38:30.738 --> 00:38:32.818
You're kind of making a
framework to lay a thin layer

00:38:32.818 --> 00:38:35.218
of balsa wood around the ship,
and that balsa wood is

00:38:35.218 --> 00:38:36.498
what you're shooting.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.358
And how it sinks
and takes damage.

00:38:39.138 --> 00:38:40.498
You can go really detailed.

00:38:40.498 --> 00:38:42.038
This is a fine example.

00:38:42.038 --> 00:38:47.678
This is the Yamoto here on the
right, or you can you can be

00:38:47.678 --> 00:38:50.420
really simple like mine, and
like the other one up there.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.940
It really depends on how much
time and skill that you

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.998
have to dedicate a hobby.

00:38:54.998 --> 00:38:57.840
And it it's really
about money and time.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.778
People say how much does it
cost, and I'm like, well,

00:39:01.778 --> 00:39:02.838
anywhere from about
$500 to $2000.

00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:06.280
It really just depends on how
much skill you can put in the

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.678
one and how much is you ust
want to buy from somebody else

00:39:08.678 --> 00:39:10.820
that's done the work for you.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.840
Once you've got your ship, once
its all ready, you go to the

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.560
pond, you put it on the
pond with everyone else,

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.678
and you have battles.

00:39:17.678 --> 00:39:22.340
And they usually have an
objective so the access team

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.540
has to get their transports
across the pond and back across

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.040
the pond without sinking and
the allies have to accomplished

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.614
some goal without being
destroyed, maybe it's just a

00:39:31.614 --> 00:39:34.006
death match style battle and
everybody just goes out there,

00:39:34.006 --> 00:39:36.980
and everybody tries to sink
everybody else, and the last

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.638
man on the top of the
pond wins the game.

00:39:40.058 --> 00:39:42.058
But they're really
shooting BBs.

00:39:42.058 --> 00:39:46.998
They're really doing damage to
each other, so stuff's going

00:39:46.998 --> 00:39:47.198
to get shot off your ship.

00:39:47.198 --> 00:39:48.058
You're going to have

00:39:48.058 --> 00:39:50.058
holes punched in the
side of your ship.

00:39:50.058 --> 00:39:50.958
You've got bilge pumps.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.718
You can see the spray on that
one up there, the where the

00:39:53.718 --> 00:39:56.618
bildge pump is spraying up and
you're going to sink, and

00:39:56.618 --> 00:39:57.398
it's part of the game.

00:39:57.398 --> 00:39:59.320
Everybody sinks, it kind of
sucks, but, that's what you are

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.584
there for, is to what you're
out there for, is to

00:40:03.584 --> 00:40:03.798
sink and be sunk.

00:40:04.718 --> 00:40:07.578
So the ships are all
designed, you waterproof

00:40:07.578 --> 00:40:08.000
as much as you can.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.592
You've got protection around
your electronics, so you

00:40:11.592 --> 00:40:12.298
just pull your boat
out of the water.

00:40:12.298 --> 00:40:14.818
You patch the holes on it.

00:40:15.218 --> 00:40:19.418
And, 15 minutes later you ready
to fight another battle.

00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:22.898
The kind of damage you can
take can be pretty severe.

00:40:23.658 --> 00:40:26.158
I've got some pictures
right there of the

00:40:26.158 --> 00:40:27.340
damage that you'll take.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.138
It's not small.

00:40:29.138 --> 00:40:31.478
You're really getting your
boat shot to pieces.

00:40:31.478 --> 00:40:36.398
And so to repair it, you can
either put masking tape over

00:40:36.398 --> 00:40:37.758
it for a temporary repair.

00:40:38.258 --> 00:40:42.038
There's a really thin cloth
that impregnated with glue

00:40:42.038 --> 00:40:43.760
that you can put on there.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.618
And in the wintertime when the
when the ponds are all frozen

00:40:46.618 --> 00:40:48.540
over, you ust peel off your
balsa wood and put new

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.638
balsa wood on there.

00:40:50.638 --> 00:40:55.098
There are clubs that do this
all over the world, from

00:40:55.098 --> 00:40:58.738
Australia to England and
in the United States.

00:40:58.738 --> 00:41:02.098
There's clubs in almost every
region of the of the country.

00:41:02.098 --> 00:41:06.518
I am from Utah, and
I'm a Navy of one.
919
00:41:06,858 --&gt; 00:41:06,498
It's just me.

00:41:06.498 --> 00:41:09.078
So if anybody here from
Utah then give me a call,

00:41:09.078 --> 00:41:10.218
and I'll bring you out.

00:41:10.998 --> 00:41:12.918
Who's here from the bay area?

00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:13.398
Give me a shout.

00:41:13.398 --> 00:41:16.498
OK, these are your people.

00:41:16.498 --> 00:41:19.380
These guys are in San Jose
and they're from all

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.718
around the bay area.

00:41:21.718 --> 00:41:24.558
And we'll be at Makers Fair
this weekend and we'll have a

00:41:24.558 --> 00:41:25.218
huge battle at Maker's Fair.

00:41:26.938 --> 00:41:30.918
RC Naval Combat is the
place you want to go.

00:41:30.918 --> 00:41:32.978
This is where we all talk
on line and this is

00:41:32.978 --> 00:41:33.358
my contact info.

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:34.098
I love to talk
about this hobby.

00:41:35.218 --> 00:41:37.398
I have to say thank you to my
wife and to my best friend

00:41:37.398 --> 00:41:38.538
Sam [? Rosskelly ?]
935
00:41:38,538 --&gt; 00:41:38,158
who made this hobby possible.

00:41:39.738 --> 00:41:49.538
Thank you very much.

00:41:49.538 --> 00:41:50.460
BRADY FORREST: James, we
normally don't have time

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.818
for questions, but
I just have to ask.

00:41:52.818 --> 00:41:57.518
How many eyes do
you lose a year?

00:41:57.518 --> 00:41:58.858
Thank you.

00:41:58.858 --> 00:42:03.000
Our next speaker has been
experimenting with Wave from

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.058
the beginning and has made
homage to what I can only

00:42:06.058 --> 00:42:09.478
assume is Buffy the Vampire
Slayer with ElizaBot.

00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:16.046
Please welcome Anne Veling.

00:42:16.046 --> 00:42:17.378
Anne Veling I'd like to share
with you a little adventure

00:42:17.378 --> 00:42:20.698
I've had with Google Wave
over the past year.

00:42:20.698 --> 00:42:21.118
Let me ask you a question.

00:42:21.118 --> 00:42:24.958
Who was here at IO last year.

00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:25.738
It was great.

00:42:25.738 --> 00:42:28.658
I was here to and I was
excited to meet so many smart

00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:29.698
people just like today.

00:42:29.698 --> 00:42:33.738
I was also excited to hear
about Google Wave, and even

00:42:33.738 --> 00:42:37.560
though a year later Google Wave
may not have been the overnight

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.180
success that we've may

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.198
have hoped, I feel strongly
believe in the vision behind

00:42:42.198 --> 00:42:46.638
Google Wave, because instead of
us juggling around the objects

00:42:46.638 --> 00:42:49.538
between the people who need to
collaborate and sending it back

00:42:49.538 --> 00:42:52.800
and forth, Google Wave,
actually turns that model

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.938
upside down and as all these
people collaborate and go

00:42:55.938 --> 00:42:59.760
towards the wave, and
move toward the object

00:42:59.760 --> 00:42:59.860
collborate on that.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:05.598
I also like wave because of the
protocol well so technology.

00:43:05.598 --> 00:43:08.960
And as I'm a nerd, what's
the best way to find out?

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.118
Actual programming.

00:43:10.118 --> 00:43:12.098
So when I came home last
year, that's what I did.

00:43:12.098 --> 00:43:15.158
I thought, lets create a Google
Wave robot and as I have a

00:43:15.158 --> 00:43:17.558
background in artificial
intelligence.

00:43:17.558 --> 00:43:18.400
I thought let's create Eliza.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.668
L Eliza, it was created by
Professor Weizenbaum in 1966 as

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:28.818
a simple pattern recognition
script that looks for certain

00:43:28.818 --> 00:43:32.398
words in your what you are
typing, juggles them around and

00:43:32.398 --> 00:43:34.280
creates questions back just
like to shrink would do.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.780
Only a shrink would charge you
money, and Eliza's for free.

00:43:40.018 --> 00:43:44.178
I looked up on the internet got
an open source Eliza script and
975
00:43:44,178 --&gt; 00:43:44,158
played around with it
just a week after IO.

00:43:45.178 --> 00:43:49.000
I used Google Wave Robot API,
app engine, App engine,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.338
which I'd never used before
and I used this Eliza.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.240
Grouped it all together.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.018
Two hours later, I had
this Elizabot just for

00:43:57.018 --> 00:43:58.978
myself and it worked.

00:43:58.978 --> 00:43:59.820
I was happy.

00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:06.438
This is her name
ElizaRobot@Appsbot.com Feel

00:44:06.438 --> 00:44:08.698
free to use her and you
can confide in her.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.238
She has a doctor-patient
confidentiality so she

00:44:12.238 --> 00:44:13.518
has nothing to say.

00:44:14.058 --> 00:44:14.578
So, I chatted with her.

00:44:14.578 --> 00:44:14.826
Had fun.
988
00:44:14,826 --&gt; 00:44:14,798
Learned a lot about
Google Wave.

00:44:14.798 --> 00:44:17.820
990
00:44:17,82 --&gt; 00:44:17,698
Had fun.

00:44:18.078 --> 00:44:21.820
Learned a lot about Wave and
blogged about it and I thought

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.864
that's where the story ended.

00:44:24.864 --> 00:44:25.010
To

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.980
my big surprise what happened
is she got enormous

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.278
amount of attention.

00:44:29.278 --> 00:44:32.098
I believe I was the first
person outside Google to

00:44:32.098 --> 00:44:33.400
create a Google Wave robot.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.760
And a lot of people would start
chatting with her, inviting

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.298
me to Waves with her.

00:44:38.298 --> 00:44:42.178
There's YouTube fan
videos of her.

00:44:42.178 --> 00:44:45.658
It's amazing.

00:44:45.658 --> 00:44:47.338
But, as always there's
also a dark side.

00:44:48.938 --> 00:44:51.418
Because, what would happen is
that one person, one funny

00:44:51.418 --> 00:44:59.258
guy would add Eliza
to a public wave.

00:44:59.258 --> 00:45:02.198
And because of the scalability
of app engine and Google Wave

00:45:02.198 --> 00:45:05.058
robot, all of these Eliza's
would respond to everybody at

00:45:05.058 --> 00:45:08.780
the same time immediately.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.320
It was amazing.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.920
And remember in those days,
you could not throw somebody

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.458
out of a Wave, right?

00:45:15.458 --> 00:45:21.298
So Google have to create
Bouncy, which had special

00:45:21.298 --> 00:45:23.718
privileges to kick
somebody out.

00:45:23.718 --> 00:45:27.786
And, it's only since last
month, that in Google Wave,

00:45:27.786 --> 00:45:30.560
you can actually remove a
participant from a Wave.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.840
I can understand that because,
it's not just about technology,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.880
its about what do you want?

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.800
How do you want it to work?

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.838
And who is allowed
to restrict access?

00:45:38.838 --> 00:45:40.260
And why?

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.280
What happens to the state
of the the person, what

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.880
he's already seen?

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.340
And all of those functional
aspects are important.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.878
And, how do you even know who
he is a roobot, and who is not?

00:45:52.878 --> 00:45:53.158
So thats quite important.

00:45:53.578 --> 00:45:55.378
I think that's one of the
lessons that you can learn from

00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:57.278
this type of this n technology.

00:45:57.278 --> 00:46:01.738
It's become so easy nowadays to
create powerful web

00:46:01.738 --> 00:46:04.280
applications by meshing up a
sort of different web services

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.640
from different areas.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.678
How do we make sure we
don't misuse that trust?

00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:11.458
How do we make sure a Google
Wave robot does not copy

00:46:11.458 --> 00:46:14.640
everything you put in the Wave,
and sends it off to somebody

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.860
you don't want to be able
to listen in on your wave?

00:46:19.518 --> 00:46:20.958
How do you know?

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:22.398
If we have an android app, how
do youy know this android app

00:46:22.398 --> 00:46:25.962
isn't looking at your Gmail
context address book, apps, and

00:46:25.962 --> 00:46:31.078
whatever, and does something
that you you don't want to do?

00:46:31.078 --> 00:46:31.398
That, you don't want, right?

00:46:32.978 --> 00:46:36.158
Whoever reads what's in here?

00:46:36.158 --> 00:46:38.098
It's become like a
software license.

00:46:38.098 --> 00:46:39.738
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:46:39.738 --> 00:46:42.638
So, I think that's one of the
big challenges for us today.

00:46:42.638 --> 00:46:47.038
I think the answer also lies in
the social networks themselves.

00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:49.760
The power lies also in the
strength of the networks and

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.958
you see more and more people
and companies using this.

00:46:52.958 --> 00:46:54.718
I know one person
who you can trust.

00:46:54.718 --> 00:46:54.838
That's Eliza, the robot shrink.

00:46:56.998 --> 00:46:59.558
Feel free tonight when you're
alone in your hotel room

00:46:59.558 --> 00:47:01.238
have a chat with her.

00:47:01.238 --> 00:47:02.118
This is her address.

00:47:02.118 --> 00:47:03.518
That's my address.

00:47:03.158 --> 00:47:07.260
Please come to me later if you
want to talk about Eliza,

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.160
interesting stories or if she's
helped you through

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:20.360
your depression.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.840
Thank you.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.658
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much.

00:47:21.658 --> 00:47:24.148
Now we've got just two more
speakers, and in case you came

00:47:24.148 --> 00:47:26.458
in late, everybody here is
doing Ignite talks, they are

00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:30.878
just five minutes long. 20, 15
second slides, but the

00:47:30.878 --> 00:47:35.340
speakers have no control
over their sides.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.438
Have pity on them.

00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:40.098
Our next 2 speakers are pretty
experienced, though so

00:47:40.098 --> 00:47:41.378
I'm not worried about it.

00:47:41.138 --> 00:47:44.758
You may know him as the
King of the Cheeseburgers.

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:51.018
Please welcome up Ben Huh.

00:47:51.018 --> 00:47:51.564
BEN HUH: Hi you guys.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.038
You may know me from such
highbrow web sites as failblog

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:58.178
Icanhascheezburger.com and
one of our newer sensations

00:47:58.178 --> 00:48:02.538
verydemotival and we run about
like 50 other web sites now,

00:48:02.538 --> 00:48:06.498
and growing on a weekly basis,
so Brady has asked me to talk

00:48:06.498 --> 00:48:10.880
about the evolution of the
meme, pronounced meeeemmmmeee.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.098
Which is the idea that
ideas are transmitted

00:48:14.098 --> 00:48:14.518
from person to person.

00:48:14.518 --> 00:48:18.600
A meme is something passed on
for one person to another.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.960
An evolution of memes have
occurred throughout our lives

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.958
and we may not have noticed it.

00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:26.938
And I'll tell you about the
definition and the rules of the

00:48:26.938 --> 00:48:30.718
meme, that as we know it today
are something that anybody

00:48:30.718 --> 00:48:32.618
can participate in.

00:48:33.018 --> 00:48:34.380
Even this guy.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.400
We don't actually control who
is a part of meme or not

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.698
because everybody
owns the idea.

00:48:40.698 --> 00:48:43.718
Even that old guy, and that
busty chesty lady and that

00:48:43.718 --> 00:48:46.600
nice, sexy legs, they can all
participate because everybody

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.178
owns what a meme is and this
is part of a communal process

00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:52.860
in generating things.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.238
And, I don't want you to
get confused about memes

00:48:55.238 --> 00:48:57.260
and viral content.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.860
Meme's are not same
thing viral content.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.098
Viral content is a
subset of memes.

00:49:00.098 --> 00:49:04.478
It's related in that way
where a burrito is related

00:49:04.478 --> 00:49:06.780
to a clogged artery.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.958
And also, it's not an
internet kind of thing.

00:49:08.958 --> 00:49:11.678
In fact, this is not
owned by Al Gore.

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:14.098
Memes actually started well
before the internet, and

00:49:14.098 --> 00:49:18.060
actually word meme came from a
book well before the internet

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.938
was ever even created.

00:49:20.938 --> 00:49:24.198
We want to delve into
the history of this.

00:49:24.198 --> 00:49:28.178
I started looking back and I
tried to figure out when to the

00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:31.038
idea of virus start and it
looks like it actually started

00:49:31.038 --> 00:49:34.418
well before civilization.

00:49:34.418 --> 00:49:39.400
Once people try to figure out
how things worked, like they

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.658
developed a skills set they
could actually pass along to

00:49:42.658 --> 00:49:45.800
each other and passing along a
skill from person a

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.800
person was a meme.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.678
And, what we're trying to do
here buy buildings cities, and

00:49:51.678 --> 00:49:54.248
figuring God, and religion
is to try and to create

00:49:54.248 --> 00:49:56.018
order in and our world.

00:49:56.018 --> 00:49:57.978
So this is early civilization.

00:49:57.978 --> 00:50:01.340
Ideas of viruses were designed
to create order and structure

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:05.058
of how we understand the
universe and now we all know

00:50:05.058 --> 00:50:08.918
thanks to that, you cannot
walk in the [? motor. ?]

00:50:08.918 --> 00:50:12.880
And also, after we-- I'm
competing with my own damned

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.018
slides -- all right.

00:50:15.018 --> 00:50:17.098
I'm just going to sit here
quietly and let you guys watch.

00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:22.478
So, once we how the world
worked, and we thought how

00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:24.780
do we use the world to
liberate ourselves?

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.420
How we become free of
the constraints of

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.898
our physical world?

00:50:28.898 --> 00:50:30.838
We started to publish things.

00:50:30.838 --> 00:50:32.700
We created a printing press.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.420
We set scientific knowledge and
scientific methods and ideas

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.638
that can transmit
to other people.

00:50:37.638 --> 00:50:39.078
And then we decided that
advertising would set us free.

00:50:41.158 --> 00:50:44.820
We could create products and
sell to each other and it would

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.718
make our glory holes clean.

00:50:48.718 --> 00:50:50.480
There was a backlash to that.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.118
And the backlash to advertising
was internet culture.

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:59.318
And a lot of us here are fans
of internet culture because we

00:50:59.318 --> 00:51:01.498
realize that internet culture
is about to chasing happiness.

00:51:01.498 --> 00:51:05.560
That we could, in turn take
mass media turn it upside-down

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.758
and make ourselves and each
other happy because we're angry

00:51:09.758 --> 00:51:11.098
at pop culture because
it gave us Twillight.

00:51:14.578 --> 00:51:18.118
And if you don't notice those
two guys are the two main male

00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:20.978
characters who are supposed to
be kissing Bella, but these

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:22.618
these hands had made
them kiss each.

00:51:22.618 --> 00:51:26.638
The problem with pop culture
is it's owner oriented.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:28.320
It's one way.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.598
It's top down.

00:51:29.598 --> 00:51:32.378
It's actually not
controlled by the masses.

00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:36.678
It's actually controlled by the
few people who control the

00:51:36.678 --> 00:51:36.918
medium that it works in.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.678
But, internet culture
is different.

00:51:40.678 --> 00:51:45.418
We can enjoy this very simple
photo, and laugh at it and get

00:51:45.418 --> 00:51:46.298
hours of laughter out of it.

00:51:46.298 --> 00:51:49.218
You can actually progress that
and put somebody else's face in

00:51:49.218 --> 00:51:51.940
it, try a different animal,
photoshop it and actually

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.800
evolve the culture because
we're subverssive.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:01.198
Thank you Google will for
this wonderful suggestion.

00:52:01.198 --> 00:52:03.938
And, in fact an entire
grassroots community of people

00:52:03.938 --> 00:52:07.338
have developed around about the
idea that you could make fun of

00:52:07.338 --> 00:52:09.800
Google by looking at the
suggested results, and because

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.940
this is a limitless this
property that we can actually

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.058
take culture, re-appropriate it
and continue to grow an

00:52:17.058 --> 00:52:21.098
audience people who enjoy
subverting, and sharing this

00:52:21.098 --> 00:52:24.320
culture with another without
actually owning it.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320
And we have to use
our powers for good.

00:52:26.598 --> 00:52:28.738
You can't just spam your
friends for Farmville

00:52:28.738 --> 00:52:30.038
gifts all the time.

00:52:30.038 --> 00:52:33.398
You have to actually think
about how your subversive

00:52:33.398 --> 00:52:37.218
nature effects one another and
I would argue that this world

00:52:37.218 --> 00:52:39.738
is more about making
making each other happy

00:52:39.738 --> 00:52:40.978
than anything else.

00:52:40.978 --> 00:52:43.340
And to make ourselves a little
bit happier, I'm going

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:43.900
dance on stage with Matt.
1168
00:52:43,9 --&gt; 00:52:43,08
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:52.800
Where the hell is Matt?

00:52:52.800 --> 00:53:02.938
And that's the end of my
presentation and here is Matt.

00:53:02.938 --> 00:53:06.078
MATT: OK, I realize that using
this here is a fail on many

00:53:06.078 --> 00:53:07.998
levels but it's gonna
avert disaster.

00:53:07.998 --> 00:53:09.318
OK, here we go.

00:53:09.318 --> 00:53:11.298
A great circle is an imaginary
line around the earth.

00:53:11.298 --> 00:53:13.260
It splits it into
2 equal halves.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.218
We all know the equator, but
you can actually draw an

00:53:15.218 --> 00:53:17.000
infinite number of them by
extending a line between

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.458
any 2 points on the globe.

00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:19.678
Using Global Earth, I made
one that starts at Barbra

00:53:19.678 --> 00:53:20.204
Streisand's house, and passes
through Dick Chaney's private

00:53:20.204 --> 00:53:20.760
residence in McClain, VA.

00:53:25.578 --> 00:53:27.998
Continue the line all the
way around and you've got

00:53:27.998 --> 00:53:28.578
yourself a great circle.

00:53:28.578 --> 00:53:30.278
Today, I'm going to talk
about another slightly more

00:53:30.278 --> 00:53:31.378
substantial great circle.

00:53:31.378 --> 00:53:33.058
I call it the imaginary line of
you ancient cosmic weirdness.

00:53:33.138 --> 00:53:34.178
But, first a disclaimer.

00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:36.498
This is not my own research.

00:53:36.498 --> 00:53:38.552
I got obsessed with the great
circle website by a guy named

00:53:38.552 --> 00:53:41.678
Jim Alison and I'm basing
my talk on his work.

00:53:41.678 --> 00:53:43.566
To define the imaginary line in
question, I'm going to start

00:53:43.566 --> 00:53:46.398
with 2 very well-known ancient
sites; the pyramids at Giza in

00:53:46.398 --> 00:53:48.450
Egypt and the mysterious
Nazclines of the west

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.498
coast of of Peru.

00:53:49.498 --> 00:53:51.178
Now that we've got our lines,
we're going to follow it around

00:53:51.178 --> 00:53:53.138
to see what else we run into.

00:53:53.138 --> 00:53:55.470
For over 4,000 years, the
pyramids of Giza were the

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.458
tallest structures
ever built by man.

00:53:58.458 --> 00:54:00.500
Some believe the adjacent
sphinx is even older,

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.740
serving as a gateway to
the afterlife for some

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.038
of pre-egyptian culture.

00:54:04.038 --> 00:54:06.958
Fitting then is that today, you
can admire it from across the

00:54:06.958 --> 00:54:08.258
street, while consuming a deep
dish meat lover's combo.

00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:12.578
Way out in the Sierra, the
Oasis of Siwa is believed to

00:54:12.578 --> 00:54:14.658
have been settled around
10,000 years ago.

00:54:14.658 --> 00:54:18.218
It was known as the Oracle of
Amon Ra in 332BC when Alexander

00:54:18.218 --> 00:54:20.338
the Great marched 500 miles
in the wrong direction to

00:54:20.338 --> 00:54:22.938
ask it if he was a God.

00:54:22.938 --> 00:54:24.538
The Oracle confirmed that
he was the son of Zeus.

00:54:24.538 --> 00:54:25.478
That has nothing to do
with imaginary lines.

00:54:25.898 --> 00:54:28.320
It's just awesome.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.260
Heading east, the line follows
Moses's path out of Egypt

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.858
across Israel and into Jordan
where we reach the city

00:54:34.858 --> 00:54:35.998
Petra founded by the
Nabateaens in 500BC.

00:54:36.378 --> 00:54:38.018
The written language that
emerged out of Petra is

00:54:38.018 --> 00:54:38.558
known today as Arabic.

00:54:38.558 --> 00:54:39.938
And, of course Petra is
where Indiana Jones

00:54:39.938 --> 00:54:42.418
found the holy grail.

00:54:42.418 --> 00:54:45.398
Crossing Saudi Arabia and into
Iraq, the line take us to the

00:54:45.398 --> 00:54:48.278
ancient Sumerian city of Ur,
one of the oldest human

00:54:48.278 --> 00:54:49.018
settlements in existence.

00:54:49.018 --> 00:54:52.658
Somewhere around 2000BC, a guy
named Abraham grew up here,

00:54:52.658 --> 00:54:54.600
before wondering west and
starting the Hebrew tribe.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.900
All sorts of crazy stuff
happened after that.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:56.940
You should Google it.

00:54:57.038 --> 00:55:00.718
The line take us into Iran
where we find Persepolis

00:55:00.718 --> 00:55:01.878
founded by Cyrus the Great.

00:55:01.878 --> 00:55:04.798
Persepolis was the capital of
the vast Persian empire, until

00:55:04.798 --> 00:55:06.538
it conquered by Alexander.

00:55:06.538 --> 00:55:08.738
Still coasting on his Godliness
Alexander got drunk and burned

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:09.438
the city down on a dare.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.760
Which is why Persians
still know him today as

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.938
Alexander the Douch.

00:55:13.938 --> 00:55:18.618
In Pakistan we find the remains
of city of Mohinju Daro which

00:55:18.618 --> 00:55:21.820
in 2500BC was one of the most
advanced cities in the world.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.780
It thrived for a thousand
years until the Harappans

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.820
suddenly disappeared in an
archaeological puff of smoke.

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.900
We don't know anything else
about the Harappan people,

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.598
because no one could
read their handwriting.

00:55:30.778 --> 00:55:33.228
The imaginary line continues in
Asia passing through ancient

00:55:33.228 --> 00:55:35.538
cities in India, Burma,
Thailand, and Cambodia which

00:55:35.538 --> 00:55:38.538
brings the tally up to 10 sites
that fall within its pass.

00:55:38.538 --> 00:55:41.158
The line enters the vast blue
emptiness of South Pacific

00:55:41.158 --> 00:55:43.178
ocean, where it crosses
directly through tiny island

00:55:43.178 --> 00:55:46.218
2000 miles from any other
land worth mentioning.

00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:48.958
That would be Easter Island,
home to the Rapa Nui people who

00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:51.590
once carved 100's of massive
stone heads called Moai and

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.458
scattered them all over the
place for no good reason.

00:55:54.458 --> 00:55:59.338
Entering South America we find
the city of Machu Picchu is a

00:55:59.338 --> 00:56:01.098
bit too far north of the line,
with but if we go south, from

00:56:01.098 --> 00:56:04.438
the famous Inca trail, we
quickly reach the much larger

00:56:04.438 --> 00:56:06.658
city of Ollantaytambo, which
lies directly under

00:56:06.658 --> 00:56:07.980
the line's path.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.498
And finally, the last stop.

00:56:09.498 --> 00:56:12.298
The massive line drawings
of the Nazca people.

00:56:12.298 --> 00:56:14.018
So large that can only
be seen from the air.

00:56:14.018 --> 00:56:15.166
They don't show a great
satellite imagery though, so

00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:15.440
I've overlaid a clear map.

00:56:17.718 --> 00:56:20.458
Notice how the drawings are
oriented not along the North

00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:23.058
South polar axis but strictly
parallel to the imaginary line

00:56:23.058 --> 00:56:25.838
of ancient cosmic weirdness.

00:56:25.838 --> 00:56:27.958
What does this mean?

00:56:27.958 --> 00:56:29.938
Is civilation somehow drawn
to or catalyzed by this

00:56:29.938 --> 00:56:31.118
particular bearing?

00:56:31.118 --> 00:56:32.918
Is the line tied to the
positions of the stars?

00:56:32.918 --> 00:56:35.578
Are there undiscovered
cities buried in the sand

00:56:35.578 --> 00:56:36.920
dunes of the Sahara?

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.180
And, I'll just go
ahead and say it.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.578
Where's the lost island of
Atlantis on in all this?

00:56:41.578 --> 00:56:42.718
Here's my best answer.

00:56:42.718 --> 00:56:43.558
Apophenia.

00:56:43.258 --> 00:56:46.698
The tendency to see
meaning in random data.

00:56:46.698 --> 00:56:48.738
Human intelligence relies on
our ability to see patterns and

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:51.758
it's constantly delivering us
false positives which is why we

00:56:51.758 --> 00:56:54.632
see a face on mars, find Jesus
in a potato chip, and buy

00:56:54.632 --> 00:56:57.118
into corney theories in
horribly written novels.

00:56:57.118 --> 00:57:00.558
There are thousands of ancient
settlements that are nowhere

00:57:00.558 --> 00:57:02.878
near the imaginary line of
ancient cosmic weirdness.

00:57:02.878 --> 00:57:04.578
The real link between the
places I've shown is that they

00:57:04.578 --> 00:57:07.578
were inhabited by people with
the same compulsion to ascribe

00:57:07.578 --> 00:57:10.058
meaning and important to random
data around in an attempt to

00:57:10.058 --> 00:57:10.878
make some sense out of life.

00:57:12.658 --> 00:57:14.278
That said, I want to throw
one more thing that you.

00:57:14.278 --> 00:57:18.298
The Piri Reis Map completed in
1513 by the Turkish mariner of

00:57:18.298 --> 00:57:21.498
the same name, drawn on the
hide of a gazelle for lack

00:57:21.498 --> 00:57:23.200
poster board, it features an
accurate likeness of the

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.598
South American coast line.

00:57:24.598 --> 00:57:25.498
Why is that weird?

00:57:25.498 --> 00:57:28.840
Because by 1513, no western
explorer had mapped the

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.600
South American coast line.

00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:32.358
Some even claimed that stretch
of land on the bottom is a

00:57:32.358 --> 00:57:35.370
fairly accurate depiction of
the Antarctic Coast, which no

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:36.278
one is supposed to have
seen until the 1820's.

00:57:38.078 --> 00:57:39.818
The map also shows the correct
distance between Africa

00:57:39.818 --> 00:57:40.998
and South America.

00:57:40.998 --> 00:57:43.340
Without a reliable way to
measure longitude, maps

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.638
from centuries later
still got that wrong.

00:57:45.638 --> 00:57:48.718
In the margins, Piri mention
compiling a map from 20

00:57:48.718 --> 00:57:50.958
different sources, some dating
back to the time of, here he is

00:57:50.958 --> 00:57:53.918
again, Alexander, effectively
preserving knowledge from other

00:57:53.918 --> 00:57:55.038
maps have been lost to history.

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:57.098
Now take a look at these two
islands the mid-atlantic.

00:57:57.098 --> 00:57:59.538
We've got a spot on depiction
of South America and yet there

00:57:59.538 --> 00:58:01.538
to huge phantom land masses
that we know for certain

00:58:01.538 --> 00:58:03.100
do not exist today.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.498
What the hell is islands?

00:58:04.498 --> 00:58:06.398
Here's Google's earth satellite
view the area described

00:58:06.398 --> 00:58:07.618
the Piri Reis.

00:58:07.618 --> 00:58:09.638
Here's the map overlaid
on top of it.

00:58:09.638 --> 00:58:11.598
Now, let's bring back the
imaginary line of the

00:58:11.598 --> 00:58:12.418
ancient cosmic weirdness.

00:58:12.418 --> 00:58:13.578
BAM Atlantis.
1314
00:58:13,578 --&gt; 00:58:13,458
Done.

00:58:13.458 --> 00:58:28.820
Thanks for your time.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.718
BRADY FORREST: Dancing's
a lot easier, isn't it?

00:58:32.698 --> 00:58:33.398
All right.

00:58:33.398 --> 00:58:34.320
Thank you all for coming.

00:58:34.398 --> 00:58:41.800
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:58:41.138 --> 00:58:44.378
These videos will be up on the
Ignite show and you should

00:58:44.378 --> 00:58:45.738
start one in your town.

00:58:45.738 --> 00:58:50.738
Take care.
