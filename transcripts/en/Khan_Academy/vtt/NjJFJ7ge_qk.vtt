00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.420
We are asked, what time is it?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.730
So we first want to look at the
hour hand, which is a shorter

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.680
hand here and see
where it is pointing.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.980
And it is pointing
right at seven.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.730
So we've just crossed
the seventh hour.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.440
So the hour is seven.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.250
And then we look at the minute
hand, which is the longer hand.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.470
And this minute hand is pointing
straight up, right at the 12.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.150
So this means the
12, when you think

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.850
of minutes, that's zero
minutes past the hour.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.810
And then each number
represents five more minutes.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.420
So this is right at 7:00.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.480
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.680
Let's check our answer.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.850
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.980
Where is the hour hand?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.150
So this hour hand,
you might say,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.480
hey, this looks closer to
eight than it is to seven,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.720
but the key is to realize
that it has passed seven

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.300
and it hasn't gotten
quite to eight yet.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.910
So we're still in
the seventh hour.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.830
So the hour is seven.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.060
Notice, these hands go
in a clockwise direction.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.440
So just past seven hasn't
gotten to eight yet.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.350
So the hour is seven.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.610
And when we want to think
about the minutes, remember,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.250
we start at the top
of the clock, that's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.210
zero minutes past the hour.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.500
And then we can count
by fives all the way

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.210
to where the minute hand is.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.040
So 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.690
We're 45 minutes past the hour.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.380
So it's 7:45.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.300
 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.210
Let's do a couple more.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.010
So where's the hour hand?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.340
Well it's between
the one and the two,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.300
but the key is to realize
that it's going clockwise,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.140
it's passed the one, and
it's about to get to two.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.340
So it's still in the first hour.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.140
So the hour is still one.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.900
And then the minutes, we just
have to count from 0 by fives.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.780
So 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.880
It's 1:45 PM.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.699
Let's do one more.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.240
 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.200
So here, once again, hour
hand is between 1 and 2.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.050
So it's past one, it
hasn't gotten to two yet.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.470
So we're still in
the first hour.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.070
And then the minutes,
well, we start at 12.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.720
That's zero minutes
past the hour.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.750
0, 5, 10, 15.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.010
So it is 1:15.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.430
Let's do even one more.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.120
So this one the hour
hand is exactly at two.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.010
And the minute hand
is exactly at 12.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.250
So that means we're zero
minutes past the hour.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.320
So it's zero minutes
past the hour.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.897
