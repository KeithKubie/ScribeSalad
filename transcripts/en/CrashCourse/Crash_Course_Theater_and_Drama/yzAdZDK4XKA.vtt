00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.189
Hey there!

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.359
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today our coverage of elaborate

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.669
stage makeup and costuming continues as we
cover Beijing Opera— Very nice Slim!

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.219
I like all this effort you’ve been putting
in lately.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.380
Though the Yin and Yang is a little on the
nose.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.830
As Yorick is demonstrating, today we’re
heading to China to explore the origins of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.810
Chinese performance and enjoy some Beijing
opera—a music theater style with its origins

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.140
in classical Chinese drama that went through
a bumpy patch during the Cultural Revolution,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.739
but is still performed today.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.719
It has gods and demons, strict color coding,
and about a million different ways to use

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.620
a chair.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.920
Let’s go!

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.149
INTRO
Performance in China starts early.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.149
How early?

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.019
Well wouldja look at that: we don’t know.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.600
But the very earliest performances seem to
have been associated with religious ritual:

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.540
songs and dances petitioning the gods for
fertility, for a good harvest, success in

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.570
war—the usual.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.750
Later on, when Daoism gets going, wu priests–a
kind of shaman or WIZARD; yeah, that’s right

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.350
my nerds, WIZARDs–would stage elaborate
seances, and some of these get co-opted as

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.830
court performances where priests zhuzh up
the ritual with jokes and special effects.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830
Those priests.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.180
Such hams.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.660
Religion and theater remain intertwined, and
by the eighth century BCE, certain temples

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.160
become famous for their performers.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.320
During the Han Dynasty, which begins in 206
BCE, performance becomes more widespread and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.020
more secular.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.930
Performers practice disciplines like tightrope-walking,
pole-climbing, sword-swallowing, fire-eating,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.050
and occasionally slightly less dangerous stuff
like juggling.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.890
There’s also mime, but probably not lewd
mime, unfortunately.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
Around this time, shadow plays also begin
appearing in China.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.660
Things cool down for a few centuries after
the Han lose power, because war does that

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.780
to a performance culture.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.909
But then it’s 600 CE, and the Sui Dynasty
is ascendant.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.820
The emperor Yang-Ti loves performance so much
that he actually opens his own training school

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.230
and hosts a festival featuring ten of thousands
of performers.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.420
Take that, minimalism!

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.450
During the Tang Dynasty, performers start
to combine music, dance, and acrobatics in

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.421
innovative ways, and the Emperor Xuanzong
opens the Pear Garden, another training School

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.530
supposed to help further that innovation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.080
Also apparently a way for him to recruit for
his personal harem.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.800
Now maybe you’re getting the idea that theater
in China was a performance tradition rather

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.820
than a literary one, and that idea is correct.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.070
But around 1000 CE, a lot of poetry starts
to develop, and then the novel comes to China.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.170
Novels are a huge hit, and storytellers start
going around to teahouses, reciting portions

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.709
of them while audiences drink tea and eat
pumpkin seeds.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.760
Performances like this are narrative rather
than dialogic or mimetic, meaning they aren't

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.240
really acted out.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.720
But it’s a start!

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.180
As the Song Dynasty continues, people actually
start writing plays, which usually begin with

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.520
a spoken prologue and then continue with a
mix of dialogue and song.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.130
We have fragments of about one hundred and
fifty of these plays.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.300
Several actors become famous during this time,
and they’re known by nicknames like “Orange

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300
Peel” and “Dimples.”

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
[[YORICK DROPS IN.]]

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300
What do you think my nickname would be, Yorick?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.300
[[WORD BUBBLE: “BALD SPOT.”]]

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.870
Very funny.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.980
But then, in the late thirteenth century,
the invading hordes come, and maybe you’re

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.150
thinking, Ugh!

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.540
Invading hordes!?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.720
This is why we can’t have nice things!

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.380
But if there’s one thing we know here on
Crash Course, Mongols are the exception!

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.640
When the Mongols invade China, forming the
Yuan Dynasty, it pretty much ushers in a golden

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.000
age of literature.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Why?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.239
Well, one theory goes that since the Mongols
preferred to handle stuff in-house, lots of

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.250
highly educated bureaucrats suddenly were
out of work.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.460
So to fill the time, they wrote stuff.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.670
Hey - I’ll take it!

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.460
I would have settled for wizards!

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.940
Drama of the period drew from history, legend,
and those newfangled novel things.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.430
Characters emerged from all classes and types,
and plays often ranged over months or years.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
And maybe you’re thinking, Hey, this sounds
a little like Elizabethan drama.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.050
And you’re right—it does.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.050
Nice catch!

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.709
But unlike Elizabethan drama, every play conveyed
a strong moral message, usually emphasizing

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.590
family and duty.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.630
Some of these plays might also have offered
subtle critiques of the political situation,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.460
where good characters suffer through all sorts
of terrible trials, like you know, being conquered

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.120
by invading hordes, before winning out in
the end.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.160
Two distinct styles of drama developed.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.020
One in the north, called zaju, and one in
the south, called chuan-qi.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.300
Zaju dramas were four acts long, except for
the most famous one, the twenty-act “Romance

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.830
of the Western Chamber,” which… got away
with it by claiming it was in five parts.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.740
These four acts contained ten to twenty songs,
and those songs were selected from five hundred

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.430
pre-existing melodies and accompanied by gong,
drum, clapper, flute, and lute.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.060
But here’s where it gets tricky: only the
protagonist sings, and each of the four acts

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.600
demands its own vocal timbre and rhyme scheme.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.630
These dramas were performed by companies of
both male and female actors, some of whom

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.900
were also probably prostitutes.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.870
We have one hundred and seventy zaju plays,
including a couple you may have heard of:

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.840
“The Orphan of Zhao,” which is still performed,
and “The Circle of Chalk,” which Bertolt

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.600
Brecht borrowed for “The Caucasian Chalk
Circle.”

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.220
Meanwhile, down south, chuan-qi plays are
developing.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.300
Chuan-qi plays have fifty acts—well, thirty
to fifty.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.300
But still.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.550
They don’t have a fixed rhyme scheme per
act.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.670
Which is a good thing, because can you imagine
changing the rhyme schemes FIFTY TIMES?

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.470
Unlike zaju songs, which were written for
a seven-note musical scale, chuan-qi plays

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.669
are written for a pentatonic scale.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.180
The main accompaniment was the bamboo flute.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.140
The most famous chuan-qi play is “The Peony
Pavilion,” a fifty five-act play about a

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.870
girl who falls in love with a man she’s
only seen in her dreams.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.880
She dies, but the real man comes to her grave
and somehow resurrects her.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.150
Chuan-qi plays are lively and eventful, but
eventually they got so long and so elaborate,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.660
and the language becomes so formal, that they
can’t be performed anymore.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.650
Let’s fast-forward a few centuries to the
origin story of Jingxi or Beijing opera.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.669
By this time, all kinds of different theatrical
styles were practiced around the country,

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.060
though none predominated in the way the zaju
and chuangi had.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.820
In 1790, a bunch of different troupes came
to Beijing to celebrate the eightieth birthday

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.699
of Emperor Qian Long.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:40.699
They liked it there.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:41.699
They liked each other.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.680
Eventually, they combined their regional forms
into one awesome new style that was even more

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.130
powerful, jingxi.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.380
Sorta like The Avengers of Classical Chinese
Theater.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.560
Which is a film franchise I’d definitely
watch.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.360
Officially, there are two kinds of stories
in Beijing opera: civil and military.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.810
But there’s a lot of overlap.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.230
Like the earlier dramas, the stories borrow
from history, legend, and other works of literature,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.760
and they all end happily.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.120
The scripts aren’t really set texts, but
more like bullet points.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.320
Great actors are encouraged to make each role
their own, and the focus is on acting, singing,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.009
and dancing rather than the literary elements.

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.970
Instead of presenting a full story from start
to finish, most evenings consisted of just

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.280
the high points with enough narrative and
acrobatic interludes to help it all hang together.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.500
The stories are elaborate, but the physical
staging is minimal.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.760
Theaters usually consisted of a raised, roofed
platform with a two-foot high wall extending

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.590
around three of the sides and the only set
pieces are a table and two chairs.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.979
But that table and chairs are versatile.

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:48.310
Depending upon the way they’re arranged,
they can represent a wall, a bridge, a tree,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.630
a door, a hill, a banquet, a court, whatever
you need!

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:56.009
There are all kinds of symbolic and codified
set and prop elements in Beijing opera.

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.190
A silver banner represents water; black silk
suggests a storm.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.220
A whip means you’re riding horseback; black
gauze means you’re having a dream; a couple

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.660
of yellow silk flags mean you’re in a chariot.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.220
A bunch of stagehands run around manipulating
all of these chairs and banners, but an audience

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.319
learns not to see them.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:18.440
As Yorick here has indicated, Beijing Opera
depends on extravagant makeup and costuming.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.190
For a closer look, let’s go to the ThoughtBubble:
Chinese opera characters are divided into

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.020
four types: sheng (men), dan (women), jing
(painted face roles), and chou (clowns).

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.020
But that’s not all.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.250
There are seven types of sheng roles, and
six types of dan roles.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.959
Until the twentieth century, dan roles were
played by men in tiny, awkward shoes, and

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:39.479
when women took over, they had to learn from
the men how to play them.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.830
Jing characters, with all the makeup, are
gods, demons, courtiers, and thieves.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.690
And Chou are clowns who are expected to improvise
jokes.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.720
Each role had its own pitch and rhythm, and
kind of like Sanskrit theater and kabuki theater,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.180
each had a bunch movements associated with
characters and moods.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.470
There are twenty ways just to point at something!

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.240
But a lot of the character work is done by
costume and makeup.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.940
There are three hundred types of dress associated
with Beijing opera, including forty six headdresses,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.779
forty seven dresses, six types of girdle,
and six types of shoe.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:18.810
That actually seems like a pretty low number
for shoes, TBH.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.720
These costumes are color-coded.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.060
Red costumes are for brides and loyal characters;
yellow for royal ones; white for old ones

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.830
and people in mourning.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.350
Makeup was color-coded, too.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.220
Most sheng and dan characters started with
a white base, made with flour, that offset

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.580
darkened brows, reddened lips, and eyes outlined
in red.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.670
There are more than two hundred and fifty
types of makeup, and the most complex designs

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.560
are for the jing characters.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.260
Jing faces are pattern-coded and color-coded.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.410
Only good characters wear mustaches, and the
more white around the eyes, the worse the

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.410
character.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.320
A lot of black, good guy; a lot of purple,
outlaw.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320
Lots of green: YOUSE A DEMON.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.320
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.800
[[[Yorick flies back in covered in green makeup.]]]

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
YOUSE A DEMON!

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.160
Beijing opera flourishes for about one hundred
and fifty years, and then communism happens.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.360
Communist leaders go through the repertory,
tweaking some plays, removing others, and

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.120
opera stumbles on until the Cultural Revolution,
when pretty much all of it is seen as anti-communist

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.650
and is replaced with new Mao-friendly works
like “The White-Haired Girl,” an opera

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.779
about a peasant girl who is raped and abducted
by a landlord.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:34.870
She escapes, her hair turns white, and then
she and her former fiancé are reunited.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.580
Like good communists, they redistribute the
landlord’s farms.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.240
An equally distributed happy ending!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.390
Come see us next time for English Sentimentality,
