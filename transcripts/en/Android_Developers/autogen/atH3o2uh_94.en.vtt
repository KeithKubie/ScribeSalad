hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.620
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.240
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animation and today I

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
graphics and animation and today I
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.879
graphics and animation and today I
wanted to talk about drawable animations

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
wanted to talk about drawable animations
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.320
wanted to talk about drawable animations
specifically I want to talk about the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
specifically I want to talk about the
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.980
specifically I want to talk about the
transition drawable this is a way to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990
transition drawable this is a way to
 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.420
transition drawable this is a way to
provide a capability for you to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
provide a capability for you to
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.120
provide a capability for you to
crossfade between representations of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
crossfade between representations of
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.200
crossfade between representations of
graphics in your views so let's take a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
graphics in your views so let's take a
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.150
graphics in your views so let's take a
quick look at the demo which I call

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
quick look at the demo which I call
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640
quick look at the demo which I call
cross-fading it's a fascinating demo

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
cross-fading it's a fascinating demo
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200
cross-fading it's a fascinating demo
that's going to crossfade between two

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
that's going to crossfade between two
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299
that's going to crossfade between two
colored rectangles exactly the kind of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
colored rectangles exactly the kind of
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.650
colored rectangles exactly the kind of
activity that you probably want to write

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
activity that you probably want to write
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200
activity that you probably want to write
and sell on the Play Store so here we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
and sell on the Play Store so here we
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.790
and sell on the Play Store so here we
have a red rectangle and when I click on

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
have a red rectangle and when I click on
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560
have a red rectangle and when I click on
it we're going to see a green rectangle

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
it we're going to see a green rectangle
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360
it we're going to see a green rectangle
and when we click on the green one we're

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
and when we click on the green one we're
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979
and when we click on the green one we're
going to see the red one and back and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
going to see the red one and back and
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479
going to see the red one and back and
forth and if we click in the middle

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
forth and if we click in the middle
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610
forth and if we click in the middle
it'll stop the animation and go in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
it'll stop the animation and go in
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.270
it'll stop the animation and go in
Reverse

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
Reverse
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430
Reverse
okay so not terribly interesting the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
okay so not terribly interesting the
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229
okay so not terribly interesting the
code is slightly more interesting let's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
code is slightly more interesting let's
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660
code is slightly more interesting let's
take a look at that now so we have this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
take a look at that now so we have this
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700
take a look at that now so we have this
class called crossfading it's an

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
class called crossfading it's an
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260
class called crossfading it's an
activity it keeps track of the current

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
activity it keeps track of the current
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000
activity it keeps track of the current
drawable so there knows which one to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
drawable so there knows which one to
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850
drawable so there knows which one to
transition to and we can go in here and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
transition to and we can go in here and
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190
transition to and we can go in here and
see how we do that first we get the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
see how we do that first we get the
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160
see how we do that first we get the
image view then we create a couple of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
image view then we create a couple of
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630
image view then we create a couple of
bitmaps we're going to create a red

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
bitmaps we're going to create a red
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149
bitmaps we're going to create a red
bitmap and a green bitmap and put them

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
bitmap and a green bitmap and put them
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190
bitmap and a green bitmap and put them
in the image view but instead of just

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
in the image view but instead of just
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289
in the image view but instead of just
installing it as the drawable in the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
installing it as the drawable in the
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.640
installing it as the drawable in the
image view we're actually going to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
image view we're actually going to
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289
image view we're actually going to
create this different kind of draw we'll

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
create this different kind of draw we'll
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630
create this different kind of draw we'll
call it a transition drawable and this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
call it a transition drawable and this
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429
call it a transition drawable and this
one takes an array of objects these

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
one takes an array of objects these
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.630
one takes an array of objects these
drawables that we've created these

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
drawables that we've created these
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.910
drawables that we've created these
bitmap drawables that now hold the red

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
bitmap drawables that now hold the red
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.280
bitmap drawables that now hold the red
and the green bitmaps so we create the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
and the green bitmaps so we create the
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170
and the green bitmaps so we create the
transition drawable with those and you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
transition drawable with those and you
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730
transition drawable with those and you
can think of this as being layers in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
can think of this as being layers in
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340
can think of this as being layers in
that drawable so it's a transition

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
that drawable so it's a transition
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.569
that drawable so it's a transition
drawable that's actually a set of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
drawable that's actually a set of
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.140
drawable that's actually a set of
drawables consisting of two and the red

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
drawables consisting of two and the red
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789
drawables consisting of two and the red
one is the first one that we created so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
one is the first one that we created so
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.960
one is the first one that we created so
that's going to be in back and the green

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
that's going to be in back and the green
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.810
that's going to be in back and the green
one is in front but the green one is not

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
one is in front but the green one is not
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.020
one is in front but the green one is not
visible by default right so it's kind of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
visible by default right so it's kind of
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030
visible by default right so it's kind of
an invisible layer sitting on top of the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
an invisible layer sitting on top of the
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770
an invisible layer sitting on top of the
first one that you loaded there and then

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
first one that you loaded there and then
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149
first one that you loaded there and then
when we click we're going to fade

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
when we click we're going to fade
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.350
when we click we're going to fade
between these so we go down here and we

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
between these so we go down here and we
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.999
between these so we go down here and we
listen for clicks on the image view if

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
listen for clicks on the image view if
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.590
listen for clicks on the image view if
the current draw Bowl is zero which

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
the current draw Bowl is zero which
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.940
the current draw Bowl is zero which
means we're now looking at the red one

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
means we're now looking at the red one
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830
means we're now looking at the red one
that first one loaded then we must need

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
that first one loaded then we must need
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300
that first one loaded then we must need
to start the transition so that we can

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
to start the transition so that we can
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190
to start the transition so that we can
see the green went on top so we say

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
see the green went on top so we say
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.570
see the green went on top so we say
start transition and we give it a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
start transition and we give it a
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.309
start transition and we give it a
duration so this time it's going to run

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
duration so this time it's going to run
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.690
duration so this time it's going to run
for

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
for
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.610
for
500 milliseconds and then it'll fade in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
500 milliseconds and then it'll fade in
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.050
500 milliseconds and then it'll fade in
the green one over the red so it's not

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
the green one over the red so it's not
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.330
the green one over the red so it's not
really doing a crossfade instead you see

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
really doing a crossfade instead you see
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100
really doing a crossfade instead you see
the red one and then we basically fade

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
the red one and then we basically fade
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.559
the red one and then we basically fade
in the green one on top of it and then

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569
in the green one on top of it and then
 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839
in the green one on top of it and then
we set the current draw Bowl so that we

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849
we set the current draw Bowl so that we
 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.430
we set the current draw Bowl so that we
can track that so that we know next time

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
can track that so that we know next time
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.920
can track that so that we know next time
we click which which one are we going to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
we click which which one are we going to
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.050
we click which which one are we going to
transition to if you want to go in

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
transition to if you want to go in
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640
transition to if you want to go in
Reverse you don't start the transition

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
Reverse you don't start the transition
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.880
Reverse you don't start the transition
because start transition always fades in

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
because start transition always fades in
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.559
because start transition always fades in
the one that's on top so if we did that

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
the one that's on top so if we did that
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.970
the one that's on top so if we did that
every time you would always see the fade

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980
every time you would always see the fade
 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.100
every time you would always see the fade
into green which is probably not the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
into green which is probably not the
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.390
into green which is probably not the
kind of crossfade effect that you're

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400
kind of crossfade effect that you're
 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.890
kind of crossfade effect that you're
looking for instead if we want to go in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
looking for instead if we want to go in
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660
looking for instead if we want to go in
Reverse we need to fade out the one on

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670
Reverse we need to fade out the one on
 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.729
Reverse we need to fade out the one on
top and to do that you call reverse

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739
top and to do that you call reverse
 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.220
top and to do that you call reverse
transition so reverse transition will

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
transition so reverse transition will
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.809
transition so reverse transition will
basically fade out the one that's on top

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819
basically fade out the one that's on top
 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.449
basically fade out the one that's on top
and then you see the one the the first

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459
and then you see the one the the first
 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.650
and then you see the one the the first
one that was loaded the one that's on

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
one that was loaded the one that's on
 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.630
one that was loaded the one that's on
the bottom so we start transition we

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640
the bottom so we start transition we
 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.430
the bottom so we start transition we
fade in the green reverse transition we

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
fade in the green reverse transition we
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.289
fade in the green reverse transition we
fade out to red if we do it in the

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299
fade out to red if we do it in the
 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.430
fade out to red if we do it in the
middle that's fine

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
