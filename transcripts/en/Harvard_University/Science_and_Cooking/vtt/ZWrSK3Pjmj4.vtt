00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.490
PIA SORENSEN: The scientific
theme of this week is elasticity.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.110
And the reason we talk about
elasticity in this class

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.000
is that it is-- so if you want
to be scientific about this,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.570
it is kind of one of the closest
ways you can get to describing things

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.170
like mouth feel and texture of foods.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.780
So if you think about what makes
a good food be the way it is,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.330
you certainly have flavor, but then
you have that mouth feel and texture.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.020
And if you wanted to describe that,
to describe it with elasticity

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.650
is actually not a bad way to do it.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.155
You can then elaborate on
that, and you can also,

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.946
of course, if it's a liquid food,
you can talk about the viscosity.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:00.080
But elasticity is very good
when it comes to solid foods.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.170
So, for example, this is important
when we talk about steak.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.330
Elasticity actually describes
the texture of steak pretty well.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.320
So when you start out with a raw
steak, it has a low elastic modulus.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.870
It's quite sort of squishy.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.140
And then as you cook it, you
get a firmer and firmer steak.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.630
If you don't like steak,
you can talk about tofu.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.350
I prefer tofu.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.830
Tofu comes in soft
tofu and in firm tofu.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.470
And you can then, if you really
wanted to then look at the elasticity,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
you can go and you can put
little weights on the tofu.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.500
And you can measure how many
weights can you put on the tofu

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
before it squishes too much,
and how much does it squish?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.160
You can do the same thing with steak.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.360
You can do this with raw steak.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.140
You can measure how high it is.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.170
And then as you add the weights,
how much does it squish together?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.960
You can then cook the steak, and you
can see how much the elasticity changes.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.940
Right?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.590
Sometimes we joke that in
this class, we ruin food.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.080
This may be one of them.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.980
So if you then wanted to understand
what happens in that steak

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.100
as you squish on it, you can think of
it the way you would think of a spring.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.480
So how many of you remember this
picture from some physics class

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600
a long time ago?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.630
Yeah some of you.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.470
Some of you.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.250
So this is how you would
typically talk about forces.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.030
And then when you put a force
on the spring, it expands.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.830
And it expands by a certain length.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.370
And if we measure that
length, we can understand

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.130
how springy or stiff the spring was.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.730
So you can do the same thing with food.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.490
So that is the same
thing as we do there,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.340
except here we're then sort
of also taking into account

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.400
that the steak has an
area and the weight

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.910
is distributed over that entire area.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.690
OK.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.349
Does that make sense?

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.140
See, they really want
you to take over now.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.620
They're like, can you
please start talking.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.770
Sorry.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.060
Jim is deep in thought.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.240
JIM LAHEY: But what about the
percentage of fat in the steak?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.870
PIA SORENSEN: What about
the percentage of fat?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.350
JIM LAHEY: I mean,
obviously, the density of fat

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.730
is different than the density of muscle.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.979
PIA SORENSEN: Yes, good, good.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.720
JIM LAHEY: Let alone the fact that
fat is fat and muscle is muscle.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720
PIA SORENSEN: Very good.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.380
Very good.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.255
So there's all kinds of
things that are going

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:20.237
to affect how squishy the steak is.

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:22.570
And you're saying that has
something to do with the fat.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.590
JIM LAHEY: I mean, you'll never get
two cuts of meat that are-- unless they

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.910
were from the same cloned, two clones.

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:34.810
Even then, I think it would
be very difficult to--

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.465
PIA SORENSEN: It's complicated.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.580
JIM LAHEY: Yeah.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.970
Well, it goes back to the human aspect,
that we're tinkering with our hands

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.459
and we're measuring things with
our eyes and writing things down.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.250
PIA SORENSEN: Yeah.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.749
See?

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.351
Chefs always beat us up because
we're simplifying things too much.

00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:50.850
But--

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.720
JIM LAHEY: And then why does-- going to
philosophy, why does mouth feel matter?

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.070
PIA SORENSEN: That's
a whole other lecture.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.300
JIM LAHEY: Well, that has to do with
this idea, concept of sensual pleasure,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.150
that if a food feels good to eat,
you'll probably eat more of it.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.995
I mean, if food is like loaded with
sugar, we tend to eat a lot more of it.

00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:20.854
At least that's what-- hi.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.500
I'm so glad that this lecture's not
sponsored by Cargill or ConAgra.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.270
It's kind of nice.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.840
It's refreshing.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.540
PIA SORENSEN: We try to be professional.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.260
So can I just show this picture?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.730
Because I think this one is
just going to kill you, Jim.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.480
This picture is just going to
kill you because this is taking--

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.252
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.890
This is taking all the
complexity you just talked about,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.380
and it's boiling it down to saying
that that elasticity that you

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.880
see in the steak is due to some
cross-length distance within the steak.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.320
And so this is similar to what we've
seen before when we cooked eggs.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.750
And we talked about, three weeks ago,
about how that cooking of the eggs

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.770
is due to the proteins unfolding
and then re-coagulating.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.220
And they form this network.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.970
They form this gel.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.756
And it's also similar to the gel
that forms when you make jello.

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:26.120
So if you really simplify
things, then you boil it down

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.190
and you can then apply--
let me see-- this equation.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.060
And you can say that that elasticity,
that squishiness that you measure,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.060
is all due to the cross-length distance.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.130
So this is a way you can just
describe foods in general.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.200
And this is the same thing
that happens in gluten.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.010
So now, we're getting closer.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.740
So in gluten, there are these glutenin
strands and gliadinin strands.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.560
And they are going to bind together.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.110
Many gluten molecules are
going to bind together

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.510
was with cysteine bonds and form
these long, intricate gluten networks

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.230
that are going to bind together.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.020
And when you squish
on that, they're going

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.090
to have an elasticity
similar to what the steak has

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.990
or the egg has or the jello has.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.450
So you can take this, and you can
apply a lot of the same equations.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.265
So that's what we do in class.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:19.890
See, now I totally ruined it, didn't I?

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.040
JIM LAHEY: No, not at all.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.748
PIA SORENSEN: OK.

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:24.480
He's very polite.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.690
Right.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.600
So you can then, if you think about what
the molecular structure of this gluten

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.770
network looks like, then you can think
about what actually happens when you

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.220
add more or less salt, when you have
a high-protein flour, when you have

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.520
fats and oils in there, when you have
a high humidity or a low humidity,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.420
when you have a high
pressure, low pressure.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.530
Then you can start to
understand how that happens.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.111
So enough of me.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.860
JIM LAHEY: Can you
leave that last one up?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.370
I like-- that might be useful.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.453
PIA SORENSEN: You like it?

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:57.330
JIM LAHEY: Yeah.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.072
Or remind me [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:00.780
PIA SORENSEN: OK.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.750
So enough of that.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.560
So let me please introduce Jim
Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.434
We're so excited to
have Jim here tonight.

00:07:11.434 --> 00:07:13.100
A while back-- should I tell this story?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.410
So a while back, I was surfing
around on the internet.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.350
And I had heard of Jim.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.720
And he came up as part
of the general feed.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.470
And I watched this video of you,
where you were making doughs.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.230
And then you were talking
about viscosity and elasticity.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.300
And he was using all
these scientific terms.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
And I was like, I want to meet this guy.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.405
So guys, you can now all meet this guy.

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:37.830
Let's welcome Jim.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.155
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.320
JIM LAHEY: Thank you.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.380
It's a great honor to be here.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.770
I mean, as someone who
dropped out of college or got

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.380
kicked out and then dropped
out, it's kind of cool

00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:00.110
that a really highfalutin school like
Harvard would invite a hack like me

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.820
to come here and talk
about elasticity in dough.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:10.170
I had, over the last three weeks or
four weeks, fantasized what I would do.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.680
And unfortunately,
nothing-- as life sometimes

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.230
prevents us from doing the things
that we think we're going to do,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.290
I'm going to do something
else instead, which

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.680
probably will be more interesting.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:34.940
So I came up with this idea about
elasticity, that if it sticks,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.770
it sucks, and if it sucks, it sticks
as a way of describing things that

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.280
are elast-- not elastic, but sticky.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.360
Because obviously, things
that are elastic at some point

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.490
are kind of sticky.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.830
I mean, even meat, fat.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.720
Obviously, when you add flour and
water together and you make a polymer,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.890
it's sticky.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.860
So what I was going to do is
I was going to do two doughs.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:08.790
One dough I was going to make by
hand and during the process of making

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.470
the dough, just kind
of stream of thought,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.030
whatever comes to my mind about
the process that I'm doing.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.900
And then on the other side, I was
going to do a very fast no-knead dough

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.990
with turns, which is
like a no-knead dough

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:33.020
except rather than actually using
my physical energy to kind of get

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.140
the dough to align-- I mean, there
are other ways I can do it, as well.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.390
I could just mix the flour and
water together and let it sit,

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.480
and then begin to manipulate it.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.690
But I figured the bigger the mess
I make, the more fun it would be.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:56.490
So I had learned to do this by
buying a textbook some 25 years ago

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.180
from a publisher, Van Nostrand-Reinhold.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.160
You ever heard of this publishing house?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:11.110
Well, they used to be a publishing
house for academic or science books.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.025
And they published a
series on artisan baking

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:20.580
by a bunch of very
renowned French bakers.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.610
So it's like a very kind
of French point of view,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.850
in terms of the style of the baking.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:35.330
However, the universal holds
true in that this is something

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.490
that human beings have
been engaged with,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:43.990
i.e. the making of some form of
fermented bread, probably for-- I mean,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.070
I would guess about 8,000 years.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.390
But in terms of
archaeological evidence, I

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.750
think it's only 6,000 years of evidence.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.560
But I'm sure it goes back further.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.870
So I just have about
a kilo of flour here.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.120
And I'll show you when-- I'm
just gonna add the flour.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.420
This is a negligible amount
of salt, 10 grams of salt.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.190
I'm making, like-- have any of you
been to my bakery in New York City?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.539
So you ever had a pizza bianca?

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.080
Pizza bianca.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.570
So this is basically like
a pizza bianca dough.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:22.150
And this, I was told by my confederates
here, is about a liter of water.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.160
Some I'm just gonna try to
make this as wet as possible.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.700
And this is pretty wet.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.280
That's wet.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.660
That's Is wet as it will get.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.660
That's exhibit number A,
exhibit A. And actually, I

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.010
did forget to put yeast in here.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.140
So I'm gonna have to
remember to do that now.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.965
So just so you know that
it's an imperfect science,

00:11:42.965 --> 00:11:45.430
and this can be done.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.760
So there is a difference
between these two doughs.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.930
One dough is bleached flour
from some supermarket.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:01.210
And the other one is a
labeled and unbleached flour.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.010
So I guess one has some type
of bleaching agent in it,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.090
and the other one does not.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:17.930
But these are not particularly,
like, pedigreed flours.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:24.320
They're probably just the general
commodity that you get from--

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.501
and it's so white.

00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:27.250
It's unbelievable.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.430
I haven't seen flour this white since--
well, I was going to make a joke.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.819
But I'm not going to go there.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.208
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.340
Got some sick people.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.960
Sick.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.650
So this, I'm just going
to put this together.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.065
Oh, crikey.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.010
So I'm just going to kind of put
this dough together very quickly

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:58.320
and allow it to sit and then start
turning it about every-- can someone

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.790
be so corny as to put-- oh.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.810
Maybe I should put my timer on.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.060
Just every 15 minutes.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.080
Actually, ideally every 20 minutes.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.860
So I'll probably get to dough to turn
once or twice before-- but you'll

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.600
see the textual thing.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.110
This dough, on the other hand,
we're going to beat it up.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.370
And by beating it up, I mean beat it up.

00:13:24.322 --> 00:13:26.802
Just trying to keep my hands clean.

00:13:31.612 --> 00:13:33.570
I feel bad that I'm making
such a mess in this.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.950
And look, somebody even put, like,
gaffer's tape down here and everything.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.120
I mean, I could try to
do it on this tabletop.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.220
But it's going to be a big mess.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.840
So let's not.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.070
And we're not gonna eat this.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.000
So we are kind of
committing a mortal sin.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.020
So this dough is going to be-- I'm
going to try to make it even wetter

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.850
than it is.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.658
Oh.

00:13:58.658 --> 00:14:00.760
That sounds good that
you made that noise.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.840
You're making me feel like I
actually do have a show for you.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.840
So this dough will come together.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.520
And I might even add more water to it.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.630
And so I learned this technique
of throwing dough down.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.010
I told you it's gonna be messy.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:25.240
But what you're going to
see over the next 10 minutes

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.040
or so, as I talk-- oh, look at that.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.550
So you can see the dough
beginning to stick together.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.280
It does have a certain degree
of cohesion and elasticity,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.060
although-- scientific
language-- it's disaggregated.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.310
It's not together.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.120
It's not elastic.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:54.410
So by causing friction, in part--
it's also chemically over time,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.720
the dough will begin
to adhere to itself.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.760
So I don't need to do this, which is
what I'm kind of famous for, which

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.720
this is no need recipe.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.370
And believe it or not, this will--

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.015
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.290
I warned you.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.440
This will come together.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:25.660
And I will be covered in
sweat and pieces of dough.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.720
And if it doesn't come
together, it was funnier.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:34.877
I made you left, which might even
have a greater value in the long-term.

00:15:34.877 --> 00:15:36.585
So basically, what
I'm going to do is I'm

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:43.980
going to keep trying to create as much
friction as possible with this dough

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.390
until-- am I getting
anyone in the front row?

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.030
OK.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.950
But you will see it come together.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.510
You know, I ought to have asked
for a plastic dough scraper.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.555
But we'll use a spatula.

00:15:56.555 --> 00:16:00.304
It'll work just fine.

00:16:00.304 --> 00:16:01.720
Thankfully, we're not eating this.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.955
Who knows what was on
this countertop, right?

00:16:04.955 --> 00:16:07.180
What sort of odd experiments were here.

00:16:12.732 --> 00:16:13.940
This is pretty wet, actually.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.260
I take that back.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.165
There is a high probability that
this dough will not come together.

00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:22.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.865
In which case, you will all be
getting your money back at the door.

00:16:32.122 --> 00:16:34.960
But I swear to God, I
did this class one time

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.290
at NYU's department of
nutritional studies.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.840
I forget what floor it was on.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:47.890
And I had an entire classroom of
people doing this on metal tables.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.520
And we had like five or six
people come up from the floor

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.760
below trying to figure out
what the hell was going on.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.032
And, you know, once you
get used to this method,

00:17:00.032 --> 00:17:02.240
you're basically taking the
dough, stretching it out,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.115
and throwing it down.

00:17:06.334 --> 00:17:07.500
This is entertaining, right?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.141
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.679
So this could be like the coolest
performance art piece, especially if--

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:16.902
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.660
If I'd only keep my fucking mouth shut.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.160
Oops, sorry.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.705
Does anyone have doubt
that this dough-- holy sh--

00:17:31.705 --> 00:17:34.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:37.655
Oh, I just ruined my new sneakers.

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:38.155
Damn!

00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:39.578
OK.

00:17:39.578 --> 00:17:40.690
I knew that would happen.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.040
So we're testing the
limit of the hydration

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.277
of this dough, how much water and how
much liquid this particular flour can

00:17:53.277 --> 00:17:55.050
hold.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.210
And depending on the quality
of the protein in the flour,

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.020
as well-- more the
quantity than the quality.

00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:10.020
You see, you want to hear that noise.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.995
If you hear that noise, it's good.

00:18:12.995 --> 00:18:15.750
It means things are beginning to stick.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.210
And the texture is
changing a little bit.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.400
It was actually stiffer and thicker
in the beginning, if you noticed.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.790
And the more I begin to knead the dough
or agitate the dough, the more liquid

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.355
it appears.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.685
I'm going to try to contain
myself and not get everyone

00:18:36.685 --> 00:18:41.070
in the first row disgustingly messy.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.235
And this can go on for quite some time.

00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:44.860
So we better talk about something else.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:52.720
So I started baking bread as a
way of quieting my troubled mind

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.420
and found a lot of solace in it.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:01.165
And I kind of became a bread
junkie when I went to Italy.

00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:03.540
Although I have to say, if
you were to go to Italy today,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.610
you would not become a bread junkie.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.040
You would be on a bread-free
diet because the bread in Italy

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:15.380
right now is, for the
most part, pretty bad.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.980
They're going through a new Dark Ages.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.680
They've forgotten that they're a
country that has this long history

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.030
and tradition of food-making.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.188
And it just-- holy--

00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:30.578
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.252 --> 00:19:36.960
I should have painted
myself blue, right?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.940
But you see the texture
of the dough is beginning

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:54.710
to-- and, you know, this isn't
dissimilar to, like, having a mixer,

00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:00.295
other than the fact that the cleaning
up is quite kind of like-- we

00:20:00.295 --> 00:20:03.190
were having a conversation at
dinner about what a big mess

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.508
I'm capable of making.

00:20:06.508 --> 00:20:07.008
Oh.

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:09.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.475
Especially when I enter
a room and there's flour.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:25.830
And eventually, this dough will,
through this agitation, begin to adhere.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:31.120
There's probably some degree
of evaporation taking place,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:37.760
obviously, because I'm taking this
dough and I'm spreading it out.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.535
And we're making a big mess.

00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:47.034
And my beautiful apron that I was
given, my commemorative apron--

00:20:47.034 --> 00:20:49.836
AUDIENCE: Like your sneakers.

00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:52.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.660
JIM LAHEY: They're not new.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:00.315
I knew what I was coming here
for, so I dressed appropriately.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.310
So has the 15-minute mark occurred yet?

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.810
OK.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.351
AUDIENCE: No.

00:21:06.351 --> 00:21:07.002
Six minutes.

00:21:07.002 --> 00:21:07.585
JIM LAHEY: OK.

00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:07.880
Good.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.450
Let's see if I can get this
dough together in six minutes.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.740
That would be redeeming.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.803
So I would suggest that if you were
to do this, do this in your shower.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.053
Set yourself up with a
nice table in your shower.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.810
But please, wear some form of
clothing when you're doing this.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.495
It just gets too weird otherwise.

00:21:44.495 --> 00:21:47.174
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:49.590
I don't think anyone's going
to want to eat what you make.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.101
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.680
But you can see the dough
is beginning to develop

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.350
cohesion it didn't have before.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.260
Its texture is beginning to change.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.780
And this really is a
one-to-one- ratio of flour

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.240
to water because I was told that
there was a liter of water in there,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.200
and we've used it all.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.840
And the flour was a
little less than a kilo.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.120
So there we have it.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.135
We're almost there, almost there.

00:22:23.135 --> 00:22:24.940
Five minutes to go.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.990
Four minutes, right?

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.330
Now, you're gonna notice the other
dough is gonna come about probably

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.935
better with a lot less effort.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.040
Imagine if I could aim it.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.660
That would be so cool.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.160
You, in the fourth row!

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:55.660
Duck!

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.950
If you have children,
this is a great thing

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.190
to do, experiment to do with them.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.470
If you have people helping you clean
your house up, that's even better.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.530
But if you don't,
that's a great exercise

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.173
in how to clean up a huge mess.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:29.900
So what I'm doing by doing this is
I'm causing those protein molecules

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.485
to align.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.040
And it's not like they're alone.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.810
I mean, there's also a
lot of starch involved

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.300
in the structure and texture of dough.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:51.980
I could have added the salt later
if the quantity of salt was higher.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.277
And that would actually have a helpful
effect on the tightening of the dough.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.480
And my science friends
can tell me, and I

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.345
think it's because salt and
water are opposite polarities.

00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:11.270
Is this true?

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.740
Oh, they're the same polarity?

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.540
Salt, water?

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.380
Polarity?

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.035
Same?

00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:17.810
Oh, shit.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.330
There goes that theory.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.199
I did-- see, I told you
I'm not a scientist.

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:23.740
I did bring my eyeglass case, though.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.615
But that's OK.

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:27.610
Come on, dough.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.050
You're gonna come together.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.550
Behave.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.230
So anyway, when I do add
salt to dough-- maybe

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.970
you can tell me why-- it
does tighten the dough up.

00:24:46.335 --> 00:24:49.306
Probably should have.

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:50.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:57.190
You another weird thing
about dough and things

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.590
that are really sticky,
apart from the fact

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:04.300
that they-- I think in general,
human beings avoid them,

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:10.620
are excited by them, and at the
same time kind of get, like, weird

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.250
just because it's sticky.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.940
It's gross.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.040
It's like King Kong just blew
a booger out or something.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.560
So there's this thing about
things that are wet and sticky

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.970
that in general don't
work well with machinery.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.620
For example, the reason
why most bread that we eat

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.590
is lacking texture or flavor is
because most of the foods that we eat

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.970
are manufactured mechanically.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.590
Very, very little of the
bread we eat per capita

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:55.070
is made by craftspeople-- or just people
in general, not craft or not craft.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.055
Most of the food that we
eat is usually manufactured.

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:05.157
I think we're almost there.

00:26:05.157 --> 00:26:07.240
I'll be saying this for,
like, the next 20 minutes

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:13.562
or so, until the sweat
pours down from my face

00:26:13.562 --> 00:26:16.020
into this dough, which you will
not-- that no one will eat.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.956
You weren't expecting this, were you?

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.611
We there yet, timewise?

00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:30.593
AUDIENCE: 40 seconds.

00:26:30.593 --> 00:26:33.050
JIM LAHEY: OK.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.170
This is our experiment.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.072
Oh, gross.

00:26:35.072 --> 00:26:40.575
I'm like totally-- this is like, oh man.

00:26:40.575 --> 00:26:43.130
This is the worse it's ever been.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:48.282
I haven't done this, by the way, this
demonstration, in, like, 20 years.

00:26:48.282 --> 00:26:54.120
So it's kind of special to kind of
go back to the origins of my baking.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.230
I used to make these very
large batches of dough.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:04.375
I kid you not, like, 20, 30 pounds
of dough in a garage in Brooklyn.

00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:06.040
Yep, you heard it-- Brooklyn.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:16.624
And I'm glad I kind of stopped doing
that because that was a real mess.

00:27:16.624 --> 00:27:17.480
AUDIENCE: Time's up.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:17.740
JIM LAHEY: Time's up?

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.240
All right.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.400
So I'm just gonna take this dough.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.620
And this is approximately
the same hydration.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.740
Same hydration.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.870
I'm just going to fold it
over like this, and that's it.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.778
I think this method's gonna win.

00:27:37.778 --> 00:27:40.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.450
It already looks nicer.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.725
Look at that.

00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:44.961
It's even got elasticity.

00:27:44.961 --> 00:27:47.366
Dang!

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:48.436
And no mess!

00:27:54.280 --> 00:28:02.130
I'm also available for children's
parties., bar mitzvahs, weddings.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.585
You want some unique-- I can
see the dough is actually

00:28:04.585 --> 00:28:05.710
beginning to come together.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.695
So I'm kind of excited now, motivated.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.670
They were so upset with
me at NYU-- pretty much

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.680
like they are going to be at Harvard--
that they never invited me back.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.490
And I'm not doing this to try to
coat everyone in the first row.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.120
I'm-- ooh.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.510
That was bad.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.780
Usually when I do this, I get,
like, a big globule on the face.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.860
That hasn't happened yet, thankfully.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:48.230
But if it does, feel free to laugh
because at the end of the day,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.200
every little bit helps.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.750
So if you laugh, it's good.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.370
It's all good.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.980
The bread you can make using
this method is as good as bread

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.480
that you could make using a stand mixer.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.160
And so there's no real
reason to do this other

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.585
than being able to understand
what happens if you take dough

00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:17.520
and you throw it on a tabletop
as if it actually matters.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.900
Like, I actually question
the validity of this method

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:27.300
right now because when I
was learning how to bake,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.742
that's all they had
vis-a-vis (FRENCH ACCENT)

00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:34.650
this French book or the French guy.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.970
And he's going like this.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.750
So-- sorry, are there
any French people here?

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.420
I'm insulting.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:51.212
You guys have a basketball
team, right, here in Boston?

00:29:51.212 --> 00:29:54.190
Right?

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.170
What's the big basketball team here?

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.990
What's their mascot and their logo?

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.690
Some encephalitic kind
of little guy, right?

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.500
There should a class action
suit by the whole country

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:13.620
of Ireland against the city of Boston
for characterizing Irish people

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.010
as encephalitic and belligerent.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.144
Think about that.

00:30:19.144 --> 00:30:19.810
Really negative.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.160
I mean, 'cause you
know, sports teams now

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.340
are their-- across this
great land of ours,

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:33.900
sports teams are having their day in
terms of the names of sports teams.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.650
I was going to start making some
jokes, but I'm-- tasteless jokes.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:42.000
But I'll stay away from the subject
because I might piss someone off.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.520
But I can always make fun of Irish
people because I'm geologically Irish.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.298
I guess it's not the same, is it?

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:53.055
Oh, gross.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.660
Come on.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.415
Come together!

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.560
It will.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.060
It will.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.240
It will.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:07.960
It really will.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.480
I swear.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.104
I swear to you.

00:31:09.104 --> 00:31:14.170
I know that this is a big
mess, and I feel like I'm

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.160
creating a halo around me of splatter.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.936
I'm really in trouble, aren't I, Pia?

00:31:19.936 --> 00:31:21.320
I know I'm in big trouble.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.275
I'm in big trouble.

00:31:22.275 --> 00:31:22.775
I can tell.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.250
How many minutes are we
total on this exercise?

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.720
I'm going to theorize
that at about 18 minutes,

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:44.790
it's going to start to appear as a
dough because-- have I gotten anyone

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.710
yet in the front row?

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.210
OK.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:51.550
But you're not, like-- I don't
see any globules on your bags.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.050
OK.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.550
I'm gonna try a little harder, then.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.670
I didn't need that shirt anyway.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:04.710
So this method-- I'm trying
to discredit this method.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:10.550
This method, which was published in
this book-- I think the book was,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.682
does anyone know the baker Eric Kayser?

00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:14.290
Eric Kayser.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.535
So he was like one of the main
bakers featured in this book.

00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:19.660
He was so young.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:28.780
So what's interesting is
that it might not be true

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:35.410
that all of this physical
activity-- is it really

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.280
helping align the protein molecules?

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.770
Or is it just, like, a wank.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:44.483
Is this master baking?

00:32:44.483 --> 00:32:46.948
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.720
Do any of you know any master bakers?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.195
Chronic master bakers that, like,
put tables in their showers and knead

00:32:58.195 --> 00:32:58.982
dough?

00:32:58.982 --> 00:33:01.934
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:16.452
So I just got my worth from this
because I'm making you guys laugh.

00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:18.160
And that matters more
to me than actually

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.750
teaching you a darn
thing about baking bread

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.380
because I made your lives richer today.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.650
But you'll see that this
dough will come together.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:30.740
I'm willing it!

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.290
It's my ego!

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.520
I got to make it come together!

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.644
It's got to stick together!

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:34.920
Come on, dough!

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.369
Come on!

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:36.910
Just kidding.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.790
You can't talk to dough.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.340
That would be the definition
of insanity, right?

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.480
But I can see the texture of the dough,
it's developing a lot of cohesion.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.396
I mean, there's this
thing called the autolyse

00:33:48.396 --> 00:34:00.330
that takes place, this period in which
the flour and starch absorb water

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.560
and the protein begins to denature.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.606
But you hear the sound is changing.

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:06.930
It's becoming more of a thud.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.420
It's definitely getting cohesive.

00:34:19.643 --> 00:34:22.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.690
Come on.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.541
It's not a dough yet.

00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:26.040
Encore?

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.290
Oh, my.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.790
Oh, my.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:34.520
You should see back here.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.255
It's even worse.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:49.389
So I came to the conclusion
of the no-knead method

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:55.360
after practicing this for years
before I opened up a bakery.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.330
And the reason why I
came up with this method

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:05.070
was it dawned on me that there's
no way ancient civilizations who

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:10.860
had policies of global domination and
expansion based on a wheat economy,

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.230
not a petroleum or
technology economy-- there's

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:21.920
no way that the Romans, for example,
could conquer the world if they had

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.020
to be engaged in this master baking.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.720
They would have been too tired.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.150
There would have been revolts that we
would have heard about that probably

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.050
would have proceeded Christianity.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.940
Oh, my.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.690
There's a big one over there,
right next to your feet.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.870
But you see the dough is
actually begin to develop

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:48.016
a little bit more cohesiveness and
body at about the 20-minute mark.

00:35:48.016 --> 00:35:50.170
Are We at 20 minutes yet, more or less?

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.502
Pia, did I get you?

00:35:51.502 --> 00:35:53.670
Good.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.730
20?

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.670
Oh, OK.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.890
But the total amount of
time I've been kneading now?

00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.440
Close to 20?

00:36:03.922 --> 00:36:06.210
Oh, Jesus.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.540
Sweating like a dog here.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.780
And actually, typically
what happens, too,

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.740
as the dough begins to
become more cohesive,

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.700
you end up having more creative
strands of dough that kind of

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.635
fly in all sorts of weird directions.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.240
But this is a good experiment.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.660
I have how many more
minutes for the other turn?

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:35.440
Now, the other problem with
this experiment, folks,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.884
is that dough B-- we'll call this
dough A. That's my bald head, isn't it?

00:36:40.884 --> 00:36:41.858
Oh, gee.

00:36:41.858 --> 00:36:44.293
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:46.241 --> 00:36:49.030
I got a mole.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.335
I am sweating, aren't I?

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.496
Well, you know what they
say-- balds have more fun.

00:37:00.496 --> 00:37:03.441
It's a bad joke.

00:37:03.441 --> 00:37:04.190
Bald is beautiful.

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:15.890
It's happening.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:16.515
It's happening.

00:37:16.515 --> 00:37:17.360
I can see it.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.010
It's a formless mass, but
it's going to come together.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:32.680
It's three, maybe four minutes
away, maybe five, 50 or 60

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.660
of these kind of things
that I'm doing to the dough.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:43.870
I've lost about 2/3 of the way of
the dough on the floor and walls.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.170
I would also recommend,
too, for the crew here,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:57.210
I'll stay after and help clean as
a gesture of goodwill and charity

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.590
because I feel bad that I'm making
such a mess at this prestigious school.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:09.894
I missed.

00:38:09.894 --> 00:38:11.560
I was trying to get you in the eye, man.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.710
Take that, gluten intolerance.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.770
So gluten intolerance-- should
we talk about gluten intolerance?

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.300
This is a form of gluten in-- no.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.260
Did we talk about
gluten intolerance here?

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:37.360
Do we talk about what's unique
about gluten or bread or wheat

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.320
or any of the plants
associated with wheat?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.830
It is really a special
and unique protein

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:48.835
because of its particular
properties, not dissimilar to,

00:38:48.835 --> 00:38:52.210
as I was discussing
with Pia-- but I wasn't

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:59.200
talking like this-- with, I was
just saying, like, latex or rubber.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.720
And the reason why I say it, it
reminds me of rubber in a weird way.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.090
And actually, if you've ever
washed-- have any of you

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.526
ever washed gluten out of flour?

00:39:10.526 --> 00:39:11.400
Done a little?

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.246
OK.

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:15.620
it's very gummy and chewy.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.330
Has anyone ever made seitan?

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.340
it's nice, right?

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.554
Neat substitute.

00:39:20.554 --> 00:39:22.720
Well, I was just thinking,
I wonder if there's a way

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:28.510
to stabilize chemically-- oh, nice.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.081
I got Peter.

00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:29.580
I got you?

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.239
Good, Pete.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:32.780
Sorry, Peter.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.665
Sorry.

00:39:34.665 --> 00:39:38.970
I'm trying to keep it local, lower.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.950
When do I have to turn
the other dough, folks?

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.636
Am I there yet?

00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:45.550
Am I past schedule?

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.230
OK.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.607
I'm just hopeful that this
dough can come together

00:39:49.607 --> 00:39:50.940
before the three minutes are up.

00:39:54.577 --> 00:39:55.910
Would you ever try this at home?

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.650
Have I dissuaded you
from making a big mess?

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.270
Then I also have succeeded.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.600
AUDIENCE: No way.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.590
JIM LAHEY: You would try this?

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.900
You would try it?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.581
Yeah?

00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:07.080
Yeah.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.024
It's kind of fun.

00:40:09.024 --> 00:40:13.600
I'm always tempted to have
audience participation.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.590
But I think what I'll do
is when the dough is done,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.400
I'm going to pass the dough around.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.992
And you guys can play
with it, if you want.

00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:23.950
I don't want to see the
dough again afterwards.

00:40:27.086 --> 00:40:27.980
Oh, gross.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.860
Look at this.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.030
Mia, it's true.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.580
I do make a mess wherever I go.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.970
My wife was commenting that
wherever I go, I make a mess.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.950
I mean, not metaphoric mess.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:53.950
I mean like an actual
physical, tangible mess.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.295
But the texture of the dough,
do you see it changing?

00:40:56.295 --> 00:41:00.240
Becoming somewhat-- it's
still not cohesive yet,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.066
but it's beginning to web.

00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:03.690
And what you're looking for is webbing.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:08.030
So the discussion on bread
and elasticity and mouth

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:13.690
feel would be something like people
talk about bread still in terms

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.637
of whether there are big holes or not.

00:41:17.637 --> 00:41:18.470
Have you heard that?

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:19.980
You guys have the big holes in it?

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.110
Ever heard that?

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.990
But, I mean, it's probably not the
most important thing about bread.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.770
The most important thing
about bread is the wheat

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.310
and where the wheat came from.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:40.330
And unfortunately, not dissimilar
to the use of glyphosate

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:49.150
as a herbicide on the heels
of the Green Revolution,

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:57.160
not dissimilar-- at that
point in human history,

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.860
it was extremely important to use
science to solve the problem of

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:14.460
or to capitalize on the success
humanity was having at producing food

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.040
at even greater levels.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.330
And there are a lot who believe, as
do I, that at the end of the day,

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.070
it was a great milestone.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:30.170
However, if one tried to legalize
an herbicide like glyphosate today,

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:38.720
it would never be allowed to
be used in the marketplace

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.236
because we know more
now than we did in 1971.

00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:47.294
See, the texture's begin to
actually become a bit of a dough.

00:42:47.294 --> 00:42:48.400
All right.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.260
Am I at the three-minute mark, folks?

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.040
I need reprieve.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.150
I need a break.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.876
OK.

00:42:53.876 --> 00:42:54.515
Oh, Jesus.

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:57.850
I was gonna wipe my forehead with
my hand, but I'm not gonna do that.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.290
I've stepped into that one before.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.790
So I'm gonna take this
dough-- this is no-knead--

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.230
and just give it a couple turns.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.530
We could play, like,
Metallica over there.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.530
And then when we come to this
side, we should have, like, Bach.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.440
I was thinking of Bach.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.940
Right?

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.880
Right?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.640
Right?

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.400
And I can stick to anything now.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.892
It's like if I-- Jesus.

00:43:26.892 --> 00:43:28.820
I'm not even religious, but Jesus.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.220
So are we doing every 15 minutes
on those turns or every 20?

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.605
And how much more time do
I have in this lecture?

00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:47.600
Because I have to time the
conclusion, the grand finale.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.750
What will the grand finale be?

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.060
Yeah.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.935
So I used to do this.

00:43:59.935 --> 00:44:01.399
I swear to God, I used to do this.

00:44:01.399 --> 00:44:02.690
I would stay up all night long.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:08.750
I'd make four or five batches
of dough as a protean hipster.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.460
It's like a Jackson
Pollock piece, right?

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.650
And in my little garage in
Brooklyn, I would go into Manhattan

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:29.412
with a basket full of bread,
like a large-- kind of like one

00:44:29.412 --> 00:44:33.910
of those big rattan baskets, like
the size of a coffin or something.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.500
And I would sell bread on
the streets of New York City.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.740
And that's kind of how
my bakery was born.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:49.820
But I have to say, once I abandoned
this method, life became a lot nicer.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.060
However, it is a really
cool thing to see

00:44:54.060 --> 00:45:02.056
this blob become a something, which it's
now becoming, as it really is changing.

00:45:02.056 --> 00:45:03.180
You see it changing, right?

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.820
It's really getting stickier, cohesive.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:15.300
I mean, it's at its most sticky
state when it's not cohesive,

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:23.210
although I guess the size and
degree of suction it can create

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:27.400
because of its texture is different.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.100
If it sticks, it sucks.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.330
If it sucks, it sticks.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.000
And I'd say we're-- I keep saying
we're, like, five minutes away.

00:45:45.771 --> 00:45:46.270
Gross.

00:45:50.729 --> 00:45:52.395
I knew I should have been an accountant.

00:45:58.153 --> 00:45:59.570
But we're getting there.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.870
We're getting there.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.280
I'm not going to give up.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.482
I can't leave here until
this is an actual dough.

00:46:05.482 --> 00:46:06.850
And I see it.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:12.020
I see the-- I can notice
this here, these areas that

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.285
are kind of sticky with stuff.

00:46:16.285 --> 00:46:18.160
But the dough is actually
beginning to adhere

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.220
to itself, which is what we want,
or what I would like to see happen.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.940
How we doing mess-wise, guys?

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.440
OK?

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.940
OK, go.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.090
Get my head out of the way.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.541
How many minutes do I
have to go over there now?

00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:54.040
What?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:54.310
10?

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:54.850
OK, good.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.390
This has got to happen now.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.600
So I've been doing this for
almost 25 minutes now, right?

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.285
More?

00:47:00.285 --> 00:47:00.910
AUDIENCE: More.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:01.770
35.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.230
JIM LAHEY: Jesus.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.310
I shouldn't say Jesus.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.834
I'll say something else.

00:47:07.834 --> 00:47:10.330
Um, gee willikers.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:27.180
I mean, this could be accomplished
in less than three minutes

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:33.490
in a stand mixer, believe it or
not, everything that I'm doing here.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:37.179
You see the dough is now
beginning to stick to itself,

00:47:37.179 --> 00:47:38.595
which is what we were looking for.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.560
On your chin.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.660
Right on your chin.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.420
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.690
Harvard's going to cover that.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.960
They told me.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.490
Oh, no.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.239
I feel really bad.

00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:51.035
Now I feel really bad.

00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:54.010
OK.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.630
Do not wash that sweater in hot water.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.650
It will be ruined.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.180
I'm so sorry.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.542
Now I feel really bad.

00:48:01.542 --> 00:48:04.000
You know what we should have
done is we should have planned

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.640
to have, like, a Blue Man Group.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.000
Everyone should have been given a piece
of clear plastic in the front row.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.480
Hi, Pia.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.230
Pia's my daughter.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.242
She's there.

00:48:19.242 --> 00:48:21.782
You having fun, Pia?

00:48:21.782 --> 00:48:22.922
OK.

00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:23.630
Just distraction.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.800
But you can see the dough is
actually becoming a dough.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.350
Do not buy this book, by the
way, by Van Nostrand-Reinhold,

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.967
unless you're a masochist.

00:48:41.967 --> 00:48:44.925
(FRENCH ACCENT) Ah, but in France,
this is how they make the bread, eh?

00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:56.290
But you see how it's really beginning
to adhere to itself or become cohesive.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:05.810
The issue is keeping it all together
as it begins to-- oh, gross.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.825
It's everywhere.

00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:09.981
Everywhere.

00:49:09.981 --> 00:49:10.730
I feel really bad.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.911
Sorry, guys.

00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:13.410
I do.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.130
I don't want to make anyone's
clothing messy other than my own.

00:49:21.234 --> 00:49:22.150
All right.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:27.780
Now the perspiration is
beginning so I know we're close.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.400
There will be no moan,
though, when this is done.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.920
There will be no cry of ecstasy.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.000
There'll be no, ah!

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.390
It's done!

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:40.610
No, that will not happen.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.590
No, no, no.

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.770
Not here.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:49.830
This is an experiment.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.570
Not an experiment.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:57.770
This is, I'd say, close to
100% hydration, if not more.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:05.880
This is-- are you seeing the difference
in the dough, or is it my imagination?

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.630
You see it, right?

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.870
OK, good.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:18.460
But imagine if during antiquity,
the Greeks or the Romans

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.570
or the Phoenicians or
the Egyptians-- no wonder

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:26.500
the Jews left Egypt if
they had to do this shit.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.935
They'd be like, I'm out of here, dude.

00:50:28.935 --> 00:50:29.752
I'm out of here.

00:50:29.752 --> 00:50:31.210
I'm not even gonna put yeast in it.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:32.025
Forget about it.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.120
So it doesn't make sense.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.950
It doesn't make any sense at all.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.830
Yeah, they get-- as the
dough becomes more cohesive,

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:50.150
these pieces will fly off into,
like, probably up toward the top,

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.970
I would even say.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.080
It's quite probable.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.605
But you see it's really becoming-- ooh.

00:50:54.605 --> 00:50:55.105
Oh.

00:50:55.105 --> 00:50:56.780
I could even take some stuff
of this stuff off here.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:57.650
Gross.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:58.947
Get back in there.

00:50:58.947 --> 00:50:59.530
Back in there.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.250
And I will pass this dough
around for all of you

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:14.760
to play with and finger at your
whatever, just to have fun,

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.020
just to see that it actually did happen.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.642
Live dough.

00:51:21.642 --> 00:51:22.732
Oh, my.

00:51:22.732 --> 00:51:23.716
Get back here.

00:51:28.144 --> 00:51:33.680
Now, I could stop now and
allow the dough to sit.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.170
And it would develop a
little bit more cohesiveness.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.730
But I think that because
we've taken it this far,

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:45.730
you might as well-- I'm gonna
ask everyone in the front

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:50.560
row to find seats in
the-- no, just kidding.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.100
You guys seem to be having a good time.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.070
What's a little staining?

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.150
It'll be a nice little-- oh, that
was the time that that crazy guy--

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.864
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:02.864 --> 00:52:03.905
JIM LAHEY: What was that?

00:52:03.905 --> 00:52:05.040
AUDIENCE: The seats are--

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.690
JIM LAHEY: Yeah, the seats are
becoming-- that's what I'm saying.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.890
They're never going to
invite me back here.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.680
They're never gonna invite me back.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.500
I'll never be invited back to another
World's Fair by my government,

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.130
and I will never be invited
back to Harvard to do a lecture.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:18.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.020
What?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.603
What happened?

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.190
There's a first time for
everything, don't you think?

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.910
But this is really becoming
a dough, as you can see.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:51.040
And it's at that point, and
I don't know what causes it.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:57.680
Is it the production of those--
just to sound scientific,

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:04.310
is it the production of foils
from disulfur hydroxyl groups?

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:05.660
Is it?

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.180
Is it?

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:06.800
Help me out, brother.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.300
Help me out.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.965
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:10.510
JIM LAHEY: Disulfides from methyls.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:11.301
Thank you, brother.

00:53:11.301 --> 00:53:12.110
Thank you.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.540
Is that what's happening
chemically in the dough?

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.040
What's your name, young man?

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.726
AUDIENCE: Tim.

00:53:18.726 --> 00:53:19.350
JIM LAHEY: Tim.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.600
I like your name already, Tim.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.460
Sounds like Jim.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.269
It's a wishbone, perfect wishbone.

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:26.810
Look at that.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.351
Look at that.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:43.160
And you see I'm throwing it at
this table with as much force--

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:49.520
--as possible.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.710
I'm never going to be
invited back, am I?

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:03.610
This is like-- I would love
one day to be invited back.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.460
But now we know, plastic.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.730
Pia's thinking to herself,
I am in so much trouble.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:14.330
Oh, my God.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:15.760
Sorry, Pia.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.080
That's why, as an act of
charity and contrition,

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.925
I will help clean after for my sins.

00:54:22.925 --> 00:54:24.050
I will make up for my sins.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.895
What the hell is this?

00:54:32.895 --> 00:54:33.520
Foreign matter.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.080
I don't even want to know.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.960
It was kind of gray.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.310
Could have been something that a
professor left on this tabletop.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.340
We're so close, guys.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:53.840
We are.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.750
We really are.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.790
And this guy's leaving because he's
like, I can't take this anymore.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:05.430
I came here for a serious discussion
about dough, protein, and elasticity.

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:12.490
And we've got some meshuggana
throwing dough on a table,

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:16.931
making all sorts of inappropriate jokes.

00:55:16.931 --> 00:55:17.430
Yeah.

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.900
But what I see taking place, though,
if you notice when I pick the dough up,

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.440
it's adhering to itself.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:29.540
And it's actually forming good
suction as opposed to bad section.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:35.900
It doesn't have this
kind of film, right?

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.650
But actually, it's beginning
to-- I call it picking up clean.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.750
And when you mix dough in a
mixer, you see the same phenomenon

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.020
toward the end of the
mix, which is called

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:55.570
the pickup, which is where you have this
development of the gluten in the flour.

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.350
And obviously, because of the
water ratio in this dough,

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:04.370
it's extreme because this is
as much water as one-- I mean,

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:10.020
if I had made a dough that
had 15% to 20% less water,

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.660
I would've already had a
beautifully formed dough.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:20.790
But the objective of this exercise was
to show you the-- sorry about that.

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.260
Hit a bag.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:28.710
Was to show you the extreme,
not what you can easily achieve

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.710
but what might be more
difficult to achieve.

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:36.420
What's unique about bread
is that you can do this.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.270
Do I need to go to the other dough yet?

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.227
Am I overdue on the other dough?

00:56:40.227 --> 00:56:41.565
OK.

00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:42.690
Think I might even have it.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.890
This is, like, three cycles.

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:48.270
I'm not doing this again
tomorrow, by the way.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.950
I got to do something, another act.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:52.090
I got to figure out-- I'm gonna die.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:02.600
Maybe what we'll do tomorrow is
I'll just buy a roll of-- this

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.510
will be funny.

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:08.289
Yeah, we should do the same thing, but
we'll buy a couple rolls of plastic

00:57:08.289 --> 00:57:11.580
because then the people that are sitting
in the front row will be freaking out.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.620
Like, what did we do wrong?

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.260
Why you're covering us
up with plastic for?

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:16.900
What's up?

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.840
I don't mind being
laughed at, by the way.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.042
As long as you're not laughing with me.

00:57:38.042 --> 00:57:40.808
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:44.126
The best line of the evening, I think.

00:57:49.756 --> 00:57:55.266
But you see, it's actually
beginning to adhere to itself.

00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:58.260
And it's making that noise
of a dough that's done.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:07.380
And it's achieving whetting, elasticity.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:13.010
Now, if we let this sit for
about 10 minutes or longer,

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:17.090
we should be able to stretch it out
pretty long, which could actually

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:20.090
be fun for the sake of the class.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.530
I could, for the sake of
making life easier tomorrow,

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.450
just do this whole
demonstration in a mixer.

00:58:28.775 --> 00:58:30.060
Yeah?

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:30.560
What?

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.250
Oh, it's time to turn?

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.750
OK.

00:58:37.873 --> 00:58:41.310
[HUMMING]

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.426
OK.

00:58:48.426 --> 00:58:50.962
Oh, gross.

00:58:50.962 --> 00:58:51.910
Oh, my God.

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.050
I can see the crew here at night.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:55.650
They'll be like, what is this?

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:57.102
This guy, he ruined our day.

00:58:57.102 --> 00:58:59.060
Now we got to spend,
like, four hours cleaning.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.018
We usually come in here,
all we do is sweep up.

00:59:01.018 --> 00:59:03.580
And now we got to figure out
how do we get this stuff off.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.130
My supervisor's gonna chew
me a new one tomorrow.

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:08.550
And oh, my God!

00:59:14.854 --> 00:59:16.270
But I did get it out of my system.

00:59:18.986 --> 00:59:21.099
And we're almost there.

00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:21.890
We're almost there.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:24.974
We almost have a cohesive mass.

00:59:24.974 --> 00:59:26.140
But you see what I'm saying?

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:31.020
What happens when the dough
actually becomes more formed,

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:33.350
it does have a tendency of
flying a little bit more.

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:49.236
And I swear to God, there is a
book that shows this step by step.

00:59:49.236 --> 00:59:50.610
I mean, it's not as long as this.

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:59.087
But when you're looking at a book,
and you're 19, 20 years old, and I'm

00:59:59.087 --> 00:59:59.920
looking at the book.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.480
I'm like, but when?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.590
How?

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:04.720
Because it never happened.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.630
But if you just-- eventually,
it will come together.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.414
Stamina alone, right?

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.580
Great upper body exercise, by the way.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.630
But I think we have cohesion.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:57.110
We have cohesion!

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:59.880
And I can use this to pick up
everything on the table now.

01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:07.890
Almost.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.900
See, we're getting there.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.910
I knew it would happen eventually.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.850
Towel?

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.590
Just kidding.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.879
My poor shoes.

01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:26.081
I'm gonna have to stop off at Alden
Shoes and get a nice pair of wingtips

01:01:26.081 --> 01:01:26.580
after this.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.190
Yeah, but I think we're there.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.690
See?

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.340
So now you have a cohesive mass.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.563
And actually--

01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:39.014
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:48.874 --> 01:01:51.035
I'm not through with you yet, man!

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.600
You want a piece of me?

01:01:57.468 --> 01:02:01.390
But you can see it's beginning to web.

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:03.760
And it's becoming very cohesive.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:09.790
And it probably has a little
bit to do with evaporation,

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:12.240
that in this period of time
that I've been kneading,

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.600
I've probably lost most of the dough.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.362
But, I mean, we could measure
the weight of this blob.

01:02:23.362 --> 01:02:26.320
And then we could come up with a real
estimate of how much of the dough

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.910
we lost.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:33.060
I would think we lost about a
quarter-- less than a quarter.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.670
Maybe 300 grams.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.880
Maybe 100 grams or so.

01:02:43.467 --> 01:02:50.980
So this is elastic, an
elastic, sticky mess.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.410
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.620
[INAUDIBLE], right?

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.305
Don't do this.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.540
[HUMMING]

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.790
This actually should be allowed to
rest for at least 20 minutes or longer

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:14.550
because the dough
hasn't kind of relaxed.

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:19.050
But this dough, for
argument's sake-- I'll

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:21.800
let it sit in the bowl for five
minutes, then I'll pass it around.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.580
And the reason why, see,
it's completely cohesive now.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.630
And it actually picks up
cleanly from the table.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:32.590
It doesn't leave a residue, or very
little residue if any residue at all,

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.430
ideally.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:37.890
And this is definitely about
100% hydration, if not more.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:39.265
So a little ball here.

01:03:39.265 --> 01:03:40.310
It's very elastic.

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:42.014
It's very smooth.

01:03:42.014 --> 01:03:44.116
I'll put it in the bowl.

01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:44.910
We'll let it sit.

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:45.510
Oh, my God.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:46.385
I ruined my notebook?

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.840
That was a no-brainer.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.405
And so--

01:03:51.405 --> 01:03:54.652
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:54.652 --> 01:03:57.514
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.360
So that's a demonstration
on how to knead

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.587
by hand in this very intensive way.

01:04:06.587 --> 01:04:08.670
But I think it's better
to use my no-knead method.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:12.010
I've got books outside, which
are really, really cool,

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:17.020
and including the recipe
for pizza bianca, as well.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.460
But going back to if
it sticks, it sucks.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:23.790
So this has more
suction or less suction.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:24.431
Hmm.

01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:26.180
I think it has a lot
of suction, actually.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.590
Let me see.

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.730
Yes, there's a lot of suction.

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:34.475
But it's not a sticky as-- well, I
guess it's as sticky as it was before.

01:04:34.475 --> 01:04:37.660
Yeah, it's definitely stickier.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.980
But it does have a tendency of
sticking to itself, which is good.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:47.840
Well, if I don't knead the dough, going
back to the mouth feel and product

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.800
texture, and I use
this method of turning,

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.950
I can get an identical crumb
structure and identical mouth feel,

01:04:55.950 --> 01:05:07.350
if I kind of fail to get the
dough to become cohesive,

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:16.310
either by mixing it mechanically or
by turning it and allowing the protein

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:23.120
molecules to kind of align themselves
from just denaturing and unraveling

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.080
and kind of doing their thing naturally.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.090
The product texture tends to be cakier.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.750
It also tends to be denser.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:39.230
Part of it, as well, has to do
with the dough fermenting properly.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:47.410
I mean, fermentation plays a
huge role in product texture.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:52.562
And if you don't get
fermentation on wheat--

01:05:52.562 --> 01:05:54.270
and also, another
thing, too, about wheat

01:05:54.270 --> 01:06:00.050
is that if it's not good wheat-- in
quotation marks, the word "good."

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:08.900
If it's not high-quality wheat, it
might not be able to ferment that much.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.320
You can still make bread with it.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.600
But are you familiar with
tolerance, the concept of tolerance?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.210
Wheat tolerance?

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:26.710
Well, flours are graded by the quantity
of protein that they have in them.

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:30.220
And then they're also graded
by the quality of the proteins.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.640
So it's not the quantity
of protein per se

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.160
that will make good bread or flour
that could be good for making bread.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.880
It's more the quality.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:46.090
And the quality of the
protein's-- how would you say--

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:52.610
resistance to fermentation is measured
by this thing called a falling number.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.980
Do you know about the falling number?

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.920
The FN?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:03.000
So the falling number measures,
I think-- if wheat, for example,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.610
is grow in Western Mass,
Mass, "Mass-a-Two-Shets."

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:15.190
If it's grown in Western
Mass, and it's a wonderful--

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:17.230
I always used to say
"Massive Two Shits."

01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:20.200
But, I mean, I kind of
have that in my brain.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.720
No-- I like this state.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.485
It's a nice state.

01:07:22.485 --> 01:07:24.657
Don't get me wrong.

01:07:24.657 --> 01:07:26.740
It's just like this weird
kind of ism that I have.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.117
So-- oh, gross.

01:07:28.117 --> 01:07:29.950
I'm gonna take this
apron off at some point.

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.450
I'm gonna stand away from the table.

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.640
Stand away from the table.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:39.140
So if the wheat is ideal, and then
all of a sudden there's a rainstorm,

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.400
and it gets wet and begins
to germinate a little bit,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.260
the quality of the
protein is now degraded.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.190
So it's not going to be as good
for breadmaking-- fermentation.

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:51.890
It can be great for breadmaking.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:55.600
But it just can't undergo the
same degree of fermentation

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.440
the wheat could undergo if the
wheat were like it were dry.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:07.040
So this is something that I think
has been a current through the ages,

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.720
whereby when you buy from a
local-- I mean, with bread culture,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:18.479
we don't have-- I mean, these are
like both white crack flour varieties.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:19.370
They're not good.

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:22.870
I mean, they're commodity
flours, basically.

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:24.439
This is not a mill.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.979
This is a brand.

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:28.399
They don't mill their own wheat.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:31.750
There's no difference between this and
this, other than labeling and packaging

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:38.939
and they contribute to No Kid
Hungry and they have the word

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:41.810
"goodness" and "good" all over it.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:46.284
So this is probably a
better product placement

01:08:46.284 --> 01:08:47.700
because it's such a strong seller.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:53.399
This one here is, again, the same
grade of flour, but bleached.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:58.960
And for all I know, they were both
made and both milled in the same plant.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.910
I mean, we don't have a wheat culture
like we do a wine culture, for example.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:09.910
I mean, people wouldn't buy wine if they
knew that or thought that it was just

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:14.330
frozen grape juice
concentrates mixed together,

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.840
and then you slap a label
on it and it's wine.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.500
And we still live in the world
where the use value of bread

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:28.890
has more importance than any discussion
about its aesthetic or, for example,

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:30.189
where the grain comes from.

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:36.090
I mean, during the colonial period
of our nation, wheat was grown here.

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:41.510
Wheat was grown everywhere-- Virginia,
North Carolina, New York state.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:45.439
Brooklyn, for example, had some of
the finest wheat in the colonies.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.850
Who knew?

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.600
Brooklyn was like a giant
wheat field at one point.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.830
And that all changed.

01:09:54.830 --> 01:10:00.370
And it's a good thing because a
lot of the world's hunger issues

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:02.390
have been resolved.

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:06.720
But at the same time, what
we did lose with wheat

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.020
was, like, where the wheat came
from, where the grain came from,

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.690
that it's not regional.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:16.580
Does anyone buy regional wheat here?

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.996
There is a regional wheat
movement here, right?

01:10:18.996 --> 01:10:21.330
There has to be, right?

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:23.020
Isn't there?

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:23.520
What?

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.540
AUDIENCE: Maine Grains?

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.910
JIM LAHEY: Maine Grains, yeah.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.640
Skowhegan.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.220
Yeah.

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.800
So there's a big
regional wheat area that

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.960
collapsed in a town called Skowhegan,
kind of southern Maine, right?

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.830
Central southern?

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.120
Skowhegan.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.860
And that was on the cusp
of becoming a wheat region,

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.260
I think, in the late 1890s.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.800
And then when people were
being encouraged and enticed

01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.950
and lured to move west, the
regional grain economy went bye-bye.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:07.030
And it's only recently, in
the last 20 years or so,

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:12.160
that there has been a re-regionalizing
and a shortening of the supply chains.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:19.380
It's just that a lot of that heirloom
or boutique or regional wheat

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:23.240
rarely sees, like, the Harvard set.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.646
I don't think any of the bread made in
the cafeteria here is regional wheat.

01:11:27.646 --> 01:11:29.645
That may be more to do
with the fact that you've

01:11:29.645 --> 01:11:35.310
got to feed a lot of people, and
it ends up becoming a cost issue.

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:41.330
But then again, it also ends up becoming
a consistency issue, as well, where

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:44.720
to know how to work with
wheat, they can be variable

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.870
based on the quality of its protein.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:50.600
To get a consistent end result,
you have to have knowledge.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:58.630
And wheat's primary function is to
feed people, not to be like, oh!

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:04.350
This is a loaf of bread made
from Red Fife or Turkey Red

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:11.240
from so-and-sos farm near
Northampton, whatever.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.250
That not the kind of
conversation we have about wheat.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:16.580
It would be great if we did.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.520
I would love to see
that, and I could even

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.772
imagine, if I don't do any more demos,
that that could possibly happen.

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.730
But anyway, I'm gonna
pass the dough around now

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:31.000
because I wanted to let it sit
and rest and get kind of jiggly.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.880
There's elasticity.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.244
And if we let it sit longer, it
will become even more elastic.

01:12:36.244 --> 01:12:38.160
It's actually going to
start to fall apart now

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.690
that I've been playing with it.

01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:41.240
But I'm gonna pass the dough.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.770
And if you guys want to-- I
know there's a lot of you here.

01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:46.515
So theme music, everyone.

01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:47.765
PIA SORENSEN: That's gorgeous.

01:12:47.765 --> 01:12:48.431
JIM LAHEY: Yeah.

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:49.950
PIA SORENSEN: So I propose we clap.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.600
[APPLAUSE]
