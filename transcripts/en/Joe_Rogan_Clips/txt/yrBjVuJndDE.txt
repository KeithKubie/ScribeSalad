Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience coastal bears. That's the big ones. You know, brown bears and grizzly bears are the same thing, but brown bears are way bigger and the reason why they're way biggers cause they live on the coast. So just eating fish and dead whales launched and anything else they can get there. Fuck. Gorging on fucking fatty, fatty, heavy foods. There's an awful video and awful Jamie, I'll find it of a grizzly that's pulling black bear cubs out of a den and killing them and eating them. And the mother is trying to stop them. He's trying to stop the grizzly from eating her babies and he just swats her away. Like she ain't shit. I gotta say it's awful, dude. You shouldn't, shouldn't play it. It definitely can't play it and you shouldn't even watch it. I'm gonna Watch the screens that they make and it takes, it's a long ass video and she's trying to fight him off, but he's like, fuck you, I'm eating your babies.

Speaker 1:          00:55          That's one thing that bothers me the most about the anthropomorphization that people do with animals is that their stance on bears is, I don't want people to hate bears, but I want people to know what a bear really is versus what they think it is. I think they're sweet. They eat honey and they're sweet and they're nice and they don't really fuck shit up. They, they're amazing. I'm a big fan of bears, but they all cannibals. They're all Canam. Bears make me feel like, of course there were dinosaurs. Bears are like, that's just a fucking dinosaur. Well, it's a a beast as what it is. It's a beast in the purest sense. Any beast make reminds me that we definitely had had to have dinosaurs, that that was just a small dinosaur. Now nothing like a dinosaur is far, far, far for Fart creepier. They don't have any hair.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I don't trust anything with no hair. You don't have any fucking hair? I have a little, I got on my face ugly, but I don't trust anything that like his hair, lips, any hair on its body. What other animals or what do you mean like fish or hairless like a snake. Everything in the waters hairless. Yeah. I'll trust those Fox. None of it. None of it. That bottlenose dolphin, Nebraska. Pinterest found you don't trust that Dolphin. That's a weapon from Russia. That's awesome. They want to put a bomb on that thing. I've had a Russian strap on. It's back. That's the whole Dan spoke Russian. It had a Russian strap on its back. Stope like the whale that they're talking about. They think the Russians had trained it to get close to boats to that it could hit the boat and blow it up. Stope you don't care.

Speaker 1:          02:24          I care. Some things are cool. I'm not rendering of t rex hair. I didn't see that live here, but I thought they think it has feathers. I don't have to think those are fed. Look at that. It has red hair by the way. At the front of its face. Well, that's the other thing. They think that it might've been because they think they might've been scavengers. T rex was a ginger with freckles. Where did you find this? Jamie's holes. You fucking Dick Gould. That no ginger's that are assholes. How about a done story? They're all over the place. Judges that are assholes, you can't not find, look at this. Like you might have had facial features like a vulture. They think it might have been red in the face cause they really don't have any idea what I mean when you see these colored drawings, they just take chances.

Speaker 1:          03:05          They just, they're all made up. The um, university of Bozeman, not the University of Bozeman, the natural history museum in Bozeman, Montana has a raptor that on one side of it they had feathers on it. Try to give you like an alternate perspective of what it might've looked like. So they had this raptor and in one side of it it looked just like an, like an evil bird. It's really cool cause they, they know now that's what it looked like. They know now that a lot of dinosaurs had had feathers. They've actually got fossils of dinosaurs with feathers. So they know that the idea that all dinosaurs were these reptile looking things is incorrect. Some of them literally were birds. So the birds that you see today, whether it's a peacock or chicken or something like that, they're fucking dinosaurs. Yeah. That's what that is. It's a dinosaur that survive are the ones that are bigger than a chicken.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Didn't really make it, but the ones, you know, why did the small ones maker, they will hide that when the impact of the crater a hit the world that it was so devastating. They killed almost everything. Yeah. Phil and whatever was left, whatever, scrounging, scavenging little creature that was left, evolved and became us. We used to be a mole. We used to be like a shrew 65 million years ago. That's what these people, these, these nonbelievers, this is what they think. You think it's ridiculous that you think you came from a monkey, you to know what they did from Joe. I know. You know, this is how crazy these liberals are. You know that it's crazy to think you came from monkey believes motherfuckers take it to another level. They, they're so crazy. They think you came from a shrew [inaudible] you were a lack, a little mole cannot character. Yup. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup. And then that became a monkey and then add the monkey becomes you all that shit inside of 65 million years. Get the fuck out of fucking wild. Crocodiles are a hundred million years old. So crocodiles are the same. The somehow or another we went from being a fucking true to being a person who knows and loves Jesus and more art shit. That's it right there. That's where that thing.
