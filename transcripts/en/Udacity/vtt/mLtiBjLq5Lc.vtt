00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.552
Image processing works on a pixel level so is associated with the fragment

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:07.657
shader. Phong shading, as opposed to Blinn-Phong illumination, is where the

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:11.167
normals interpolated across the triangle and each normal is used at the pixel

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:16.529
level to shade, so again the fragment shader. Skinning is an animation process

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.868
where a vertex is transformed two or more times and the results are weighted

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:25.292
and added together, so that's vertex shader. Displacement shifts the actual

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.330
locations of points, something only the vertex shader can do.
