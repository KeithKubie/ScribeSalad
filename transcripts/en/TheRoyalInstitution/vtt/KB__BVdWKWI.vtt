00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.160
The ability to perceive motion
is so important to us humans

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.679
that we can easily fool our eyes into
seeing movement that isn't actually there.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.460
In this activity you and your kids
will create your very own animations.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.040
Today we are going to
have a look at these interesting things here.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340
These are called thaumatropes.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.140
Can you see there are some pictures on them
here?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.540
Do you want to take a look?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.160
Tell me what you can see
and what you think they might be for.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.820
So it makes you... It looks like a movement,
so it's like that and then it explodes.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.080
So we are going to have
a go at making these ourselves today.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.660
And I've been to the Ri website
and downloaded and printed off these templates.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.620
So we are going to use these.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.380
And there's only one rule to this really
and that rule is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.440
that you have to draw the
picture the same way up on here.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.320
So when you fold them over
and you spin them around

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720
they're both looking the same way up.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.100
Draw one image in the top half of the
template and another image in the bottom half.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.480
Ask your kids lots of questions about
what they think will work best and why.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.540
Then carefully cut out the shape.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.619
Glue some string or a thin skewer to the
middle of the template and fold the other

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.619
side over.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.260
It works.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.299
It does actually, doesn't it?
- Let me try.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.921
This little toy is called a thaumatrope and
it

00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:53.819
takes advantage of our persistence of vision.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.409
This means that the image on one side of the
toy

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.119
lingers in our vision long enough

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.360
that we see it overlap with the image on the
other side.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.640
The faster you spin it, the better the illusion
becomes.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.960
OK, Daniel, when you look at this picture,
and you see a picture of two people,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.820
are they moving?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.620
No.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.360
So it's just like a picture of
two people that are not moving.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.720
Do you think it would be quite fun to try
and create something where it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.260
looks like the picture inside is moving?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.220
I know how!

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.180
So we've got this funny picture on a disk.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.650
Shall we try... I think a really good way
to make this picture spin

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.740
is to pop this pencil in the middle of it
and then try to spin it around.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.260
So do you want to?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.480
It doesn't work.
- Doesn't work?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.019
Ask your kids if they can figure out how
to get this phenakistiscope to work.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.240
Why do you think we've got a mirror on the
table?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.040
Do you think that has something to do with
this activity?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.040
Yeah, obviously, because it's on the table.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.060
Suggest they peer through the slots at the
mirror while you spin the disk.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.040
It's working!
- So tell me what's happening?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.880
He's walking really fast.
- He's walking?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.320
And we've got some blank templates here
that we've printed off again from the Ri website.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.640
So we can have one each. So we're going to
do the drawings first and then you can cut

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
them out afterwards.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:38.440
So you've got to try and think of something
in it that's going to do some kind of gentle movement.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.180
It's working!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.480
Now you do it,
now you do it! - OK.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.319
When you watch any kind of moving image on
a screen, including this video, what you're

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.659
really seeing is a series of still images,
like these, where the subject in the images

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.870
changes position slightly each time. If the
images are shown quickly enough we perceive

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.870
movement.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.030
Why don't we work out why we think this is
actually looking like something that's moving

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.500
when we look through.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.980
So is it like in a cartoon? It's just lots
of pictures animated together so it's like

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:27.550
that. But when it's mirrored and kind of like,
you know like, you can't really see it, it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.870
tricks your mind to assume that it's moving,
because you can't quite see. - OK.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.500
These phenakistiscopes also have a series
if images on them. When viewed in the mirror,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.310
through the passing slits, we're only able
to see the images one at a time in quick succession,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.700
so we perceive movement.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.540
We've had lots of fun today doing this activity.
If you want to have a go at it yourself you

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.200
can go to the Ri website and download the
templates. Don't forget to like and subscribe.
