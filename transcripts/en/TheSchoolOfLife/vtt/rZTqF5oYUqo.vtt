00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.080
Flirting has a bad name.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.400
Too often, it seems a supreme form of duplicity,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.600
a sly attempt to excite another person and derive gratification from their interest,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.720
without any corresponding wish to go to bed with them.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.920
It looks like a manipulative promise of sexual affection,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.800
that, at the last moment, leaves its targets confused and humiliated.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.800
In our sadness, back home alone after the nightclub or the party,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.320
we may rail against the flirt for 'only' flirting,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.760
when it appeared there would be so much more.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.280
But this kind of pattern represents only one,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
unedifying and regrettable possibility around flirting.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.840
At its best, flirting can be a vital social process

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.240
that generously lends us reassurance

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.520
and freely redistributes confidence and self-esteem.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.760
The task is not to stop flirting,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.600
but to learn how better to practice its most honorable versions.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
Good flirting is, in essence,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.120
an attempt driven by kindness and imaginative excitement

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.000
to inspire another person to believe more firmly in their own likeability,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880
psychological, as much as physical.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.472
It is a gift offered not in order to manipulate,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.800
but out of a pleasure of perceiving what's most attractive in another.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680
Along the way, the good flirt must carefully convince us of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.040
three apparently contradictory things:

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.240
that they would love to sleep with us,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.400
that they won't sleep with us;

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.720
and that the reason why has nothing to do with any deficiency on our part.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.280
Good flirting exploits, with no evil intent,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.440
an important truth about sex.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.160
That is what often most enjoyable about sex is not the physical process itself,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.760
so much as the idea of acceptance that underpins the act.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.393
The notion that another person likes us enough to accept us

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.880
in our most raw and vulnerable state,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.120
and is, in our name,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.360
willing to lose control and surrender aspects of everyday dignity.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.200
It is this concept, far more than the deft touching of skin,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.240
that is what contributes the dominant share of our pleasure.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.400
As we undress someone for the first time,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.640
or heed their requests to call them the very rudest words we know.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.320
The good flirt knows this, and is therefore spared the guilty sense

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.480
that they might not be in the position to offer their lover anything valuable.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.649
They are wisely convinced that it is eminently possible,

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.880
simply over a dinner table, in the kitchen at work,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.480
to give the person just about the most wondrous aspect of sex itself,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840
simply through the medium of language.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.799
The good flirt is an expert, too,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.440
in how correctly to frame the fact that there won't be sex.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.280
By a deeply entrenched quirk of a human mind,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.000
it's generally hard for us to hear such news

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.920
without at once reaching one overwhelming and crushing conclusion:

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.000
that it is because the seducer has suddenly found us deeply and pervasively repulsive.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.160
The good flirt loosens us from such punitive narratives.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.560
They powerfully appeal to some of the many genuine reasons

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.520
why two people might not have sex

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.280
that have nothing to do with one person finding the other disgusting:

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.600
for example, because one or both party already has partner,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.000
because there is an excessive age gap, gender incompatibility,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200
an office that would disapprove, a difficult family situation,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.160
or more simply, a lack of time.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.406
Freed from the rigid and blunt opposition

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.560
that flirting has to be the prelude to actual sex,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.680
the good flirt can artfully imply how different things might have been

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.200
if the world had been more ideally arranged.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.480
And the recipient of the flirt can, with equal grace, ascent to the story,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.600
without a need to twist it through self-hatred.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.040
We all stand in need of reminders of what is tolerable and exciting about us.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.560
It's a desperate foreshortening of possibilities

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.640
to insist that such reawakening

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.600
could only be justified by actual intercourse.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.160
Understood properly, flirting can beneficially occur

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.920
across the largest gulfs:

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.960
gulfs of political belief, of social, economical, marital status,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.880
of sexual inclination, and (with obvious caveats) of age.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.160
The 26-year-old corporate lawyer and 52-year-old man

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.760
behind the counter of the corner shop can flirt;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.760
and so may the cleaner and the CEO.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.280
It is all the more moving when they do so,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.160
because it signals our willingness to use the imagination

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.120
to locate what is most attractive about another person,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.840
who lies really very far from oneâ€™s own points of reference.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.320
The question of what, if I considered someone, anyone sexually,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.560
I would find charming is one of the most intimate,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.520
interesting and necessary questions one can ask.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.600
Flirting matters,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.520
because of how rarely most of us get to experience ourselves as desirable.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.240
We generally learn, through a rich sequence of rebuffs,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.200
and via intelligent modesty, to see ourselves as far from ideal.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.280
This picture is not inaccurate, but it isn't entirely true, either.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.040
So the good flirt carries out an important psychological mission:

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.000
to restore balance to our view of ourselves.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.440
They remind us that, for all our failings of character and bodily liabilities,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.640
we are in fact, in certain ways, properly appealing,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.440
and in a better situation than the one we find ourselves in,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.240
a truly interesting person to want to spend a night with.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.760
The flirt supplies an antidote to a characteristic sickness of maturity:

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.880
an excessively negative view of ourselves.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.280
A good flirt is doing crucially important social work.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.880
They understand that being recognized as erotically appealing is hugely beneficial,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.160
and a key to rendering us more patient,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.800
more generous, more energetic, and more content.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.760
It is a quiet tragedy that this widely consequential need

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.200
should so often be expected to pass through the desperately narrow gate of sex.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.040
The good flirt is wisely and literally trying to give erotic endorsement

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.960
(with all the benefits this brings) a larger opportunity in life.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.400
Liberating it from the tiny difficult window of opportunity,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.560
offered by an actual requirement to make love.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.960
The good flirt is a pioneer in a crucial democratic science:

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.280
they are attempting to correctly identify attractiveness

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.280
in a way that will serve the many, rather than a few.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.640
We should not only be grateful to good flirts.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.480
We should try to become good flirts ourselves.
