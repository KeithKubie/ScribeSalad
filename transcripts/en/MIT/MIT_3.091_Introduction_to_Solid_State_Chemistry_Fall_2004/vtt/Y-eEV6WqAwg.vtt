00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.530
First of all, welcome to the
families. It's family weekend.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.060
So, welcome to the parents, sibs,
and other members of extended family.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.590
I hope you have a lovely weekend on
campus, and especially welcome to 3.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.130
91. I have nothing special planned
today, just a run-of-the-mill

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.660
lecture so you get a sense of what
it's like to be sitting in one of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.190
these seats that you've paid so
dearly for. I hope we can convince

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.730
you that you've made a smart
decision in putting your son or

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.330
daughter on this campus.
You will come to the quick

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.990
conclusion it's not because of the
facilities. Facilities here are

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.660
nothing special.
Classrooms, labs,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.330
and so on, it's the peer group.
It's not the faculty. Faculty are

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.990
OK, but I think it's the peer group.
I think it's the students are going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.660
to be the friends and colleagues
that makes it a special

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.650
experience here.
I'm teaching freshman chemistry,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950
but it's taught from the Department
of Materials Science and Engineering.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.260
And, I just want to make one little
plug. If you walk up and down the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.560
infinite corridor,
by and large it's ugly because it's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.860
decorated with administrative
offices, with one exception.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.170
As you get to the east end, it
looks like an engineering school

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
because there are labs associated
with the Department of Materials

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.780
Science and Engineering.
And, if you ever wondered what's

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.080
going on in those labs,
it's your chance to find out.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.380
So, this afternoon from 3:30-5:00,
it will be possible to tour the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.690
undergraduate laboratory,
which is on the south side,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:16.246
and the nanomechanics lab on the
north side.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:03.530
So, if you're finding uncomfortable
silence with your son or daughter,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.070
and things are kind of dragging on,
walk down to the east end of the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.610
infinite corridor,
and you can see some interesting

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.150
things. They're going to have some
demos, and whatnot.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.690
And, the other announcement is that
on Tuesday, we will have quiz six

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.230
based on homework six,
but there is a few questions on

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.650
homework six touching upon x-rays.
And at the rate we're going,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.950
we will not have covered that
material. So,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.240
ignore the questions on x-rays.
But, the rest I think you should be

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.540
familiar with.
And, we'll test at the end of the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.840
period instead of the beginning.
That way, you will have some time

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.140
to interact with the recitation
instructor. So,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.440
what I want to do today is something
really important.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.740
And, it's fitting that the parents
are here. Up until now,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.040
by and large, perhaps with the
exception of some of the band gap

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.340
material, what we've been covering,
you could've seen bits and pieces of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.410
that in high school.
And, if you've taken a lot of high

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.230
school chemistry you might be
familiar with it.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.050
Well, starting today,
say goodbye the high school.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.880
This is solid-state chemistry now.
That's why we have the crystal

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.700
models appear.
And, what we're going to do is

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.520
we're going to begin with a little
bit of review.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.350
And so, if you'll take a look at
the handout that's going around,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.170
this will, of course, be posted on
the web afterwards.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:37.940
But, just to follow along,
I know the parents are here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:23.750
It gives them some comfort factor to
hold a piece of paper in their hands.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:43.333
So, that's your Linus blanket for
this morning. So,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:31.250
I want to give the big picture.
And the big picture is that the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:51.500
thesis of 3.091 is that electronic
structure informs bonding,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:38.750
which then informs state of
aggregation. And just to remind you,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:59.733
we started back at the beginning of
September with the Bohr model of the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:46.250
atom, and saw that it was inadequate.
Sommerfeld put in a few patches,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:04:06.500
came quantum numbers, Aufbau
Principle, multi-electron atoms.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:53.870
Then we could explain the patterns
in the periodic table.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.740
And then we posited octet stability
as something that atoms strive for.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.620
And that gave rise to, first of all,
just inert gases,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.490
explained them. But then we said,
you know, things might engage in

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.370
electron transfer.
We could describe ionic compounds,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.240
then electron sharing, covalent
compounds. Then we talked about

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.120
metals, which is 75% of the periodic
table, and en route saw the Van der

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:36.373
Waals bonds as a fourth type
of primary bonding.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:24.390
And then, we looked at secondary
bonding, which is prevalent in

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.790
covalent compounds,
and we saw these three types,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.190
dipole-dipole, London dispersion,
and hydrogen bonding. And,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.590
ultimately, that allowed us to
decide whether something is a solid,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.990
or a liquid, or a gas at a
particular temperature.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.390
And, we are particularly interested
in 3.091, since this is solid-state

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.790
chemistry, the circumstances under
which something is a solid.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.190
So, up until now, I think you're
comfortable with classifying

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.590
materials on the basis of their
bonding type, in other words,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:11.513
is it a covalent solid, or ionic
solid, or a metal.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:58.760
But, I want to show you a little
more interesting way of classifying

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.520
because we are going to classify
things according to atomic

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.290
arrangement. And so,
if you will flip over the sheet,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.050
we'll talk about atomic arrangement,
and how it plays into classification

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.820
of solids. By the way,
solid, let's define solids.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.580
Solid is something that is
dimensionally stable.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.350
It doesn't flow under its own
weight. It has a volume of its own,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.110
whereas a fluid, either a liquid or
gas, takes the volume

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.910
of its container.
The food goes to the walls of the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.740
container. The liquid in a gravity
field sinks to the lowest point in

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.580
the container.
But, the container determines the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.410
shape. A solid retains its shape.
So, now I want to classify solids

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.240
by atomic arrangement.
So, I don't care if they are metals

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.080
or ionic compounds or covalent
compounds. There are two classes:

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:07.760
ordered and disordered.
Isn't it nice when you can take

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
things and classify them,
just bifurcate? It's one or the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
other, just move through that
decision tree.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, let's look at ordered solids.
Ordered solids have a regular

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
atomic arrangement,
whereas disordered solids have a

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
random arrangement.
I put an asterisk next to random

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because it's not totally random.
There is some local order, but

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
there's no long-range order.
So, the order is short range.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And, what do we call such solids?
The ordered solids are called

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
crystalline solids.
And, we have a plain,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
everyday word for such an ordered
solid. It's called a crystal,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and I've been using that term a lot.
I talked about Davisson and Germer

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
irradiating a nickel crystal.
That's to distinguish the material

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
for something that's disordered.
If it's disordered, we say that the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
atomic arrangement is amorphous.
And, there is a simple Anglo-Saxon

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:52.130
word for an amorphous solid: glass.
Glass is an amorphous solid.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.390
You might think glass has to do
with whether something is

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.660
transparent or not.
And, I want to disabuse you of that.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.930
We've talked about transparency.
And, what do we know about

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.190
transparency? If we want to talk
about transparency,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.460
if something is transparent,
what do we do? We ask ourselves,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.730
is the band gap in that material
greater than three electron volts?

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:35.993
If the answer is yes, it's
transparent.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:28.200
It is less than three electron volts,
it's an absorber.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:46.133
So then, what does glass mean?
Glass means no long-range order.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.600
Let me give you some examples. We
could say, for example,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.800
we've got diamond. Diamond is
crystalline. And,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.000
yet it's transparent.
Why is it transparent?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.500
Band gap is about 5.
electron volts. Obsidian,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.000
this is a glassy rock. It's got no
long-range order.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.500
It's an amorphous material.
And, it is opaque. Obsidian is

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.000
opaque. So, here's an example of an
opaque glass and a transparent

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.500
crystal. So, as of now,
I want to make sure that nobody in 3.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.000
91 from this day forward ever,
ever says glass is transparent.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:30.150
I will show you before the end of
the month metallic glass.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.300
How can it be a metal and glassy?
Well, it must mean that there is

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.460
metallic bonding operative.
But, the atoms are not in a regular

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.610
arrangement. And,
that material is not transparent to

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.760
visible light,
because you know that metals have no

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.920
band gap whatsoever.
So: something important here to

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.300
retain.
So, the parents will now learn what

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.920
the students have learned.
When we go into a new unit,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.530
we begin with a history lesson.
So, let's go in the way back

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.150
machine. We'll go back to early
efforts in trying to describe

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.760
ordered solids.
So, that's why crystallography is

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.380
the study of ordered solids.
Crystal comes from the Greek,

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:37.826
krystallos, which is one of the
terms that might refer to ice.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:27.900
It's a certain form of ice,
but anyways, that's the origin.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.810
So, let's go back to the first
marking point in history.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.720
Robert Hooke, back in 1660,
was studying cannonballs. They were

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.630
doing military research already back
then. What do you think?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.540
And, he posited that a crystal must
owe its regular shape to the packing

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.810
of spherical particles.
So, if you pack regularly,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.450
you'll get long-range order.
And then, about a decade later,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.090
there was Niels Steensen, who was a
Dane, spent most of his scientific

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.720
career in Italy.
And, he observed that quartz

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.360
crystals had the same angles between
corresponding faces regardless of

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.990
their size. And,
see, what they were looking for is

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.630
trying to make a connection between
the macroscopic and the atomic world.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.270
In other words,
here's a simple question.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.900
If I see something has a
macroscopic shape very regular and

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.540
cubic, can I infer from that that if
I divide, divide,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.180
divide, divide, divide,
if I get down to atomic dimensions,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.540
there will be some cubic repeat unit?
Yes or no? That's the question they

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.630
were wrestling with.
And then, around the end of the

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.720
century, Christian Huygens in 1690
studying calcite crystals made

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.810
drawings of atomic packing and bulk
shape. And, here's a drawing from

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.900
his book in 1690.
And, Tom, if you could switch the

00:10:52.900 --> 00:11:12.400
video over to the document projector,
I've got a calcite crystal here.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.800
Here's the calcite crystal.
All right, and now, auto focus is

00:10:42.800 --> 00:11:07.590
off, auto focus is on,
OK, so now, you can see,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.390
look at the regularity of this.
Imagine, you're looking at this.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.190
This is all you have to work with.
There's no scanning electron

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:35.113
microscope. There's no
nanoscope, nothing.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:25.290
That's what you've got to work with.
And what he comes up with, Tom, if

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.580
we could go back to the computer
video please? So,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.880
starting with that crystal,
this is what he posits. That's not

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.170
bad. Remember,
this Huygens is the same one that

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.470
gave us optics.
You see, these people were

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.760
polymaths. They weren't narrow
specialists. They were generalists.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.050
And, they made substantial
contributions in more than one field.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.350
Tom, let's go back to the document
camera. Let's go back to

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.230
the document camera.
Here's a piece of tin.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.690
So, I mean, if I had to draw this
piece of tin, I might draw a

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.150
different drawing from what Huygens
drew because you can see the angles

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.610
are different here.
Look, these are right angles.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.070
Well, here's a piece of beryl.
This is beryllium aluminum silicate.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.530
Look at that.
That's a hexagon on en,

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:33.726
almost. So, what's going on?
Here's a piece of cryolite.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:26.660
Looks like somebody borrowed it and

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.990
dropped it. Look at that.
See, bad data. Can you imagine

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.330
drawing that? See,
that's what happens.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.660
They give you lousy samples,
expect you to do cutting-edge

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.990
research. [LAUGHTER] OK,
Tom, let's go back to the computer

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.330
before I digress.
All right, so here we are.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.660
Here's another example. I couldn't
bring this one in.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:13:06.986
These are big chunks of basalt off
the coast of Iceland.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And, you can see,
they have other forms.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
All right, so far so good.
Now, let's go into about a hundred

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
years later over to France.
This is Rene-Just Hauy, and he's

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
studying at Sorbonne.
And, he's studying the cleavage of

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
calcite. Basically,
what he does is he comes in to work

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
everyday and he breaks things.
And, he breaks the calcite, and he

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
looks up the little pieces of
calcite. And what he observes is

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that all shards are rhombohedral.
It doesn't matter how small he

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
breaks the calcite crystal down.
He always gets rhombohedral shards.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So then, he says, I'm going to
posit that that's the base unit of

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
calcite. And furthermore,
because he's a Frenchman and they

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
are steeped in mathematical
tradition, he decides to model this

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
mathematically.
And he says, OK,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
we all know that if we wanted to
fill three space with the same unit,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
we could choose a number of shapes,
right?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:53.360
We could start with a cube,
and I could fill this room with

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.730
cubes of identical size.
I could fill this room with sort of

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.100
orthorhombic boxes,
sort of rectangular but square

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.470
cross-section.
I could have something that's

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.840
rectangular with a rectangular cross
section. I could do something

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.200
that's rhombohedral.
How do I know? Look at the crystal.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.570
I don't see any holes here.
So, what Hauy did is he said

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.940
mathematically,
I want to determine,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.310
what is the maximum number of
distinguishable shapes that

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.640
will fill three space?
I call this the milk carton problem.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.940
How many different shapes of milk
cartons could you make that you

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.230
would be able to fill the truck
perfectly? And,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.520
he came up with seven of them.
And, I'm getting ahead of myself

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.820
there. The seven of them are shown
here. This is in your notes,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.110
and these are the labels for them.
And I said here's the basic unit.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.410
So, you have three lengths,
A, B, C, and you have three angles,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.700
alpha, beta, and gamma. And,
depending on which mix you choose,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:15:06.666
for example the cube is here, A
equals B equals C.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:53.880
So, three edges,
all normal to one another,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.760
and then here's the orthorhombic.
They're not equal to each other,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.640
and so on. So: seven basic shapes.
And, here they are drawn for you.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.520
And, this is taken out of the
lecture notes,

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.410
the archival lecture notes.
So, this is analogous to the tiling

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.290
problem, just to drive home the
point. So, if you want to do the

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.170
tiling problem,
how many distinct shapes of tile are

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.050
there in two space?
So, I think we can agree,

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.920
we can go with square tiles.
Or we could go with rectangular

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.780
tiles. What other tiles do we have?
Triangle, well, triangle is

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.640
actually, it's not a basic unit
because I can't,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.490
it doesn't observe translational
symmetry, but if I close the

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.350
triangle like this,
and have a 60í, so this will become

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.210
the basic repeat unit,
OK? Then there's a regular

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.070
parallelepiped where this unit,
or angle, rather, is not equal to

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.660
60í.
And this, in fact,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.990
is a basic unit that Frank Gehry
uses in building his - if you go

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.330
over to the Stata Center,
you will see that the basic unit

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.660
that's used to make those irregular
shapes is this.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.990
This is space filling.
And all of these are labeled,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.330
and so on. This is the clothing
problem. How do you cut a

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.660
two-dimensional piece of cloth to
fit over a three-dimensional shape?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.990
It's not a trivial problem. That's
why most clothes don't fit.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.330
It's very simple: fashion designers
don't understand the

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:37.660
simple geometry.
And, how do we describe size?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
For men, at least, they take a
chest size and the sleeve size.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
For women they just go, oh, she's
an eight. An eight?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
One number? This is why things
don't fit. You have to get down to

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
the unit cell.
Here's one that won't work.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The pentagon won't work. And,
I'm not trying to make a political

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
statement; I'm simply saying - so,
here's what you can do. Here's what

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
happens if you try to fill two-space
with a pentagon.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:53.570
You see, it won't butt up.
There is these white gaps.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.150
The reds touch the reds, but it
won't fill. So,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.730
this is how Hauy worked in
three-space and determined that

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.310
certain units will not butt up
against one another and fill three

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.890
space perfectly.
OK, so we are clicking.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.460
Things are going well. But we
still haven't got atomic

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.040
arrangements. All we've got this
milk cartons so far.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.620
So now let's think about the next
step. The next step came about 50

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.200
years later, 1848,
which was an auspicious year in

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.790
Europe.
It was another Frenchman,

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.390
August Bravais. And, he proved
mathematically that there are 14

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.990
distinct ways to arrange points in
space. And, what do I mean by that?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.590
Here's a cartoon that shows the
cube. We've agreed that the cube is

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.190
a cookie-cutter that will fill three
space. But when I start putting

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.790
atoms in the cube,
I have three distinguishable

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.390
arrangements. So,
here, on the left, I have something

00:17:47.390 --> 00:18:06.246
where I put atoms only
on the corners.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:54.050
In the second one,
I put atoms on the corners,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.100
and one in the center. Now,
think, look at the one in the center.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.150
That one in the center sees eight
nearest neighbors.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.200
Each one of these see only six
nearest neighbors.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.260
So, these atoms have a different
atom arrangement,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.310
a different atom environment from
the atoms in this arrangement.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.360
So, the left one is called simple
cubic. The center one is called

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.410
body centered cubic because there is
an atom in the center.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.470
And it doesn't matter.
I can arbitrarily shift the center

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.660
up to this corner.
And in this corner atom sees the

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.990
same nearest neighbors in the same
arrangement relative to the center.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.330
Here's body centered cubic. Choose
any one of those.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.660
If I sit here in the center,
I've got one, two, three, four,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.990
five, six, seven, eight, or I can go
to this one over here,

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.330
and it sees one, two, three,
four. And you just keep going.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.660
It's going to see the same
arrangement. And yet,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.990
the cookie-cutter that fills space
is the cube. And yet,

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.330
there is one other possibility,
and that's face centered cubic.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.300
Face centered cubic is here.
Well, you have the square face,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.920
and an atom in the center of each
face. And, that's distinguishable.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.530
That's distinguishable. So,
Bravais, again,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.150
Frenchman, steeped in math,
goes into the mathematics and asks

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:10.760
how many different ways can I put
atoms in two these seven crystal

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.380
systems that Hauy has specified,
and get distinguishable point

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:33.093
environments? And,
the answer is 14.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:23.860
The answer is 14,
14 ways to arrange points in space.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.730
So, now we're getting somewhere.
And, by the way,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.590
if you look at this,
here are the 14 different Bravais

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.460
lattices. And,
they are shown, this is also from

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.330
the lecture notes.
And, all we are putting here is one

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.190
dot at each lattice point.
But it doesn't have to be a dot.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.060
What I'm going to show you in a
second is I can put sets of atoms,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:20:05.186
groups of atoms.
In other words,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
if I wanted to describe the
positions of every apple in an

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
orchard, what I could do is say that
the Bravais lattice is telling me

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
the planting of the trees.
And then I can hang different types

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
of apple arrangements at each point.
So, this is what we are getting to.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
We are trying to break this down.
Otherwise, we're going to have a

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
gazillion different atomic
arrangements. And what we're able

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
to do is confine everything to
simple set of 14.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
So, what I want to do now is show
that we can look at different sets

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
of elements at these points.
So, let's see what happens if we

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
look at face centered cubic and put
different atomic groupings at each

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
point. So, ultimately what I'm in
search of is the crystal structure.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And, the crystal structure is the
atomic arrangement in three space.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And, the crystal structure is the
sum of two components.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:56.300
First is the Bravais lattice.
And, what the Bravais lattice is,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.610
it's really just a point environment.
It's a point environment.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.920
And I can put anything I want at
the point, including nothing.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.230
I mean, I can make this the
equivalent of a John Cage piano

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.530
piece with just a bunch of rests of
different time signature.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.840
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Listen. That's rests in 4/4 time.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.750
See that?
See this? That's a simple cubic

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:28.250
lattice. It's a set of points in
space. OK, so it's a point

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:33.750
environment, but let's hang
something on the points.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:39.250
And, what we hang on the points is
called the basis.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:44.750
And, this is the atom grouping at
each lattice point.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:50.250
This will all become clear,
I assure you, with a few examples.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.070
So, let's look at some examples.
Let's look at examples,

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:59.210
say, for face centered cubic.
Let's see what we can do with face

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.350
centered cubic.
So, I'm going to choose,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.490
in all cases, the Bravais lattice is
FCC. So, that's shown up there on

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.630
the right side.
Only, what you're seeing here is

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.780
the drawing with just a single atom
at each lattice point.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.920
So, if the basis is something,
just a single atom, so that could be

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.120
a metal.
So, an example for that might be

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.370
gold. See, this is gold.
This is a FCC Bravais lattice with

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.620
one atom at each lattice point.
How do I know it's gold? Look at

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.870
the color. It's obviously gold.
That's how I know. That's FCC gold,

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.120
but there's a whole bunch of metals
that are faced centered cubic

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.370
including aluminum,
copper, platinum; these are all FCC

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.620
metals. OK, and so in this case,
we would call the crystal structure,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.870
the crystal structure is also FCC
because you've only got one atom per

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.760
lattice point.
So, the lattice point,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.290
the Bravais lattice and the crystal
structure are the same: face

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.820
centered cubic.
I could put a molecule at each

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.350
lattice point.
For example, methane,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.880
I could put the five atoms,
carbon and the four hydrogens at

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.410
each lattice point.
And, if one of you is the first

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.940
human to go to Jupiter,
when you get to Jupiter,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.460
and you see solid methane,
you will be heartened to know that

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:41.520
it will be in the FCC
crystal structure.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:31.190
It has to be. Even proteins,
even DNA, if it partially

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.390
crystallizes, is going to
crystallize in one of those 14

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:41.590
Bravais lattices.
It has to. So, solid methane,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:46.790
and this will also be FCC. We could
put an ion pair,

00:23:46.790 --> 00:24:05.313
for example, a cation and an anion
at each lattice point.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:56.300
And that would give us sodium
chloride. And sodium chloride gives

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.610
us something that's called the rock
salt crystal structure.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.920
And, this model here is sodium
chloride where the greens are

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.230
chlorine, and the golds here are
sodium. What you do,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.530
is you might say, well,
look, they describe a square so why

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.840
don't we just call this simple cubic?
I have different atoms of different

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.830
lattice points.
So, that won't work.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.490
Instead, if you could just train
your eye to look at the greens,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.160
look at, one, two, three, four, five.
There's a fifth green in the center

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.830
of a square. Then,
train your eye to look at the golds:

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.490
one, two, three,
four, make a square,

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.160
five in the center. So,
instead, say let's look at the pairs.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.830
Green and gold: one.
Green and gold: two. Green and

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.490
gold: three. Green and gold: four.
And green and gold: five in the

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.160
center make a face centered cubic
lattice with a rock salt

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.860
crystal structure.
That's shown here in this cartoon.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.590
So, whether you count the greens or
you count the blues,

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.330
it doesn't matter. But it's the ion
pair. So, that means this is a

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.060
derivative from the FCC Bravais
lattice. And then,

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.790
there's one other one.
There's one other one.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.530
I can put an atom pair.
I can put an atom pair. Here I put

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.260
five atoms, a molecule.
Here I'm going to put an atom pair.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:37.320
The example I'm going to give you
is two carbons at 109í.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And what will that give me?
That's an example of diamond or

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
silicon or germanium.
And, here's diamond right here.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
This is diamond. If you train your
eye, the atom that I'm holding has

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
four struts coming out of it.
That's the sp3 hybridized, four

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
struts coming out of a single carbon.
Every carbon has four struts coming

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
out of it. But,
watch this. When I lie this down in

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
a single plane,
and I bring it up,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
you see where it got the post its?
Look at how the post its describe

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:57.250
it.
One, two, three,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.750
four, five. It's face centered
cubic, and with each lattice point,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:06.250
I take two carbons. Two carbons
here, two carbons here,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.750
two carbons here, and I go all the
way through the lattice.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:15.250
And, I end up with diamond cubic
crystal structure as a Bravais

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.750
lattice with a basis of the atom
pair. And, this is diamond cubic.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.250
So, diamond cubic is the crystal
structure, but it's derived from an

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.750
FCC lattice. So,
again, the overarching theme here is

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.720
the integral of the Bravais lattice.
So, this is the set of points,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.180
right? This is the point set in
three space, the Bravais lattice.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.630
And then, what you put at each
point gives you the crystal

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.080
structure. And,
you could go on, and on,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.540
and on, and you can have a ball with
this stuff. Oh,

00:26:46.540 --> 00:27:07.346
here, this is, to show you in two
space, this is interesting one.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:53.330
This is an Escher print.
This is the dogs. So, what's the

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.660
crystal structure here?
So, let's start looking.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.990
Well, you might go one, two,
three, four, five. You might say,

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.320
well, this looks like simple face
centered cubic.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.660
Actually, face centered and body
centered are the same in two space,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.990
right? The body, how do you
describe a sponge in two space?

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.330
Think about it. OK, the trouble is,
this dog is facing in the other

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.660
direction. So,
that won't work.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:36.720
So, instead, all these dogs are
facing the same way.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
And now, if you look carefully,
take as the basis, see, those could

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
be lattice points.
The Bravais lattice is the red dots.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
The basis is the set of four dogs.
The two facing the right, and these

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
two facing the left,
now, two right, two left,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
two right, two left. So, it's the
four dog set, you know?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Those four dogs are the basis.
So, bingo. So, now, what do we

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
have? We have simple cubic.
This is SCP, simple cubic puppy.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
That's a two-space, all right?
Look at this one.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:59.080
I put the dot here on the abdomen of

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.240
this creature.
So, what have you got?

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.410
This is a rhombus. Or some of you
might have initially called this the

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.580
triangle. But,
you see that when you put the two of

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.740
them together,
this has translational symmetry.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.910
And, in fact, look at how many of
these entities belong to

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.930
that lattice point.
All of this, all of this,

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.810
all of this, because the tail to
this is up here.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.680
So, the repeat doesn't start until
down here. You could cut it this

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.550
way. I don't care.
But the point is this is a concept

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.430
of the basis. The basis is many,
many units that are repeatable, and

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.300
can be positioned at each lattice
point. So, now,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.180
what I want to do is talk little but
more about the cubic system because

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.060
we're going to focus on a cubic
system in 3.091 largely because it

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.680
has a simple geometry.
Most of the periodic table,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.060
you'll find, is in cubic system,
FCC or BCC. And then, the math is

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.430
simple because you're in Cartesian
coordinates. So,

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.800
let's take a look at what we've got
going for us here.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.180
I want to look at the properties of
cubic crystals.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.550
So, here we are.
This is a table out of your lecture

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.930
notes, and I'm going to work through
this table. And,

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.310
I urge you to get friendly and
comfortable with this table so that

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.050
you understand the properties.
And, why am I making you learn this

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:26.170
stuff? Because I think it stands to
reason that if you look in this

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.290
crystal, you see that atoms touch
along certain directions.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:34.400
And, atoms are far apart along
other directions.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.520
Well, we've already seen in 3.
91 that there's a correlation

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.640
between atomic contact and bonding.
And, bonding is related to a whole

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.760
host of other properties.
For example, mechanical strength,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.880
there are people in this room that a
thinking about being mechanical

00:29:50.880 --> 00:30:10.093
engineers, aero-astro engineers,
nuclear engineers.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:58.330
You need to understand the
relationship between the crystal

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.660
structure and the strength of the
material. Obviously,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.990
if I look down an atom direction,
if I look down an atom direction

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.330
where I have a high density of atoms,
that's going to be a direction of

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.660
strength. If I look down a
direction that has a low population

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.990
of atoms, that's going to be a
direction of weakness.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.330
And then subsequently,
if I want to cleave a crystal,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.870
then where my going to cleave it?
I have to understand the

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.620
crystallography.
The electrical properties,

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.370
the optical properties. What's the
index of refraction?

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.120
It's the bending of light in
response to the field set up by the

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.870
bonds. So, you want to go into
optical electronics,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.620
you've got to know the stuff.
Everybody has to know this stuff

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.370
because chemistry is central to
everything. It's all chemistry.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:48.120
This conversation is brought to you
by secondary bonding.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:31:07.840
It's all. That's it.
So, let's look at this one in some

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
detail. And what I want to do first
of all is the unit cell; let's look

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
at the unit cell.
So, here's FCC, face centered cubic,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
so there's the lattice.
And, now what I'm going to use is a

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
hard sphere model.
So, I'm going to make the spheres,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
the atoms, so big, that they
actually touch along their principal

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
axis of contact.
So, face centered cubic,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
the atoms touch along that face
diagonal. And,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
the unit cell, this is called the
unit cell. This is the repeat unit.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:28.300
The unit cell is that which repeats
in three space and fills three space.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.610
It's the basic unit of the crystal
system. And, the edge of the unit

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.920
cell is given the dimension,
a. So, the edge of the unit cell,

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.230
and this is a cube so it's all the
same edge, so the volume of the unit

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.530
cell is equal to a cubed.
That's trivial. So, we got that.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.840
Oh, lattice points per unit cell,
lattice points per unit cell,

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.330
let's look at that.
Let's look at this red one.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.990
How many lattice points? Well,
we can count lattice points by

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.660
counting atoms.
If you see, there's eight corner

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.330
atoms, and how much of each of those
corner atoms lies within the bounds

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.990
of this unit cell?
It's one eighth. So,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.660
lattice points per unit cell is
going to equal eight times one

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.930
eighth. This is the corners.
This is the corners.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.810
And then, we've got these face
atoms. Eight times 1/8 is one.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.680
And, you see these blue ones?
These blue ones are half inside this

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.550
unit cell and half inside the
adjacent unit cell.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:37.430
And I've got one, two,
three, four, five, six of them,

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.300
two in this direction, three
principal directions,

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.180
and two times, so that's six times
one half, which is - this is the

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.060
face atoms. OK,
six times a half is three.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.750
So, three plus one is four.
So I have, effectively,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.250
four lattice points per unit cell.
I'm not saying atoms because I

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.750
could replace each of these single
atoms with a methane molecule.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.250
So then I'd have five atoms per
point. So that's why I'm being a

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.750
little bit fastidious here,
lattice points per unit cell.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.250
What else are we looking at? Oh,
nearest neighbor distance. Well,

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.750
nearest neighbor distance: that's
kind of obvious.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.250
Here's a drawing.
This is a, this is a,

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.750
and that distance is root two times
a. And this is half of root two,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.250
so that's given here, a over root
two, nearest neighbors,

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.770
well, you can see that.
Nearest neighbors: let's count from

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.330
this one. It's got four at the
corners, right,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.880
and it's got three in this plane,
three in the other plane. So,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.440
that's going to add up four plus
four plus four is nearest neighbors

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.990
is equal to 12.
Some people call this the

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.550
coordination number.
And, this has got the highest

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:49.110
number of nearest neighbors when you
have hard spheres of equal dimension

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.660
of any crystal system.
You can see here in body centered

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.220
cubic, it has eight nearest
neighbors whereas simple cubic only

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.160
has six nearest neighbors.
Whoops, we don't want to look at

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.490
that anymore. All right,
and then the packing density,

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.830
I want to show you the packing
density. That's an interesting

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:13.160
calculation. What the packing
density indicates is how much,

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.490
going back to Democritus, if we
model the FCC crystal as hard

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:21.830
spheres touching,
how much of this is matter and how

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:26.330
much of it is free space?
That's given by the packing density.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.990
And, that's equal to the volume of
the atoms divided by total volume.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:35.660
So, if we choose the unit cell as
the basis so we've got something to

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.330
count on, let's go back.
Well, let's go to the other one.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.990
I like this one. It's a cuter
drawing. OK, so,

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:49.660
the volume of the atoms,
well, I know I've got four atoms,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.050
the equivalent of four atoms.
And, what's the volume of an atom?

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.170
It's going to be four thirds times
pi times the radius of the atom

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:02.290
cubed. And, what's the point of
that unit cell?

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:06.410
That unit cell is a-cubed.
And now, I need to know the

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.520
relationship between a and r so I
can convert one to the other,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.640
and then I'll have a dimensionless
group here. So there,

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.760
you can see the relationship between
a and r. A-squared plus a-squared

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.880
is the 16 r squared.
So, if you go through all that,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:43.093
you can convince yourself that a
equals two roots of two r in FCC.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:32.750
So, plug that into there,
and you will end up with the packing

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:51.533
density will be equal to pi divided
by three times the square root of

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:44.250
two, which is a value of 0.
4. So, that means in face centered

00:35:44.250 --> 00:36:02.500
cubic, in a face centered cubic
lattice, you have 74% matter.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:55.450
This is assuming hard sphere model.
Sphere is so big that they touch.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:36:00.900
So, that's 26% void.
And, you can go through,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:06.360
and you can see that as you look at
this table that the packing

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.810
decreases. In the case of body
centered cubic,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:17.270
there's a little more open space.
It's 68%, and in the case of simple

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:22.140
cubic, it's only about half packed.
So, this table here is something

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.420
that you want to get good and
friendly with.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.710
The other thing I need to show you
is crystallographic notation.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.990
And, what I think I'm going to do
is invite you to look at the website.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:39.280
This will give you the nature of
crystallographic notation.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.570
Position is basically as it is in
your math classes.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:47.850
The only difference is we don't put
enclosures. There's no parentheses

00:36:47.850 --> 00:37:05.733
around a point.
So, if the origin is 0,

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.500
,0, but don't put parentheses around
it. So, a point is simply written

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500
as follows: so origin for a point,
0,0,0. That's all there is to it.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.500
In the case of directions,
this is going to take a little more

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.500
time than I have set aside because
I've got a few items of business

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.500
that I need to take care of.
So, I think I'm going to hold at

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.500
this point, and we'll jump ahead to,
see, I always have a few things up

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:27.140
my sleeve.
OK, so let's go back to the

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.420
beginning. When people came in,
as is the custom, we have music

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.710
playing. And what was the music
today? Yeah, The Talking Heads,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.990
and the song was? "Burning Down the
House." So, why would I be playing

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:44.280
Burning Down the House in a lecture
about crystallography?

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.570
Well, what inspired me to choose
that piece of music was this

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.850
painting, the Houses at L'Estaque.
This was painted by Georges Braque

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.940
in 1908.
L'Estaque is a community down in the

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.820
southern part of France.
And, when Braque painted this,

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.700
he outraged the critics of the salon
in Paris who condemned this painting.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.580
They said, look,
it doesn't have a common perspective.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.460
The houses in the back,
it looks as though the lighting is

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.350
coming from here,
but the lighting over here is coming

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:20.230
from another angle.
He broke all sorts of artistic

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:24.110
conventions. And,
one critic ultimately condemned this

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:43.553
painting of houses as nothing but a
stack of cubes.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:32.830
And from this came the term Cubism.
And since we've been talking about

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:37.660
the properties of cubic crystals,
I thought the connection was pretty

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:42.490
obvious. OK, I did.
All right, we have a contest every

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:47.330
year in 3.091.
The contest involves developing a

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:52.160
mnemonic device for the certain
groups in the periodic table,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:39:10.120
the lesser-known actinides and
lanthanides.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And so, I'm going to announce the
winners today,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
and we'll see if they come to class.
But in their defense, there is a

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
second lecture.
So, if they are not here,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
we assume that they are at the
second lecture,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
right? So, anyway,
here's one. This was for the

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
lanthanides. This was an
Elizabethan sonnet that was written

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:26.370
by Allison Burke. Is Allison here?
She obviously goes to the second

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:33.120
lecture. OK, so,
well, you'll see in a minute what

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.870
the prizes are.
OK, next one, Eddie Fagin,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:46.620
is Eddie here? You have to come
down and claim your prize.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.400
Come on down. [APPLAUSE]
OK, so he has a choice of two items.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.200
One is the, congratulations, but I
haven't shown you everything.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.990
First, here is his mnemonic verse.
But, this is really hot. Look, one

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.790
of the things that we learned is the
Born Exponent,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.590
and but what's really cute is,
I mean, I didn't notice this the

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:16.390
first time. I just caught it last
night. So, this,

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:21.190
of course, is a pun on the Bourne
Identity, but down here,

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:40.980
it's the 3.091 pictures is in the
corner here, very sweet, very sweet.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:30.460
OK, so you have a choice of the hot
necktie from the American Chemical

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.920
Society, or, this is a ladies scarf.
You don't know what's going on in

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.380
his personal life.
What are you talking about?

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.840
[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Come on.
But you know what I'm going to do?

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.300
You're not going to make the choice
right here in front of all these

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.760
people. You're going to talk to me
afterwards and they are not going to

00:40:52.760 --> 00:41:10.386
know what you chose.
Perfect. [APPLAUSE] OK,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
so the one that I'm choosing as the
winner, I had all sorts of things

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
given to me over the years.
The Elizabethan sonnet is one.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
But this is the one that takes the
cake. This is a musical departure,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
a riff on the Nat King Cole song
Love.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:28.800
And, this is an image of the CD.
She turned in the CD to me minutes

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.590
before 5 o'clock on the deadline
date. So, this is the image.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.713
And, there's the words.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:42:00.330
Listen to this phrase here.
It imitates very, very in the song.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:11.660
It's beautiful.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:16.660
So, that's really good.
[APPLAUSE] Is Ms. Gabriel here?

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:23.330
Please come down. She obviously is
either here, or she is shy,

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:29.990
or she goes to the 1 o'clock class.
Anyways, I wanted you to see, and I

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:36.660
want you to understand that this is
part and parcel of what makes this

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:43.330
student body unique.
I mean, I submit that this kind of

00:42:43.330 --> 00:43:00.326
thing would not happen at Harvard.
[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:53.330
OK, a couple of more things.
Tom, can I get back to the document

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.660
camera? I want to show some other
crystals and make the point about

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.990
symmetry and so on.
So, this crystal I'm going to show

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.320
you is cryolite.
And, cryolite is birefringent.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.660
Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you
to go back to the thing.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.990
I needed to show this one thing,
please, Tom? Can we go back to the

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:13.330
computer? Thanks.
OK, so what I'm going to show you

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.660
is something that's birefringent.
The crystal symmetry has atoms just

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:36.720
in parallel, a little bit off axis
from one another.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:23.330
And, what that does is it gives rise
to two indices of refraction,

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.660
and so if you have a light ray
entering the crystal off the

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.990
alignment of the optical axis,
the light will split into two. So,

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:33.320
you will get an ordinary ray and an
extraordinary ray.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.660
And the separation of these two
rays is related to the difference in

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.990
the indices of refraction.
Now, if you are in optoelectronics,

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.330
and you're making a splice, and
you've got a material that's

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.660
birefringent, you'd better know this
because all of a sudden you've got

00:43:46.660 --> 00:44:07.586
your light going off to the side,
or maybe this is what you want.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:54.390
So, what I'm going to show you is -
now we can go to this.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.790
This is a piece of cryolite.
And, it's birefringent. And,

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:03.190
what I want to do is show you how it
will act, if we can go to this,

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.590
where am I, OK, I'm here, good.
Let's see, can I zoom in anymore?

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.990
Good. And now, what we'll see is
as I turn this,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.390
you see, now I've lined up.
So, do you see this line here?

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.790
Appears as a line, everything's as
it should be. But then,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:25.460
as I turn this, cool.
See that? Separation.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.380
And then I can bring it back.
So, that's birefringence. And,

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:35.300
this is another example of what you
get with a crystal that has a

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.220
particular crystal structure,
one of the rhombohedral types.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.150
Back to the computer, Tom, I've got
to set up one other thing here.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:50.070
OK, so this gives you an indication
of some of the materials that you

00:44:50.070 --> 00:45:07.606
may know that are -
obviously calcite.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:59.150
Ice is birefringent,
not terribly so. Rutile,

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:03.300
very much, titanium dioxide,
one of the forms of titanium dioxide.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.460
Quartz: just mildly so.
OK, now I want to show some very

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.610
strange FCC. This is colored gold.
You know what gold looks like.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.760
It's very malleable.
It's an FCC crystal,

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.920
and yellow. By alloying with
different elements, you can

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.300
change color, right?
But these are all FCC.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.920
You see, nickel is FCC.
Aluminum is FCC. And, indium,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.530
so on, what I'm going to show you is
the alloying of indium with yellow

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:38.150
gold to give something that is 12
karat gold. So,

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:42.760
Tom, may we switch to the document
camera? OK, let's get the cryolite

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.380
out of the way.
This is gold. This is the gold

00:45:47.380 --> 00:46:06.693
foil that Rutherford would've used
in his famous experiment.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:56.420
OK, and now, this is indium gold.
It's a very soft, sort of a dove's

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.850
egg blue color,
very lovely color.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:05.280
So, you might ask yourself,
well, what could you do with

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.710
something like this,
because it's somewhat brittle.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:14.140
You can see, here's the machine.
That gives you a better sense of it,

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.570
just a little bit off.
All right, so what I was thinking

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:37.073
as what if we were to do
something like this?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:27.150
We could take a watch like so,
and then what we could do is put

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.300
something like that here,
see, and then we put quartz movement

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.460
underneath, and we put some numbers
on the front here,

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.610
and some hands. And,
this thing's solid 12 karat gold.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.760
We could sell this thing for about
$10,000 apiece.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.920
[LAUGHTER] And then,
there's all those other colored

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.250
golds.
We can do all of this as well.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:56.750
So, I think this gives you a sense
of what happens when you understand

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:01.250
crystallography?
And, I think with that,

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:05.750
we are going to go for an early
dismissal and wish you

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:06.750
a good weekend.
