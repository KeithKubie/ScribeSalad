00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.260
EMILY FORTUNA: Joining us now
is Yossi Matias, Vice President

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.140
of Engineering at Google and
the head of the Google R&amp;D

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.370
Center in Israel.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.640
Thanks for being here, Yossi.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.580
YOSSI MATIAS: Thank you
very much for inviting me.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.163
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Yossi, you're involved

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:17.280
with AI for social good.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.410
And you've worked on
an impressive number

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.880
of projects surrounding that.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.540
How did you get into that area?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.100
How did it start up here?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.640
YOSSI MATIAS: So in a way, we
were working on social good

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.020
from the early days in Google.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.890
It's part of the
DNA of the company

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.130
to try and use technology to
solve problems for people.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.470
And obviously, in the last
couple of years, where AI

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.330
is getting a lot of--

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.660
we became an AI first company.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.120
And AI had all
these advancements.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.280
So suddenly, we started looking
into how to leverage on AI,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.150
how to use it to solve those
societal problems that can help

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.995
out people in a profound way.

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:57.620
EMILY FORTUNA: And
specifically, you've

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.910
worked on flood prediction.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.980
And in my experience,
predicting the future

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.385
is not a task best
left to mere mortals.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:05.010
So I'm curious.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.885
You could tell us how
you got started on that

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:07.990
and how it actually works.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.270
YOSSI MATIAS: Sure.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.343
Yeah.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.718
There's an old saying that
prediction is hard, especially

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:12.960
about the future.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.630
So I've been
leading a team which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
is working on crisis response,
where the mission of the team

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.140
is to develop technologies to
help people during crisis--

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.680
natural disasters
and other crisis--

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.290
by providing the right
information to people.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.790
And in fact, my
involvement in that,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.520
going back 8 and 1/2
years, where as a user,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.700
I had the experience.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.000
We had a devastating
fire in Israel.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.380
And it was near
our Haifa office.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.970
We have offices in
Tel Aviv and Haifa.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.010
I was visiting that day.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.260
And I didn't know what
I should be doing.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.190
I saw this huge smoke.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.700
I didn't find any
information on the internet.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.870
And this was actually
the first time

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.750
that I experienced the
need for information.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.080
And it was not until I actually
called the mayor's office

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.110
that I got the phone number
of actionable information.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.009
And in fact, at that
time, I asked my team

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.320
to see how to make
that information

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.760
available to everybody.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.960
And within a few hours, anybody
searching for fire in Israel

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.470
could get that information.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.960
So this was the
first example where

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.860
we gave kind of actionable
information to people.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.010
Now, fast forward--
now we integrated

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.240
into Search something
we call SOS Alerts,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.240
which essentially provides
information about major crisis

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.590
when they happen.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.040
And one thing we discovered
is that we can only

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.930
give information which we have.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.850
But one of the most devastating
natural disaster are floods.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.650
They impact up to 250
million people per year.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.720
And there are thousands of
fatalities because of them.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.100
And in many cases, we don't have
information about where floods

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.240
exactly is going to occur.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.088
So we knew this is
important problem.

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:02.880
But it wasn't clear
whether we can actually

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.570
do anything about it.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.750
There was an engineer
that just joined.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.210
And he said he wants to
work on a project that

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.670
could help save lives.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.150
And I asked him, well, why don't
you spend part of your time

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.010
seeing how much we can advance
using AI and other technologies

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.960
in order to help out
with flood forecasting?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960
And within a few months,
he made enough progress

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.940
that we actually built
a team around it.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.400
And in less than a
year, actually, it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.283
was ready as a pilot in
the partner area in India.

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:36.450
And that's how actually the
flood forecasting effort

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.780
came to life.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And when you first

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.040
started looking at that problem,
did you think it was solvable?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.810
YOSSI MATIAS: So actually, when
I had the discussion with him,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.913
I told him that I'm
not sure if we're

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:48.330
going to be able to solve it,
because in order to really--

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.130
and we were focusing on really
what we call riverine floods.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.530
These are floods where the river
starts rising because of water.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.070
Then you know then there's
likely going to be some floods.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.230
But the important
information to know

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.810
is exactly where the
flood is going to occur,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.200
because it's only then that
people will take action.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.050
It's only then that
people would evacuate,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.655
or it's only then
where government

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:13.530
can take action and
evacuate the right people

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.150
from the right places.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.640
Now, in order to get these
accurate predictions,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.829
there's a lot going on.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.830
You need to have relatively
fresh information about where

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.740
the water already is in order
to make the predictions.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.450
We are leveraging
on the fact that we

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.360
have better elevation
models for many more

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.830
places around the world.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.480
And that elevation
model itself is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.500
computed with some of
the best technologies.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.180
Machine learning on aerial
imagery and the other data

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.090
that we have, it's using a
lot of computational power

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.840
to do hydraulic simulations
and complemented also

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.700
with machine
learning techniques.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.410
And it's using
information that we're

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.280
getting through a partnership
with the Indian government,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.920
where they're actually measuring
the water level in quite

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.920
a few rivers and
trying to actually make

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.220
sense of what's going on there.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.890
So this is really
a true partnership

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.310
with the Indian
government on that.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.490
And as it turns out, we could
actually get into prediction

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.360
a few hours before the floods
actually get into the level

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.710
that it did of over 90%
accuracy, which was actually

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.800
quite impactful.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
that's hugely impactful.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.030
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.240
How were you able to connect
with the Indian government

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.170
and get these people
involved in the project?

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.180
YOSSI MATIAS: The
beauty is that once we

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.450
started working on that,
there's a lot of interest

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.560
to collaborate.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.710
And I would say that on many
of the societal problems,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.860
the notion of collaboration
between companies

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.783
and communities and
entrepreneurs and governments,

00:05:47.783 --> 00:05:49.450
I think this is one
of the areas that we

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.620
need to see more of, because
these are big problems.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.050
And we do need to have
this kind of community

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.023
effort and global effort, in
order to really tackle them.

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:00.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.040
EMILY FORTUNA: Thank
you so much, Yossi.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.098
And thank you for helping
create this environment

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:05.890
to be able to make
these products possible.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.390
YOSSI MATIAS: It's
a privilege to be

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.932
able to have this
kind of environment

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:11.980
and to work with people who care
about how to use technologies

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.690
to solve big problems.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.740
