00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
60 angular degrees is about 1 radian.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's easy to remember once you get used to it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But remember, it's ABOUT 1 radian.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's not precisely 1 radian.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
360° is 2π. 2π is 6.28 something.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
60° is a 6th part of it, a 6th part of 6-point something is 1.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And now we can work backwards.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If 1 radian is 60°, then 0.1 radian should be 6°.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this requires the use of a calculator, I guess.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The ratio of this leg to the hypotenuse is the sine of 40°,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so what we are needing is the ratio of this leg

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to this hypotenuse is the sine of 40°.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The number that we are looking for would fulfill the following:

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that number divided by 10 is the sine of 40°,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which means multiply both sides by 10.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We need the sine of 40° multiplied by 10, which is about 6.4.
