about what I think of a skills
development I mean do you have the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019
development I mean do you have the
 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.590

gone you sure you want to call this met

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799
gone you sure you want to call this met
 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.269
gone you sure you want to call this met
and we came back a year later and and it

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:52.279
and we came back a year later and and it
 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.580
and we came back a year later and and it
turned from being Smet to stem and we go

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590
turned from being Smet to stem and we go
 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.620
turned from being Smet to stem and we go
why is it now stem and that's met and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
why is it now stem and that's met and
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.660
why is it now stem and that's met and
they said well believe it or not we were

hearing what was being said and they

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380
hearing what was being said and they
 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.050
hearing what was being said and they
realized at that point they needed to re

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
realized at that point they needed to re

is that actually it still took another

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
is that actually it still took another
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.190
is that actually it still took another
six or seven years for stem to actually

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
six or seven years for stem to actually
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.460
six or seven years for stem to actually
gain some traction because a lot of both

a case where in this case the scientists

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860
a case where in this case the scientists
 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.529
a case where in this case the scientists
need humanists and a humanist need a

do we go about assembling the team and
 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.980
do we go about assembling the team and
so for me at the very least stem is

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990
so for me at the very least stem is
 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.100
so for me at the very least stem is
important but all over the place when we

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
important but all over the place when we
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.230
important but all over the place when we
look at those grand challenges those

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240
look at those grand challenges those
 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.990
look at those grand challenges those
gnarly problems I do come away thinking

gnarly problems I do come away thinking
 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.909
gnarly problems I do come away thinking
scientists need humanists and humanists

nee scientists and we need both to help
