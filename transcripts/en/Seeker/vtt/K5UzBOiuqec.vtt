OMG LOL WUT EMOJI EMOJI EMOJI OMG!

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.389
JUST SAY IT!

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.389
Message from Trace Dominguez, everyone!

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.389
Thanks for swiping right on DNews.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.960
According to the Pew Research Center on Internet,
Science and Tech -- only 35 percent of Americans

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.650
texted at ALL in 2006.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.699
Then in 2015 Pew reported, 100 percent of
18-29 year olds text, duh.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.970
But 92% of people over 50 also text!

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
That's a lot of people doing something that
didn't even exist a little over ten years

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480
ago.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.150
It took 80 years -- from 1900 to 1980 -- for
cars to get anywhere close to those numbers…

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.940
So, when something like this takes over so
quickly, scientists have to struggle to catch

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.969
up to how it's affecting us!

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.510
For example, a new study in Epilepsy &amp; Behavior
found that when some people text (either on

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.610
a phone or a tablet) a whole new brainwave
appears.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.399
In fact, the researchers said they'd never
seen anything like this; this brainwave is

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.399
unique!

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.390
When a brainwave changes, it's usually because
the brain activity is changing.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.830
Think of it like the flashing light on your
computer.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.930
Different patterns can show different things,
and this one is new!

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.520
The researchers aren't exactly sure what this
new wave means, but they think it shows the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.160
brain is using emotion, attention, motor-skills,
and auditory-verbal activity all together.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.759
Funnily enough, this only shows up when texting
on smaller screens.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.290
Indicating, yet again, quote, "people shouldn't
text and drive," because texting changes how

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.500
the brain is functioning.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.580
And some of those changes are for the better!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.990
For example, in 2009 a study in Bioelectromagnetics
found kids who texted had faster response

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.920
times on computer tests, but were less accurate
in their responses.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.520
In fact, kids who used mobile phones (in general)
had poorer working memory, but had faster

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.420
learnings for simple and associative memory
tasks! and another small study from a 2011

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.180
British Journal of Psychology argues that
kids who use abbreviations while texting tend

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.710
to use fewer as they get older and more educated,
and their spelling scores are better those

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.030
who didn't text at all.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.829
Yet another study says that "skilled texting"
also leads to better spelling.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.010
There's even a really weird study that shows
our brains are forming stronger connections

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.530
to our thumbs because of texting.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.950
According to their results, in Cell, smartphone
users who text had more sensitive touch on

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.370
the end of their thumb than people who didn't
-- more phone use, better perception.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.370
So strange.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.019
But of course, there are also negatives.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.220
Multitasking isn't real.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.870
Our brains, cannot multitask, we can only
serial task.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.629
We can pause this main thing, and then do
-- [SENDS TEXT] -- then come back to it.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.470
But that back and forth takes a LOT more effort
than just finishing the first task.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.330
You might be arguing with me in the comments
already, but that's because you're probably

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.569
overconfident, sensation-seeking, and impulsive.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.159
People.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.180
MULTITASKING ISN'T A THING.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.060
In fact, Neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin
writes even trying to multitask increases

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.250
the stress hormone cortisol and releases adrenaline,
causing scrambled thinking and mental fog

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.440
after a while.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.760
This happens because your prefrontal cortex
has to stop what it's doing, burn some energy

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.370
to save your spot, and pick up a second task.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.799
It can do this quickly, which is why you think
you're doing it simultaneously, but you're

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.799
not.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.000
Plus, you have to decide to answer a text,
causing decision-fatigue.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.129
AND a study in Computers and Human Behavior
found people who think they can multitask

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.349
spend more time studying (to make up for that
switching cost) and do poorer in school overall.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.850
Texting is changing how our brains work, how
we interact with our own bodies, each other,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.799
our environment, and how we learn and see
the world.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.620
It's a massively influential tool.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.939
But, like any tool, learning how and when
you use it -- is probably more import… [beep]

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.010
hang on i just have to answer this.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.810
[[texting]] What was I saying?

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.610
Guys, I am not cool.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.960
So, can someone tell me what's up with sex
texting.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.010
Is that what they call it?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.010
Sex-exting?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.519
Don't worry, Dr. Ali Mattu knows what I mean
-- and we wanted to know if sexting can improve

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.519
your relationship!

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.049
If you're worried about being bothered by
texts, I have a solution!

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.090
Turn on your airplane mode when you're working
or studying.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.090
It works!!

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.090
What do you think?

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.630
Do you have an out-of-contact strategy?
