00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:45.950
O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s

00:00:45.950 --> 00:01:08.980
last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.391
the perilous fight
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:14.391
streaming?

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:21.909
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting
in air,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:58.899
Gave proof through the night that our flag
was still there,

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:21.590
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.530
the brave.
