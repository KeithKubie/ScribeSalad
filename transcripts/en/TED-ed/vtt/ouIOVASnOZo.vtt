00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.964
I probably first wanted to be an actor

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:09.790
but knew the household I lived in,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.844
that probably wasn't going to be respected,

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.253
so that kind of just stayed in my head.

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:15.750
And then I liked the idea

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.017
of being a computer games designer,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.988
and actually started to give that a go.

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:23.169
I used to watch certain movies that I loved.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.457
I started to create what the computer game

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.530
would look like and stuff,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.347
but I wasn't too strong in maths,

00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:31.298
so that kind of veered me off from that.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.505
So, they are the two careers

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.430
I remember early on aspiring to do.
