00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.620
Payoff diagrams are
a way of depicting

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.380
what an option or set of
options or options combined

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.450
with other securities are
worth at option expiration.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.200
What you do is you plot it based
on the value of the underlying

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.770
stock price.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.059
And I have two
different plots here,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.142
one that you might see
more in an academic setting

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:20.740
or a textbook, and one that you
might see more if you look up

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.050
payoff diagrams on the internet,
or people actually trading

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.670
options.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.711
But they're very similar.

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.290
This one just worries about
the actual value of the options

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.430
at expiration.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.259
This worries about
the profit and loss.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.890
So this will incorporate
what you paid for the option,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.570
this will not.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.280
This just says what it is worth.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.210
So with that said, we
have company ABCD trading

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.440
at 50 dollars per
share, and then we

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.650
have a call option with a $50
strike price or a $50 exercise

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.550
price trading at $10.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.740
Which tells us that the
owner of that option

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.280
has the right but
not the obligation

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.276
to buy company ABCD stock at
$50 per share up to expiration,

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:00.650
assuming it's an
American option.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.650
If it was a European option,
it would be on expiration.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.775
So what is the value of
this option at expiration?

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:12.300
So this is value at expiration.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.490
So if the stock is
worth less than $50,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.670
the owner wouldn't
execute it, they

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.400
wouldn't exercise the option.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.754
So the option
would be worthless.

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:22.670
It would be worthless.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.970
They would just let it expire.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.980
No reason to actually
exercise the option.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.050
Now, if the underlying stock
price is worth more than $50,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.670
if it's $51, then you
would exercise it,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.430
because it's now-- the
option is worth $1.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.880
You can buy something for
$50 and sell it for $51,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.540
so it's now worth $1.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.700
If the underlying stock
price is $60, of course,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.510
you would exercise it,
it's now worth $10.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.590
Because you can buy
something for $50, and you

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.030
can immediately sell it at $60.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.196
We're saying that the
underlying stock price is $60.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.510
So it would be worth $10.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.090
And so you have a payoff diagram
that looks something like this.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.380
It kind of hockey sticks.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.810
Below $50, it's
worthless, and then

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.940
above $50, all of a sudden,
it becomes worth something.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.066
Now, if you do it in the
profit and loss model,

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:08.190
all you have to do is
incorporate what you actually

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.139
paid for the option.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.470
So in this situation,
below $50, you still

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010
would not actually
exercise your option.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.550
Because why would you
pay $50 for something

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.300
that's actually trading
for less than $50?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.390
But you would say, hey, I would
have had to take a $10 loss,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080
because I paid $10
for that option.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.920
So up until $50, your
profit is negative $10.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440
You have lost $10.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.550
You have lost the
price of the option

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.609
because you wouldn't
exercise it.

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.900
Then all of a sudden if the
stock price goes above $50,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.320
you would exercise it,
but you would still

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.028
have a negative profit,
because you still

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:46.820
haven't made up the
price of the option.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.010
All the way up until $60.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.980
At $60 per share for the
underlying stock price,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.680
you could exercise the
option, buy the stock at $50,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.700
sell it at $60.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.130
You would make $10 doing
that, but, of course, you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.920
have to spend $10 on the option.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.710
So there you are break even.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.150
But then as you get above a
$60 stock price at maturity,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.570
then all of a sudden
you start to make money.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.290
So these are both
legitimate payoff diagrams

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.621
for a call option, for this
call option right over here.

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.370
They're just different
ways of viewing it.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.180
This is the value of the option.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.580
This incorporates the
actual cost of it.
