1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.060
You're though the whole rap world has always been fascinating to me.

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:10.230
Like how someone gets in,
like,
how do you get started?
Are there open mics?

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.720
Like what?
[inaudible] back in the day,
man,

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.650
that someone had to be the guy endorsing you.
You know,

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.730
like saying to,
you know these guys over here,
Amen.
Listen to this,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
these artists,
right?
Or this artist's right here,
they're the new shit.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
They're going to be the one and then you would have to do a couple showcases and

9
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.570
stuff like that.
And you know,
when some people over,
I mean we,

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.210
we definitely did a,
our sheriff showcases in the beginning,

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:40.500
but we were getting passed on left and right because,
you know,
people thought,

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
you know,
what are they talking about with this cannabis shit?
And we,

13
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.690
and we didn't sound like a west coast group,
you know,

14
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:51.780
because we're trying to sell our shit to west coast labels here.

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.130
And they did not get us.
It wasn't until,
you know,
um,

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.900
mugs had had,
you know,

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.310
he'd previously been in a group called [inaudible] 73 and he had worked with

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.120
these guys called the rhyme syndicate,
which was ice teas guy.
So he kind of,

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
you know,
he was the guy that people knew and then,
um,
send dogs,

20
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.080
brother and mellow man,
ace eventually would get in the door.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.880
And so people started hearing about us through,
you know,

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.260
through more mugs than mellow metal.
Mellow didn't really do shit for us,

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.550
you know,
all,
all truth told.
But mugs,
you know,

24
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.960
they kept hearing about a group that he was forming outside of 73,

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.990
which came to be Cypress Hill.
And so,
you know,

26
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:38.991
the guys that worked on him worked with him on the 73 records,

27
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.230
which was Joe's Niccolo of,
of rough house records,
you know,

28
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.740
he wanted to sign whatever Muggs was doing and you know,

29
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.100
he eventually ended up signing us,
um,

30
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.510
and they had a distribution deal with,
uh,
with Sony music.
So,
you know,
we,

31
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.390
you know,
put out our records of rough house Columbia or roughhouse,
Sony,

32
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.120
something like that.
And that's how we got put on,
you know,
and,
and again,

33
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.690
it had to be word of mouth because if nobody heard you heard of you,

34
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:11.691
you have to have some really fucking dope music for them to even like consider

35
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.710
you if you didn't have like someone back in you.
It was tough.
You know,

36
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.250
you had to have someone come speak on your behalf and say hey these guys are the

37
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:24.540
new new shit.
And,
and uh,
fortunately for us,

38
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.320
once we put out our snippet tape,
like when Sony put out our snippet tape,

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.720
guys like EPMD right.

40
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:34.050
And they were one of our favorite groups in the world,
man,

41
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.650
it will the top five for Cypress willows,
you know,
public enemy,

42
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:41.610
Beastie boys EPMD fuck.
They were the shit.

43
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.750
And uh,

44
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.750
those were the guys that took our snippet tape and they were showing our snippet

45
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.210
tape to other rappers.
Like,
hey guys,
look at these new fucking guys.

46
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:53.730
Cause you know,
Busta rhyme told me this story,

47
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:58.170
you'll have yo son are just shift from EPMD way back in the day.

48
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:03.171
They was planning for a public enemy and I just happened to be in the boom in Wa

49
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470
and you know,
ice cube when we met him for the first time,
you know,
um,

50
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.950
and we had our ups and downs with him,
but he's one of my homeys.
Um,
he,

51
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.050
he told me,
yeah man,

52
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.770
the first time I heard of y'all was through epmt that we was on tour was doing

53
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:21.410
this show and they came in,
which I'll tape and that's how I heard of y'all.
And,

54
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:25.320
and you know that they were like our first street team man,

55
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.780
fucking EPMD our faith,

56
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.460
our favorite one of our top three favorite groups was out there,

57
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.900
like with our snippet tape telling people,
hey,
these guys are the new shit.

58
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.530
And uh,
they do,
they do stuff occasionally,

59
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.620
but I think they do more work,
you know,
individually.

60
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.400
Now I know Eric sermon is putting out a record right now.

61
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.480
He was just promoting it on,
on some radio show.

62
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.260
And,
uh,
I mean those guys still act,
stay active.

63
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.570
I mean he's a producer so he's always making music.
But as a rapper they'll,

64
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.210
they don't put out as much stuff as they used to.
But yeah,
they're still active.

65
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.540
You know who I Miss Kool g rap,
Kool g rap ever.

66
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.580
I still bust out a,
a lot of guys don't have a style if he doesn't,

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
you know,
if he had never come out of so many people were influenced by him,

68
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.580
bad motherfuckers.
A lot of people forgot about him.

69
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.040
Lot of people forgot about him.
And he was one of the baddest dudes I've been in.

70
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.420
A lot of people you know would talk about Big Daddy Kane and Rakim Chore,

71
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.370
but You couldn't talk about them without talking about Kool g rap cause he was

72
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.600
like one of those guys like spitting mad versus man,

73
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.620
like his bar work was incredible.
He was incredible.
I still listen to that song.

74
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.950
Cock blocking.
Yeah.
Every now and then I'll throw that on and I got to tell you,

75
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.190
you know,
like if you hear songs that he does today,

76
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.980
he is still fucking current.
Like his,

77
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.690
he's still got that style that that cuts through.
Like,
you know,

78
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.060
some of the older artists date,

79
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.090
they sort of lose the style that people love and they don't know how to

80
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:04.420
transition into,
you know,
what their style would be right now.
You know,

81
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.990
like updating whatever that style is.
You know,
a lot of,

82
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.190
a lot of the older artists had troubles doing that,
you know,
but my man,

83
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.450
Kool g rap,
not a fucking street blues.
Phil,
he's still ill.

84
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.790
He was a fantastic,
yeah.
Yeah.
I always got confused why he didn't get bigger.

85
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.170
I didn't get it.
I was like,
he's got so good.
You know,
I think it was,

86
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.030
it was just the wave that came after him.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's like,
uh,

87
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.070
he was such an underground force in,
if you're underground force,
you know,

88
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:39.970
you had to make a conscious decision whether,
okay,

89
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.910
I'm going to go main.
If I go mainstream,
I'm going to lose these hardcore fans.

90
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.210
I might gain,
you know,
these mainstream fans.

91
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:53.920
But how long are they gonna stay with me as opposed to these core fans that,

92
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.530
you know,
that,
that they're put with his style.

93
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:01.610
He couldn't just keep them cause like I thought he could,
a lot of guys kept him.

94
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.260
Brian,
you want to know something?
I think it was due to,
um,
you know,

95
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.920
the record company not wanting to take the chance because as an artist,

96
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.950
you want everybody to hear your shit.
Right.
You know,
for us,

97
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.950
we didn't play those games.
We said fuck it.
And you know,
if,

98
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.810
if we felt it was the right look for us,
we were going to take it,
you know,

99
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:24.980
no matter what anybody thought and you know,
and uh,
uh,
again,

100
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.490
you faced scrutiny for Shit like that.
But in the end,
you know,

101
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:33.260
if you didn't play yourself,
people remember that,
you know,
and we said,

102
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.170
fuck it.
We're gonna take our music mainstream.

103
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.480
Even though that was not our intent.
You know,

104
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:43.100
we always meant ourselves to be a more underground group but insane in the
brain.

105
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.690
Didn't allow that.
It,
it,
it propelled us,
you know,
so we were like,
okay,

106
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:52.670
well we're going to take our underground NASA's up into this mainstream and show

107
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.150
them how we do it and it,

108
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.510
it kicked the door open for a lot of an other underground next to go into the

109
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.570
mainstream and we prove that if you do it right and if you stay on your game and

110
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:06.450
if you keep working in,

111
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.470
in and stay present and put out quality music that you can sustain those,

112
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.820
those mainstream fans that you gain right there and the core.
Yeah.

113
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:21.680
You guys sustain so well that people covered your shit.
Yeah,
like rage.

114
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.551
That was awesome.

115
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.910
Machine when they covered pistol grip pump on my left at all times.
Holy Shit.

116
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.560
One of my favorite bands.
Still a roach.
A yell on that.
Yeah.
That,

117
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:30.710
that shit was awesome.

118
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.750
I mean he took a totally different take on it but like a cover.

119
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.410
But it was a cover but it was his take.
Yeah,
it was bad ass.

120
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.210
It was one of my favorites,
man.
You know,

121
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.400
and it was an honor to me because you know,

122
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:46.550
like I was really good friends with them to begin with.

123
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.860
I saw them come out the gate before they exploded and became rage against the

124
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.270
machine and so for them to cover one of our songs were like,
man,

125
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.650
fuck yeah.
You know,
because they,
they helped us get better.

126
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.950
You know,
there was a lot of groups that we look to for influence,

127
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.840
even if they were doing different style of music,

128
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:07.910
like public enemy wasn't influenced to us.

129
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.860
Rage against the machine was an inspiration to us to like push the envelope a

130
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:14.600
little bit more on what we were doing.

131
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:18.680
Not necessarily like how they were because they had their own sound just like we

132
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.220
had our own sound and so they made us push,
you know,

133
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.780
in groups like that made us better.

134
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:27.890
So when we heard this guy fucking doing or this band doing the cover and then

135
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:31.160
they asked us to come play this song,
which,

136
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.150
which would be their last night as rage against the machine for a long time.

137
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.840
This was like their last show right here.
Wow.
We got to do that with them.

138
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.870
That must have been amazing.
And I was wearing a dad hat before.

139
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.640
Dad hats were cool.
I will not wear one right now.

140
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.640
I know what I was thinking for.
