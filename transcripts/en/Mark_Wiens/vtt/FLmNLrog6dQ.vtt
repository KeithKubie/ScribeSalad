00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:01.605
- Hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.971
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Jerusalem and today I'm gonna

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.389
take you on the ultimate
food tour of Jerusalem.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.356
I'm gonna meet up with
my friend David who is

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.520
The Hungry Tourist.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.561
He's an amazing food lover
and we're also gonna meet up

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.063
with one of his friends
whose name is Rafram, and he

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:21.015
knows Jerusalem especially
the food like the back

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.471
of his hand so we're gonna
take you on the ultimate

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:25.059
Jerusalem food tour.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.642
(exotic music)

00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:34.263
- My name is Rafram Hadad, I
was born in Tunisia but I grew

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:38.430
up here in Jerusalem and I
know about food, about culture.

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.739
- And David, The Hungry Tourist.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.988
- Just travel for food
and people, because food

00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:48.402
without people is nothing.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.235
(uplifting music)

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:01.666
- Okay so actually we're
on the outside of the old

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.416
city right now and we're
stopping to eat our first

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:05.916
meal in Jerusalem.

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:12.630
(police sirens)

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.663
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:57.825
(foreign language)

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:03.871
- So what's the name of this place?

00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.869
- Acramawi.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:05.863
- Acramawi.

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:07.491
- Yeah, the origin of this
place is from a village

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:10.577
called Vincarin which was a
Christian village outskirts

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:13.860
of Jerusalem and (inaudible)
because they were deported

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.902
and the family moved
to Habon area and they

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:19.030
opened this place.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.576
- We're starting off this
Jerusalem food tour with

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:24.159
some legendary hummus,
oh and I cannot wait

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.619
to dig into this.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.411
He whipped up that hummus and
then he put it in the bowl

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.496
and he added some chickpeas on
top, he added some olive oil.

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:35.168
First bite of the hummus.

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:37.592
Oh it looks amazing, you can
see how like whipped that

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:39.346
texture, look at that texture.

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:41.013
How fluffy it looks.

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:44.564
Oh that's a sizeable first bite.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.818
Oh wow.

00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:53.828
Hummus is a relatively
simple ingredient dish, but

00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:55.874
where you really notice
the difference is, are the

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:58.047
different textures and
the different ratios

00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.537
of the ingredients.

00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:03.704
That is one of the fluffiest,
it's not like silky smooth

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:09.959
you can actually feel the
texture of the chickpeas

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.294
in there, and then even
though you see a pool of

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:15.461
olive oil it doesn't feel oily at all.

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:24.351
That hummus is absolutely awesome.

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:26.274
Mm, and that pepper is
wonderful, it's oh yeah.

00:03:26.274 --> 00:03:29.872
That heat starts to build,
that kind of heat that sort of

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:32.713
goes up your nose a little bit.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.796
I love it it's wonderful.

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:41.151
This guy has to be the
best hummus I've ever had.

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:44.348
- This is actually one of
the best in the world, yeah.

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.525
- Okay I'm going in for an onion next.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.275
And onions are the perfect scoop.

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.528
You can get a lot of hummus
in a wedge of onion like this.

00:03:56.114 --> 00:03:59.365
The onion is very mild,
a little bit sweet.

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.782
And just load it with that hearty hummus.

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:10.952
Basically anything that
you dip in that hummus

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:12.656
will be amazing.

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:15.831
They have a separate bowl full
of like a sour chili sauce

00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:18.331
to add to your hummus as well.

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:23.464
That chili is spicy though.

00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.594
That hummus was absolutely insane.

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:30.470
The texture I've never
tasted hummus so fluffy in my

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.923
entire life and you know
it was fluffy because how

00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:36.923
he whipped that up, that
was just insanely good.

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:45.718
Almond will be great.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.556
We're stopping next for
a quick almond beverage.

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:50.389
Look at how foamy, frothy this is.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.001
Mmm, oh yeah that's very
almondy and quite sweet it

00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.918
has that kind of like
almond jelly taste to it.

00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:05.136
That's refreshing.

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:08.056
We're moving on now to a
deli shop that has cheese and

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:11.353
all sorts of interesting things.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.936
(upbeat music)

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.072
We're at this very small shop
in Jerusalem now and they

00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:28.710
are known for having some
of the best products.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.627
(foreign language)

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:36.386
Wow.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:37.389
- So fresh, huh?

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.262
- Oh it's so
- [David] Crispy!

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:43.044
- It has like a fuzzy outside
edge, more kind of juicy

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:45.065
than a regular cucumber.

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:45.953
- [David] Yeah it's amazing.

00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:46.862
- Wow it's great.

00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:48.445
It's so good, yeah.

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:51.876
- [David] Very rare to find.

00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:58.310
- You want to eating,
you eating the outside.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.730
- Oh it has a little shell.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.560
- [Shopkeeper] Taste this.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.639
- [Mark] Well thank you very
much, grab one of these.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.056
So you take off the little outside shell.

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:10.767
Oh it's almost like a soybean.

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:12.350
A little bit drier.

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:17.142
Mmm, so this is like a snack.

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.891
- [Shopkeeper] Yeah.

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.393
- The owner at that shop
is so nice, we just spent

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:24.103
15 minutes just like sampling
all of his fresh ingredients

00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:26.483
and then he gave me a little
bag of zatar, which is a

00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:29.932
thyme blend with sesame
seeds in it to take home,

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:32.230
so that's really kind of him.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.813
What an amazing fresh
produce shop that is.

00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:41.583
And right down the street
is the next restaurant that

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:43.423
we're coming to.

00:06:43.423 --> 00:06:44.256
Oh!

00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:50.002
(foreign language)

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:01.176
- [Rafram] The bread here is very very

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:03.259
different from Jerusalem.

00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:05.142
- [Mark] Okay.

00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:08.060
- [Rafram] Very thin, very
thin, they are the only people

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.604
in the area that's using
this bread, this thin bread

00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:15.181
which is actually, you eat
it and you don't feel hunger,

00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:16.799
you know, you don't feel heavy.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:18.893
It's very consistent with paper.

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:20.977
And it's amazing bread,
they make it on the saj

00:07:20.977 --> 00:07:23.554
you know, like upside down
pan, and it's amazing,

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:25.471
one of the best tastes.

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.155
I will take a bite because I need to.

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:33.405
(laughing)

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.700
- [Mark] There's some
cucumbers in here, some tomato

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.956
some onions and then he
added in some sauces.

00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:42.246
This looks incredibly good.

00:07:42.246 --> 00:07:46.413
I'm gonna grab over there
where the meat is the thickest.

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:55.707
Oh that's incredible.

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:57.546
Oh the tahini in there.

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.302
You can taste that nuttiness.

00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:02.005
And the beef almost has
like a salted almost like

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:03.672
a jerky taste to it.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.961
The bread is almost
tortilla, this is almost like

00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:07.955
a burrito.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.538
Absolutely amazing.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.315
What I really liked
about it was that bread.

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:19.274
It really was like a tortilla.

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:21.729
It wasn't like the thick
bread so it was kinda light

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:25.513
and yeah it doesn't make
you too like, bloated.

00:08:25.513 --> 00:08:29.268
That meat inside was delicious
and then the combination

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:31.770
of those cucumbers, oh.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.150
Food is amazing and
people are so nice here.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.733
We are now walking to the
old city of Jerusalem.

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:40.515
(exotic music)

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:42.767
Wow, this is absolutely incredible.

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:46.350
The ancientness, the
history here it's amazing.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.100
Okay we are in Old Jerusalem now.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.727
And greeted by some bread and vegetables.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:57.841
I already love it.

00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.424
(exotic music)

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:08.130
It's so ancient, just look
at this walkway and then

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.708
you walk through here, you
can smell the aroma of coffee

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:14.041
you can smell freshly baked bread.

00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:17.791
Oh man this is amazing
and look at this alley

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:20.450
and the staircase.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.744
It's so incredibly good
that we have Rafram with us

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:26.580
today who's guiding us through the ancient

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.546
city of Jerusalem because
there's so many little hidden

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:30.667
passageways and alleys.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:35.170
Look at this place we are
walking down right now.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.374
What's your name?

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:37.308
- Amir.

00:09:37.308 --> 00:09:38.430
- Amir, nice to meet you.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.600
Do you also blog?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.433
- Yeah.

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:41.570
- You do?

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.737
Oh okay, Mark M-A-R-K Wiens W-I-E-N-S.

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:49.939
Bye Amir, see you man.

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:52.566
We just walked down this
flight of stairs through

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:55.396
some narrow passageways
and alleys and straight

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.229
to a kebab restaurant.

00:09:58.604 --> 00:09:59.940
- He's starting everything for us now.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.525
He's lighting the fire.

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.067
- Oh he's lighting the fire for us?

00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:04.193
- We are first customers.

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:05.937
- First customers of the day.

00:10:05.937 --> 00:10:10.104
Wow, it has like a cave,
actually because it's hot

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:15.688
outside, this stone in here
you can feel the coolness.

00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:17.683
Oh is there an AC?

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.933
(laughter)

00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:24.471
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:30.890
- [Rafram] I asked him
if the hummus is good.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.306
He asked me to taste it.

00:10:32.306 --> 00:10:34.681
- He is about to start
making kebabs and you can see

00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:39.173
he has a bowl of hummus
which he ground by hand, and

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:41.961
yeah they're just opening
up for the day today,

00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:45.090
so he is making the food
for the first time and

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.640
lighting up the grill right now.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.768
And is this lamb?

00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:52.518
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:00.273 --> 00:11:02.658
- [Rafram] It's a mix of
- [Mark] Lamb and beef?

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:03.820
- [Rafram] Lamb and beef, yes.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.320
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.032
(exotic music)

00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:39.962
And he's been making the
most awesome, handmade

00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:43.506
kebabs that I've ever seen in my life.

00:11:43.506 --> 00:11:46.587
He mixed up that meat
then he chopped it up with

00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:50.803
a giant sword, he added
all the spices and then he

00:11:50.803 --> 00:11:54.057
put them onto skewers with
along with onion and tomato.

00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:56.184
I can't wait till that meat hits the fire.

00:11:56.184 --> 00:11:59.726
That is gonna be one of the
world's greatest aromas.

00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:01.726
I can already guarantee.

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:11.015
He's busting out the sword again.

00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:13.515
- [David] The sword is coming.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.385
- [Rafram] Some swords cut our

00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:19.885
meat before they make a salad.

00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:33.921
- There's absolutely no
better way to make a salad

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:36.088
than with a giant machete.

00:12:41.008 --> 00:12:43.180
I'm not gonna say you have to
make salad this way at home,

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.347
but that is the next level
of chopping up a salad.

00:12:56.137 --> 00:12:57.751
He just rocks that sword back
and forth, back and forth

00:12:57.751 --> 00:13:01.011
and literally in just minutes
he's gone from a coarse

00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:05.556
chopped vegetables to a really
fine mince of tomato and

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:08.806
cucumber and all that parsley in there.

00:13:27.437 --> 00:13:28.770
A lot of spices.

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:33.062
(exotic music)

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.767
Just straight up sesame.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:05.485
- (speaking foreign language)

00:14:05.485 --> 00:14:06.568
- Taste test.

00:14:12.577 --> 00:14:15.414
(laughter)

00:14:15.414 --> 00:14:19.925
Oh that is the most insane
salad I've ever had in my life.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:21.842
Oh wow, it's so creamy.

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:26.796
(laughter)

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:33.296
oh, that's almost undescribable.

00:14:35.757 --> 00:14:39.512
You can taste the sesame
seeds, the creaminess

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:42.298
the nuttiness, that parsley
comes in really nicely.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.798
It's almost foamy.

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:48.106
Oh that's amazing, he's a beautiful man.

00:14:48.106 --> 00:14:49.317
- [Rafram] He is a beautiful man.

00:14:49.317 --> 00:14:52.315
- That meat is sizzling
away and every now and then

00:14:52.315 --> 00:14:56.282
when the little driplet
of oil, of grease falls

00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.200
down into the coals you get
that smoky aroma of the meat.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.492
I'm at that kind of like
state of mind where I can

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:06.377
hardly wait and the food
anxiety is hitting me

00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:07.960
strongly right now.

00:15:09.001 --> 00:15:11.668
(sizzling meat)

00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:18.870
The wait is over, the meat
is ready, he dished us

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.283
out some hummus and then
some of the salad we

00:15:22.283 --> 00:15:24.039
saw him prepare.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:26.125
He actually bought the
bread across the street

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.669
from the baker.

00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:29.837
That meat just looks insane.

00:15:29.837 --> 00:15:32.210
Little meatball shapes and
little one biters, you can

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.752
actually see all of that
parsley within it as well and

00:15:34.752 --> 00:15:37.128
how it's caramelized, the
meat has caramelized on the

00:15:37.128 --> 00:15:39.378
edges where it was grilled.

00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:47.126
Oh, oh that is just wonderous.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.868
Oh the meat just collapses in your mouth.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:55.785
You taste onions in there
and what it really focuses on

00:15:55.785 --> 00:15:58.535
is that slow grill over the fire.

00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:03.630
Giving it that wonderful smokey,
greasy like umami flavor.

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:09.517
- Oh my god.

00:16:11.397 --> 00:16:12.730
- That's insane.

00:16:13.774 --> 00:16:14.607
Oh wow.

00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:17.731
Next level.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.187
- Try this.

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:22.357
- This is the type of restaurant
that you should travel

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.613
around the world just to eat at.

00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:26.946
This is some pickled turnip.

00:16:28.831 --> 00:16:31.074
- [David] It's Iraqi in origin.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.657
- Mm, really juicy.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:35.827
Amazing.

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:38.580
I'm gonna get one more
forkful of that salad.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.035
You can just see how thick
and rich that is from

00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:43.868
the sesame seed paste, the tahini.

00:16:46.155 --> 00:16:48.992
The vegetables are so
light, and then he's made it

00:16:48.992 --> 00:16:51.530
into a sauce that's just
wrapped it all together.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.692
It's a little bit like pasty,
and nutty and so fragrant.

00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:57.561
Okay next I'm gonna try some
of this hummus, and this is

00:16:57.561 --> 00:17:00.645
like a totally different
looking hummus from the one that

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.561
we had earlier this morning.

00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:04.437
And you can see that this
hummus looks a little more

00:17:04.437 --> 00:17:07.066
smooth than the hummus
that we ate in the morning,

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:08.438
just from looking at it.

00:17:08.438 --> 00:17:10.438
It's all ground by hand.

00:17:15.682 --> 00:17:16.515
Mmm, whoa.

00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:20.791
- [David] It's amazing hummus.

00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:24.958
- And definitely it's more
thick and a little more sticky

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:31.506
than the hummus we had in the
morning, totally different.

00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:36.377
That salad is award winning.

00:17:36.377 --> 00:17:39.026
- (speaking foreign language)

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:40.693
- He's from my city.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.767
- That was special, that is
an experience of a lifetime

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:48.769
right there.

00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:52.269
- Nobody but Rafram can find these places.

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:56.153
- That is a restaurant where
it really is a privilege

00:17:56.153 --> 00:18:00.524
to eat at a restaurant like
that and, huge thank you

00:18:00.524 --> 00:18:02.940
to Rafram for taking us there.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.523
(upbeat music)

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.003
Next up we walked over to a
place called Zalatimo Sweets.

00:18:13.003 --> 00:18:16.528
And this is another ancient,
generations-old sweets shop.

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.449
But he only makes one thing.

00:18:18.449 --> 00:18:22.282
- (speaking foreign language)

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:35.766
(foreign language)

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.883
- [Mark] So it's called Zalatimo Sweets.

00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:47.218
So he really slaps out the
dough until it's paper thin

00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:49.741
then he folds it over and
then he adds in some cheese

00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:52.867
and I think he has another
couple of variations as well,

00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:55.085
and then he folds it up, he
bakes it, puts on a little

00:18:55.085 --> 00:18:58.879
bit of olive oil and it's
really amazing to watch

00:18:58.879 --> 00:19:00.379
him make this art.

00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:14.116
(pastry crunching)

00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:19.166
His family has been here for
over 200 years making this

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:21.166
same dessert, 200 years!

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.418
And ours should be coming
out of the oven very quickly,

00:19:24.418 --> 00:19:27.251
but starting with a cup of coffee.

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:34.125
Aw yeah, I love that cardamom in there.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.213
I love it.

00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:41.636
We got two different
versions, one with nuts and

00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.672
one with cheese.

00:19:42.672 --> 00:19:45.005
And you can just see that
paper thin dough and then

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:47.049
he bakes it and then he tops
it with some kind of syrup

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:51.386
or honey and then dusts
it in powdered sugar.

00:19:51.386 --> 00:19:52.636
So it's cheese.

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:56.803
Look at that crispy, crispy
dough, oh it's so thin.

00:20:07.436 --> 00:20:10.984
Wow, the dough is so, so
thin, almost like baklava

00:20:10.984 --> 00:20:15.151
and crispy but then you have
the contrast of the salty

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:21.445
cheese with the sweet honey
topping that crispy dough.

00:20:26.609 --> 00:20:29.026
- Listen to it, it's crunchy.

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:33.912
- Mm, it's so crispy and the
next one this one is nuts,

00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:36.791
but I'm like really impressed
how delicate and how

00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:40.458
subtly contrasting the
flavors are together.

00:20:42.957 --> 00:20:46.040
It's really really impressively good.

00:20:46.917 --> 00:20:49.258
If you look on the inside of this one,

00:20:49.258 --> 00:20:51.086
oh yeah you can see I
think it was mostly crushed

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:53.508
up walnuts that he added in here.

00:20:53.508 --> 00:20:56.084
(pastry crunching)

00:20:56.084 --> 00:20:57.917
Listen to that crunch!

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:05.392
That is amazing.

00:21:08.649 --> 00:21:12.493
I'm not a huge lover of
sweets, but this is perfect.

00:21:12.493 --> 00:21:16.494
After 200 years, they know
exactly what they're doing.

00:21:16.494 --> 00:21:21.401
It has that beautiful mix
between crunchy and gooey.

00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:23.195
The nut one is good, but
I think the cheese wins.

00:21:23.195 --> 00:21:25.778
- [David] Cheese wins big time.

00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:29.990
- Thank you very much that was amazing.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.407
That was amazing.

00:21:32.322 --> 00:21:35.483
Wow that was just
impressively good, so good.

00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:39.650
So delicate, so refined, what
another gem in Jerusalem.

00:21:46.778 --> 00:21:49.698
This entire old city of Jerusalem
is just a maze of alleys

00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:53.283
and ancient lanes, it's a whole bazaar.

00:21:53.283 --> 00:21:56.873
You have modern shops
selling all sorts of footwear

00:21:56.873 --> 00:22:00.242
and clothing and kitchenware
and then there are restaurants

00:22:00.242 --> 00:22:03.026
mixed within here, you could
just get lost and just explore

00:22:03.026 --> 00:22:06.142
these alleys if you just
keep your eyes open walking

00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:08.977
around the old streets of
Jerusalem, you'll just see

00:22:08.977 --> 00:22:12.893
just incredible things and
just admire the history

00:22:12.893 --> 00:22:15.899
of the city and if you keep
your nose open, you'll get

00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:19.616
whiffs of coffee, you'll
smell the zatar, you'll smell

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:22.379
the different spices as you're
walking through this alley

00:22:22.379 --> 00:22:26.546
it's just an overdose of
all things that you can see

00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:30.125
and smell and hear.

00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:32.708
(exotic music)

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.886
We are walking back out
towards the Damascus gate

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:45.053
and we're gonna now drive
somewhere to eat another lunch.

00:22:46.764 --> 00:22:47.804
What's up man.

00:22:47.804 --> 00:22:48.967
- (foreign language)

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:49.800
- How are you?

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.633
- Fine.

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:51.466
- What's your name?

00:22:51.466 --> 00:22:52.424
- Tem.

00:22:52.424 --> 00:22:53.423
- Tem?

00:22:53.423 --> 00:22:54.426
Nice to meet you.

00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:55.426
- (foreign language)

00:22:55.426 --> 00:22:57.132
- Nice to meet you.

00:22:57.132 --> 00:22:58.134
- (foreign language)

00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:00.717
(exotic music)

00:23:09.813 --> 00:23:13.480
(speaking foreign language)

00:23:14.562 --> 00:23:15.854
- We're stopping just to
buy some fruit right at the

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:18.818
entrance, right at Damascus
Gate and she gave me

00:23:18.818 --> 00:23:20.735
a sample before we buy.

00:23:25.763 --> 00:23:29.346
Mmm, oh that's so juicy
and sweet and sour.

00:23:34.766 --> 00:23:36.683
Mmm, that's incredible.

00:23:40.684 --> 00:23:41.689
- Good, good.

00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:42.777
- Eat a peach, okay.

00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:43.860
- Good, good.

00:23:48.526 --> 00:23:49.359
- Mmm.

00:23:50.572 --> 00:23:51.578
- (speaking foreign language)

00:23:51.578 --> 00:23:55.200
- That's delicious too,
it's not too sweet.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.040
Kinda a little bit starchy.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.626
Getting a kilo of those too.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:00.459
- Good.

00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:01.607
- Thank you.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.613
We're leaving out of the
Damascus Gate and so Jerusalem

00:24:04.613 --> 00:24:08.359
is the walled in city, Old
Jerusalem is a walled in city

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:11.356
and so the different gates
are named for the roads

00:24:11.356 --> 00:24:12.526
that went to the different cities.

00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:16.527
So this gate actually leads
to Nablis in Palestine.

00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:19.483
And then also onto Damascus.

00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:23.527
- We go to Mathneola Market
now, it's like the main market

00:24:23.527 --> 00:24:25.027
of West Jerusalem.

00:24:26.862 --> 00:24:29.445
(upbeat music)

00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:41.191
- We drove over to West
Jerusalem and we're gonna

00:24:41.191 --> 00:24:43.196
have lunch at a market over here now.

00:24:43.196 --> 00:24:46.613
(street performer music)

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.777
- (speaking foreign language)

00:24:52.777 --> 00:24:54.068
You wan to get inside?

00:24:54.068 --> 00:24:57.568
- [Mark] Is it okay, just for a few shots?

00:24:58.445 --> 00:25:02.028
Just to get some closeups
on the food here.

00:25:05.324 --> 00:25:08.187
- [Chef] This is akima,
potoates, the kebabs, spinach

00:25:08.187 --> 00:25:10.727
onion and (inaudible).

00:25:10.727 --> 00:25:14.894
You have meatballs, you
have lungs, this is lungs.

00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:23.648
You have meatballs, in fresh tomato sauce.

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:24.731
- [Mark] Wow.

00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:29.566
- [Chef] Now you have beef sofrito.

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:36.230
Mousaka, great dish,
eggplant stuffed in meat.

00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:40.574
You have the koubleh, you
have the okra, you know okra?

00:25:40.574 --> 00:25:41.741
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:25:48.952 --> 00:25:51.696
We're eating our third
plate of hummus today.

00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:53.698
There's some tahini.

00:25:53.698 --> 00:25:54.531
- [David] Fresh salad, they just cut it.

00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:55.971
And falafel.

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.144
- These are sort of the
standard starter dishes that

00:25:58.144 --> 00:25:59.365
we're getting here.

00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:01.087
Then after that we'll be
served more the stews and

00:26:01.087 --> 00:26:03.341
those dishes that they cook down there.

00:26:03.341 --> 00:26:05.341
Third hummus of the day.

00:26:08.838 --> 00:26:12.089
Mmm, oh, that one is incredible too.

00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:14.175
This one is nice and kind
of tastes garlicky to me.

00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:16.715
Tomato salad there are
tomatoes in here, there are

00:26:16.715 --> 00:26:18.715
onions, there's parsley.

00:26:19.673 --> 00:26:24.260
Oh lots and lots of lemon in
there, that's what makes it.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.134
It's so refreshing.

00:26:26.134 --> 00:26:28.967
Some house pickles, wonderful.

00:26:28.967 --> 00:26:30.641
We didn't do any ordering.

00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:32.858
Since David knows them.

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:36.685
- I just told them,
just give us good food.

00:26:36.685 --> 00:26:38.938
That's all I said, just give us good food.

00:26:38.938 --> 00:26:41.478
And let's see what will happen.

00:26:41.478 --> 00:26:44.478
- Dish of kebab, potato and spinach.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:50.276
Okra, green beans.

00:26:55.611 --> 00:26:57.611
Azura, rice and lentens.

00:26:58.522 --> 00:27:00.272
This is the mousakka.

00:27:10.283 --> 00:27:13.533
White beans, potato and beef and onion.

00:27:17.576 --> 00:27:19.992
- They brought us enough food
to cover the entire table.

00:27:19.992 --> 00:27:22.244
We've got some of their
specialty dishes, it all looks

00:27:22.244 --> 00:27:26.953
incredibly good, oh I can't
wait to start digging in.

00:27:26.953 --> 00:27:29.455
And just those appetizers
the starters, were excellent

00:27:29.455 --> 00:27:30.537
as well.

00:27:30.537 --> 00:27:32.368
Azura, oh this is the
name of the restaurant.

00:27:32.368 --> 00:27:35.412
- [David] A dish
- [Mark] Oh look at how

00:27:35.412 --> 00:27:37.817
- [David] Turkish in origin.

00:27:37.817 --> 00:27:39.989
This is gonna be so amazing.

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:42.157
- [Mark] It just slices
with your spoon like butter,

00:27:42.157 --> 00:27:45.363
it's so tender and then
topped with that minced meat.

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.780
Oh, man, wow that looks good.

00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:56.118
Oh wow, oh wow.

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:03.063
That eggplant is ridiculously soft.

00:28:03.063 --> 00:28:07.016
And then it has a real kind
of like cinnamon sweetness.

00:28:07.016 --> 00:28:08.727
- [Chef] It's a stuffed eggplant with beef

00:28:08.727 --> 00:28:10.855
and tomato sauce.

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:13.105
- [Mark] Oh look at that
interior. Come take a look at

00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:16.181
that inside, it looks like
minced meat on the inside.

00:28:16.181 --> 00:28:17.301
- [David] Burger inside.

00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:18.428
- [Mark] It looks like a
burger on the inside with

00:28:18.428 --> 00:28:21.222
eggplant just surrounding
it and just that soupy

00:28:21.222 --> 00:28:23.305
tomato sauce drowning it.

00:28:25.305 --> 00:28:27.164
You need a spoon to eat this.

00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:30.747
- Yeah just a spoon,
spoon is the best way.

00:28:32.561 --> 00:28:34.851
- What I love about that
is that the tomatoes are

00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:37.144
very tart, they have a
nice sourness to them.

00:28:37.144 --> 00:28:40.842
And then again you have
that really really tender,

00:28:40.842 --> 00:28:42.382
creamy eggplant.

00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:43.215
- [David] Kima.

00:28:43.215 --> 00:28:44.048
- [Mark] Kima.

00:28:44.048 --> 00:28:44.881
Okay this is called Kima.

00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:45.839
(crosstalking)

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:49.572
Oh potato, forgot about the potato.

00:28:49.572 --> 00:28:50.405
- [David] Look at the color of the potato.

00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:51.293
- [Mark] I've gotta
respoon, I have to respoon.

00:28:51.293 --> 00:28:53.464
- [David] This potato he's
had on the fire for hours

00:28:53.464 --> 00:28:54.297
and hours.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.680
- [Mark] Caramelized.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.730
The entire thing is just
completely soft and the

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.110
onions melt in your mouth,
the eggplant melts in your

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.359
mouth, the meat melts in your
mouth and even the potato

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:11.575
melts in your mouth.

00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:14.239
The flavor is a little bit
plain, but it really focuses

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:15.983
on the main ingredients.

00:29:15.983 --> 00:29:18.906
- [David] Probably only pepper
and salt I would say here.

00:29:18.906 --> 00:29:21.739
- [Mark] Rice, lentils and onions.

00:29:29.369 --> 00:29:32.009
- You know what it is,
this is comfort food.

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:36.398
(crosstalking) back to your
childhood, your mother.

00:29:36.398 --> 00:29:39.982
We're going now to oxtail,
so again you see it's

00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:41.732
falling off the bone.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.607
It's been sitting on the fire.

00:29:44.607 --> 00:29:46.227
- [Mark] You can actually
see the bones have just

00:29:46.227 --> 00:29:47.807
fallen out already.

00:29:47.807 --> 00:29:49.725
The little oxtail bones.

00:29:49.725 --> 00:29:52.143
One my personal favorite
meats is oxtail because

00:29:52.143 --> 00:29:56.310
every single time you eat oxtail
it just falls off the bone.

00:30:01.173 --> 00:30:05.006
Oh, it's the red chilis
in there, what a kick.

00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:09.426
Oh yeah, and that meat is
just ultimately tender.

00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:11.973
Sofrito and there's meat
in there, there's potatoes.

00:30:11.973 --> 00:30:16.140
- [David] Yes, and sofrito,
like it's got like celery,

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:22.223
carrots, cooks for a long
time and the meat is added

00:30:22.223 --> 00:30:23.806
and garlic, potato.

00:30:33.854 --> 00:30:36.531
- It's really good, it's again,
everything is very tender

00:30:36.531 --> 00:30:40.489
the meat is tender, the potatoes
just melt in your mouth.

00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:41.609
- That's another sofrito.

00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:42.859
- [Server] This is the chicken sofrito.

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:43.692
- Chicken sofrito.

00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:45.321
- [Server] It's a little bit spicy.

00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:48.711
- Wow, one more dish,
excellent, oh and you can smell

00:30:48.711 --> 00:30:52.044
like almost a slight curry powder aroma.

00:30:55.597 --> 00:30:58.842
Oh side of the drumstick,
you know what it tastes like?

00:30:58.842 --> 00:31:00.468
- [David] I know how my mom
used to make it and it's

00:31:00.468 --> 00:31:02.635
gonna be exactly the same.

00:31:06.676 --> 00:31:07.811
- Falls apart.

00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:11.326
- [David] It's so sweet, so
soft, like it (crosstalking)

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:15.672
- [Mark] Those potatoes
actually, they're not dry at all.

00:31:15.672 --> 00:31:18.166
I'm loving all of the food,
but I gotta take another

00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:21.461
bite of this, this is a masterpiece here.

00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:24.963
It's like an eggplant
sandwich with just a burger

00:31:24.963 --> 00:31:27.297
on the inside it's incredibly good

00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:29.464
and it's so saucy as well.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.758
But probably my absolute
favorite dish of this entire meal

00:31:36.758 --> 00:31:39.795
is one of their specialties
and I think this is the dish

00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:42.161
that the name of the restaurant
is actually named after

00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:45.043
this is the eggplant with
the minced meat on top of it.

00:31:45.043 --> 00:31:48.084
Oh man, this is an award winner here.

00:31:48.084 --> 00:31:52.251
The texture of that eggplant
is just unbelievably creamy.

00:31:56.342 --> 00:31:58.009
Thank you very much.

00:31:59.547 --> 00:32:02.291
Walking out of the restaurant
or sort of like, stumbling

00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:06.294
out of the restaurant,
that was spectacular food.

00:32:06.294 --> 00:32:08.672
That was a meal where I
actually had to move to the

00:32:08.672 --> 00:32:10.422
next hole on my belt.

00:32:12.094 --> 00:32:15.094
If you love to eat, this is
a place you're gonna want

00:32:15.094 --> 00:32:17.347
to come for sure and have a feast.

00:32:17.347 --> 00:32:20.514
(inspirational music)

00:32:29.918 --> 00:32:31.710
We're just walking through the market now,

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.463
there's everything you can
imagine at this market.

00:32:33.463 --> 00:32:35.711
A lot of fresh produce.

00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:39.628
And some serious desserts,
look at these piles.

00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:41.546
These are all Iraqi desserts?

00:32:41.546 --> 00:32:42.544
- No just this one.

00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:44.673
- That one over there, okay.

00:32:44.673 --> 00:32:47.796
- [Mark] They look
similar to a jelly bean.

00:32:47.796 --> 00:32:49.300
So the dessert is called zengoula.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.840
- Zengoula it's Iraqi
dessert, wait let me do a

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.673
(inaudible) here.

00:32:54.601 --> 00:32:56.103
- Like a coiled, deep
fried and then some kind of

00:32:56.103 --> 00:32:57.481
a syrup on it.

00:32:57.481 --> 00:32:58.314
- [David] Exactly.

00:32:58.314 --> 00:32:59.147
- Alright.

00:33:05.369 --> 00:33:09.451
Yeah, it is like crispy,
and it sort of juices with a

00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:13.618
floral tasting syrup, it's
very sweet and very crispy.

00:33:15.496 --> 00:33:18.079
(upbeat music)

00:33:26.837 --> 00:33:28.337
We have just come over to
the wailing wall which is

00:33:28.337 --> 00:33:30.968
the Western wall of Old Jerusalem.

00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:34.208
And this is one of the holiest
sites in the Jewish faith

00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:37.835
and it leads up to the
temple of the mount.

00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:39.502
Thank you very much.

00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:48.628
This is the Western Wall built
by King Harrod the Great.

00:33:50.476 --> 00:33:52.524
On a spur of the moment
decision in an effort to work

00:33:52.524 --> 00:33:55.110
off some of the amazing food,
we decided to explore the

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.528
fascinating Western Wall Tunnel.

00:33:58.528 --> 00:34:01.065
While above ground you can see
about 60 meters of the wall,

00:34:01.065 --> 00:34:05.225
underground you have a chance
to walk along 485 meters

00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:09.108
of the original wall built
in 19 B.C. by King Harrod.

00:34:09.108 --> 00:34:11.691
(exotic music)

00:34:20.253 --> 00:34:21.879
We're walking through this
narrow passageway, it's

00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:24.931
pretty long, right next to the wall.

00:34:24.931 --> 00:34:27.384
(cheering and yelling)

00:34:27.384 --> 00:34:28.636
- Do you have a YouTube channel?

00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:29.634
- I do.

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.672
- Groovy!

00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:32.008
What's your name, what's your name?

00:34:32.008 --> 00:34:33.008
- Mark Wiens.

00:34:33.008 --> 00:34:34.219
(crosstalking)

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.346
(cheering and yelling)

00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:37.596
(laughter)

00:34:40.023 --> 00:34:44.190
This, this is unbelievable,
just ancient, ancient tunnels

00:34:45.624 --> 00:34:49.176
people walked in these same
lanes in these same tunnels

00:34:49.176 --> 00:34:52.556
like two and a half thousand years ago.

00:34:52.556 --> 00:34:57.097
Whoa, this is really really
cool and we're on our

00:34:57.097 --> 00:34:58.764
way to the aqueduct.

00:35:02.474 --> 00:35:05.684
That water is extremely clear.

00:35:05.684 --> 00:35:08.934
And there is even some fish down there.

00:35:11.973 --> 00:35:15.556
And there's water
falling from the ceiling.

00:35:16.397 --> 00:35:19.857
That was incredibly cool
though, that ancient really

00:35:19.857 --> 00:35:20.940
tight tunnel.

00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:24.142
After emerging from the
depths of the tunnels,

00:35:24.142 --> 00:35:26.352
unfortunately the Dome of the
Rock was already closed for

00:35:26.352 --> 00:35:29.221
the evening, but luckily
from a nearby school,

00:35:29.221 --> 00:35:32.057
we were able to get an impressive
view of the golden dome.

00:35:32.057 --> 00:35:36.065
A sacred site, and a breathtaking view.

00:35:36.065 --> 00:35:38.648
(exotic music)

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.390
Finally, before heading to
dinner, we drove to the top

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.810
of the Mount of Olives to
see an incredible sunset

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.977
against the beauty of Old
Jerusalem in the background.

00:36:15.036 --> 00:36:15.869
We had a nice, relaxing afternoon.

00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:17.992
We worked off a little
bit of that food from the

00:36:17.992 --> 00:36:21.564
Jerusalem food tour and
we watched the sunset from

00:36:21.564 --> 00:36:26.059
the top of Mount Olives, now
we're having one last meal

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:30.407
to complete this Jerusalem
food ultimate food tour.

00:36:30.407 --> 00:36:34.500
And this is a place that I
think the reservations are

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.296
really hard to get, so
luckily he knows the chef,

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:40.969
again he knows everyone
and we got a reservation,

00:36:40.969 --> 00:36:42.469
we're gonna have dinner here.

00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:43.965
- [Chef] Be careful.

00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:47.709
- [Mark] Alright, thank you very much.

00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:51.000
- [Chef] This is the grill
station and this is cold

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.167
station you know like fish,
fresh fish and everything.

00:36:59.842 --> 00:37:02.509
(meat sizzling)

00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:06.064
- [Mark] The aromas coming out
of this kitchen are insane.

00:37:06.064 --> 00:37:07.904
Oh I can't wait to see
what they're gonna bring us

00:37:07.904 --> 00:37:09.536
out for dinner tonight.

00:37:09.536 --> 00:37:10.708
Yeah.

00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:12.799
(cheering)

00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:14.882
(laughter)

00:37:14.882 --> 00:37:18.054
- Okay guys, fried seabass
together with a fatuta,

00:37:18.054 --> 00:37:20.679
which is kind of like an
Arabic vegetable salad with

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:22.266
crispy pita bread and lemon.

00:37:22.266 --> 00:37:24.563
- [Mark] They just brought
us out the first course

00:37:24.563 --> 00:37:27.113
and it's served on a block
of wood and all sorts of

00:37:27.113 --> 00:37:29.946
different little appetizer dishes.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.000
Oh and I think that's some
of the ahi sashimi there.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.833
Oh, okay.

00:37:41.543 --> 00:37:43.131
Oh that melts in your mouth.

00:37:43.131 --> 00:37:45.714
(upbeat music)

00:37:47.297 --> 00:37:48.963
This is burrata which is a type of cheese.

00:37:48.963 --> 00:37:51.296
(inaudible)

00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:17.178
Another signature dish, is a polenta.

00:38:28.748 --> 00:38:30.498
It's a giant scallop.

00:38:42.122 --> 00:38:44.504
That blend of spices is amazing in there.

00:38:44.504 --> 00:38:46.087
- [David] Very bad.

00:38:54.171 --> 00:38:55.277
- [Mark] What is that, foie gras?

00:38:55.277 --> 00:38:56.277
- [David] Yeah.

00:38:56.277 --> 00:38:59.277
- Oh, rossini with foie gras on top.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.000
Oh that just sliced effortlessly.

00:39:13.801 --> 00:39:16.596
Oh that is tender, juicy supreme.

00:39:16.596 --> 00:39:19.508
Oh and ridiculously creamy and rich.

00:39:19.508 --> 00:39:20.592
- [David] Last bite.

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:21.838
- [Man] That's a bite, open
your mouth, come on open

00:39:21.838 --> 00:39:22.755
your mouth.

00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:30.341
(applause)

00:39:35.223 --> 00:39:36.932
- Yeah, that is unbelievable.

00:39:36.932 --> 00:39:38.646
We've come to the end
of this incredible meal

00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:41.281
and dessert is just insane.

00:39:41.281 --> 00:39:44.529
I love the hand of the
chef here on the platter.

00:39:44.529 --> 00:39:48.696
I may as well go for the
hand of the chef right now.

00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:54.326
Oh yeah, that's like a cheesecake almost.

00:39:55.954 --> 00:39:56.952
What's up man.

00:39:56.952 --> 00:39:57.950
- Yeah, what's up man.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.953
- How are you?

00:39:58.953 --> 00:40:00.201
- Good.

00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:01.867
- Good.

00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:03.537
Just finished with dinner
in Jerusalem, that is an

00:40:03.537 --> 00:40:06.701
amazing restaurant the
staff are so friendly and so

00:40:06.701 --> 00:40:10.044
generous and so, they all
are having a great time

00:40:10.044 --> 00:40:11.384
as they're cooking.

00:40:11.384 --> 00:40:14.307
The food is top notch, the
ingredients were extreme

00:40:14.307 --> 00:40:19.063
quality, it was very loud
and lively kind of restaurant

00:40:19.063 --> 00:40:20.727
but really really good food.

00:40:20.727 --> 00:40:24.687
And today has just been an
amazing Jerusalem food tour.

00:40:24.687 --> 00:40:27.562
I still can hardly believe
that I was eating in Jerusalem.

00:40:27.562 --> 00:40:31.236
And everything from the
hummus we had in the morning,

00:40:31.236 --> 00:40:35.617
all the way to the kebabs,
what else did we eat, oh

00:40:35.617 --> 00:40:38.119
that giant feast at lunch
to dinner, the food has been

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:42.618
fantastic in Jerusalem and
this is no doubt one of the

00:40:42.618 --> 00:40:44.872
most fascinating cities in
the entire world, one of the

00:40:44.872 --> 00:40:47.532
most important cities in the entire world.

00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:50.125

an honor to have a chance

00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:51.708
