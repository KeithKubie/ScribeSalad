tremendous amount of trouble with - to
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.240
tremendous amount of trouble with - to
the things or to the child so that it's

the things or to the child so that it's
reasonably safe and then the child is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
reasonably safe and then the child is
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.609

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.499
her to get into like maybe there's a Oh
what would we say maybe there's a

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509
what would we say maybe there's a
 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.760
what would we say maybe there's a
tablecloth and on top of the tablecloth

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770

and if you persist with saying no then
the child will eventually give up and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
the child will eventually give up and
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.500
the child will eventually give up and
sort of go limp now now and often the

course that might make you feel guilty
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.500
course that might make you feel guilty
but what that means is that you've

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
but what that means is that you've
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.120
but what that means is that you've
effectively brought the behavior to a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
effectively brought the behavior to a
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.420
effectively brought the behavior to a
halt and if you do that ten times you've

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
halt and if you do that ten times you've
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670

need to explore and you want to use this
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300

you can grab them by the leg and say no

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
you can grab them by the leg and say no
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.900

them go and then soon after you do that
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.900
them go and then soon after you do that
about 10 times soon then if you just say

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910
about 10 times soon then if you just say
 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.450
about 10 times soon then if you just say
no with the same tone of voice the child

without having the leg grabbed then no
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.820
without having the leg grabbed then no
will just produce stopping of the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
will just produce stopping of the
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.650
will just produce stopping of the
behavior and that's unbelievably useful

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
behavior and that's unbelievably useful
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.410
behavior and that's unbelievably useful
because as soon as you're you train your

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
because as soon as you're you train your

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
can learn what things they're not
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.310
can learn what things they're not
supposed to get into and it's amazing

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
supposed to get into and it's amazing
 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.110
supposed to get into and it's amazing
how fast children can learn that and how

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
how fast children can learn that and how
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.720
how fast children can learn that and how
fast they can generalize to the class of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730
fast they can generalize to the class of
 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400
fast they can generalize to the class of
things that they shouldn't get into like

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
things that they shouldn't get into like

things that they shouldn't get into like
you don't have to teach them every

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550
you don't have to teach them every
 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.070
you don't have to teach them every
single thing they can generalize very

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080
single thing they can generalize very
 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.870
single thing they can generalize very
rapidly that's not much different than

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880
rapidly that's not much different than
 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.560
rapidly that's not much different than
thinking but also once they are capable

of understanding what no means you have

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550
of understanding what no means you have

an extremely potent means of helping

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
an extremely potent means of helping

them regulate their behavior with a
 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.960
them regulate their behavior with a
minimum of intervention so that's

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
minimum of intervention so that's
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.560
minimum of intervention so that's
unbelievably useful so now let's say you

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
unbelievably useful so now let's say you
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.790

upon doing something that you don't want
 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.100
upon doing something that you don't want
them to do like inserting a fork into an

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
them to do like inserting a fork into an
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.930
them to do like inserting a fork into an
electrical outlet and you just can't

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940
electrical outlet and you just can't
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.680
electrical outlet and you just can't
have that and so you can say no

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690
have that and so you can say no
 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.550
have that and so you can say no
hopefully you've already done the no

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560
hopefully you've already done the no
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.100
hopefully you've already done the no
training that I recommended and and if

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110
training that I recommended and and if
 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.749
training that I recommended and and if
that doesn't work what I recommend doing

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759
that doesn't work what I recommend doing
 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.029
that doesn't work what I recommend doing
is picking the child up by the arms and

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039
is picking the child up by the arms and
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.309
is picking the child up by the arms and
then putting them on the steps say look

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319
then putting them on the steps say look
 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.890
then putting them on the steps say look
you sit there until you're ready to

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900
you sit there until you're ready to
 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.059
you sit there until you're ready to
listen now or usually the child will sit

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069
listen now or usually the child will sit
 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.620
listen now or usually the child will sit
there and then the rule has to be

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630
there and then the rule has to be
 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.420
there and then the rule has to be
something like you can get up as soon as

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430
something like you can get up as soon as
 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.100
something like you can get up as soon as
you're ready to be a civilized human

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110
you're ready to be a civilized human
 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.839
you're ready to be a civilized human
being again and you can refer to

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849
being again and you can refer to
 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.600
being again and you can refer to
yourself your own attitude during a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610
yourself your own attitude during a
 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.370
yourself your own attitude during a
process like that because if the child

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
process like that because if the child
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.379
process like that because if the child
does comply and sits on the steps and

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389
does comply and sits on the steps and
 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.939
does comply and sits on the steps and
then comes and says I'm ready to be good

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949
then comes and says I'm ready to be good

then comes and says I'm ready to be good
and you like him again you got to be

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080
and you like him again you got to be
 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.170
and you like him again you got to be
honest about this then you can tell that

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180
honest about this then you can tell that
 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.260
honest about this then you can tell that
he's honest in his decision to rejoin

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270
he's honest in his decision to rejoin
 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.839
he's honest in his decision to rejoin
the civilized world now sometimes if you

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849
the civilized world now sometimes if you
 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.309
the civilized world now sometimes if you
put a two-year-old that's particularly

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319
put a two-year-old that's particularly
 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.620
put a two-year-old that's particularly
rambunctious on the staircase then as

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
rambunctious on the staircase then as
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.969
rambunctious on the staircase then as
soon as you let go of their arms they'll

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979
soon as you let go of their arms they'll
 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.339
soon as you let go of their arms they'll
run off and that can be a game or it can

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349
run off and that can be a game or it can
 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.990
run off and that can be a game or it can
just be an act of defiance and in that

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000
just be an act of defiance and in that
 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.149
just be an act of defiance and in that
case then you go get them and you put

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159
case then you go get them and you put
 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.649
case then you go get them and you put
them back on the steps and you do that

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659
them back on the steps and you do that
 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.990
them back on the steps and you do that
several times if necessary and if that

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000
several times if necessary and if that
 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120
several times if necessary and if that
that becomes a game then you sit on the

rule has to be you see that the
 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.610
rule has to be you see that the
punishment not only has to bring the

behavior to a halt in the most merciful
manner possible but that's still

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880
manner possible but that's still
 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.300
manner possible but that's still
effective but it also has to satisfy

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310
effective but it also has to satisfy
 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.000

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.030
and so then if that works then the child
 

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.640
and so then if that works then the child
can have a little gift and he's in bed

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.650
can have a little gift and he's in bed
 

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.560
can have a little gift and he's in bed
at 9:30 and then you can make it 9:00

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.570
at 9:30 and then you can make it 9:00
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.240
at 9:30 and then you can make it 9:00
and then you can make it 8:30 and then

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.250
and then you can make it 8:30 and then
 

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.280
and then you can make it 8:30 and then
you can make it 8:00 and those are call

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:10.290
you can make it 8:00 and those are call
 

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.870
you can make it 8:00 and those are call
that's called successive approximation

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880
that's called successive approximation
 

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.820
that's called successive approximation
right you hit the target you specify the

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:13.830
right you hit the target you specify the
 

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.140
right you hit the target you specify the
target that you want the child to

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.150
target that you want the child to
 

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.500
target that you want the child to
achieve and then use small rewards not

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.510
achieve and then use small rewards not
 

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.020
achieve and then use small rewards not
too often in order to attain that goal

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.030
too often in order to attain that goal
 

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.090
too often in order to attain that goal
and those are unbelievably effective

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100
and those are unbelievably effective
 

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.680
and those are unbelievably effective
strategies and they can actually be

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:24.690
strategies and they can actually be
 

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.770
strategies and they can actually be
pretty fun but I would say the advice to

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:27.780
pretty fun but I would say the advice to
 

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.570
pretty fun but I would say the advice to
not let your child do anything that

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580
not let your child do anything that
 

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.480
not let your child do anything that
makes you dislike them is really really

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.490
makes you dislike them is really really
 

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.210
makes you dislike them is really really
useful you want to talk this over with

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220
useful you want to talk this over with
 

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.650
useful you want to talk this over with
your partner too so that you have your

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660
your partner too so that you have your
 

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.010
your partner too so that you have your
disciplinary strategies and your rules

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.020
disciplinary strategies and your rules
 

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.180
disciplinary strategies and your rules
talked out so that you don't work at

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:41.190
talked out so that you don't work at
 

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.570
talked out so that you don't work at
cross-purposes to one another so okay so

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580
cross-purposes to one another so okay so
 

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.050
cross-purposes to one another so okay so
that's probably good enough for that
