00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.950
From Marvel Studios...

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.809
The new logo's still going? Alright, I'll wait.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.129
From.... Still going?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.940
Alright, here it comes!
From..

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.320
Maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrvvveee-

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.280
Jeez, how long is this thing?
Just cut it off. Nobody has time for that.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.880
Great, now we're running behind. 
It's Thor...Thor Ragnarok.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.360
After The Dark World, Marvel is back with a radical new formula for the Thor films:

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.620
NOT making them suck.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.860
YES!!!!!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.580
In an installment that trims all the dead weight off the franchise.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.560
From his love interest,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.200
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.440
to his homeland,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.700
to his friends you couldn't name with a gun to your head,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.200
to his right eye,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.900
to his dad,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.600
his hair,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Dang, even his hammer?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.680
They just trimmed all the weight off, huh?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.680
It's like the whole franchise got on Hemsworth's steamed chicken diet.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.220
Aaaaabs.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
Meet Thor, God of Thunder, who despite being able to shoot lightning, from his hands,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060
spends most of the film getting electrocuted.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.860
When Thor's father Luke Skywalkers himself into the afterlife,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.020
his sister Hela, Goddess of Pointy Things, will return to claim the throne.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.580
In an epic family feud that will make you wonder:

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.580
Are we sure Thor wasn't the adopted one?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.540
Put him next to Hela, Loki and young Anthony Hopkins and tell me he's not the odd God out.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.360
Thrill, as indie comedy director, Taika Waititi, takes the reins of a giant superhero movie.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.300
Because when you're part of a $14 billion global franchise, YTF not?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.160
Now it's out with the old, and in with the jokes.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.860
Behold...

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.920
...my stuff.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.940
Where boring exposition scenes get tagged by jokes...

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.160
I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard-

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.660
Hang on.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.980
Give it a second.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.140
Badass moments get tagged by jokes.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.700
You wanted to know who I am?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.260
And even heart filled emotional beings get tagged by jokes.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.400
Piss off, ghost!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.800
Yeah, they overdo it sometimes.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.900
But this is a movie where an orgy spaceship shoots fireworks over the Rainbow Bridge,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.220
where Hulk fights a zombie wolf.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.980
If you're mad it tries to make you laugh too,
you're doing it wrong.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.620
Follow Thor's exile on Sakaar,
a collection of the galaxy's most colorful gladiators,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.640
garbage,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.100
and Goldblums.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.300
Who's gonna get in first?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.780
And thrill as it turns into the closest thing we'll get to a Planet Hulk movie,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.600
where Bruce Banner awakens to find he's spent the last two years of his life as an enslaved killing machine.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680
I've been Hulk for two years? What the hell happened?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680
And take all of nine minutes to get over it.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.800
You want revenge?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.300
I'm-um...I'm just undecided.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.600
Together, they'll team up with new additions to the Thorniverse,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.620
like the depressive alcoholic Valkyrie,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.540
Drinks.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240
a Taika Waititi made of rocks,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.960
*gibberish*

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.500
and a mute bug with knives for arms, and they still have more personality than the Warriors Three.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Dodge that bullet, Lady Sif!
But don't worry, you still got it coming.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.200
Enjoy the first Marvel film where everything actually looks like a classic Marvel comic book,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.600
that reminds us all..

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.300
Thor is a cosmic viking created by nerds on acid in the 60s. It should look crazy.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.600
With the best bridge sequence since Deadpool,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.200
the best two man laser fight since Starship Troopers,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.560
and the best vehicle chase sequence where the hero jumps out to take the bad guys down by hand...

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.200
..since all the other ones.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.560
DIE, SPACESHIP!

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.900
Hey, we found Marvel's new Sky Beam.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.020
Yaayyy.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.600
So get pumped for what's easily the best Thor movie,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.640
also the best Hulk movie,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.620
probably the best Doctor Strange movie,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.300
the second best Guardians movie

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.080
and shoot, probably the best He-Man movie we're ever gonna get too,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.380
that hopefully taught Marvel an important lesson:

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.480
Don't fire the weirdo. Embrace him.
EMBRACE THAT WEIRDO.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.500
Starring...

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660
Flash Thordon.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.740
Look at these lies.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.800
Note to self, before commissioning a propaganda mural depicting my peaceful rise to power,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.720
DON'T commission another mural depicting the horrible, horrible truth.
