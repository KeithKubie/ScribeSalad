00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.408
- [Voiceover] A convenience store requires

00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:06.250
that Ayumi spend $4 or more if

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.315
she wants to pay using a debit card.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:12.113
Donuts each cost $0.80.

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:14.852
Donuts each cost $0.80 or $0.80 each.

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:17.906
A bottle of orange juice costs $1.20.

00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:20.344
If d represents the number of donuts

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:23.165
Ayumi would need to buy to pay

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:27.029
for 1 orange juice and the
donuts using a debit card,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.423
which of the following inequalities

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:31.267
best models the situation described above?

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:35.132
Alright, so she needs to spend $4 or more,

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:38.441
and she's going to buy 1 orange juice.

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:42.643
She's going to buy 1
orange juice and d donuts,

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.803
d represents the number of donuts.

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:46.660
So let's write this down.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.365
So this 1 orange juice,
this 1 orange juice

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:53.056
right over there, that's
going to be $1.20.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:55.495
We'll assume everything
I'm writing is in dollars.

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:56.532
That's that, and then how much

00:00:56.532 --> 00:00:58.894
is she going to spend on donuts?

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:01.868
Well, the donuts are $0.80 cents each

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:04.253
and d is the number of donuts,

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:07.600
so she's going to spend $0.80 times d,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.547
or 0.80d, we can write it like that,

00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:17.327
or we could just write this as 0.8d.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.365
So this is what she's spending
on that 1 orange juice,

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:21.597
this is what she's
spending on the d donuts,

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:24.104
and in order to use her debit card,

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.403
in order to use her debit card,

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.921
she needs to spend $4 or more.

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.917
So this thing right over here,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.320
needs to be greater than or equal to $4.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.968
Once again, greater than
$4, that's the "or more,"

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:38.767
but it could also be exactly $4,

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:42.041
and that's why we have the
equals sign right over here.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:45.930
So let's see, which of
these choices describe that?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.884
Let's see if 0.8(d +
1.2) is greater than 4.

00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:53.474
So before you even see if this expression

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:54.659
right over here is equivalent to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.161
this expression right over here,

00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:57.955
you can see, this is greater than 4,

00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.720
we want to be greater than or equal to 4.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.453
So just like that, you
could rule this one out,

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:07.228
and actually if you distribute the 0.8d,

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:08.920
you will see that you
get something different.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.886
You'd get 0.8d, and then 0.8 x 1.2,

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:17.367
is not $1.20, is not 1.2 right over here.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:18.731
So we can rule that one out.

00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:21.694
0.8(d + 1....

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:25.617
0.8(d + 1.2)

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:29.204
is greater than or equal to 4.

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:31.765
Well let's see, that has a
greater than or equal to,

00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:36.753
but if you distribute 0.8d,
0.8 x d is going to be this,

00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:39.849
but 0.8 x 1.2 is not 1.2,

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.824
it's going to be .96, 0.96.

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:47.170
So that's not going to work out.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.732
Let's see, 0.8d + 1.2 is greater than 4.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:52.854
We're close, but remember we want

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:54.735
greater than or equal to 4.

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:57.718
And then lucky for us, this
right over here is very similar.

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.342
It's exactly what we wrote up
here, with just the difference

00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:03.024
that instead of writing
$1.20 they wrote 1.2.

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:07.597
So if you just swap these two around,

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:12.597
you get 0, let me do that
in those same colors.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:17.715
You get 0.8d +

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:20.625
instead of writing $1.20
I'll just write 1.2,

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.895
is greater than or equal to 4.

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:24.892
Is greater than...

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:28.997
Is greater than or equal to 4.

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:31.099
So this is exactly what we had over there,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.675
so I would definitely feel
good about picking this one.

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:38.259
Now if you're doing this is in
timed conditions, I would...

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.448
Instead of even doing this,
you could go straight.

00:03:40.448 --> 00:03:41.957
Instead of just even
trying to think it through,

00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:43.265
you could go straight to
see, "Well which of these

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.539
"really describes what's going on here?"

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.338
So let's see, we want to be
greater than or equal to $4.

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:50.962
We're gonna spend $1.20 on orange juice,

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:51.896
and then the amount that we spend

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.696
on donuts is that right over there.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:54.422
So you might have been able to

00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:56.407
just cut to the chase and pick that one.

00:03:56.407 --> 00:03:59.013
Whichever way works better for you.
