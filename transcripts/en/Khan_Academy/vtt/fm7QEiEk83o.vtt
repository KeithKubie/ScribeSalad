00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.962
- [David] Hello,
grammarians, hello, Rosie.

00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:03.961
- [Rosie] Hi, David.

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.951
- [David] So today we're gonna talk

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.821
about a special kind of
dependent clause, which again,

00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:09.999
is a kind of clause
that can't be a sentence

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.193
on its own called a relative clause.

00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.606
So a relative clause is a dependent clause

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:18.763
that starts with a relative pronoun

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:21.494
So okay, so a relative pronoun is a word

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:25.077
like who or that or
which or whose or where

00:00:29.653 --> 00:00:32.650
that like any pronoun, substitutes in

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.676
for another part of the sentence.

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:40.048
So for example, Harry
Potter is also known as.

00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:42.371
- [Rosie] The boy who lived.

00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:44.389
- [David] The boy who lived.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:45.525
- [Rosie] Is that Dumbledore?

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:47.352
- [David] Yeah, that's my Dumbledore.

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:48.685
- [Rosie] I like it.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:49.518
- [David] Thank you.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:53.270
You can see in this little
snippet who is subbing in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.353
for the boy, right, so it is behaving

00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:59.704
like a pronoun, but a relative pronoun,

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:03.212
and so we've got this
thing here, who lived.

00:01:03.212 --> 00:01:06.142
The boy lived, on its
own, could be a sentence,

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.142
but who lived cannot be.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:13.242
- [Rosie] Well who lived
is describing the boy.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:15.820
- [David] So right now,
all of this together is

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.442
just a noun phrase, but who lived within

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:21.741
this noun phrase is a relative clause.

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.495
So, we need to find a
store that sells the new

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:27.058
Willamette cold brew coffee ice cream.

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:28.056
- [Rosie] I've heard it's really good.

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:32.025
- [David] So all of this
together is a sentence.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.441
This is definitely a sentence

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:36.018
We need to find a store that
sells the new Willamette

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.653
cold brew coffee ice cream.

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:39.393
Like, indisputably, that is a sentence.

00:01:39.393 --> 00:01:40.955
We have our subject, we.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:44.538
We have our verb, need,
and then the object

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.128
of need is to find a store
that sells the new Willamette

00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:50.717
cold brew coffee ice cream.

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:53.114
But, we're focusing on
this yellow part here,

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:56.364
so that is substituting in for a store,

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:02.736
that's what that relative
pronoun is representing.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.996
And then we have that sells the new,

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:08.402
so we've got store that sells, right?

00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:10.397
So that is our subject here.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.140
Sells is the verb

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.068
The new Willamette cold
brew coffee ice cream

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:19.297
is the object of sells, and
everything in yellow here,

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.993
all this yellow text,
is our relative clause.

00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:25.128
It cannot stand on its own as a sentence.

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:29.166
You could not just have that
sells the new Willamette

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.056
cold brew coffee ice cream.

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:33.971
On its own, that doesn't work
because the very presence

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:38.138
of this relative pronoun
requires more stuff to go on.

00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:43.193
Well, let's make things a
little more complicated.

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:45.280
The woman who always wore a red hat came

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.184
into the cafe every Sunday.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:50.784
So this sentence contains
a relative clause

00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:52.341
right there in the middle of it,

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:54.941
who always wore a red hat.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.584
All right, so we've
got who substituting in

00:02:57.584 --> 00:03:00.187
for the woman and that's the subject

00:03:00.187 --> 00:03:03.622
of the verb phrase wore
a red hat, but again,

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:06.065
this could not be a sentence on its own.

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:08.043
Now the challenge here
is when you see sentences

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:09.980
like this in the wild,
then you see sentences

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.642
like these in the exercises,
they're not gonna be

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:14.783
differentiated for your convenience

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:16.413
with two different colors, so
you have to be very careful

00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:20.580
to figure out where this
dependent clause begins and ends.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.426
So you can parse, so you can
make sense of this sentence,

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:28.315
in order to make it work.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:31.175
So really what is this
sentence actually saying,

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.020
just on a base level?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.173
- [Rosie] The woman came into the cafe.

00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:40.811
- [David] Right, and so everything
else, this every Sunday,

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.721
or who always wore a red
had, that is kinda extra,

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:50.137
and so it's your job as a
writer, reader and editor

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.099
of text, as someone who is working

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.404
with the English
language, to puzzle it out

00:03:56.404 --> 00:04:00.552
and separate the sentence
into its components.

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:03.721
- [Rosie] Right, this is a
who always wore a red hat

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:04.713
is a description of the woman.

00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:05.546
- [David] Right.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:10.225
- [Rosie] Then we move on
to the verb, the action

00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:12.525
of the sentence, what is she
doing, she came into the cafe,

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:15.302
so that's not part of
that relative clause.

00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:19.550
The relative clause is just,
in this case, providing

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.287
some description of the woman.

00:04:21.287 --> 00:04:24.640
- [David] Right, so use
your best sense because yes,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.497
it is possible that the
red hat could be the thing

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:29.135
that comes into the cafe every Sunday,

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.137
but it's more likely
that that hat is attached

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:33.199
to the woman that was referenced earlier.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.442
- [Rosie] Right.

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:36.343
- [David] So, that is a relative clause.

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:38.130
You can learn anything.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.169
David out.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.919
- [Rosie] Rosie out.
