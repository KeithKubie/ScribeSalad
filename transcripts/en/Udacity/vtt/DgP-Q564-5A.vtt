00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.400
Now it's time for
you to think about a product idea.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.020
One you'll use throughout
the rest of this course.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.039
&gt;&gt; Yeah and
if you don't have an idea already,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.830
think about problems in your
life that you want to solve.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.210
If nothing comes in mind
check out requests for

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.970
startups in the instructor notes.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.100
Is there an industry that
you always think about?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.130
You can also observe others and their
work and talk to them about the problems

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.930
that they face or
the problems that there companies face.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.770
The best problems to address are those
that you have personal experiences with.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.400
Your commitment to finding a solution
will be that much stronger and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.270
it will be the one thing that keeps
you going through the crazy highs and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.740
the crazy lows of building a company.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.650
&gt;&gt; It's a key idea to make sure
that you're building something

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.490
that solves a real problem.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.290
Yeah, for example Apoorva Mehta, the
founder of Instacart and his cofounder.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.030
They spent a year and a half trying to
build a social network for lawyers,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.700
without realizing one cardinal
truth about the space.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.160
And that's that,
lawyers don't like to share.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.070
Apoorva eventually solved
a different problem.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
And it was one that he always thought
was a personal pain, grocery shopping.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.050
He realized that his friends were
willing to use the app that he built,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.620
and it was unlike so
many of his other products.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.319
&gt;&gt; By observing and
reflecting on the world around you,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.930
you'll be likely to stumble
upon an idea that you love.
