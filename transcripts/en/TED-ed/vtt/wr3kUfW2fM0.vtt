00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.589
By 1973,

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.969
Harvey Milk had already been many things:

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.339
naval officer, high school teacher,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.389
bit-part actor, and wandering hippie.

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:25.289
But as he embarked on yet another life 
running a camera shop in San Francisco,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.639
he already found himself distracted.

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.349
From the Watergate hearings 
on national news,

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.829
to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.240
Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.258
Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:45.578
were essential to the fabric of the city,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.888
and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems.

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:52.830
From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.760
to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.880
Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.979
This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.518
as the representative 
for his own district,

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:09.598
which included the heart of 
American gay culture,

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:11.258
the Castro.

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:15.968
At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.058
plagued the LGBT community,

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:22.598
labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders.

00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:25.819
But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.729
He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet,

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.049
and he saw the Castro

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.759
as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.148
Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services

00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:42.238
to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups,

00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:46.098
regardless of race, age, or sexuality.

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.378
But despite his flair for public speaking

00:01:48.378 --> 00:01:50.148
and open-hearted approach,

00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:53.418
voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision.

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:57.788
In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors.

00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.630
In 1975, he lost again.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.900
A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.369
Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district,

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.699
befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.699
This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.”

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.839
And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977,

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.026
Harvey finally won the seat–

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:30.296
becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.980
Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.022
He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:42.672
and launched a major clean-up of the city.

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:45.352
But not everyone was happy 
with this direction.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:48.202
Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum,

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:52.562
especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6.

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:55.008
The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.318
for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools,

00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:02.318
would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career.

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:06.128
Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community,

00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:09.078
calling them unfit to work with students.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.478
But Milk urged them not to hide in fear:

00:03:12.478 --> 00:03:13.818
“Come out to your relatives.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.578
Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends.

00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:19.328
Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers…

00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:20.578
break down the myths.

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:23.028
Destroy the lies and distortions.

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:26.018
For your sake. For their sake.”

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:27.918
Alongside other activists,

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.548
he ran an incandescent campaign 
against hate.

00:03:31.548 --> 00:03:33.998
On November 7, 1978,

00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:37.218
Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide.

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.618
It was proof that Milk’s message was 
gaining traction.

00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:43.648
But just twenty days after this 
inspiring victory,

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:46.198
he was assassinated at City Hall–

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:50.508
killed alongside San Francisco 
Mayor George Moscone.

00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:53.018
Both men had been murdered by Dan White,

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.038
a former fellow supervisor,

00:03:55.038 --> 00:04:00.228
who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates

00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:02.473
and incorrigibles.”

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:05.606
He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings,

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:09.966
and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.416
The night of Milk's murder,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.526
thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city.

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:16.046
In the wake of this tragedy,

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:18.036
yet another injustice arose.

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:20.216
In a highly controversial verdict,

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:24.416
White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months–

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.433
a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.593
in what became known as 
the White Night Riots.

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:32.912
But even after his death,

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:35.982
Milk continued to preach 
his hopeful cause.

00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:40.272
He left his friends and followers a total 
of three different tapes

00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:43.904
to be played in the event 
of his assassination.

00:04:43.904 --> 00:04:45.914
They leave us with a call to action,

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:51.324
and a reminder that everyone is welcome
in the fight against injustice:

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:53.445
"I ask for the movement to continue…

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.515
and if a bullet should enter my brain,

00:04:55.515 --> 00:05:00.795
let that bullet destroy 
every closet door…”
