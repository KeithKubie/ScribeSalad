00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.740
For outsiders, Cape Town can appear to be a symbol of post-apartheid South Africa.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.600
The coastal city is promoted as a top destination for its diversity of food, landscapes and cultures.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340
But for black South Africans, life in Cape Town is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
steeped in the lasting legacy of
apartheid â€“ the system of white minority

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.620
rule that has left the country's black
majority poor and powerless.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.120
Though apartheid was officially terminated in 1994, throughout South Africa

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.669
neighborhoods remained structurally
segregated, and the vast majority of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.720
black citizens remain locked in grinding poverty.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.860
I'm going to show you how Cape Town was designed to keep racial groups separated,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.200
and how those divisions persist today.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.500
Cape Town's layout provides a striking
example of the clear socioeconomic

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.220
divisions between South Africans. I'm
standing in a township that reflects the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.550
living conditions of most black Capetonians: poor and under-resourced,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.770
without access to running water, sewage
or even electricity. Just next to it is a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040
white suburb that's worlds apart.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.240
There's no easier way to see this than with a drone. From above you can see the state of the bustling black

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.479
township I'm standing in, called Imizamo Yethu. It's a barren, informal settlement made up

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.979
mostly of shacks and government-built
homes. Literally next to the township is

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.560
a white suburb that's overflowing with greenery.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.600
So here's what life looks like for most white Capetonians: nice suburban homes with running water,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.619
protected by walls and alarm systems.
Some even have signs specifically

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.360
warning black Africans, in their language
of Xhosa, of dogs inside.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.960
And the disparity isn't just black-and-white. Here's the color township of Manenburg

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.979
to the left, and the informal black
settlement of Nyanga to the right.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.970
Unlike black townships, the ghettos of
colored people are made up of small

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.040
homes, rather than shacks, and have basic services like running water.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.840
Before we go any further, I should break down how racial groups are classified here.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.060
"Colored" is a centuries-old community of
diverse heritage that might be called

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.170
"Creole" in the U.S. or Caribbean. They're
distinguished from "Africans," who are the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.240
city's Xhosa-speaking black population.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.160
While Africans are the vast majority in most of South Africa, in Cape Town coloreds are the largest group.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680
Africans are a close second. Whites are only 15%, followed by Asians and others.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.560
The segregation we see from above is the
legacy of an apartheid system that was

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.880
instituted by South Africa's National
Party and lasted from 1948 to 1994.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.569
Apartheid further expanded the policies
of white domination and racial

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.120
segregation that were already in place
since the colonial era.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.630
Under the 1950 Group Areas Act, the government created racially segregated areas and forcibly

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.600
removed people from neighborhoods
reserved for white people.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.320
From 1950 until 1983, one of the largest mass removals in modern history took place.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.840
Here in Cape Town, District 6, where I
currently am, had been a booming area in

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.930
the heart of the city, with more than
60,000 colored residents. But in the '70s,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.470
the government bulldozed their homes and forced them into windswept housing

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.240
projects on the Cape Flats, far from the
city centre. Apartheid dictated where

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.350
people could live and move about.
Africans were issued a "pass," for an ID

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
document stating where they could live
and work. They would be arrested if

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.950
police found them in a white
neighborhood not designated as their

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.840
place of employment. The system was used to bar most Africans from moving to the city in search of jobs.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.800
Instead, they were confined to living in three blighted

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.820
townships. In the '80s, hundreds of
thousands began moving to the periphery

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.110
of the city, building shacks and informal
settlements. The legacy of that migration

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.880
remains today in poor townships like
this one. Part of apartheid 's divide-and-

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.570
rule scheme was to give coloreds
priority over black Africans for jobs

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.470
and housing. But coloreds were also
systematically displaced at the expense

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.790
of whites. And today, the white minority
continues to live near the city centre

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.870
and in lush suburbs like this one. And
the inequality isn't limited to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.100
neighborhoods. Under apartheid, Cape
Town's more exclusive Atlantic Coast

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.870
beaches, like this one, used to prohibit
blacks. Whites enjoyed their own beaches

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.680
like these, while blacks and coloreds had
their own beaches, which looked like this.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.880
Today, beachfront areas like Camps Bay still cater to mostly whites. But now,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.760
it's all about who can afford the nice
restaurants and shops.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.560
It's this kind of unspoken disparity that continues to permeate Cape Town society.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.200
Studies by local researchers have found that black Africans are almost always less

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.600
successful than white people in moving
up career paths in Cape Town,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.639
a phenomenon labeled the "ebony ceiling effect."

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.379
The inequality here is so stark that
Cape Town's GINI index, which economists

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.600
use to measure inequality, is 63 out of
100, that's one of the highest in the world.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.480
So why has Cape Town failed to
deliver a better life for all since the end of apartheid?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.270
Some blame Cape Town's governance. Cape Town rests within the

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.870
province of the Western Cape, which is
the only one of South Africa's nine

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.530
provinces not run by the governing
African National Congress.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.900
That's the anti apartheid party of Nelson Mandela.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.340
Instead, it's run by the Democratic Alliance, which grew out of white liberal establishment politics, but

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.280
includes remnants of the old National
Party and black middle-class support.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.160
The Democratic Alliance dismisses any claims that Cape Town remains racist.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.800
But it's hard to deny the structural segregation and discrimination that still exists,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.520
even if it is more subtle than it was under apartheid.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.920
Now that Cape Town grapples with a water crisis the world has never seen,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.760
the stark disparity between the haves
and have-nots is on full display.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.760
Many black Capetonians have always lived without running water.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.960
Now, others in Cape Town are getting a glimpse into that experience as they line up to collect a

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.770
ration of water. But what about everything else?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.320
Will the dream of a truly equitable society ever become reality here?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.040
