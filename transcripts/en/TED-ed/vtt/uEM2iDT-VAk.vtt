00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:10.844
Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:15.629
or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt,

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.087
on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:25.158
Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten,

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.123
here are some questions you can ask,

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:30.081
and the well-informed answers
that your friend,

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:34.150
being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.840
and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.962
What is gluten?

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.948
Gluten is an insoluble protein composite

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:47.871
made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin.

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.240
Where might you encounter gluten?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.291
Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley.

00:00:56.291 --> 00:01:00.260
What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.286
and why do you suddenly care about it?

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:07.242
Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:10.582
and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour,

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:12.981
like bread and pasta.

00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:15.234
For some people, 
these foods cause problems,

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:21.337
namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:23.964
Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:26.299
that occurs when a person's immune system

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.839
mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.602
leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases,

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:37.484
a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:40.499
Celiac disease is an inherited disease,

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.422
in which eating foods with gluten

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:46.983
leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine.

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:49.681
This impairs intestinal function,

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:54.308
leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea,

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:59.186
weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis,

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:06.000
iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.080
Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.809
of developing certain types of cancer.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:17.841
Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S.

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.768
When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac,

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:24.417
the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy.

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.596
The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet,

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:31.061
which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:34.914
Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy,

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:38.766
but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten.

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:42.850
These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.936
They experience painful gut symptoms

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:50.806
and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash.

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:54.246
A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:59.408
So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of?

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:03.712
Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear,

00:03:03.712 --> 00:03:08.086
but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease.

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.004
Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms,

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.833
the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:17.908
and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet.

00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:20.317
There's no reliable blood or tissue test,

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:24.874
partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease,

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:27.801
and has a number 
of different possible causes.

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.723
For example, it may be the case

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:33.187
that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine,

00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:36.046
or cause it to become leaky.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:38.715
But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:41.729
are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins,

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.030
but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.077
The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans,

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:53.286
so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon,

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.924
where they're fermented by bacteria,

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:59.469
producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.996
This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:09.513
Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect.

00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:13.430
This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.481
and because of that belief, it does.

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:22.098
It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect.

00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:25.148
Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media,

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.480
the nocebo response may play a role

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.598
for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten.

00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:32.562
For all these reasons,

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:34.738
it's clear that 
the problems people develop

00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:39.133
when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.637
So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:45.611
might be wheat intolerance.
