00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:06.430
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Dana, and this, more
importantly, is Bill Nye.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.190
We are very excited to have
him here for Talks at Google.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.180
He's published a book recently
some of you might have read

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.360
or will be purchasing very
soon at the back of the room.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.300
It's "Undeniable: Evolution
and the Science of Creation."

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.760
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.681
There's 20 books in a carton.

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.180
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Survival of fittest.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.290
Whoever is the fittest
enough to get to them first.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.664
BILL NYE: No, I'm
just saying you

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:36.580
should think about buying
a carton, that's all.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.370
No, it's all good.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.664
Lead on.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.080
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Let's have a seat.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.940
BILL NYE: Which side am I on?

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.890
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think
you're on that side.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.181
BILL NYE: Oh, where the hat is.

00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:45.460
Yes, in case I forget.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.120
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Just in case.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.411
BILL NYE: Are there any
questions on what we've covered

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:49.814
so far?

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:51.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Everyone good with that?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.980
OK.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.470
Great.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.144
So welcome back to Google.

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:56.560
You've been to our
offices before.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.735
BILL NYE: Couple times, yes.

00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:58.010
Love it.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.718
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thank
you for being here.

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:01.880
This is ridiculously
exciting for me

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.967
because I've been a fan--

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.050
BILL NYE: I love you, man.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So
I wanted to start

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.400
by talking about education,
because that's how many people

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.650
sort of got introduced to you.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130
You are Bill Nye,
the science guy.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.970
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.678
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We
know you, we love you.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.840
We watched your specials
and your shows growing up.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.302
And now you're an educator on
evolution, which is awesome,

00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:25.510
because we need more of that.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.670
BILL NYE: Because I'm
a mechanical engineer.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.889
So evolution is--

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.430
DANA HAN KLEIN:
Clearly in the realm.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.099
BILL NYE: I'm an
expert on evolution.

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.890
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right,
but so clearly there

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.320
were certain outside
factors that inspired you

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.070
to write a book on evolution.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.740
But it takes somebody
with real passion

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.040
to go out there and
actually do the research

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.050
and take the time
to write and edit

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.050
something that's not
necessarily immediately

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.270
in your field of expertise.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.061
BILL NYE: Yeah, but
I'm a science educator,

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:56.160
and so I consider this
book a primer on evolution.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.952
Fundamentals.

00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:58.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Very much so.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.750
And written in a
very interesting way,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.916
which was enjoyable to read.

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:02.090
BILL NYE: Oh, you read it?

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.430
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I did.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.070
BILL NYE: Whoa, whoa.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.420
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.160
Oh my goodness.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.290
BILL NYE: No, because
most of the time

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.520
the interviewer doesn't have--
oh, you know, I mean to.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.460
I'm going to get to it.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.585
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I loved it.

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:11.850
It reminded me of my
environmental science

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.180
class in the best way
possible, all the things

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.430
I loved out of that
condensed down into a book.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.030
BILL NYE: Can I ask you-- I
know we're supposed to be me.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.430
You're supposed to ask,
I'm supposed to answer.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.315
What is environmental
science, exactly?

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.815
DANA HAN-KLEIN: At the time I
took it, it covered evolution.

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:30.789
It covered a little bit
of biochemistry stuff.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:31.830
BILL NYE: What chemistry?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.387
Paleo?

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:33.220
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Bio.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.050
BILL NYE: Biochemistry.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.550
DANA HAN-KLEIN: A little bit.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.050
Touched on it.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.005
It was high school, so
it wasn't-- we didn't get

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:37.140
detailed.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.100
BILL NYE: So there's water.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.405
There's a lot of water.

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:40.130
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There's a
lot of water involved, lots

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.390
of bathroom passes and-- no.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.330
No.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.780
But it was an attempt
to kind of introduce us

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.549
to evolution and biodiversity,
and we had a unit [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.090
at one point.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.220
BILL NYE: Good, good.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.110
Like the environment.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.490
The science of the environment.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The science of
the environment, if you will.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.830
BILL NYE: Brilliant.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.663
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:01.110
But so it's not something
that's in your immediate field.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.950
And I feel like you took it
upon yourself as an educator

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.160
to go out and do this.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.877
So can you tell me about
some of the highlights

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.460
of your own education
that brought you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.150
to this point in time
where you're like,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.670
I am on a mission to educate.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.250
BILL NYE: That's
very good, Bill.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.900
I had Carl Sagan for astronomy.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.800
I just took one class from him.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.010
I was by no means
his star student.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.760
I was just like some guy.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.407
But he had a huge effect on me.

00:03:30.407 --> 00:03:32.490
Is there anybody here--
it's fine-- have you never

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.600
heard of Carl Sagan?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.285
That's remarkable.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:37.660
DANA HAN KLEIN:
We are at Google.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.660
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.100
But people are from other
parts of the world and so on.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.330
So he was a very
influential guy.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.960
And my high school physics
teacher was hugely influential,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.480
George Lang.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.840
And I had a fabulous
sixth grade teacher.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.500
And these people just--you know,
you spend more time with them

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.550
than you do with your parents.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.790
And so this is why
teaching as a profession

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.470
is an important thing.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.804
Nobody wants to pay for it,
but it's an important thing.

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:04.220
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
What would you say

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.550
makes a great teacher,
and maybe in particular

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.600
a great science teacher?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.230
BILL NYE: Passion.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.730
Passion.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.646
No, that's what it is.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:12.630
What did you like about
your favorite teacher?

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.130
It was he or she was excited
about whatever the hell it was,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.149
right?

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.230
Whatever the heck it was, sorry.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.110
So you want to have
passion, and you also

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.610
want the person to
be knowledgeable.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.111
It's very troubling
when you show up

00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:30.610
and you feel like,
he doesn't really

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.960
know what he's talking about.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.090
Sort of story of my life.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.740
But it's the passion
and the subject matter

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.200
that interests you.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.594
That's what makes
a good teacher.

00:04:40.594 --> 00:04:42.010
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Is there something

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.930
you think we can do as
a society in general

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.616
to encourage the next generation
of passionate teachers?

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.615
Because they're the ones
sort of leading the way

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:53.280
for the future of our future.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.080
BILL NYE: I just tell you guys,
and this is not rocket surgery,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.580
you just have to pay teachers.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.870
No way.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.010
Sorry.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.530
If a person coming out
of engineering school

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.470
could get a job as
a physics teacher

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.290
instead of writing code here,
he would think twice, right?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.450
Well, what do you make, four,
five times as much money

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.060
at Google as you do
teaching in high school?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.180
So it just makes people
make different choices.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.500
And apparently-- this is
anecdotal-- but apparently

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.150
in my parents' day
that wasn't the case.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.720
And so teaching was
considered a profession

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.410
and people were well paid.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.280
But since so many
public school systems

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.000
are tied to property
taxes, you end up

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.400
with the people who need the
best teachers getting the worst

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.520
teachers, or the least qualified
teachers of the teachers who

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280
are into it.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.940
And so on and so on.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.460
But this is the United States.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.920
And so I was born here.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.680
I don't know any better.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.480
I want the United
States to be the world

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.940
leader in all this stuff.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.740
You can't help it.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.550
Any Canadian people?

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.770
Right on.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.830
See?

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.980
It's an example
of some socialism

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.570
that works very well, right?

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.880
Seems to work very well.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.880
So seems like solvable problems.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.630
I ramble.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.660
Imagine.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.260
Weird.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's still on topic.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.171
BILL NYE: A little bit.

00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:26.670
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So would you
say you value most in education

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.660
is the passion?

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.090
And obviously the
ground-level knowledge

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.460
that's required to teach this
information to other people.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.775
Are there other parts
of it that you value?

00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:37.400
BILL NYE: Well, the
other thing is, you

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.394
know-- does anybody have kids?

00:06:39.394 --> 00:06:40.560
You've met people with kids.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.220
Some of you were kids.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:50.270
And kids, after a fashion,
respond well to rules.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.810
And I would say they respond
well to expectations.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.830
And as a friend of mine
says, there are no rules.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.400
There are traditions
and understandings.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.684
So yeah, if you screw
up, we have a tradition

00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:04.600
of you being punished.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.480
I think that-- you know
that feeling where you

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.890
want to do well for a teacher?

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.330
You want to achieve
something for a teacher?

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.460
That's because he or she
has set out expectations.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.580
We're going to have this many
quizzes or homework assignments

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.950
or term papers or
whatever the heck it is.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.530
And you want to meet
those expectations.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.350
But you don't want rules for
the sake of rules, right?

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.960
So part of it, part of
being a good teacher

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.280
or a successful
educator is to set

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.772
achievable goals, expectations.

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:41.230
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Would you say
that setting achievable goals

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.960
and expectations is
something that we,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.370
more in the current fields,
that we sort of need

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.630
to step up and become
leaders in again,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.420
with engineering and science
fields and mathematics?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.790
Or do we need to make
it more accessible?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.540
BILL NYE: Well,
as I say, you have

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.160
to do everything all at once.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.560
So you have to make it
achievable and accessible.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.800
But it's really
easy to set goals

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.740
that the students can't meet.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.280
It's really easy.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.950
And if you set the bar
too low as an educator,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.840
you're frustrated.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.890
I should have asked
more of these people.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:21.460
So how many people
are a product of STEM?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.030
STEM.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.821
Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math.

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:27.120
How many people got out
of school before all that?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.330
Yeah.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:34.330
So for people my
age, we didn't have

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.440
that sort of background
noise of STEM, STEM, STEM,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.929
because we had
the space program.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.320
And everybody was just
expecting that people

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.590
would go to the moon, that
cars would have fins on them

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.740
and look like rockets.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.350
And everybody expected that
great things would be achieved.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.310
But after that, after the Cold
War sort of resolved itself,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.870
then that emphasis fell off.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.520
So the big challenge now
is not going to the moon.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.740
It's going to be climate change.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.790
And so I want you all to be
the next great generation.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.720
Both of my parents are
buried, or interred,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.300
at Arlington Cemetery.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.150
They were both in World War II.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.000
By the way, if you get a chance
to spend four years in prisoner

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.668
of war camp, don't do it.

00:09:29.668 --> 00:09:30.167
Don't do it.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.419
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Sound advice.

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:35.960
Sound advice.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.610
BILL NYE: If it's an opportunity
that you're confronted with.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.340
Then ladies, I just
gotta tell you.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.390
So how many people have seen
"Imitation Game?" right?

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.790
It's got your very good-looking
Benny Bob Cumberbatch there.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.045
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Something
along those lines.

00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:55.420
BILL NYE: I mean, I have no
problem with Keira Knightley.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.920
I'm good.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.460
I'm good.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.060
The whole thing there took
place in Britain in that movie.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.022
Well, my mother was graduated
from Goucher College

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.230
back when we had such things.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.920
It was the sister
school to Johns Hopkins

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.430
in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.240
And so the dean of
students was a woman

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.090
named Dorothy
Stimson, who happened

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.990
to be the first cousin
of Henry Stimson, who

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.910
was the Secretary of War.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.490
This was back before it was
called Secretary of Defense.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.130
It was called war, like
that's what we're doing here.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.551
And I often wonder if
things would be different,

00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:36.050
how things would be different,
if we went back to calling it

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.640
the Department of War.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.060
Like this is, no, it's war.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.630
That's what we're doing.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.200
Yeah.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.010
It's not defense.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.470
Defending our oil fields on
the other side of the world.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.030
So anyway, she worked
on the enigma code,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.476
my mom, because apparently
Henry Stimson said

00:10:56.476 --> 00:10:58.850
to Dorothy Stimson, do you
have any girls, any women that

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.016
can come work on this thing?

00:11:00.016 --> 00:11:01.470
I can't tell you what it is.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.810
So my whole life,
people-- there's

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.960
people of that generation,
they would ask each other,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.339
what did you do during the war?

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:11.130
Like you would say,
where were you on 9/11?

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.160
Oh, I can't talk about it.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.940
Ha ha ha ha.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.200
Can't talk about it.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.090
And so to the women here,
I reflect on this story

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.890
quite a bit recently.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.140
I remember my mother could
not get an American Express

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.250
card because she was married.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.100
She was Mrs. Nye.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.310
Even though she had a
master's degree and she

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.220
went on to get a
doctorate, my mom.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.360
And I remember her
slamming the phone down,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.830
cussing at those people
with just the D word.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.860
She wasn't dropping
F bombs back then.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.490
And it wasn't that long ago.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.060
So we have climate change.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.540
And so my parents would
be-- we would call it

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.380
from the greatest generation.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.410
We have climate change.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.580
And we're going to need
scientists and engineers

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.540
like never before
to address this.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.539
And half of the humans
are girls and women,

00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:10.330
so half the scientists
and engineers should

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.414
be girls and women, right?

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:12.871
DANA HAN KLEIN: I
completely agree.

00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:14.680
BILL NYE: You can
change the world.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.880
And so you guys are--we're
living at an exciting time,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.260
and of course, as I understand
it, it's a Chinese proverb,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.102
it's an interesting time, which
the nuance or the connotation

00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:31.660
is, interesting
means kind of sucks.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.850
Like you can't relax.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.590
So let's change the world.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.410
Yes.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:37.910
Go on.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.993
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
actually, you beat me to it.

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.400
I was going to ask you about
sort of women bringing--

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.441
BILL NYE: Well, I was
brought up with this stuff.

00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.500
But my mother would also tell
you-- keep in mind, everybody--

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.390
my mom would tell you when you
could wear a floor-length gown

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.170
and when you had to
wear a cocktail dress.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.160
This was important to her.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.550
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Important, very important.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.900
BILL NYE: White tie, black tie.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.410
Does anybody know?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.490
OK, so it's tie, women wear
cocktail dresses and the men

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.810
wear tuxedos with black ties.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.370
And I recommend, guys,
you do what you want.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.670
Course I recommend a bow tie.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.114
But also, I think you
should wear a shirt.

00:13:13.114 --> 00:13:14.530
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Also sound advice.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.113
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:16.830
I mean, there's
probably a few guys here

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.760
that could pull if off,
but I just think about it.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.310
Then if it's white tie-- I was
brought up with this, you guys.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.320
This is the same woman with
the doctorate, all right?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.010
White tie, women
have to wear gloves,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.530
and the gown has
to reach the floor.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.640
And the guys have to wear
white ties, and shirts.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.250
And shirts.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:36.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Always shirts.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.310
BILL NYE: Yeah, that's steady.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.339
Yeah.

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:41.130
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
clearly your mother's

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.510
an inspiring figure, an
academically impressive one

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.530
as well.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.630
Who would you say are some
of your favorite women

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.619
scientists, contemporary
or otherwise?

00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:54.160
BILL NYE: Well, are
there any members

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.090
of the Planetary Society here?

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.680
Right on.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.180
Yes.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.850
I love you, man.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.640
So the Planetary Society
was started by Carl Sagan

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.680
back in 1980, as disco
music was giving way

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:17.590
to new wave and the important
work of Sid Vicious and the Sex

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.090
Pistols.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Punk is something

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.563
I'm sort of familiar with.

00:14:21.537 --> 00:14:23.453
BILL NYE: You wouldn't
know it to look at you.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.820
Surprise.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.370
Shocking.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.190
You knocked me over
with a feather.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.040
No, it's all good.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.600
But Carl Sagan started the
Planetary Society because he

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.183
and a couple other
guys-- Bruce Murray

00:14:40.183 --> 00:14:42.110
was the head of the Jet
Propulsion Lab, JPL,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.060
at that time, and
Lou Friedman was

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.200
an engineer there-- felt
that public interest in space

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.960
exploration was very high,
but government support of it

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.360
was not especially high.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.730
And so I joined The
Planetary Society.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.470
I was alive in 1980, people, OK?

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.630
I joined The Planetary
Society, and I've

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.170
been a member since 1980.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.450
Then at Carl Sagan's
memorial service

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.666
I was asked to be on the board.

00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.220
Then I became vice
president, which

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.110
is sort of a thing
you put on stationary.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.140
And you guys know Neil
deGrasse Tyson, right?

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.410
So he's a dear friend of mine.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.909
I spend a lot of
time with that guy.

00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:22.130
I was at his place
for Thanksgiving.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.440
Anyway, there's a lot of wine.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.600
He's really into wine.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.490
He's an expert.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.364
I don't know if you guys
know this about him.

00:15:28.364 --> 00:15:30.980
He's really quite
the oenologist.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.980
So now I'm the CEO.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.830
I just don't really
know what happened.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.320
It was a party, and
he's pouring wine.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.980
And so now I'm the CEO
of The Planetary Society,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.960
and we work to advance space
science and exploration so

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.500
that citizens of earth will know
the cosmos our place within it.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.820
So you should all join.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.580
And we feel we're at
another crossroads, where

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.470
public interest in
space is very high

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.790
but government support
of it is not especially.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:11.290
So one of the scientists
I admire a lot is Emily

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:16.190
Lackdawalla, , , who works
for The Planetary Society,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.850
full disclosure.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.820
And she is a geologist
who is just remarkable.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.010
So she's on our website.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.510
Check her out.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.650
And then last night I was
on stage-- check me out.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.130
I look like nobody.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:37.990
I was on stage with Sue
Strecker and Abby Allwood.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.170
And these are two--
let's see, one

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:50.300
is a-- she's not a geologist,
no, she's a geophysicist.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.041
Yeah, she's a geophysicist.

00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:53.540
And the other one's
not a geologist.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.040
She is an astrobiologist.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.522
And just an anecdote, if I may.

00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:00.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Please.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.140
BILL NYE: I was in a
meeting with Bruce Murray,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.920
who was one of the guys who
started the Planetary Society.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.211
And I said, well, we should
contact that guy in France.

00:17:06.211 --> 00:17:07.829
You know, he's a geologist.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.970
He's like, he's not a geologist.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.040
He's a geochemist.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.540
Whoa.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.039
Whoa.

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:13.871
Sorry, man.

00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:15.579
DANA HAN-KLEIN: An
important distinction.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:16.359
BILL NYE: I guess.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.740
Yeah.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:23.280
So anyway, these women,
they have come of age

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.440
at a time when it was
really difficult to get

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.760
a PhD in geology.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.810
And yet they're ruling
the freakin' world.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.020
Well, it's actually Mars.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.270
They're ruling Mars.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.060
And it's cool.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.000
So I admire those people.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.130
But you want to get
to a point, I think,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.680
where you're not that concerned,
is it a man or a woman.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's the goal.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.820
BILL NYE: But we're
not to that point.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.710
DANA HAN KLEIN:
We're working on it.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.543
We're working on it.

00:17:45.543 --> 00:17:47.150
BILL NYE: The longest journey.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
actually, speaking

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.400
of folks like Carl
Sagan and Neil

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.260
deGrasse Tyson and
yourself, and greats like,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.900
let's say, Sir
David Attenborough.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.310
BILL NYE: Sure.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.050
Bill, David.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.400
We're like that.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.085
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Bill,
David, Neil, Carl.

00:17:58.085 --> 00:17:58.960
BILL NYE: Carl, Bill.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The Beatles.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.274
BILL NYE: But the thing
about the Beatles,

00:18:05.274 --> 00:18:07.940
they were all about the same age
and they were working together.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.195
Yeah, but go ahead.

00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:12.570
DANA HAN KLEIN: We'll call
you all scientific rock stars.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.089
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:14.630
Check me out.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.255
Here's my card.

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:16.796
DANA HAN KLEIN: You
should change it.

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:18.280
BILL NYE: Scientific rock star.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN: CEO and
scientific rock star.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.160
BILL NYE: Scientific rock star.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.701
Or we'll put it the
other way around.

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.030
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Your choice.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.380
But you were all sort of
masters at making science

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.490
accessible and entertaining.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.573
BILL NYE: I love you, man.

00:18:29.573 --> 00:18:30.130
Yes.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.020
DANA HAN KLEIN: You
know, Carl Sagan did it

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.720
with his version of "Cosmos,"
and now Neil with his.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.040
And you had "Bill
Nye the Science Guy"

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.910
and all your specials.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.900
And you've just sort of been
at the forefront and sort

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.560
of leading the way with
this scientific edutainment.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.231
BILL NYE: It's hip now.

00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:46.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's hip, it's cool.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.550
How do we make it
more hip and cool?

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.244
Because you have a
global audience now.

00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:53.410
BILL NYE: Thanks to YouTube.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.100
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, what's
up, our YouTube friends?

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.845
But we watched it on
VHS in a classroom.

00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:01.150
BILL NYE: VHS, yes.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.775
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It
was back in the day.

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:03.510
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Pre-DVD, folks.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.230
But now you have this
sort of global audience.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.160
So how do you
capitalize on that?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.530
BILL NYE: Well,
briefly, I wrote a book.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.790
That was the next step.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.090
So just to talk
some more about me,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.250
because it's is so interesting,
I was a kid show host.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.592
And it was hard to get
respect as a kid show host.

00:19:29.592 --> 00:19:31.800
You're a clown, you know,
you fall on your empennage.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.410
DANA HAN KLEIN: Your
words, not mine.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.610
BILL NYE: And you get
buckets of water to the face.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.400
And by the way, if
you ever are going

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:46.270
to get a bucket of water thrown
on you, untuck your shirt.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.910
You wouldn't think it wouldn't
make that much difference.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.743
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Is this
for science reasons,

00:19:50.743 --> 00:19:52.750
or is this just cold reasons?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.304
Or a combo?

00:19:53.304 --> 00:19:55.470
BILL NYE: Yeah, I mean,
one's a result of the other.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.680
Yeah.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.522
The cold water in
the crotch is--

00:19:59.522 --> 00:20:00.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Something to avoid.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.604
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:20:01.604 --> 00:20:03.060
Your mind goes right to it.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.040
But so it's taken me
years to get respected

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.570
in this other way, which
I think, to your point,

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.086
expands my influence.

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:17.960
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And sort
of leading off that,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.410
do you-- again, you started
as a mechanical engineer.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.140
Do you feel that now, because
you are in the public eye,

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.580
that you sort have to beef up
your knowledge of-- I mean,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.870
you wrote an entire
book on evolution.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.330
Clearly you felt you had to
beef up your knowledge on that.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.121
BILL NYE: Oh, yeah.

00:20:31.121 --> 00:20:34.110
I'm continually-- disclosure.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.310
How many people read IFLS?

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.320
It's good, yeah.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.700
But I read "Science News."
"Science News" is really good.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.370
I mean, I don't get a
plug for that or anything.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.210
What is your magazine about?

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.150
It's called "Science News."

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.520
How many people
read "Space News?"

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.800
Oh, man, that's a party.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.080
You read "Space News?"

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.100
Yeah.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.870
This week Eutelsat is going
to get MR Sat to reckon

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.960
a new K-band radio frequency.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.230
Cool.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.460
Whatever that is.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.420
Yeah.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.459
So I work hard to
stay current, I guess,

00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:16.750
is the answer to your question.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.940
But it's the process.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.610
That's what I
emphasize to everybody.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.880
It's the process, it's the way
we know that's so important.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.020
And this is, frankly, what's
so troubling about the guy

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.290
in Kentucky, is he and
his followers, I mean,

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.930
they seem to be conventional
brains and everything.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.890
But they use them in a
really different way.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.890
And they just deny,
deny, deny everything

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.630
they can see in nature.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.380
And I don't know if you
followed this fascinating aspect

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.610
of my life, but I sent him
a book, a copy of my book.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.310
Here's hoping you have a
revelation, a real one.

00:22:01.015 --> 00:22:03.620
DANA HAN KLEIN: Did you give
him some ice for that burn, too?

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.600
BILL NYE: No, no.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.370
He doesn't take it that way.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:13.200
No, instead he prays for me
and quotes New Testament stuff

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.440
that's supposed to enhance me.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.220
And he's just checked out.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.604
It's really amazing.

00:22:20.604 --> 00:22:22.020
And it wouldn't
matter except he's

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.454
raising a generation of
kids that are checked out.

00:22:24.454 --> 00:22:26.245
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And by
the way, just so you

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:27.661
know, as of at
least this morning,

00:22:27.661 --> 00:22:30.450
or recently, you were the
number one best seller book

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.790
under creationism on Amazon.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.831
BILL NYE: I know, I know.

00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:33.610
Check me out.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Score one for Bill.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.800
BILL NYE: But here's the thing.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.950
There is a thing.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.200
And you can hyphenate
that, the thing.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.170
People are interested in it.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.680
As of sort of day
before yesterday,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.920
there's almost four million
YouTube views of that debate.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.570
So why would four million
people watch this thing

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:03.445
that I figure guys and gals like
you kind of know the answer to?

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:06.740
, Except, like, it's fun to
watch a car wreck, I guess.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.020
Or not fun, I didn't mean fun.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.161
Fascinating.

00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:10.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
can't look away.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.190
BILL NYE: You can't
look away, yeah.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.890
So it really says that we
have something going on

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.720
in our society that
you wouldn't expect,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.720
that people are still
interested in questioning

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.470
the fundamental idea in biology.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.720
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But also
watching the debate, I think,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.920
helped sort of as a platform
to-- if you ever do have

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.640
to have this conversation
with your friends or family

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.120
or something like that--it gives
you solid arguments to provide,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.249
because of the rest of us
aren't necessarily experts

00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:39.790
in evolution.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.989
BILL NYE: Well, I spent
a little time, yeah.

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:42.864
DANA HAN KLEIN: Yeah.

00:23:42.864 --> 00:23:45.072
Just a little more than
maybe some of the rest of us.

00:23:45.072 --> 00:23:46.304
Not all of us.

00:23:46.304 --> 00:23:48.220
But it gave sort of a
valuable way to be like,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.721
well, no, look at the XYZ.

00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.220
Dinosaurs.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.475
Ark.

00:23:52.475 --> 00:23:53.210
Ate everyone.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.212
Wouldn't work.

00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:55.170
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:59.390
So do you know that at
the creationism place

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:05.110
they have done-- no, I say that
because they call it a museum.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.790
They do.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.290
But there are no artifacts.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.105
There's no thing.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.747
When you go to museum
you expect to see--

00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:14.830
what do you expect to see?

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.000
The Wright brothers
airplane or something.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.320
Spirit of St. Louis.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.070
The rock hammer that Lyell
used to discover deep time,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.540
or I don't know.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.540
But there's nothing
from the past.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.530
It's all robots and
animatronic stuff.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.850
And along with that is
this very, how to say,

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.970
logically complete
robo-dinosaur-- like I

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.810
think it's a
pachycephalasaurus, if you're

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.275
into it-- eating a
coconut, because they

00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:47.270
were all vegetarians
until the fall,

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.190
until stuff went
wrong 6,000 years ago.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.130
I know.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.370
There you go.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.110
She's speechless.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.890
That's what I'm talking about.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.794
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
That's-- I don't know.

00:24:57.794 --> 00:24:58.960
That's hard to compete with.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.425
But you did it.

00:25:01.425 --> 00:25:03.550
Sounds like something out
of, like, a sci-fi movie.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.299
BILL NYE: Exactly.

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:05.790
But so when you
bring kids there,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.619
if you're a person who lives
in the Cincinnati area--

00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:10.660
I don't know how many
people are from that area--

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.390
but you probably think of
Cincinnati as an eastern town

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.230
result of the steel industry.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.740
And it is-- gosh, if you ever--
I don't work for Hilton, OK?

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.330
But the Netherland Hotel in
Cincinnati, it's amazing.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:32.750
It's this Italian marble columns
in the lobby or atrium area.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:38.190
And have you ever
seen "Citizen Kane,"

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.830
and they have the fireplace.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.196
It's like, that's the fireplace.

00:25:41.196 --> 00:25:42.320
It's like two stories high.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.380
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The
exact fireplace?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.200
BILL NYE: Wouldn't surprise me.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.980
It was amazing.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:50.230
Anyway, but across the river
from there is Kentucky.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.970
And it's a whole nother
notherness on the other side.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.940
And he calls it the
Creation Museum,

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.610
but there are no artifacts.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.610
And another irony, the Creation
Museum is made of limestone

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.510
and built on limestone.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.870
Kentucky-- you ever been
to Mammoth Cave-- no,

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.327
I mean the Mammoth Cave is
just amazing, spectacular place

00:26:10.327 --> 00:26:11.660
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.590
And they don't
really acknowledge

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.500
how it all got there.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.100
It's really something.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.025
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So they have a
theme, amusement park museum.

00:26:23.025 --> 00:26:23.700
BILL NYE: Oh yeah,
they're trying

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.640
to build an amusement park.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.960
That didn't quite--

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.780
BILL NYE: The Ark Park.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.613
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:26:27.613 --> 00:26:30.092
So-- terrible punnery.

00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:31.800
BILL NYE: No, that's
what they called it.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.290
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No, I know.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.206
That's the worst part.

00:26:33.206 --> 00:26:36.540
BILL NYE: By the way, at
least as of a few days ago,

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.630
they had not backed down.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.420
To be an employee at
the new Ark Park, which

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.600
is to get tax breaks or
some sort of revenue stream

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.970
from the Commonwealth of
Kentucky for tourism--

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.560
in order to work at the
Ark Park, which is supposed

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.950
to be for tourism, you have to
write something about your walk

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.360
with Christ, and you
can't be homosexual.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.450
You can't be gay to work there.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.130
So that is against
the law of the US.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.200
So we'll see what happens.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.430
I don't know how that's
going to shake out.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.980
But if you're into it, it's
like a cool thing to watch.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.140
It's the legal system at work.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.260
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Doing its job.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.810
Well, clearly they've gone with
a sort of entertainment value

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.940
in their own direction.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.400
But yours, I feel,
is more legitimate.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.360
BILL NYE: Well, I'd
say it's more self--

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.310
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And at
least grounded in science.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.810
Yes.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.480
One thing I thought
that was great

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.629
that you did that sort of
distilled evolution down,

00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:37.170
in addition to
writing this book that

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.670
was very fast and snappy and
great for the current age we're

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.800
in, is the emoji evolution.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.470
BILL NYE: Emoji evolution.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.970
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Emoji evolution.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.386
And it was great,
and I thought it

00:27:46.386 --> 00:27:52.201
was great sort of use of
current textual lingo iconery.

00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:53.950
BILL NYE: Hey, what's
the plural of emoji?

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.825
Is it emoji?

00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:56.491
DANA HAN KLEIN: I
think it's just emoji.

00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:58.190
BILL NYE: Like deer or fish.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.437
You can tell them apart.

00:27:59.437 --> 00:28:02.020
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But do you find
that to be an effective method

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:02.630
of communication?

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.010
You know, I'm sure it got
hundreds and thousands of hits.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.160
Do you think it's millions?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.040
BILL NYE: Well, I
mean, it's cool.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.240
So you guys, the
hardest thing for me

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.860
as an educator, the
thing that I work on,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.110
is to work to get things
understandable in short things.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.670
And grownups like me--
ah, these kids today.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.230
Attention span is so short.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.400
Dammit, when I was
young-- it's the same.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.890
People are the same.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.880
People used to just thumb
through the book, the magazine.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.550
Now we do this about
the same speed.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:39.090
So condensing it
is the challenge.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.170
I always talk about
the discipline

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.334
in the vocabulary, DIV.

00:28:43.334 --> 00:28:44.000
Gotta have that.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.700
Can't define the
word with the word.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.730
I mean, we all tend to do it.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.860
Well, bats eco-locate.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.191
So they use eco-location.

00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:55.690
What?

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.780
You just said that.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.184
And so you have to really
pay attention to the writing.

00:29:02.184 --> 00:29:04.100
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And I
suppose a limited medium

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.420
like that sort of forces you.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.260
Or--

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.680
BILL NYE: Get'er done.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Exactly.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.760
Or, you know, having the show
and communicating to a younger

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.920
audience forces you to--

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.760
BILL NYE: So fourth grade.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.890
So we had these very
compelling studies

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.990
back in the 1990s
that 10 years old is

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:27.270
as old as you can be to get a
lifelong passion for science.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.340
And it may be-- I mean,
I will claim anecdotally,

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.692
or in a related
story, it's as old

00:29:32.692 --> 00:29:35.929
as you can be to get a
lifelong passion for anything.

00:29:35.929 --> 00:29:37.720
What do you guys-- you
guys are all coders?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.730
What do we do?

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:39.900
We're software designers?

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.280
We're artists?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.680
You wanted to be an artist
before you were 10, right?

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.440
Or maybe it's 12.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.430
But it ain't 17.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.870
And so we aimed the show
at people in fourth grade,

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.500
at 10-year-olds.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.330
It turns out to be a pretty
good grade for everybody.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:02.230
It turns out to a very
good level for most people.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.966
About half the
viewers were grownups.

00:30:03.966 --> 00:30:05.466
DANA HAN KLEIN:
Maybe it was parents

00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:05.890
watching with their kids.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.710
BILL NYE: That's what it was.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.360
Yes.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:08.879
Yes.

00:30:08.879 --> 00:30:11.420
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But it's clearly
an entertaining show for all

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.086
ages, then, as opposed to--

00:30:13.086 --> 00:30:14.710
BILL NYE: It's got
to be funny, people.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.180
If it's not funny,
just don't even bother.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.180
No, really.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.860
DANA HAN KLEIN:
Everyone quit now.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.500
BILL NYE: No.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.600
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'm going
to switch gears completely.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.060
I'm going to talk
about space more.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.070
BILL NYE: We love space.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.340
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:26.790
BILL NYE: I'm kooky for space.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:26.985
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:27.693
Space is awesome.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:29.890
And I think last
time you were here

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.690
you said, if you guys
all weren't here,

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.481
where would you be?

00:30:32.481 --> 00:30:33.130
SpaceX.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.160
We just invested in SpaceX.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.020
BILL NYE: No, I
said that at lunch.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.470
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.020
BILL NYE: There's like two--
when young engineers coming out

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.311
of school, there's like two
places you want to go right

00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:47.537
now, Google or SpaceX, right?

00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:48.370
How about Microsoft?

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.270
This is recorded, right?

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.655
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yep.

00:30:54.655 --> 00:30:56.570
What's up, buddies?

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.040
BILL NYE: I mean,
I'm not joking,

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.390
but now I will
tell it as a joke.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.780
Some of my best friends
work at Microsoft.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.390
I lived in Seattle,
and the most people,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.692
they're either at
Boeing or Microsoft.

00:31:07.692 --> 00:31:09.650
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So with
all love to Microsoft--

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.590
BILL NYE: But I got a laugh.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.360
It got a laugh.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's the
right audience for it.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.130
So we believe in
SpaceX, and we've

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.650
contributed a sizable
amount of funding to them.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.342
If you were in charge,
where are you going with it?

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.800
BILL NYE: If I'm
in charge, there's

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.660
two things we're going to do.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.047
This is our mission is
to send humans to Mars

00:31:33.047 --> 00:31:35.130
and to look for signs of
life in the solar system.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.600
To look for signs
of life writ large,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.610
but the solar system especially.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.112
So I have very
good relationships

00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:45.820
with people at the
European Space Agency,

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.020
very cool guys and gals who
work at the Japanese Aerospace

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.830
Exploration Agency, JAXA.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.730
Have a pretty close friend who
works at ISRO, Indian Space

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.610
Research Organization.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.550
But NASA is still the
biggest space agency

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.940
in the world, still
the biggest deal.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.880
And as they like to say,
don't come running to me.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.603
Russian space agency,
Roscosmos now-- used

00:32:08.603 --> 00:32:10.790
to be Soviet Space--
has landed on Venus,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:15.580
has put balloons in
the clouds of Venus.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.420
They made the first robotic
sample return mission

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.074
from the moon.

00:32:20.074 --> 00:32:20.990
You may not know this.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.770
Just a few months after the
humans walked on the moon,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.830
the Soviet Union brought back
rocks by robot from the moon.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.430
They did all that, but
they're 0 for 21 at Mars.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.420
Landing on Mars is
really difficult.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.842
There's just some
physics problems

00:32:37.842 --> 00:32:38.800
that are hard to solve.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.420
They're not impossible,
there just difficult.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:48.880
So it's been estimated that
what our very best rovers do--

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.620
Mars rovers-- do in a week a
human geologist could do in

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.700
about a minute.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.210
So if you could
get a human there

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.670
you could really
get something done.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.240
And you guys, I
just try to remind

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.850
everybody what's at stake here.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:10.280
If we found evidence of life
on Mars, or evidence of life

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.510
on Europa-- Europa is
the moon of Jupiter

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.740
that has twice as much seawater,
or maybe more than that times

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.820
as much seawater as the earth.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.840
More than that times, yes.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.580
More than twice as much
seawater as the earth.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.140
If we found living things
there, it would change history.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.450
It would revolutionize the
way everybody in the world

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.070
thinks about his or her place in
space, as they like to call it.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.510
And so this is a
very small investment

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.707
for robotic exploration.

00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:41.790
So it's Planetary Society.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.290
Did I mention The
Planetary Society?

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.350
Did I say that earlier?

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.849
Yeah.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.960
We want one and a half
billion dollars a year

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.090
at NASA for planetary
exploration.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:58.030
And then we would like the human
space flight people to focus

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.370
on sending people to Mars.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.830
What's happened is, people in
this congressional district,

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.640
that congressional district,
they want their space thing

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.300
done, they want
their rocket built,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.340
they want their capsule built.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.270
And then it just
gets to be diffused.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.110
It's about building hardware
instead of going someplace

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.710
and doing something.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:22.409
So the NASA budget during
the Apollo era was almost 10%

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.949
of the federal budget.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.830
Now it's 0.4%.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:31.080
And then planetary science
is in turn 9% of that.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.889
So less than .04% of
the federal budget

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.429
goes to planetary exploration.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.260
And that is yet where we make
all the crazy discoveries.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.690
And this is the places where
we would, dare I say it,

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.679
change the world.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.929
And so we advocate for that.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.017
But if we were to put humans
on Mars and find life,

00:34:52.017 --> 00:34:53.850
it would be-- I mean,
I say it all the time,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.360
we would still drive
on the right in the US,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.202
like, let's not
change everything.

00:34:59.202 --> 00:35:01.160
But just think how your
life would be different

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.540
if we didn't know the
earth went around the sun,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.800
if we didn't know that
the moon had craters.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.650
These are Copernicus
and Galileo.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.220
These discoveries in
astronomy changed history,

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.040
changed all of humankind.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.910
Now we take out a phone,
if it doesn't tell you

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.320
which side of the street
you're on, this sucks, man.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.370
This weather report
is off 10 minutes.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.035
I have an app that
tells you, says

00:35:26.035 --> 00:35:28.590
it's gonna rain in 18 minutes.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.890
What the--?

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.240
And it's right.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.200
It's cool.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.720
So all that comes from space.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.660
That's what I'm saying.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.460
No, without space exploration
you wouldn't have that stuff.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.834
And so, like I'm
telling you, did

00:35:45.834 --> 00:35:47.000
you hear about Google Earth?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.380
Have you heard about this?

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.210
Sorry.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:50.919
Go ahead.

00:35:50.919 --> 00:35:51.710
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.450
I'm going to get a little
ridiculous with space now.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:54.080
BILL NYE: Oh, bring it on.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:54.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.780
This is going to go a little
sci fi, a little, what

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.670
does Bill Nye think about?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.410
What is a technology
that you would

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.680
like to see in your lifetime
that hasn't been invented yet,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.290
without the
constraints of realism?

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.860
Something like the holodeck,
like a light saver.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.180
Do you want a hoverboard?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.862
Anything you want.

00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:16.570
BILL NYE: Really?

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:16.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.526
Let's go for it.

00:36:17.526 --> 00:36:18.970
Why not?

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.824
Not saying we're going
to make it for you.

00:36:20.824 --> 00:36:22.740
BILL NYE: If what I
really want got recorded--

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.870
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Within PG reason.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.328
BILL NYE: --it
would end my career.

00:36:27.784 --> 00:36:29.950
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Within
YouTube broadcastable reason.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.699
BILL NYE: There's two
things that I really

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:35.350
want somebody to figure out,
and these are not easy things.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.240
The better battery.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.250
Or I'm calling it a battery--
better electrical storage

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.184
system.

00:36:41.184 --> 00:36:43.350
You guys at Google, how
much electricity do you use?

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.200
Most of the US's output.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.630
Like enormous, right?

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.870
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I'm not going
to take responsibility for it,

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:48.120
but probably.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.390
BILL NYE: But it's an enormous
amount of electricity,

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.490
which we all benefit from.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.090
If I'm going to use
electricity, it's

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.090
a fabulous thing to use-- I
mean, there's nothing better.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.410
A better battery would
change the world.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.510
And then if you guys, if
somebody could come up

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:05.020
with a way to desalinate
seawater much more economically

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:10.040
than we can right now, that
would just be freaking cool.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.690
These are really difficult
engineering problems, I think,

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.880
but what's not to love
about engineering problems?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:21.540
As I say, engineers use science,
solve problems and make things.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.630
That's our business people.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.650
The world owes us a living.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.250
No, whatever.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.890
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.090
So but as far as the
extraordinary space stuff,

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:38.265
I would love to be able to fly
in orbit at a reasonable cost

00:37:38.265 --> 00:37:38.765
safely.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.580
So have you heard
about Mars One?

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.330
People claim they want
to go to Mars one way.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.010
I don't want to go one way.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.730
I want to come back.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.780
I mean, I think that's sort
of part of the-- if I'm going

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.240
to sign on, I'd like--

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.040
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You want
the option of returning.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.539
Yeah.

00:37:58.539 --> 00:37:59.185
Reasonable.

00:37:59.185 --> 00:37:59.810
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.164
I want also a pretty solid
plan, not just the option, not

00:38:03.164 --> 00:38:03.830
just a checkbox.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Just drop you there.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:05.970
Good luck.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.303
BILL NYE: So that would be cool.

00:38:07.303 --> 00:38:11.150
But we still, we're
constrained by physics.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.870
To get into orbit still right
now takes a lot of energy.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.203
I'm not saying it can't be done.

00:38:15.203 --> 00:38:18.480
The costs can't be lowered,
but it does take energy.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.180
And you've got to do that
right now by burning something.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.740
You know, space elevator.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.450
After we invent nanotubes.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.190
Cool.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.540
You guys use nanotubes that
are 50 nanometers long?

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.410
We need them like
50 kilometers long.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.640
Then we'll take a meeting.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.414
So I'm not saying it can't be
done, but it's a long way off.

00:38:38.414 --> 00:38:39.330
So yeah, those things.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.400
But is that short term?

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.750
The other thing The
Planetary Society's involved

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.260
is solar sailing.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.240
So I don't know how much
physics you're into,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.740
but it is a surprising result
that light, although it

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.970
has no mass, has momentum.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.350
Photons have momentum.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.790
So if you have a
spacecraft out there

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.340
in the icy blackness of space
and sunlight's falling on it,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:09.130
it gets a push, a very
gentle, gentle push.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.997
But unlike a chemical
rocket, the push

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:14.970
is there all the
time, day and night.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.732
Wait, there's no night.

00:39:16.732 --> 00:39:17.231
Ha ha!

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.810
So The Planetary Society,
this goes back to Carl Sagan.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.420
Carl Sagan talked romantically
about a solar sail mission

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.470
to catch up with Comet Holley.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.880
If you know Comet
Holley, it used

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.770
to be called Halley's Comet.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.030
But they found people-- they,
people from the Holley family

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.300
stepped forward and said,
we pronounce it Holley, not

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.412
Halley.

00:39:42.412 --> 00:39:44.620
But I don't know if you know
"Rock Around the Clock,"

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.030
Bill Haley and the Comets.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.770
They're not going
to change that, OK?

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.130
It's Comet Holley.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.960
Let's see, Bill and
the Comet Holleys.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.440
That's not going to happen.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.275
So I guess that's
an older reference.

00:39:56.275 --> 00:39:57.900
So it's a rock and
roll song, you guys.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.400
Sorry.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.910
Anyway, that
mission got canceled

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.770
when the space shuttle was
decided to be built instead.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.070
And it was disappointing.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.630
Nobody caught up
with Comet Holley.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.580
And people from time to
time build solar sails.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.120
And the last really cool
one was IKAROS, which was--

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.150
is anybody Japanese
here, like from Japan?

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.470
So the Japanese space
agency always creates

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.930
an English acronym.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.190
It's like, OK, cool.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:38.610
So IKAROS means interplanetary
kite-craft acceleration.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.310
So it's cool.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.250
I mean, it's cool.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.750
So it was a good solar sail.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.720
But it was tested and it worked.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.700
But now it's in this really
long orbit around the sun.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:53.800
It's not really flying a useful
or intended mission right now.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.850
But The Planetary Society--
did I mention them?

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.810
We're building our
own solar sail.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.900
It's built.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.240
Yesterday it got put
in the ultrasat, which

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.390
is a combination
of small satellites

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.597
that will launch the
first week of May.

00:41:08.597 --> 00:41:10.013
If you've got
nothing to do, we'll

00:41:10.013 --> 00:41:11.160
see you at Cape Canaveral.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.520
It's gonna be crazy.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.940
So this thing is
a CubeSat, so it's

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.990
10 centimeters by 10
centimeters by 30 centimeters.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.330
This is a NASA standard.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:29.244
And the sails, which are made
of this crazy, shiny mylar--

00:41:29.244 --> 00:41:31.160
brrrrr, they kind of--
except you're in space,

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.390
so it just goes-- they
will be pushed by the sun.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:44.030
So this thing is this big,
and the sails are a little bit

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.240
bigger than this
first green patch

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.050
here, just a little
bit bigger than that

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.240
when they are fully deployed.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.420
And so CubeSats are a
very popular standard.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.510
You can go to websites and
buy solar panels and stuff.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.250
And this thing was
built by people

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.620
around the world, our
46,000 members who

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.109
just think it's cool.

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:05.150
And we're going to try
this, and it would greatly

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:09.370
lower the cost of
many, many missions.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.090
And it would be part of the word
that everybody that everybody

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.730
loves now is
democratizing space,

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:18.600
where small organizations,
universities and so on,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.570
could participate in
interplanetary missions or SIS

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.620
lunar, from here to the
moon kind of missions.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.380
Mission is jargon
for spaceship thing,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.770
spaceship things between
here and Venus or Mars.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:38.510
And as the saying goes, you
can trade money for time.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.040
If you have time, the solar
sail will take you anywhere.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.490
And so people sit around--
what we need, OK, we're

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.510
going to build a
solar sail and then

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.140
we're going to put
a laser on the moon.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.940
And then we're going to shoot
at the solar sail for 10,000

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.890
years.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.150
And it will go to
Proxima Centauri.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.680
It's gonna be brilliant.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.010
But it's the only technology
that anybody's thought of

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.490
to go to another star system.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.050
Just, you know, if
you get around to it.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:12.240
10,000 years.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.780
Let's see, the Roman
Empire was pretty good.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.520
Went 750, like 800 years?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.020
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
They had a good run.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.940
BILL NYE: A good run.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.244
So we need to go 10 times that
long with an electronic thing

00:43:24.244 --> 00:43:25.410
on the far side of the moon.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:25.909
OK.

00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:26.884
All right.

00:43:26.884 --> 00:43:29.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Clearly
there's an impetus out there

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.490
to come up with a
better plan, possibly.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:30.760
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.177
Yes.

00:43:31.177 --> 00:43:32.635
DANA HAN KLEIN:
Let's work on that.

00:43:32.635 --> 00:43:35.590
BILL NYE: But there's two
questions that get us all.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:40.624
Where did we come from, and
are we alone in the universe?

00:43:40.624 --> 00:43:42.040
And if you meet
somebody who says,

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.248
oh, I've never wondered that.

00:43:43.248 --> 00:43:44.950
They're lying.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.560
Of course.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.790
Come on.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.120
Of course you have.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.124
Are we alone?

00:43:49.124 --> 00:43:50.790
That's why I want to
go to Mars and see.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.000
Does it have DNA or
the Martian microbes?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.190
Are they like us?

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.350
Are they some other alien?

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.620
Ah, ha ha ha.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.630
Sorry.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.838
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I was gonna
say, do they [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:03.838 --> 00:44:04.900
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.420
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So let's say
someday, you're still around,

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.250
we're all still around,
humankind survives,

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.990
and for whatever reason we meet
maybe not cellular alien life,

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:16.320
but full formed alien life, and
whatever hypothetical reason,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.240
we are able to communicate.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.720
What would you say to them,
and conversely, what would you

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.410
want them to say to you?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.670
BILL NYE: Do you have any food?

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.860
Sorry, that was my inner dog.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.470
It was just, when I meet dogs
that's what it seems like

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:35.280
they're-- are you another dog?

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.816
Do you have any food?

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.190
So I guess I would say, what
are you passionate about?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.272
Why are you here?

00:44:44.272 --> 00:44:45.730
We came here because
we just wanted

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.640
to see what was going on.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640
What are you doing here?

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.300
I guess that would
be the question.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:54.070
And they might say, well, we
were just wandering around.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.480
And then, you know, in some
science fiction stories--

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:56.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.860
BILL NYE: Right.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.447
We wanted to see if the
spaceship would work.

00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:02.030
Actually, we didn't
mean to come here.

00:45:04.145 --> 00:45:05.770
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Do
you have directions?

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.250
That's the real question.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.930
BILL NYE: Well, let
me get out my phone.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:13.900
So I grew up with a
lot of science fiction.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.540
And people who are members
of The Planetary Society

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.124
grew up with science fiction.

00:45:20.124 --> 00:45:21.790
There's a tremendous
amount of crossover

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:27.460
between science fiction
people and real space people.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.230
But right now-- I guess it's
not new-- is this apocalyptic,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:35.480
everything is going to suck
in the future science fiction.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:41.850
And what is so compelling
to me about "Star Trek" is

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.990
it's this optimistic view,
that the problems are solved,

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.550
that people just get along.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.140
And they don't have
material problems.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.244
They have just human
to human problems.

00:45:54.244 --> 00:45:56.660
And I mean, you could say the
same is true in Shakespeare.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.451
They're not worried
about food and shelter.

00:45:58.451 --> 00:46:01.110
There's who said what to whom.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.280
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No impending
Romulan attack in Shakespeare.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.180
BILL NYE: Well, yeah.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:06.490
Right.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.020
There's no Romulans
in Shakespeare.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.370
That was a great episode.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.450
It was really good.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.130
What's the title of that one?

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.570
Oh, shoot.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.470
What's the title of the
first Romulan episode?

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.490
Oh well, I failed.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.966
But anyway, I was sitting there
with some other Googlians--

00:46:24.966 --> 00:46:25.840
what are they called?

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.349
Googlians?

00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:27.390
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Googlers?

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.140
BILL NYE: Googlers.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.460
Googlists.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.160
And they had never
seen "The City

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.950
on the Edge of
Forever," which is

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.000
the generally regarded as
the best original "Star Trek"

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.170
episode.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.620
And it's about people.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:45.140
With all the technology that
goes on, it's about people.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.119
So that's still
what interests us.

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:49.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think that's
part of the reason a lot

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.460
of people-- the
actual space programs,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.840
yes-- but that sort of
surge of "Star Trek" on TV

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.985
and "Star Wars" in
the '70s and '80s.

00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:00.360
I think it keeps
people inspired.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.310
But there's also
the grounded science

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.860
that people sort of strive to
achieve the things that they

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.280
see in science fiction.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.510
BILL NYE: Technetic
field, subspace.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.343
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think
QuickTime came about

00:47:11.343 --> 00:47:13.700
because of a "Star Trek"
episode, is my understanding,

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.080
the ability to play
multiple audio streams.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.320
So people are inspired
by stuff like that.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.424
BILL NYE: We are.

00:47:20.424 --> 00:47:21.590
It's about your imagination.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:22.920
I mean, I'm not telling
you guys anything.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.610
The whole place is imagination.

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:25.985
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
So I think we are

00:47:25.985 --> 00:47:27.220
going to take some questions.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.940
If folks would line up,
we have a microphone.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:29.310
BILL NYE: Oh, wow.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.280
I love you guys.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.330
Thanks for coming,
everybody, by the way.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.210
Thank you.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.910
Lead on.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:40.554
Dana, lead on.

00:47:40.554 --> 00:47:41.220
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.220
My question is about
artificial intelligence.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.480
In recent news reports
Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.830
have mentioned their
thoughts about it.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.670
I wonder if you could
speak about yours,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.840
and especially how it
relates to evolution.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:01.260
BILL NYE: So everybody's
concerned about the singularity

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.010
when computers will
be as smart as humans,

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:11.470
able to not only win at
"Jeopardy," but other stuff.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.980
And I'm all for it, you guys.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.120
And you all may be right
that when a computer is built

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.930
that's every bit as screwed
up as a human brain,

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.050
it'll be really great.

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:24.210
But 20%, a fifth of
the people on earth,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.730
have no electricity, have
never made a phone call.

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.920
I'm not talking about never
made a cellphone call.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.820
Never made a phone
call of any kind.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.050
And the thing I
always wonder about in

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.130
these apocalyptic artificial
intelligence scenarios,

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.350
which Elon Musk and
Stephen Hawking-- this will

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:45.260
be the end of humankind, when
humans build a computer smarter

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.050
than we are.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.430
What if they stop
shoveling the coal

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:54.320
and the electricity shuts off?

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.030
What are these
machines going to do?

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:58.350
They'll build their
own nuclear reactors

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.420
and force you to feed
them electricity.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.960
OK.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.550
We'll see.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.500
So I just don't think
it's as apocalyptic

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.500
as those guys assert.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.570
But I can easily
imagine a situation

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.460
where we all get increasingly
dependent on something

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:17.370
that controls our sewer
systems, our electrical grid,

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.270
our education system.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:24.760
So many people get classes,
for example, electronically.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.080
And everything falls apart.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.940
That I can easily imagine.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:32.310
But I think it's not the same
as having the robots take over.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.730
That's my feeling on it.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:35.230
Thank you.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:36.847
It's a cool question.

00:49:36.847 --> 00:49:38.430
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's
a relief to know.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.888
BILL NYE: Well,
but I may be wrong.

00:49:39.888 --> 00:49:42.950
I mean, I'm the first guy
to say I may be wrong.

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.636
Maybe it will be the
end of the world.

00:49:44.636 --> 00:49:47.010
So did you ever see-- you guys
are too young-- "Colossus:

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.920
The Forbin Project?"

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:53.690
So they have computers--
because of the danger of humans

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.230
screwing up and killing
everyone with nuclear weapons

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.980
accidentally launched,
they're going to have

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.650
a computer control it all.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:04.020
Then the Soviet Union
has the same deal.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.690
Oh, I know.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:06.220
We'll hook them together.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.040
And they can be in
touch to prevent

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.030
a worldwide nuclear catastrophe.

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.195
But you know, stuff goes wrong.

00:50:13.195 --> 00:50:14.320
DANA HAN-KLEIN: As it does.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.370
BILL NYE: Yeah.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.070
I mean, you get
two supercomputers

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:20.100
controlling nuclear weapons.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.330
Could've seen that coming.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.700
That's all I'm saying.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.540
Yes.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.690
Sorry.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.530
AUDIENCE: My name's Harrison
and I'm super nervous right now.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.780
BILL NYE: Bring it on, Harris.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.111
That's so flattering, man.

00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:30.610
Thank you.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.060
I'm just some guy.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.070
AUDIENCE: So recently Ted
Cruz became the chairman

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.910
for the Subcommittee on Space,
Science, and Competitiveness.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.680
And he's habitually tried
to cut funding to NASA.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.830
And this past week the Senate
voted on whether or not

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.592
they thought climate
change is a hoax.

00:50:45.592 --> 00:50:47.800
And overwhelmingly they said
that it wasn't, but they

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.940
came back and said, we can't
be so arrogant to think

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.700
that it's caused by humans.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.690
So in your opinion,
what would you say

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.530
is the best way to influence
policymakers to kind

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.730
of embrace science more?

00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.840
BILL NYE: OK.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.350
First of all, everybody,
you have to vote.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.430
All right?

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.669
You can run around, well,
my vote doesn't count,

00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:07.460
it's just one vote.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.070
I'm not going to vote.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.997
It's all you get.

00:51:10.997 --> 00:51:12.830
And for those of you
who don't want to vote,

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.810
would you just shut up
and let the rest of us

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.900
do what little what we can.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.790
So voting is usually popular.

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:25.010
And then these people
really respond to letters.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.780
And emails are effective,
but the letters

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.570
are really-- I've
been several times

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:35.580
to the Senate
Acceptance Office, which

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:41.380
is like an airstream
trailer-- it iis-- right

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.530
by the US Capitol.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.324
And they take the
letters and they

00:51:45.324 --> 00:51:46.740
take them to
someplace in Maryland

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.430
and irradiate them to kill any
anthrax and stuff like that.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.220
But they open every one of them.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.690
And so if you write to
those guys, they'll get it.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.990
But we have Jim
Inhofe, James Inhofe,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.240
who's written a book saying
climate change is a hoax,

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.160
as the head of the
Senate committee.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:06.660
Oh, god.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.790
Dude.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.240
And so we have to--
it's going to be

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.160
a near-run thing for humankind.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.740
I say this all the time.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.600
If United States were leading
the world in climate change,

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.140
there would not be this
whining about, well,

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.660
India's burning more coal than
they were allowed according

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:28.900
to the 1990 of the thing with
the stuff in paragraph seven.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.760
None of that would matter if the
US were out in front on this.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:36.800
So we gotta stay optimistic,
and just write letters and vote

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.120
to influence those people.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.445
And let us, in California,
for example, lead the way.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:51.130
We can pass laws
locally that will

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.200
be a model for the
rest of the country.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.750
You know, whatever
California does

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.150
with cars everybody follows.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:03.710
People in Ohio drive Futuras--
what else do we drive?

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.430
Malibus?

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:09.480
They drive places with
California place names

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.310
because California has this
reputation of not just cars,

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:18.420
but being, like,
free, like, wild.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.270
So if we--

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.260
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Mother earth, man.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.218
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:53:21.218 --> 00:53:24.980
If we pass local laws
here, we will lead the way.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.140
So let's do all that.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.894
Let's do everything all at once.

00:53:27.894 --> 00:53:29.310
Did I mentioned
the better battery

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.705
and desalination at
extremely low cost?

00:53:32.705 --> 00:53:33.705
That's a great question.

00:53:36.977 --> 00:53:39.560
AUDIENCE: Science education is
something that's clearly tricky

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.750
and that you've kind of set
the bar on in a lot of ways.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.970
So how can the average person
be a more effective advocate

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.345
of science and
science education?

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.454
BILL NYE: Do everything.

00:53:52.454 --> 00:53:53.620
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All at once.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:54.536
BILL NYE: All at once.

00:53:54.536 --> 00:53:56.810
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.680
Just embrace science.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.330
And if you meet students that
have questions, if you can,

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:02.980
take time to answer them.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.060
And of course don't
be a know-it-all.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.720
I mean, it's easy to say.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.440
Hard for me.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.430
I kid.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.820
I kid.

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.920
But embrace students, I guess.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.151
We were all young once,
and the young people today

00:54:20.151 --> 00:54:20.775
are the future.

00:54:20.775 --> 00:54:24.990
And we want to encourage them.

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.900
And you know, another
thing, you guys--

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.680
and you guys were probably
all these people--

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.180
but there's a big emphasis,
often, on nowadays

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.400
what's called gifted kids.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.600
You guys are probably
all gifted kids.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.990
Gifted kids are
going to be fine.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.100
It's everybody.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.910
We want to get
everybody to embrace

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.535
scientific method
and these discoveries

00:54:46.535 --> 00:54:49.330
that our ancestors made,
and this process by which we

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.880
know nature.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.620
So I would say celebrate
it in everything you do.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:59.360
Now I'm a bit of a maker,
gearhead, tinkerer.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.140
I got a feeling the
people in this room

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.470
sort of kick my ass at that.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.640
But it is fun.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.750
I have solar panels on my house.

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:11.770
It's just fun to get an
electric bill for $10.

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:12.420
It's just fun.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.820
I mean, whether you hate
it or not, it's just fun.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.250
So try stuff like that,
and you get your neighbors

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:19.230
talking about it.

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:22.990
And then you can engage people.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.270
So I'm thinking out loud, man.

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.300
It's a tough question.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.665
I don't have an easy answer.

00:55:28.665 --> 00:55:32.530
The longest journey,
single step.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.070
Yes.

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.840
No, it does.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.070
AUDIENCE: Hello, Bill Nye.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:37.720
My name is Tien.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:43.370
My question is, do you think
that mankind will eventually

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:46.770
move to space, where kids
are born and raised in space?

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.810
And if so, how much longer
do you think it will take?

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.389
BILL NYE: Now when you say
mankind, you mean humankind.

00:55:52.389 --> 00:55:53.180
I'm looking at you.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.045
I don't know you, but I think
you want to go humankind.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.200
So this is a great question.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.020
It leads to a bigger, higher
idea that I'm all into right

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.400
now.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.210
We grew up-- especially in the
US, we grew up with this idea

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:13.350
that you just keep going.

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.480
You just keep moving.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.750
In fact, humankind--
everybody's from East Africa.

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.240
Everybody.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.700
Let's go, we'll
go to Mesopotamia.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.120
Hey, we found some plants
that grow every year.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.870
Let's eat those.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.500
Cool.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.490
Wheat and corn and
all this stuff.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:29.990
OK.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.400
Cool.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:30.980
We'll stay here for awhile.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.010
It's nice here, but
I'm going to go.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.650
I hate you.

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.230
I'm going east.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.440
And then people
go across Eurasia,

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.800
and they end up in India.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.140
They get so out of hand they
end up in Alaska and then all

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.930
down North America, kicking
mammal butt all the way down,

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:51.757
eating everything.

00:56:51.757 --> 00:56:53.840
But we're not going to be
able to do that forever.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.196
We're going to run out of earth.

00:56:56.196 --> 00:56:57.570
And so I think
it's going to take

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:00.990
a change in our world view.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.500
Living and dying in space
sounds cool and romantic and

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.480
consistent with this,
let's spread out,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.050
let's take over the
world, the universe,

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.050
I mean the solar system.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.040
I think it's really difficult.

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.610
I mean, I'll give
you that humans

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.290
live in extraordinary places.

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:18.000
But everywhere-- I
mean, by our standards

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.040
here in northern California.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.640
Does everybody know the
motto of California?

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.022
The state motto, my
fellow Californians?

00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:26.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Eureka.

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.688
BILL NYE: Eureka.

00:57:27.688 --> 00:57:29.320
Yeah, I found it.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.750
So these European guys
come over the hill.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:37.390
Orange trees are like weeds and
the salmon are in the river.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.360
They're like in the
Sacramento River like this.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.100
It's all the protein
you'd ever want, right?

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.500
And it's so out of hand.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.000
In California the
rocks are made of gold.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.060
The thing is so crazy.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.330
But in zero gravity
on Mars, places

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.890
like that, it's not like that.

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:59.070
Like when you open the
spacecraft door on Mars,

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:01.680
you're going to
notice right away.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.797
Really cold, and
you can't breathe.

00:58:04.797 --> 00:58:05.880
You'll notice that, right?

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.390
That not breathing part.

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.940
You'll really be
focused on that.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.570
So it sounds
romantic, but I think

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:17.320
what our future is going to
be is exploring these places,

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.680
but nurturing, taking care
of ecosystems here on earth.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.620
This could be Bill the Hippie
talking, who's lost his way,

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.900
is an old curmudgeon.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:32.490
But living in space and having
babies in space-- making

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:35.320
babies, I think,
is probably cool.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.710
But having babies--
you know, there

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.290
was a couple on
the space shuttle,

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:43.020
and NASA's all, no comment.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.080
You've got to think, though.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.059
You've got to think.

00:58:47.059 --> 00:58:48.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Off-the-record experiments.

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:50.160
BILL NYE: So far.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.920
But maybe there'll be a "now
it can be told" someday,

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.219
some book.

00:58:55.219 --> 00:58:56.885
And I imagine there's
some complexities.

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:04.020
I've spent a lot
of time imagining.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.560
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
But back to humans.

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.660
BILL NYE: But I think it's
a lot harder than it looks.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.690
It is a cool thing to
ponder, what would it

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:14.786
be like to live in space?

00:59:14.786 --> 00:59:17.160
And I'll just tell you from
a science fiction standpoint,

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.090
"2001" is still a
cool movie where

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.270
they create a little bit
of artificial gravity.

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.536
When we go to Mars, I think
we're going to need to do that.

00:59:26.536 --> 00:59:28.160
Well, you can take
pills and everything

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.610
and exercise eight hours a day.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.380
I know, but I think we're
going to want to have something

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.840
that spins sooner or later.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.901
It's a great question.

00:59:35.901 --> 00:59:36.650
I don't know, man.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.340
Wo-man.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.296
BILL NYE: Tien, right?

00:59:39.296 --> 00:59:40.270
I don't know, Tien.

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.770
Yes.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.670
MALE SPEAKER: So
we have a question

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:45.300
from Googlers on
the live stream.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.210
Kathleen is
wondering, as a child

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.760
I participated in Mad
Science and really enjoyed

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.850
that experience, but didn't
find any programs like this

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.490
after middle school years.

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:56.060
What are some ways
you think science

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.560
can gain more participation
from high schoolers and beyond?

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.030
BILL NYE: You at Google
ought to have a program, man.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.850
I don't know, except
I do a job every year

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:11.560
for Toshiba and the National
Science Teachers Association.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.960
I'm not saying
this is a panacea.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.880
This is something
to think about.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.590
It's a scholarship program
called ExploraVision

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.850
where you have to come up
with an idea for an invention

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:26.130
that you think will come into
existence in the next 20 years.

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.490
And what's cool about it,
there are high school awards

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:35.030
akin to the Intel
Science Awards and so on.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.240
But it starts in kindergarten.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.835
So a program like
Mad Science that

01:00:40.835 --> 01:00:42.800
starts in kindergarten
through second grade,

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.110
then third through fifth, and
sixth through eighth, and then

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.630
high school, it's consistent
all the way through.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.300
So I guess here's
what I think, is

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.160
we should find ways to build
on existing things like Mad

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.300
Science.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.060
And I guess I would call on
a corporation like Google

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.820
to lead the way.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.200
I mean, heck, I had
sushi in the lunchroom

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.732
today, for crying out loud.

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:08.420
DANA HAN-KLEIN: In a boat?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.520
BILL NYE: In a boat.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.620
Yes, a miniature boat.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.220
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The sushi was
in a boat, not the people.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.120
BILL NYE: Yeah.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.860
Yeah, we weren't in a boat.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.180
No, it was solid ground.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.010
Yeah.

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.250
I mean, I get a little dizzy,
but it wasn't in a boat.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.740
But there's a miniature
boat on the table

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:29.320
with a miniature fishing net
with miniature fishing weights.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.050
It was cool.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:32.720
It was really cool,
and thank you.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.670
Really appreciate it.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.230
It was cool.

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.910
And what do you do
now when someone

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.210
serves you a meal like
that, what do you do?

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.100
Take a picture.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.600
I did.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.610
I took a picture.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:47.080
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
gotta keep hip, you know.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.538
BILL NYE: Yeah,
well, I do my best.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.380
I do my best.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.750
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But I think
that people like yourself,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.610
we're grateful for you
coming to places like Google.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.820
BILL NYE: Well, thank
you for inviting me.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.670
I love you guys.

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.532
It's so great.

01:01:58.532 --> 01:02:00.740
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Speaking
about the joys of education,

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.720
so I have two final questions.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.970
BILL NYE: Two final questions.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.180
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You talk
about how we all have

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.725
30,000 or so days on earth.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:08.350
BILL NYE: Yeah.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:08.950
Oh, man.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:09.700
You read the book.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.890
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I read the book.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.010
What do you want your
legacy from that to be?

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:17.825
Do you want it to be
combating climate change, or--

01:02:17.825 --> 01:02:18.450
BILL NYE: Yeah.

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:19.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:19.910
All right.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:20.980
Answered.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.450
BILL NYE: I want you guys
to cure cancer, I mean,

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.160
at some reasonable level.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.110
I don't think you can
cure every cancer.

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.520
There's some failure
modes out there.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.560
And then I'd like you to invent
a better battery, the water

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.660
desalinization.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.670
I would like you to raise
the standard of living

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.550
of women and girls.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.940
And the way to do that
is through education

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.890
so that the human population
naturally starts to go down.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.800
And you guys, I mean,
this is so sweet.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.880
Anyway, we're all playing
the hand we're dealt, right?

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.420
So I was born at a
time, in the 1950s,

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.160
and one of the things
that's very troubling when

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.460
you get to be my
age is you realize

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.730
that you're going to die.

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:08.790
I went through many
years pretty sure

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:13.610
that everybody else was getting
older and was going to die,

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.770
but I was fine.

01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:20.540
But is anybody familiar
with the game of rugby?

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.320
Rugby football?

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.950
Yeah, so unlike US
football-- which we can all

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.440
have a whole nother discussion
about whatever they're

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.420
doing-- but can't throw
the ball forward in rugby.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:39.900
So I often think of
this metaphor as,

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.520
what you do is you
run with the ball.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.550
You try to get as many defenders
to come after you as possible,

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:47.770
and then throw it to
the next guy in the line

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:51.600
so that he's got an open field
and can advance the ball.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.850
So I'm doing my best
to throw the ball

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:59.480
of scientific discovery and
understanding to you guys

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.410
so that you can advance
it down the field of life.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:05.550
Wow, man.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.640
And with that I
just have to add,

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.270
as a guy who got a job at
Boeing out of engineering school

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:14.310
and lived in Seattle for 26
years, I just have to say,

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.150
go Seahawks.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:19.660
I'm sorry, people.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.250
So did you see the game?

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.729
You don't have to know anything
about-- what is going on?

01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:25.270
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Some
sloppy football.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.410
Some sloppy football.

01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:29.600
BILL NYE: 19 to nothing, and the
guy, I'll throw it like this.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.860
And some guy catches it.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.000
And we're going to kick a
field goal like Charlie Brown

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.410
and Lucy.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.810
And then no, we're
going to-- what?

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:39.860
That's not fair.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.400
Well, I'm sorry.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.470
And then how many people
have ever caught an onside

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.930
kick ever in foot-- ever?

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.640
Then they did that too.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.190
It was a cool game, you guys.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.220
You can hate football,
you can hate me,

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.540
you can hate everything.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.690
But it really was exciting.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:02.040
And I know the Packers--
it's a team from-- there's

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.597
a team from Wisconsin.

01:05:03.597 --> 01:05:05.430
DANA HAN-KLEIN: They
play American football.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.700
BILL NYE: Named after
guys who slaughter meat,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.820
the Green Bay meat packers.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.010
That's what it came from.

01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:13.600
They have a huge franchise.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.390
But the kooky little
backwater Seattle Seahawks

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.391
beat them in crazy fashion,
and it was exciting.

01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:20.973
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I don't know if
it's fair to call the Seahawks

01:05:20.973 --> 01:05:22.160
backwater anymore.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.330
They're pretty successful now.

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:29.280
BILL NYE: There's a company
called Microsoft up there.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.420
You guys, I just want to remind
you as an old Boeing employee,

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.020
airplanes are big and
they cost a lot of money.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.320
At least when I worked
there, the Boeing

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.820
payroll in the Seattle
area, in King County,

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.020
Boeing payroll was
bigger than Microsoft.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.330
Not the Boeing profit, but
it's sobering to think.

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:57.830
I mean.

01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.980
I love my software as
much as the next guy.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.584
But big things that do
stuff are cool also.

01:06:04.584 --> 01:06:06.000
Well, you guys,
thank you so much.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.760
Is it time to wrap and
go sit and sign books?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.000
DANA HAN KLEIN:
I think so, yeah.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.240
BILL NYE: Thank you so much.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thank you
so much for being here.
