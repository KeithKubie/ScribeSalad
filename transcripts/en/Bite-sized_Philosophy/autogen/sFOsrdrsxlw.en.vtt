00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.290 align:start position:0%
up that's easy because the consequences
 

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.069 align:start position:0%
up that's easy because the consequences
of<00:12:40.410><c> not</c><00:12:40.589><c> speaking</c><00:12:40.890><c> up</c><00:12:41.250><c> although</c><00:12:42.060><c> delayed</c><00:12:42.660><c> are</c>

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
far worse that's the reason that's the
 

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.650 align:start position:0%
far worse that's the reason that's the
reason<00:12:46.320><c> if</c><00:12:46.440><c> it</c><00:12:47.190><c> can't</c><00:12:47.430><c> be</c><00:12:47.550><c> courage</c><00:12:48.060><c> it</c><00:12:48.450><c> could</c>

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
reason if it can't be courage it could
