well any any genetic disorder is an

well any any genetic disorder is an
 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.379
well any any genetic disorder is an
interaction with the environment so I

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389
interaction with the environment so I
 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.259
interaction with the environment so I
don't exclude environment I just don't

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269
don't exclude environment I just don't
 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.220

see yet any strong evidence for a

see yet any strong evidence for a
 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.089
see yet any strong evidence for a
particular environmental factor I think

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099
particular environmental factor I think
 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.710
particular environmental factor I think
that one could do studies for example

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720
that one could do studies for example
 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.589
that one could do studies for example
one could go to third world countries

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599
one could go to third world countries
 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.810
one could go to third world countries
and do a study and ask is the rate of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
and do a study and ask is the rate of
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.020
and do a study and ask is the rate of
autism they are the same as it is in the

autism they are the same as it is in the
 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.840
autism they are the same as it is in the

certainly could be done that would

certainly could be done that would
 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.599
certainly could be done that would
answer that question but certainly

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609
answer that question but certainly
 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.590

development of an organism has an
environmental component to it but you

can only study that when there's when

there's some evidence which enables you

there's some evidence which enables you
 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.329
there's some evidence which enables you
to isolate that environmental component

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339
to isolate that environmental component

I think the vaccine studies have been

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989
I think the vaccine studies have been
 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.810
I think the vaccine studies have been
now largely discredited

they took mercury out of the vaccine and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650
they took mercury out of the vaccine and
 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.400
they took mercury out of the vaccine and
this rates of autism didn't change and

this rates of autism didn't change and
 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.920
this rates of autism didn't change and
now of the 12 all authors of the

that the age at which parents begin to

that the age at which parents begin to
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.010
that the age at which parents begin to
recognize autism and their children

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
recognize autism and their children
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.350

they receive vaccinations that's the
 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.450

many parents of autistic children say

many parents of autistic children say
 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900
many parents of autistic children say
that they could tell very early on that

there's something wrong with your child

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019
there's something wrong with your child
 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.350
there's something wrong with your child
there are about a quarter of the cases

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360
there are about a quarter of the cases
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.660
there are about a quarter of the cases
of autism where it looks like the child

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670
of autism where it looks like the child

in the parents opinion has been

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
in the parents opinion has been
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.700
in the parents opinion has been
developing normally and then

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
developing normally and then
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.820
developing normally and then
to their mind suddenly goes off course

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
to their mind suddenly goes off course
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.840
to their mind suddenly goes off course
and I think at least 5% of cases it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
and I think at least 5% of cases it's
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.850
and I think at least 5% of cases it's
it's been very well documented that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
it's been very well documented that
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.620
it's been very well documented that
actually a child has begun to lose gains

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630
actually a child has begun to lose gains
 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.330
actually a child has begun to lose gains
that they have made so there is this

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
that they have made so there is this
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.460
that they have made so there is this
component that's very tragic when parent

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
component that's very tragic when parent
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.530
component that's very tragic when parent
feels relieved that they've gotten

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
feels relieved that they've gotten
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.660
feels relieved that they've gotten
through and I think every parent who has

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
through and I think every parent who has
 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.230
through and I think every parent who has
a child suffers through nightmares that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240
a child suffers through nightmares that
 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.600
a child suffers through nightmares that
you know hoping that their child will be

you know hoping that their child will be
 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.020
you know hoping that their child will be
healthy and they give birth to a healthy

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
healthy and they give birth to a healthy

the child suddenly stops developing

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470
the child suddenly stops developing
 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.610
the child suddenly stops developing
that's tragedy of horrendous proportions

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
that's tragedy of horrendous proportions
 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.770
that's tragedy of horrendous proportions
and it's natural for the parents of such

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
and it's natural for the parents of such
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.270
and it's natural for the parents of such
children to look around for the possible

at almost any particular age for example
 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.880

there are class of disorders that are

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890
there are class of disorders that are
 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.010
there are class of disorders that are
called storage disorders where the child

thing that they eat every day builds up
 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.710
thing that they eat every day builds up
to a point and then begins to poison the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720
to a point and then begins to poison the
 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.250
to a point and then begins to poison the
brain and these in these cases a child

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260
brain and these in these cases a child
 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.750

will develop normally up to a certain

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760
will develop normally up to a certain
 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.020
will develop normally up to a certain
age and then will often regress and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
age and then will often regress and
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.070
age and then will often regress and
sometimes will died so the idea that you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080
sometimes will died so the idea that you
 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.740
sometimes will died so the idea that you
know you can't have sudden onset of an

know you can't have sudden onset of an
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.900

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.420
illness when the child's 2 or 3 is is
just as wrong if there were you know

vaccinations you know that would be
something that one could study but in

something that one could study but in

something that one could study but in
the absence of evidence for that you

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
the absence of evidence for that you
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.250
the absence of evidence for that you
have to ask yourself well what should we

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260
have to ask yourself well what should we
 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.080
have to ask yourself well what should we
be looking for should it be the plastic

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090
be looking for should it be the plastic
 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.560
be looking for should it be the plastic

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.610
