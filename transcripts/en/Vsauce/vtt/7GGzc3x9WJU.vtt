00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.382
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about why we dream.

00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:07.129
What's going on inside our brains?

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.264
The scientific study of dreaming is called oneriology.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.190
And for most of history, it didn't really exist,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.811
because you can't hold a dream.

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:19.818
It's difficult to measure a dream, you can't taste it.

00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.317
You can't see other people's dreams,

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:24.277
and if you ask them to tell you what they dreamt,

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:27.244
the results are almost always unreliable.

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:31.541
In fact, it's estimated that we forget 85 percent

00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:35.574
of the dreams we have, especially within the first ten minutes of having them.

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:39.546
But then, in 1952, something amazing happened.

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:43.620
Researchers at the University of Chicago found this.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.673
It's a unique type of electrical activity

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:50.634
that occurs during a certain stage of a person sleeping.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.519
When researchers awoke people during this stage,

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.852
they almost always reported that they had been dreaming.

00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:01.311
Also, at the same time, during this stage, people's eyeballs are going crazy,

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.440
rapidly darting all over the place underneath their eyelids.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.904
You can actually see this happening if
you watch people sleep like I usually do.

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:10.911
During REM sleep, some pretty bizarre stuff happens.

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.207
If you look at the electrical activity of a brain

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:16.244
that is in REM sleep, it almost exactly mimics

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:18.459
the way the brain acts when it's awake.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.207
The biggest difference being that the production of chemicals inside the brain

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:25.550
like norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.835
is almost completely blocked,

00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:30.477
and that causes the muscles to stop moving,

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:33.504
which is why you can dream about flying or running around

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.521
or fighting ninjas, but your body doesn't move.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.270
People who have a disorder achieving complete REM atopia

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.891
move around in their sleep and act out their dreams.

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.816
They can even get out of bed and sleep walk.

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:48.326
Oh, before we move forward, I should say two things.

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:52.531
One is that it's possible to wake up and not be able to move your body

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.284
because you're still in REM atopia.

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:57.377
You're completely conscious and you know that you're awake,

00:01:57.377 --> 00:01:59.419
but your body is not ready to move.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.086
On the flip side, you can also be inside a dream

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.250
and know that you're dreaming.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.003
This phenomenon is known as lucid dreaming,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.375
and it's particularly attractive, because
while in an illusive dream,

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.220
I can make conscious decisions about what I do.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.395
I can go fly to wherever I want, or I can
have a tea party with Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:23.190
I'm in control, but achieving illusive dream is quite illusive.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.729
Howcast has a great video, which
I've put in the description

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.401
that gives some tips and tricks on how to achieve one.

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:34.364
Researchers were able to deprive
mice of REM sleep by using this

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:38.915
inverted inside a tub of water way up to the tippy top,

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.373
meaning that the mouse was only able to sit

00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:44.086
right on top of this little tiny surface.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:48.170
When that happens, the mouse can still
fall into non-REM sleep,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.760
but as soon as they reach REM sleep
and their muscles relax,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.715
they fall off the platform into
the water waking up.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.727
What they found was that when mice
are not allowed to achieve REM sleep,

00:02:57.727 --> 00:02:59.729
they have an incredibly amount of trouble

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.598
remembering things.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.315
This happens in humans too.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:06.403
If you have people remember word pairs and then you don't allow them to sleep,

00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:09.775
the next day, their memory for that stuff is incredibly terrible.

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.396
But memory and REM does not stop there.

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.119
If a person learns a difficult new task during the day,

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.288
say a new instrument or a new type
of difficult puzzle,

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:20.787
you can measure the electrical activity in their brain

00:03:20.787 --> 00:03:23.876
while they do that, and then while they sleep that night,

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:27.045
whether they know it or not, their brain replays

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:29.341
those electronic impulses.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.505
Many popular theories about why we dream

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.258
are variations on the idea that while we sleep,

00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:37.844
the unconscious part of our
brain is busy organizing memories,

00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:41.350
and strengthening connections from the day before that we need in the future

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.265
while getting rid of the junk that would otherwise clog the brain.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.480
Now, so the theory goes,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.847
these electrical impulses are detected by

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:51.737
our conscious brain, and our cortex freaks out.

00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:56.106
It doesn't know what it means, and so it tries its best to create a cohesive story,

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:58.533
creating a dream.

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:02.201
This would explain why dreams are often so
fantastic and seemingly random.

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.711
They're not supposed to make sense,
they're  not an actual message from our brain.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.008
It's just the results of our cortexes trying to synthesize the noise

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.005
coming from all the work being done back in the unconsciousness.

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:17.002
Under this way of thinking, dreams are an epiphenomenon.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:19.846
They're not a primary process that has a purpose.

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:23.555
Instead, they're the accidental result
of a more important process

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.226
going on behind the conscious brain.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:28.360
But some researchers don't believe that.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.529
They believe the dreams serve a primary purpose,

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:34.648
and that purpose is to prepare us for threats.

00:04:34.648 --> 00:04:40.205
They think this because the most prevalent emotions felt during dreams are negative.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:44.665
Abandonment, anger, and the most common of all, anxiety.

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:48.789
Theory goes like this: back when we were early humans especially,

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.877
we had no idea what kind of threats we might encounter during the day.

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:53.878
And so, to prepare us,

00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:56.966
our brain would simulate anxieties while we slept

00:04:56.966 --> 00:05:00.847
to make us better prepared for that feeling in the real world.

00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:02.757
So people who had terrifying dreams

00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:05.642
were better at dealing with anxiety in the real world,

00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:07.684
and had stronger genes.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:10.894
All right, so the theories we discussed today are quite popular,

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.986
but they don't really enjoy a consensus.

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:15.943
Not everyone agrees on them, and they barely scratch the surface

00:05:15.943 --> 00:05:18.076
of scientific thought about dreams.

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:20.992
But that's kind of the cool thing about dreams.

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:22.983
Think of it like this.

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:26.873
Here is the eagle nebula—a giant structure in outer space

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:29.830
6,500 light years away.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.333
Despite its distance, we pretty much
know what it's made out of.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.964
We know that it's 100 trillion kilometers tall,

00:05:35.964 --> 00:05:40.515
we know what caused it, and we know
where it's going to be in 750 million years.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:43.471
But last night, I had dreams,

00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:47.514
and no one really knows why or for what reason.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:51.019
And that's pretty cool, and that's why—
thanks for watching.

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.568
If you want to learn more about the world, I highly recommend

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:04.276
Smarter Every Day, it's a show here on YouTube
by a guy named Destin

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:06.541
who I've met, he's awesome, I've learned a lot from him.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.908
He's the guy who did the chicken thing
from the lean back.

00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:11.539
He's also studied what causes poop splash,

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.876
slow motion water balloons,

00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:16.832
and has a lot of guns and explosions.
