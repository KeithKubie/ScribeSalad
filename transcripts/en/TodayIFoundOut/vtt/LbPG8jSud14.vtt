00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.369
The man behind Project Pigeon was famed American
behaviorist and Harvard professor B.F. Skinner,

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.250
who teamed with the U.S. Army to develop such
a system.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.570
Pigeons were trained using operant conditioning,
a type of learning pioneered by Skinner in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259
1937 where behavior is modified by its consequences.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.259
In operant conditioning, the initial behavior
is spontaneous, but when it is either rewarded

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.259
or punished, that behavior is either reinforced
or inhibited.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.059
In this case, Skinner rewarded pigeons for
pecking an image on a screen to get them conditioned

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.059
to do it.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.170
Skinner then designed a nose cone for missiles
that had three windows for the pigeon (or

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.660
up to three pigeons in some tests) to look
through.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.829
Via the flight control system and a metal
piece on the nose of the pigeon(s) to detect

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.550
a peck, the pecking of the windows would result
in the missile changing course, depending

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.800
on which window was pecked and where on the
window the pecking happened.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.339
The pigeons were then trained to peck such
that the target, whatever object the pigeon

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.950
was conditioned to go for, stayed centered
in front of the missile.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.370
The National Defense Research Committee was
skeptical of pigeons guiding missiles, but

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.920
contributed $25,000 (about $321,000 today)
toward research into it anyway.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.200
Even with this support, Skinner’s idea was
considered eccentric and there were few in

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.750
power who would take him seriously.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.880
However, in simulation, the pigeons, who can
process visual information roughly three times

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.990
faster than humans, were remarkably good at
guiding the missile straight to the target

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.300
once they were trained, rarely missing in
the simulator.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.680
Despite this, Project Pigeon was canceled
in October of 1944 due to the belief of Army

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.090
decision-makers that investing more time and
money into it would delay the development

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
of other projects that had more promise of
being successful.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.259
There was also, of course, some unease in
entrusting the guidance of a missile to a

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.259
bird.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.280
As Skinner stated, the problem was not that
the system didn’t work when tested in the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.210
simulator, it was that “no one would take
us seriously.”

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.950
That wasn’t the end of Project Pigeon though.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.990
It was brought back by the Navy in 1948, only
this time called Project Orcon, for “Organic

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.990
Control.”

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:25.180
It was canceled again in 1953 thanks to advancements
in electronic guidance systems.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:39.459
bat-bombBat Bombs were another experimental
weapon considered by the U.S. during World

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.650
War II, at the suggestion of a Dentist, Dr.
Lytle Adams who was a friend of the First

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.650
Lady.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.870
These bombs consisted of a bomb-shaped casing
with several compartments inside.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.090
Each compartment housed a Mexican Free-tailed
bat.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.129
Each bat had a small incendiary device attached
to it.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.410
The casings were refrigerated in order to
lower the bat’s body temperature and force

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.530
them into hibernation until they were dropped
from a plane shortly before dawn.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.959
A parachute would slow the descent and eventually
the casing would be triggered to open and

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.360
release the bats.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.500
As bats in sunlight would seek roosts in dark
places like attics, when they were released

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.519
and the Sun came out, they’d seek such places.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.700
The hope was that with the incendiaries timed
to go off all at once, this would start fires

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.640
in places that were hard to access to fight
a fire.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.370
Further, in many cases, the fire’s existence
wouldn’t be noticed until it had well established

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.370
itself.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.340
It was thought that bat bombs would be particularly
effective in Japan where buildings were made

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.049
largely of wood and paper.

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.700
Release several hundred thousand of these
bats in major Japanese cities and the towns

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.629
would go up in flames while resulting in much
smaller losses of life than by carpet bombing

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.670
or a (later) nuclear strike.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.120
Essentially, it would help take out the infrastructure
while minimizing civilian casualties.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.739
While on the surface this plan may seem farfetched,
the U.S. agreed to develop the Bat Bomb for

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.989
four reasons: bats are available in large
numbers (four caves in New Mexico alone are

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.319
each believed to be the home to millions of
bats); bats can carry more than their own

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.810
weight in flight (up to three times their
weight); bats can hibernate for extended periods

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.680
without need of food or water; and finally,
bats fly in the dark, then find secluded places

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.910
to hide at sunrise.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.900
The program was actually mildly successful
in a bad way.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.370
During testing, some of the bats with incendiary
devices attached escaped, resulting in a large

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.900
part of the base they were being tested at,
Carlsbad Army Airfield Auxiliary Air Base,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900
burning down.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.900
(As seen in the above picture.)

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.889
The results in the controlled testing were
also very promising and it seemed like this

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.479
would actually work well.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.870
In fact, it was estimated that while standard
incendiary bombs would probably start about

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.430
167-400 fires per bomb load in a major Japanese
city, based on the testing, the bat bombs

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.230
would probably produce about 3,625-4,748 fires
per load.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.750
Further, just ten B-24 bombers could carry
an astounding 1,040,000 bats strapped with

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.870
the 17-28 gram incendiary devices.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.550
However, the program was cancelled, as with
the pigeons not because it didn’t work,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.860
but for other reasons.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.310
In this case, it was estimated that the bats
would not be ready for deployment until mid-1945.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.120
Despite the promising results in testing,
the program was considered to be moving too

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.639
slowly, and, with an estimated $2 million
invested in it (about $25.7 million today),

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.889
too expensively.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.000
Instead, the Manhattan Project was deemed
a more likely candidate for ending the war

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.500
sooner, as it was thought to be progressing
quicker and certainly would have a more dramatic

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.410
effect if it was ultimately successful.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.490
Both for the historical novelty of ending
WWII with literal bat bombs and for avoiding

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.539
having to use a nuclear weapon in war and
the massive loss of life that ensued, I think

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.020
we can all, except for maybe the bats, agree
that it’s too bad the timetable on the bat

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.410
bomb project was considered too long.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.430
For reference, Little Boy and Fat Man were
deployed on August sixth and ninth of 1945

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.430
respectively.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.760
So at the original timetable, the bats would
have been ready sooner had the project continued

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.780
to be funded.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.030
Pigeons were also used as messengers during
both World Wars.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.250
The U.S. and United Kingdom created special
pigeon service units with tens of thousands

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.250
of birds.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.270
One pigeon, nicknamed Gustav but officially
known as bird NPS.42.31066, flew over 150

00:06:24.270 --> 00:07:07.939
miles to England on D-Day to deliver a message
about the Normandy landings.
