You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
N y. S. E. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.230
Hey, I'm Chad. I'm Rod. I'm Robert [inaudible].

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.320
This is radio lab and our show today is about, uh,

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.340
being witnessed to something that's actually not something you really choose to

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.980
witness. Yeah. You feel like, should I be seeing this?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.340
This is a story that for me speaks to like what it's like to live in a city.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.250
When you look out the window, we're still,

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.230
we're all so jammed together that suddenly you're seeing into the lives of

10
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.520
somebody else through their window and you just kind of fall into it without

11
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:38.410
even wanting to in this particular tale. It,

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.890
what is observed is so surprising.

13
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.800
And so for its tenderness and for its quiet love that we,

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.750
it's a rare thing to see.

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.810
So we wanted to send it your way from our friends over at Radiotopia,

16
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.180
Nick Vanderkolk and Brendan Baker. So here we go.

17
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.470
This is how their story begins.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.890
So I'd been living in my apartment about 15 years and one evening I walked in

19
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.540
the living room, which has three bay windows,

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
which faced the gardens in the back and over half a block of gardens and across

21
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:20.241
a small street there was this bright window that I'd never noticed before,

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120
but it's at the exact eye level of my third floor apartment.

23
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.080
And after awhile I realized that I'd never seen it because there had always been

24
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.660
curtains and so it was always, I think dimly lit.

25
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:37.770
The curtains were often closed and all of a sudden there's this bright light and

26
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.080
no curtains and it was like a movie screen

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.970
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.820
<v 0>15 years and that window is meant nothing.</v>

29
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.270
I haven't even noticed it. I know it's all I think about it.

30
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.910
There were new tenants and it had always been a living room and now it was

31
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:05.840
suddenly a bedroom.

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.560
And there were these two people in there and they were naked.

33
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.290
This young couple in their twenties they were really lovey dovie and they were

34
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.220
always naked.

35
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
That's Diane Wiper who tells the story and she told it to radio reporter Brianna

36
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.650
Breen who produced this piece with Nick and Brendan.

37
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.040
The thing is they pushed their bed so that the head was up against the windows.

38
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.160
So their heads,

39
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.660
you could see the both of their heads lying there so you'd see things that you

40
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.280
just like. They were just shocking.

41
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.340
I just had been there all of this time and suddenly you could see people having

42
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:47.720
sex really clearly, like, like amazingly clearly.

43
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320
I had no idea that you could see so well across a such a distance and it was

44
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:55.970
really uncomfortable.

45
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660
My husband and I were still adjusting to parenthood and it wasn't the most

46
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.660
romantic time in our, in our lives.

47
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.330
And my son was probably three.

48
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.900
And when your new parents to a toddler,

49
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.500
especially because he sleeps in the bed with us too.

50
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.450
So he's like literally right between us.

51
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.880
The last thing you need is a couple of hotties getting it on across the window,

52
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.880
reminding your husband of everything he's getting.

53
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.270
So to have this really beautiful young woman that was really thin and,

54
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.430
and, and naked all the time, really, you know,

55
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.390
it was very frustrating. And, and, and you know, she had this beautiful tall,

56
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.790
lanky, well-built boyfriends. And so I first, I just,

57
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.530
because I felt like my husband was going to be staring at this naked woman all

58
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.230
the time, I started closing the Living Room curtains,

59
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.220
which is really kind of silly and it made our room really dark and we never

60
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.440
closed those curtains. And so that didn't work.

61
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.420
So I thought about like making a really big sign that said like,

62
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.090
close your curtains or buy curtains.

63
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.600
They didn't even have curtains by curtains. We can see you.

64
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.760
And I thought about going by their building.

65
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.900
I had no idea what their unit was and leaving a note.

66
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.210
And then I started thinking that was really silly and prudish and started

67
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.330
realizing that they were just young and I had to just get over it and live with

68
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.800
it and move on. And so that's what I did.

69
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.803
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

70
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.250
<v 0>we got really used to them and then they became sort of the symbol of what we</v>

71
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:44.670
used to be, you know,

72
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.900
in our twenties and they were living this really carefree time.

73
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.390
And that's another thing that it was kind of hard not to.

74
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.710
Sometimes when you're an early parenthood you get a little bitter.

75
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.150
I think out some of those freedoms and we'd watch them sleeping till 11 while

76
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.340
we'd been up since five with our toddler and,

77
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.910
and we saw them eating breakfast on the roof together.

78
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.150
So we got used to it and we, we knew we would notice like, oh look,

79
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:11.100
they got a new, you know, plant in there.

80
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.680
And they became sort of part of our lives, you know,

81
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.910
because they were just always there and never ever bought curtains.

82
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.130
Do you think all the neighbors in your building and the surrounding buildings

83
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.910
also saw this? It's funny.

84
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.010
I think that the way that we are positioned,

85
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.990
because all of the buildings around us are different sizes and our building is

86
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:36.360
the tallest one on our block.

87
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.740
But it's exactly at the right level to see there.

88
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.103
Their windows.

89
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.350
I have a friend next door and then a friend across the way and all of them have

90
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.860
windows facing the gardens, but all of them are blocked.

91
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.090
And I look at the other windows of the buildings around us and I don't think

92
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.830
anyone has this perfect level view.

93
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.930
The irony is that I'm such a private person and I don't know,

94
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.340
am I supposed to have maybe respected their privacy and just looked away,

95
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.420
but it's impossible because that's the way the chairs face face the window.

96
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:15.260
I couldn't, I couldn't not see them if I wanted to,

97
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.290
but I guess I could have not gotten the binoculars

98
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.510
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

99
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.370
<v 0>so time went by, and this is maybe a year and a half later, two years later.</v>

100
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.750
And I remember seeing their room and the light was on, but it was empty.

101
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.280
And I thought that was strange cause it was five o'clock in the morning and they

102
00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:48.690
never went anywhere early. And it was like that for like a whole week.

103
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.850
It was just this empty room with the light on.

104
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.850
And I thought that was strange.

105
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.280
They didn't seem to be there as often or maybe it's just she would be there and

106
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:03.060
he was gone for long periods of time and we just kind of forgot about them,

107
00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:05.000
you know, we just, there were there, they were,

108
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.150
there wasn't as much action going on and they weren't as present and so we just

109
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:14.151
kind of lived our lives and forgot about them for maybe seven or eight months.

110
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.180
At the end of last year in December,

111
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.940
there was this night when my husband and I separately had both seen this woman

112
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.560
naked sitting in the window,

113
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.190
kind of chubby slump shouldered woman who was just looking down at the street.

114
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.920
And we both thought it was so strange,

115
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.020
she just couldn't figure out who she was and what she was doing and why she was

116
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:42.854
naked.

117
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.950
And a few nights later there was this young man standing right at the window by

118
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:53.360
the bed and he was skeletal.

119
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.680
He was so thin and he was bald completely.

120
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.600
And we realized it was the same couple.

121
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.480
They had completely changed

122
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.120
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

123
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.280
<v 0>he was sick. There was something serious wrong with him.</v>

124
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

125
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.480
<v 0>after that, I just watched the window all the time.</v>

126
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.300
<v 5>Okay, we're going to, we're going to pause it right here. Um, let's just,</v>

Let's get back to our story from Brianna Brene and the folks that love and radio

153
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.570
and Nick Vanderkolk and Brendan Baker.

154
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.040
So we're just going to go back to the room.

155
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 7>See, see what's what we can see through them to</v>

156
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.580
<v 0>window. Here's Diane wiper.</v>

157
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.730
I just watched the window all the time and he would sit all day.

158
00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:31.540
He was there because I work from home and I would see him all day in the

159
00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:34.480
bedroom, either lying down or sitting at the computer.

160
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.590
And then after a couple of weeks he was just lying down and he was just there

161
00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:44.230
and his bald head would be, um,

162
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.610
up against the pane of glass all the time.

163
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.350
And she would be there and she'd come in and she would bring him things,

164
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.050
but mostly it was just him there by himself.

165
00:10:56.051 --> 00:11:00.790
And sometimes he would have like his knees bent and you could just see how, uh,

166
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.220
skeletal they were. They were just bones.

167
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.080
And sometimes he'd kick off the blankets and he was just lying there naked and

168
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.933
he may C8 it.

169
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.470
And then after awhile he was just always burrowed under the blankets.

170
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.460
I found myself thinking like, well,

171
00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:23.230
maybe he's been through chemo and he's recovering and you know,

172
00:11:23.231 --> 00:11:27.100
he's going through this, um, this sick phase before he gets, well,

173
00:11:27.101 --> 00:11:30.100
because he's so young. He's in it, you know, he's just such a young guy.

174
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.620
And so we had to go to Colorado to see my family for Christmas.

175
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.950
And, um, I worried all the time I was there.

176
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:44.950
I W I thought about them and I worried that he wasn't going to be there when we

177
00:11:44.951 --> 00:11:47.890
got back. I'd worried all the time about it.

178
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.050
When we got back about 10 days later, um, he was still,

179
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.830
but his head looked so much smaller and um,

180
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.200
and there were a lot of people there. And then,

181
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.330
and then I got out my binoculars, I got my birding binoculars.

182
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.390
I'm not proud of it, but at that point I felt so invested.

183
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.660
It looked like people coming to say goodbye.

184
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.490
And there was this sort of short, um,

185
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.350
blonde Midwestern looking woman who I guessed was his mother.

186
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.390
And then there was this young guy who just kept pacing the halls. You know,

187
00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:41.570
you could just see through our two doorways leading out of this room and you

188
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:44.960
could just see him go down one side and through the other and then back and

189
00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:48.110
forth and back and forth. And I figured he was the brother

190
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.540
and it looked like the girlfriend's sister was also there. It was just,

191
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.180
it was just a guest looked like her.

192
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.970
I remember there was just this little gathering going on in the living room

193
00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:07.971
right below the neighbors were standing around and having drinks and they had no

194
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:11.040
idea at all what was going on right upstairs.

195
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.670
I would watch people come and go. Then after awhile,

196
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.250
everyone left except for the girlfriend and the mother. And,

197
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.920
and I spent, and I spent, uh, all that evening,

198
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.010
like sitting vigil in the back of the couch and,

199
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.150
and watching. And,

200
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.000
and I remember the girlfriend lying beside him for a long time on her own,

201
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:43.080
and she was just stroking his face so tenderly. It was,

202
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.440
it was so much affection that really transcends the kind of young love that you

203
00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:53.730
expect. That's all I could see was the top of his head all that time.

204
00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.470
And I remember later seeing her standing by the bed when the mother on the other

205
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:06.670
side, and they were just all talking and she put a hand on his forehead,

206
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.850
put the back of her hand on his forehead, and then she was wiping at her eyes.

207
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.310
And you could tell that there was this,

208
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.330
that there was this sense that something that it was getting closer,

209
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.120
then I could see this reckoning.

210
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.910
Where's she,

211
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.460
she was wiping at her eyes and touching his forehead and wiping at her eyes.

212
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:31.294
And [inaudible]

213
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.110
there were candles lit. And,

214
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.950
and this, um,

215
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:46.550
young woman was on one side and his mother was on the other side

216
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.510
and they just were lying there for a really time and they had their hands just

217
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:55.760
resting on his chest.

218
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.300
And so I watched it for a long time.

219
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.140
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

220
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.740
<v 0>the mother and the girlfriend were lying on either side of him and you could</v>

221
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:13.490
tell it was his, this was the end. I thought.

222
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.820
Now all that's left is the girlfriend and the mother and inexplicably me

223
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:23.480
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.961
<v 0>me.</v>

225
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.961
Like I'm one of the three people at the deathbed and they lay there for a long

226
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:34.010
time and then they just got up and they went into the other room

227
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.200
and I realized that must've been the moment.

228
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.650
And all this time, you know, I always had this sense that, you know, they're,

229
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.940
they're gonna break up, they're gonna move out.

230
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.100
Nobody that age stays together very long.

231
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.130
And I had no idea. It was just like this beautiful love story.

232
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.453
[inaudible].

233
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.700
So the next day,

234
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.440
the next day I got up and I went to the window first thing and they were folding

235
00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:20.431
up blankets and stacking them on the bed and I figured that he had been taken

236
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.440
away. And so I was in the kitchen and my husband called because he had,

237
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.240
he knew how obsessed I had gotten with this situation and he said,

238
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.070
there's activity over there.

239
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.020
And I came running and I got my binoculars and I looked and,

240
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.400
and realized that he was still there. He was still on the bed. Um,

241
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.500
his body was still there and it was the coroner.

242
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.870
So the coroner and his assistant came and they had these white plastic gloves on

243
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.500
and they pulled his body to the edge of the bed and onto this white sheet.

244
00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:03.310
And I just remember the, the life lessness of it. It looked so shrunken.

245
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.700
It almost looked like a shrunken rubber proxy of a body,

246
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.440
so incredibly dead.

247
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:18.090
They wrapped him in the sheet and they zipped him into a vinyl bag and they put

248
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:21.370
him on this kind of Gurney.

249
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.850
They took the Gurney out and I just had this very strange impulse and I ran in,

250
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.690
threw on my coat,

251
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.760
kind of over my pajamas and ran out to the street and ran to the corner.

252
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.560
And I got there just as they were hauling him out,

253
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:42.700
they were carrying him out and the girlfriend was there.

254
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.330
She was talking to one of them in the doorway and they loaded him into this van.

255
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.540
And I realized that they didn't know me at all.

256
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.450
Like I had, you know, I had no place to be there.

257
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.270
And they looked at me,

258
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:05.271
I remembered the coroner's assistant and looking at me like I was sort of like a

259
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.180
rubber Necker on the street, you know, looking at this grizzly scene.

260
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.160
And I realized that that's what I was, I had no place to be there.

261
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.200
And suddenly it all felt so perverse.

262
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.520
And so I went home and I felt very strange about the whole thing.

263
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.930
Um, and I tried to tell myself that, well,

264
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:30.290
I never want it to be part of their lives. I want it.

265
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.160
I was the one that wanted them to put up curtains.

266
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:35.370
I wanted them to just shut the intimate stuff out. I,

267
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.180
I was uncomfortable with it. I was the one that wanted out.

268
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.480
And I started remembering all of a sudden the,

269
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.720
when I moved to that apartment so many years ago,

270
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.050
and I was in my mid twenties that I had to share the apartment with a roommate

271
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.170
cause it was too expensive. And my bedroom was in the living room.

272
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.650
And I remember how when I first moved in,

273
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:02.670
I pushed the head of my bed up against the three bay windows. So,

274
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.690
so that in the morning I could see the sky and I remember that I had no clue.

275
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.990
It never occurred to me that anyone could see me,

276
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.170
that I remember that I felt like whenever I looked out the window,

277
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.950
I never saw anyone. And I never closed my curtains either.

278
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.420
Did you ever find out either of their names? I,

279
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.440
I never have found out their names and I looked through the local obituaries

280
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.040
obsessively for weeks and there was never anyone that fit his description.

281
00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:44.700
There was never anyone young enough or that looked like him. Um,

282
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.010
so no idea.

283
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.930
I walked by their place several times and there's only,

284
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:54.930
there are only numbers on the mailboxes and the buzzers and there's,

285
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.940
there are no names so I can't look up anything. I don't know. Yeah.

286
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.510
I have no idea who she is. I have no idea who he was,

287
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.900
no idea what he was sick with.

288
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.780
I don't know if I've gotten anything right. Maybe they were married,

289
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.470
but I didn't get wrong. The fact that he died because

290
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.980
I was there, I was there for that because I saw it all.

291
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.820
I think about that a lot. How he chose that he chose to die in that,

292
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.440
in that bed, in that bedroom.

293
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.310
And he didn't choose to go to a hospice or anywhere.

294
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:40.790
He wanted to be in his bedroom.

295
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.560
All of those long days from the morning when I looked out in the evening,

296
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:49.390
he was just exactly the same position that was where you wanted to be.

297
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.503
And, uh,

298
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.810
it's where all of the happy times where I guess, and the end times, you know,

299
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.700
just a couple of days after it happened,

300
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:08.290
she was up on the roof with a friend doing, doing yoga.

301
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.730
And I've watched her lying around a lot.

302
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.860
She went out of town I think for a bit. And um,

303
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.120
she's still there.

304
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:25.230
I have been watching her recovery and instead of being this young woman,

305
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.290
she looks totally different. She looks so changed.

306
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.250
She just looks like this very, um,

307
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.270
experienced world wary person.

308
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.440
She has a job now that gets up very early,

309
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.680
cause I get up at six and she's already dressed and heads out at like six 15.

310
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.540
And the other night I saw her, uh,

311
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.680
and she was in her bedroom and she, um,

312
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:03.070
was wearing this baggy t shirt and all the lights were on and,

313
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.200
and she was dancing just dancing around her room.

314
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.010
<v 4>Okay.</v>

315
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.460
<v 0>So yeah, I want her,</v>

316
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.610
I want her to move on this,

317
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.980
this young woman that I was so cranky and bitter about, you know. No,

318
00:22:21.981 --> 00:22:24.460
she's now, she's, um,

319
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.880
now I feel so protective and kind of maternal, you know,

320
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.350
if you ran into her like at the corner market or something,

321
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.420
do you think you could ever say anything to her? Yeah,

322
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:42.440
if I ran into her, I wouldn't say a thing.

323
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.760
What would I say? I've been watching you through your window.

324
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.550
How creepy would that be? Um, yeah,

325
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.320
no way. She doesn't, you know,

326
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.810
sh she doesn't know that.

327
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.090
She doesn't know that there's this person that I don't know,

328
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:14.860
that's this complete stranger that's out there.

329
00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:16.330
Really rooting for her. You know,

330
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.623
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

331
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.790
<v 0>Diane Webber told her story to radio porter, Brianna Breen,</v>

332
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.750

333
