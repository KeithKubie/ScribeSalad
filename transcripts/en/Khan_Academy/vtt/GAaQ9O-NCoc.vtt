00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:03.842
- [Voiceover] A total of 72
people participated in a survey

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.181
about their music preferences.

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.273
The results, separated by
gender, are displayed above.

00:00:10.273 --> 00:00:13.768
According to the survey,
what is the probability

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:17.792
that a male likes rap music?

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:20.346
So let's look at the total
number of males surveyed.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:21.708
So this column right over here,

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:25.857
these are the males that were surveyed.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:28.319
And we see that the total number

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.117
of males surveyed is 35.

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:35.055
So there's 35 males that were asked

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.768
what is their musical preference?

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:38.068
And we want to know
what is the probability

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.337
that a male likes rap music
according to the survey,

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.227
according to the survey.

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:45.928
So out of the 35 males,

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:49.526
how many of them liked rap music?

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:52.766
Well, we see right over
here four out of the 35

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.485
liked rap music.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.725
So based on this survey, and
this would really just be

00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:59.349
an estimate of the true probability,

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:01.644
but based on this survey, out of 35,

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.664
four liked rap music,
so your best estimate

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.066
of the probability of a
random male liking rap music

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.589
based on this survey,
according to the survey,

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:13.015
would be 4/35ths, or four out of 35.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.229
Now let's look at the choices.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.210
And there we have it, four
out of 35 is actually,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.444
is the first choice.
