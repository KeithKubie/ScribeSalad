like this is so unique and so beautiful
but we got to the point where we felt

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
but we got to the point where we felt
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.399
but we got to the point where we felt
like we were repeating ourselves with

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
like we were repeating ourselves with
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.810
like we were repeating ourselves with
the one sort of must catch after the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
the one sort of must catch after the
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.359
the one sort of must catch after the
other and so we eventually chose the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
other and so we eventually chose the
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.880
other and so we eventually chose the
ones that suited the film the best and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
ones that suited the film the best and
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890
ones that suited the film the best and
then had to take the others out and to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
then had to take the others out and to
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870
then had to take the others out and to
see as you say to see these animals

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
see as you say to see these animals
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550

hunting in water was really what the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
hunting in water was really what the
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649
hunting in water was really what the
scene was about as well getting the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
scene was about as well getting the
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170
scene was about as well getting the
audiences used to the water as well as

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
audiences used to the water as well as
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.870
audiences used to the water as well as
on the same sort of curve that the land

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
on the same sort of curve that the land
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240
on the same sort of curve that the land
was getting used to her water but

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
was getting used to her water but
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.130
was getting used to her water but
ultimately I think that it just became a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
ultimately I think that it just became a
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:01.010
ultimately I think that it just became a
bloodfest

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560
this was quite interesting where you see

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
this was quite interesting where you see
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.800
this was quite interesting where you see
that this little coffe with its intense

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
that this little coffe with its intense

stops and confronts the slyness hoping
that's just by confronting it's going to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
that's just by confronting it's going to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
out to one side of the frame there and
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.770
out to one side of the frame there and
it's so interesting because I think that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
it's so interesting because I think that
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.500

in the in the pre screenings that we had

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
in the in the pre screenings that we had
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.289
in the in the pre screenings that we had
of this people were anticipating fake

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.570
of this people were anticipating fake
blood and so the real blood is even more

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
