00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.800
So the classic approach to negotiation is
positional bargaining.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.820
In positional bargaining I have a position,
you have a position, and we each haggle over

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.970
those positions.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.160
Now the rules to positional bargaining are
very clear: You start with an extreme demand

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.530
but not so extreme that the other side thinks
that you’re crazy or bluffing.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.559
You can concede stubbornly, and you demonstrate
a greater willingness in the other side to

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.440
walk away from the negotiation table.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.429
So you go to the car dealer.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.050
You want to buy a Corvette.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.679
The car salesperson says, “$80,000 take
it or leave it.”

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.780
You say “80?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.700
I’ll tell you what: 40, take it or leave
it.”

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.969
And you start arguing and haggling, crossing
your arms.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:56.999
Threatening to leave.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.190
An hour later the car salesperson brings that
number down to 70.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.469
You’ve gone up to 50.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.740
You each then demonstrate a greater willingness
to walk away from the negotiation table.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
You say, “You know what?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.740
There’s actually another Corvette dealer
down the street.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.080
Maybe I’ll just go there.”

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.790
And the car dealer says, “Well, you know
what.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.630
You see all these people standing in line
here.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.430
They all want to buy this Corvette.”

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.040
You each threaten to walk.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.470
But if you don’t walk you might end up typically
somewhere in the middle of those two other

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.920
numbers: 40, 80, you might end up around 60.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.260
However, this probably isn’t the best agreement
that you could have come to.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.400
All this is doing is arguing over one single
factor: a number.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.030
And that’s the problem of positional bargaining,
is that I might have a lot of other interests

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.980
at stake but none of them are getting shared
within this very strict form of positional

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.980
bargaining.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.660
There’s another form of negotiation that
at the Harvard Negotiation Project some of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.480
my colleagues have developed, we call it “Interest
Based” negotiation.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.610
The idea here is let’s not argue over positions,
let’s argue over underlying interests.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.170
“Why do you want the car?”

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.400
“Well I want the car because I have three
kids, three boys.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.550
I want a safe car.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.650
I don’t really care about the sunroof.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.640
I don’t need to look that cool, you know.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.980
But I want a car that’s not that expensive.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.040
I want one that’s energy efficient.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.730
And these are all of my interests.”

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.920
Now the car dealer has his or her own interests.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.760
If I ask you right now on camera what day
do you think I bought my most recent car—

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.870
Literally what day—you should know.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.880
It was December 31 right at the end of the
year, because I knew one of the interests

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.380
of the car dealer in my area was they needed
to get these cars off the lot for the next

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.660
year’s cars.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.540
They were more likely to go lower because
they had other interests at stake.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.330
So interest based negotiation says don’t
just focus on the positions, what you say

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.570
you want; focus on the underlying interests.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.960
And this is just as true in contemporary society.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.190
Whether it’s a business example – two
people arguing over a contract.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.810
Don’t just focus on the positions, focus
on the underlying interests.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.340
When it comes to policy in the United States
or elsewhere you say “This is your position

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.340
on healthcare.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.340
I say this is mine.”

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.989
Let’s not argue over the positions.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.130
What are the underlying interests?

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.860
Why is that policy the one you want.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.519
Then you can extract so much more value when
you focus on the level of underlying interests.
