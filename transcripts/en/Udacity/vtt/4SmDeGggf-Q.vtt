00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.960
So, now the second thing to
know about humans, all right?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.458
Human vision.

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:09.422
Humans are much more sensitive to
changes in what's referred to as

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:14.250
luminance, how bright something is than
they are sensitive to what color it is.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.200
Now here's an example.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.830
Now this example may work better or

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.130
worse depending upon how
your monitor is set.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.090
So if you're not seeing
the illusion I'm about to show you,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.590
play with your monitor.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.230
Here's two images with text on them,
and in the top,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.940
the background and the text are now, now
I'm going to have to change the color of

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.580
the pens, they're the same color, but
they're the different brightness.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.442
Okay, different,
the technical term is luminance.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:39.260
All right?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.090
And probably all of you have
no problem seeing that it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.970
says text in color without intensity
differences, blah, blah, blah, fine.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.680
On the bottom, actually on the Mac
monitor, I can hardly read it.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.690
On this monitor, I can read it
just fine because it depends upon

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.320
how each monitor, and
we're going to talk about monitors and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.470
gamuts in a little bit,
how they show it.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.175
But you could have adjusted
the color of the text in there so

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:07.375
that the color became almost,
what's called isoilluminant.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.946
All right?
So the same amount of luminance, okay,

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.842
but different color so you just
basically take the, the cyan there and

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:15.708
just make it brighter or darker.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.602
Don't change its, what we're going to
learn is called the hue, the color, and

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.470
you can make it go away, right?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.753
So the bottom line is that
the human system is much

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:28.208
better at dealing with
differences in luminance.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.258
So these phenomena, trike,
tri-stimulus color theory,

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:35.443
difference in luminescence, this has
been luminescence, has been known for

00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:38.042
a very long time,
since the very early 1900s.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:41.465
So starting in the 1920s, people
started doing some what are called

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.162
psycho-physics experiments
by psycho-physicists,

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:47.489
because who else would do psycho-physics
besides psycho-physicists?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.260
Of basically showing people
different kinds of stimuli and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.370
asking them what they see.
