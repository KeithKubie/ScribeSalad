Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So I mean, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04          I'm with you in that I am ridiculously optimistic. Oh that's good. I think that I think people, I mean I'm, I follow Steven Pinker's logic of that. People will sort of look at the horrible things that we have today and say, God, this world is terrible. Now. There are definitely terrible aspects, but this is without doubt the greatest time ever to be alive that we've ever seen, at least in recorded human history. I would agree with that. I think communication is a giant part of that.

Speaker 1:          00:34          It is. This is this global a world which we thought was going to be beautiful thing. And then people said, oh no, it's a hellish thing. In fact, it's got beautiful aspects and some hellish aspects as any invention has. You know, like Internet, hey, you can teach someone how to save their life on, on the Internet. Ah, you can also teach online and make a bomb on the incident, you know? So I think this is always there. Every next step we get, we will have some positives. Then we'll hit all the negatives and then we'll go back to small positive. So yeah, I've, I've got to be able to miss it. Yeah. Well I am an optimistic person. I otherwise it just wouldn't be here. But this military aspect that I mentioned, I'm flipping back to that. But yeah, I do try and think I need to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:13          I think that's a good thing to do. Now. I need to do that. If a 10, nine years, I've been saying I'm going to politics, so I'm going next year, but it might not be a general election. I try and plan ahead because I can't, I can't if I randomized it, like just float because a lot of people do find out this happened and then that happened. And then I was like, and that could be a wonderful life, but I have my river analogy. If you're canoeing down the river, um, if you go at the same speed as the river, they could throw you under rocks. He could give you a wonderful ride. It could be anything, but it's up to the river. Whereas I pedal like crazy. Sometimes I back pedal like crazy. I have actively backpedaled against things and, and sometimes usually I'm peddling faster than the speed of the river to try and guide myself through. You see that whenever do these canoeing. Um, well anyone driving a boat through the river and when I looked look

Speaker 2:          01:57          at human interactions objectively, part of me has to consider that there's a possibility that we need all this negative in order to reinforce the positive that there is some component of human life that desires or, or relies upon negative things to reinforce positive things that this yin and Yang that we, we exist under that, this, this, that we see the horrors of war and horrific poverty and all these terrible things in the horrible violence. We see this and it actually serves to reinforce our desire for positive things and reinforce and push our society in a more positive direction. I mean, I'm, I almost think that this is when we see national tragedies and shootings and all these different, terrible, terrible things, there's, there's all this fear and anger and frustration, but there's also action and the action might meet new might think there's a lack of action by politicians are a lack of action by the police or a lack of action by, you know, whoever we think should be responsible for mitigating these horrible situations that happen.

Speaker 2:          03:09          But publicly, the, the, the, the social fabric of the world, the way people communicate and interact, I think it reinforces our desire to not have that happen. It reinforces our understanding of peace and our love of peace. And I think that these, these bad things that we see in our world, they're almost propel us towards a better world because human beings are constantly striving for improvement and innovation. This is one of the things that we do. We want things to be better and bigger and faster and stronger. And we want our society to be better at all times. We never say this is good. Let's keep it just the way it is. We never, we never say that. So my, my thought is that even this, even what we were experiencing in this country, we like, it seems at times that were almost like on the brink of civil war between the right and the left and people align on both sides and conflating people's opinions and changing people's perspectives in order to suit their own narrative that I think that this ultimately all this [inaudible] you see it from the outside and you look at and go, what the fuck are we doing?

Speaker 2:          04:11          I think it's a natural part of the way human beings figure out life.

Speaker 1:          04:18          I shall respond to, sure. Yeah. I, I think, I think almost the same as you. I would not take it slightly differently. I've noticed that humanity only sometimes gets going and does things when he's right up against the wall. You know, somebody that needs these things to go on. If you took a wellbore to scenario. We went right to the wire on that and then suddenly we came back and maybe not even, it wasn't even the political will on that. It was just actually, if the Japanese haven't bombed Pearl Harbor, we wouldn't you guys, we wouldn't have had you guys in us with us for a DNA to, yes, all that. All the, the, the forces and the, the money and the almond and the tanks and the shermans coming in. You know, we needed that coming in and without the Russian people we wouldn't have won world war two and that was, and they were in this agreement.

Speaker 1:          05:08          So I can't quite work out humanity. I do think positive. I do think the negatives, you can appreciate the positives more. I do think one thing on, on the Brexit, Brexit hate thing that's been going on, there's a lot of young people are coming on and saying, well, so we're going to lose all this stuff. The ability we could travel to to Europe without visas. We can work there, we could retire there, we can get a healthcare. They're all costs you and that's going to tell you we cut off and we are roaming charges are going to go out with the old that people are valuing what they, uh, they could lose a lot more. So yeah, the Yin and Yang, the you can, I think, I think it's gonna go on this way. And also some people once, once we get to a good place, I've noticed that a lot of people will say, okay, I'm not going to be politically active anymore.

Speaker 1:          05:49          I'm just going to carry on doing my life and getting other people can sort of things that I've noticed that people will get activated to get to a result. Maybe an election result, something or a referendum or whatever it is. And then they'll, they will just back off. They get frustrated, they get faster or they just think, well, that's done. That's bagged and in a positive way maybe. And just say, but now I'm not even gonna pay attention to what's going on, but things will start rolling backwards. So, um, I think we're going to keep having it like that. Maybe the but the percentage of positive things to negative things. It's never changed over all the years. Over the last 10,000 years. It's just there's more people in the world doing more positive things and doing well and negative things. Maybe humanity hasn't changed cause I brain sizes haven't changed.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Even back to the cavemen days, you know, even back for the last hundred thousand years, the size of our brains is not moved. So we, if you went back to seven 70,000 years ago, we would still be able to have conversations like this even though we wouldn't have the radios and things. It'd be more on our tribe. I think I'll try B is better than you are trying to say. Actually Steve, I don't know if our tribe is better than that tribe. I just think liberals are similar than some good people that drive in this same shit as in that drive. We need to maybe trade with them or we can go to war with them, but then we could die lot and Shelly could die. And Kenny and Roger and number 22, you know, because those conversations were happening in this slightly different way I think all the way back.

Speaker 1:          07:04          And it wasn't all just bring me food. You Nice, good three fight. It wasn't that, it was maybe, you know, millions of years ago, but not 700,000 years ago. And we only started speaking a hundred thousand years ago. What we've developed since then, I'm fascinated by us as human beings because we, we, uh, we were just another animal and now we are, we are kind of amazing animal. We've fermented beautifully. We landed on the bloody moon. You guys landed on the moon, which I as a child thought that we landed on the moon, but in fact you guys, I did them, but they, they Apollo 11, they kept it quite open. I think Michael Collins in the command module. So this is for the world. And there was this kind of feeling. And Neil Armstrong is, it's a nice, yeah, I grabbed hold of that as a kid. I was growing up, you know, but younger than me.

Speaker 1:          07:50          But it's pretty weird thing to think that we went from not being able to talk to space travel in a hundred thousand years. I mean, that's what they think, right? They think that people didn't have real language. 100,000 folks be two genetic. Um, I think it's about a hundred thousand years ago. That's when it came to, and the first words we said was, let's go to the moon in 100,000. What's your name? Jack Kennedy. Okay. Jack. Good idea. But let's put it on the back burner for the moment. What do you think happened that turned us into this? Do you ever stop and think about that? Well, I don't think it's a bloke upstairs floating in the clouds because they used to live in the clouds and then we flew through the clouds and no one ever had mentioned, hey, he's not in the cloud. So I, it's a randomized thing, you know, I think these random like dinosaurs hundred and 65 million years of those bastards, right?

Speaker 1:          08:34          And all they did was eight, uh, kill eight cold pool and, and have sex. That's all they did. Those four things for 165 million years, we've had 300 years since the enlightenment of human rights and democracy and stuff like that. If we, if we say the Great Greeks did a great thing, but it really is lost, we're going to do is they had 165 million years of that. But why did they come along when we had all these creatures in the sea and suddenly huge ones, something happened, something twisted, randomizing thing. It's, I, I, we, we, I know. Maybe we'll never know, but it has happened and I just don't think a bloke did it upstairs with a big beard. He said, now is the time that you speak and now you make handbags and now fight wars with the MG 42 bow. Now, you know, I just, I just think it happened and we need to roll with it and try and make humans work on this planet, because then we're going to be going a mile soon.

Speaker 1:          09:31          And you can just say it the future, if we got it going on Mars at some, but the margins, because we want to vote, we've got our own Martian government. You sure you earthlings, you know, they're going to treat us the same way. Yeah. Ricans treat the British. Yeah. And then the has come back and attack us. The [inaudible] you could just see that in some sort of, you know, how did you turn the light? Sure. Yeah. Definitely happy. You know, and I, so I, I, I despair about humanity and I, and I, and I, I celebrate humanity. Yeah.
