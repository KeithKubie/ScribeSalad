signal and then can send that signal out
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.490

to a robotic arm or as I say through a

of coffee and take a sip by themselves
 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.970
of coffee and take a sip by themselves
so it gives them the kind of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
so it gives them the kind of
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.670
so it gives them the kind of

and it's a world that is related to
 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.160
and it's a world that is related to
recording signals from the brain but

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170
recording signals from the brain but
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.390
recording signals from the brain but
also driving brain activity by

also driving brain activity by
 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.440
also driving brain activity by

this kind of deep brain stimulation has

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130
this kind of deep brain stimulation has
 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.770
this kind of deep brain stimulation has
proved effective for some kinds of

and there are a lot of possibilities the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
and there are a lot of possibilities the

a daunting task to put it mildly but

a daunting task to put it mildly but
 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.229
a daunting task to put it mildly but
what these experiments suggest is that

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
what these experiments suggest is that
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.330
what these experiments suggest is that
we may not need to do a cell by cell

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
we may not need to do a cell by cell

told me about was his dream and it is
 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.440
told me about was his dream and it is
really a quite inspiring dream besides

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.120
functioning absolutely normally and then
the brain departs from a normal function

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130
the brain departs from a normal function
 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.989
the brain departs from a normal function
into an aberrant

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:28.999
into an aberrant
 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.209
into an aberrant
which is manifest in all of the signs

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219
which is manifest in all of the signs

hope the not so distant future to be

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:39.829
hope the not so distant future to be
 

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:41.319
hope the not so distant future to be
able to record from an individual's

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:41.329
able to record from an individual's
 

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:43.959
able to record from an individual's
brain and understand when the signals

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969
brain and understand when the signals
 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.729
brain and understand when the signals
begin to move into the schizophrenic

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:45.739
begin to move into the schizophrenic
 

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:49.239
begin to move into the schizophrenic
mode and perhaps be able to stimulate

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249
mode and perhaps be able to stimulate
 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.939
mode and perhaps be able to stimulate
the brain to correct that back to the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949
the brain to correct that back to the
 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.380
the brain to correct that back to the
normal mode

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390
