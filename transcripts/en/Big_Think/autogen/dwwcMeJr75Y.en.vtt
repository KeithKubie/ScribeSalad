woman's space in a certain way even

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
woman's space in a certain way even

it but I think to a large degree when we
kind of separate ourselves out and it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
kind of separate ourselves out and it
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.880

there is a real crisis of masculinity
that's that's happening in America I

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660
that's that's happening in America I
 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.390
that's that's happening in America I
think the problem is is the way it's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400
think the problem is is the way it's
 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670
think the problem is is the way it's
being framed is that there's a problem

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
being framed is that there's a problem
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.170
being framed is that there's a problem
with masculinity because women are too

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180
with masculinity because women are too
 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.670
with masculinity because women are too
powerful or women are taking up too much

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680
powerful or women are taking up too much
 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.800
powerful or women are taking up too much
space and that's the way that it's being

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
space and that's the way that it's being
 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.140
space and that's the way that it's being
talked about rather than what's going on

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
talked about rather than what's going on
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.720
talked about rather than what's going on
with men you know that maybe they're in

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730
with men you know that maybe they're in
 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.730
with men you know that maybe they're in
school less or that they feel like they

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740
school less or that they feel like they
 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.950
school less or that they feel like they
have to adhere to a you know a certain

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960
have to adhere to a you know a certain
 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.840
have to adhere to a you know a certain
ideal of what men are supposed to be

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
ideal of what men are supposed to be
 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.570
ideal of what men are supposed to be
like and so instead of focusing on men

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
like and so instead of focusing on men
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.310
like and so instead of focusing on men
and focusing what we can do to prop them

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
and focusing what we can do to prop them
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.800
and focusing what we can do to prop them
up people seem really incredibly focused

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
up people seem really incredibly focused
 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.300
up people seem really incredibly focused
on the fact that women are doing well

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310
on the fact that women are doing well
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.159
on the fact that women are doing well
and maybe that's not such a good thing

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169
 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.529
I think that I think that it is

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539
I think that I think that it is
 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.540
I think that I think that it is
effective when activists work from from

think that it's increasingly being more
effective with the work that's being

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710
effective with the work that's being
 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.580
effective with the work that's being
done online that it is a bit more and

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590

really a step in the right direction and

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870
really a step in the right direction and
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.059
really a step in the right direction and
because you are getting more voices out

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069
because you are getting more voices out

because you are getting more voices out
there and maybe while one organization

all of these different voices can be

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319
all of these different voices can be
 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.629
all of these different voices can be

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639
working on the same issue but bringing
 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.249
working on the same issue but bringing
something different to the table I think

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259
something different to the table I think
 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.760
something different to the table I think
is really important

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770
 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.510
the what bothers me the most about the
