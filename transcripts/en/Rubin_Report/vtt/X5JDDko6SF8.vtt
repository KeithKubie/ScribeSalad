[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>joining me today is a comedian,
a writer for the Daily News and the spectator,</v>

3
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.880
the former sex columnist,
step playboy,

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.020
and a woman in the midst of taking off Twitter for lent.
Bridget.
Tracy,

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.080
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you for having me.

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.550
You are in the midst of taking off Twitter for land.
As I just said,

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.560
you were on a break from legal characters and attacking people and owning people

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.970
and destroying people and getting a deck.
I know exactly what she smiling about.

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.270
How's it going?
Before we get into anything else about you,
I mean,
how,

10
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.140
so first of all,
how long have you been doing it for?
A couple of weeks.

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.861
<v 2>Okay.
Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:44.861
so I inadvertently didn't know that this was the line just lent ever.

13
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:50.150
So it's normally 40 days,
but because of the way you serve falls edse 46 days.

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.840
Oh Man.
And um,
uh,
there's 26 days left.

15
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.800
Some 40 days at or sorry,
20 days in,
right.
Um,

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.180
of my 46,

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300
<v 1>which is why Twitter,
why giving up Twitter of all things.</v>

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.860
So I have

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.910
<v 2>not many vices left.
I've given up drinking.
I've given up smoking weed,</v>

20
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.030
I've given up.
I mean,
if there's something that you can quit,

21
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.190
I'm pretty much quite at other than coffee and Twitter.

22
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.900
And I thought that I would give up coffee because that was the easiest of the

23
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:22.860
two.
And I tried to do that.
I want to kill myself.

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.120
And so I decided that I would give up Twitter and I'm,
I'm like you,

25
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.740
I take weekends off sometimes.

26
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:34.630
I try and I felt in February really addicted to it.

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.020
I remember there would be days where I'd say,
okay,

28
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.830
9:00 AM you're off.
You shouldn't even be doing it in the morning,

29
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:46.000
but by 9:00 AM get off and go do something.
And then it's 11 and I'm like,

30
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.930
well I'll just do until 11 yeah.
And then it's noon and then,

31
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.090
and this is very addictive thinking.

32
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.600
Oh well I've already ruined my whole half of my day.

33
00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:59.380
So now just until the rest of the day I'm just going to tweet and I can feel

34
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:03.040
myself that refresh,
refresh,
refresh,
like a little rat.

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.020
<v 1>What was that like when you realized that the kick that you're go go,</v>

36
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.200
go pick or whatever it is,

37
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.690
is sort of like some of the things that you've quit cause you've been,

38
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.290
you've been sober for about five years.
Yep.
Yup.

39
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.480
<v 2>Yeah.
Five and a half,
a little bit.
Who's,
and the,</v>

40
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:19.040
it wasn't necessarily noticing the kick,
it was noticing the inability to,

41
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.080
the lack of parallel feeling,

42
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.750
kind of powerless over being able to stop when I wanted to stop.
Yeah.

43
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.850
If I put an end time not being able to meet that end time having it,

44
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.030
I,
it's very much like my life started journaling a little bit unmanageable.

45
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.893
Yeah.
Things.

46
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
And even just seeing how much the most interesting thing that's come of the two

47
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.750
weeks or a little more then,
um,

48
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.910
I guess almost three weeks now is how much physical energy I have.

49
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.630
So how this,
and this I haven't really found the science on because I'm a nerd.

50
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.410
So I went down all these science halls and now I'm looking at reading this book

51
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.161
irresistible,

52
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.480
which is all about addiction and all the studies and it's brilliant.

53
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.350
But why do I,
how is something so passive,

54
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.610
taking so much energy,
actual physical energy.

55
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.440
So you physically feel better?
Oh,

56
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.820
physically I have so much actual energy.
And what is it?

57
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.890
Just because the adrenals,

58
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.130
you're getting kind of fired up when you have that adrenaline.

59
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.080
I don't know how you feel when you're on,

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.550
I generally step away if I start feeling reactive.
Yeah.
I,
if I'm,

61
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.910
if I started feeling my heart racing and even when I'm kind of addicted,

62
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.780
I'm like,
okay,
Bridgette.
Yeah.
What do you think of them way?

63
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.540
<v 1>What about the mental clarity?</v>

64
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.540
<v 2>So that's been I,
the productivity is,</v>

65
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.220
I've written,
I've been doing a daily writing prompt on my patrion.

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.670
I've read on just that alone.
I've done 15,000 words.

67
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:52.270
I wrote a 12 page book proposal.
I did,

68
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.370
I been keeping diary of a Twitter junkie.
I just,

69
00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:59.080
the daily how I feel and whatnot.
And um,

70
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.490
that's another probably 20,000 words.
I,
I'm pretty much written a book.

71
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.650
I mean,
that's why you're doing it.
Right?

72
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.630
That's about the same amount that I probably would have written on Twitter.
Yeah.

73
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.000
Right.
Exactly.

74
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.390
<v 1>Great.
Um,
so it's interesting because when I've done this and as you know,</v>

75
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:19.290
I do the weekends and I do the August thing.
What I found is,

76
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.780
especially when it's not just the weekend when it's the longer one,

77
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.770
is that I'm just generally calmer.

78
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.750
Like I'm not bad neurotic or whatever in general.
But I find that like,

79
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.170
like my patience level,
like if I'm at the supermarket,
you know,

80
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.140
normally you're like checking out and you're maybe looking at your phone or

81
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.820
whatever,
where now it's like,

82
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.320
I'm more inclined to say hello to the person that's checking me out or just like

83
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.060
a little more presence.

84
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.010
<v 2>I am so much more present.
Yeah,
definitely that,</v>

85
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.240
that has been a remarkable difference and everything.

86
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:52.910
And even people in my family and my sister,

87
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.900
we were joking about the other day and she said,
Eh,
you are more present.

88
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.990
Even just on the phone with her and in my life.

89
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.470
And I feel like even my dog notices that it just,

90
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:05.740
that my dog's here are connected to me and I'm like,

91
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.610
is this because I'm just not on my phone all the time?
And it's the,

92
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.870
but I'm a maniac.

93
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:15.350
I have an addictive personality and I'm just a maniac in general.

94
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:20.351
And so the first week I would say I went through real withdrawal.

95
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.440
And it was interesting because I went to,

96
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.230
I went to mass on Ash Wednesday because I figured if I was going to do it,

97
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.870
I might as well it partake in my ritual.
I'm not some great Catholic,

98
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:36.830
but I went and I was feeling kind of ashamed that I was quitting something so

99
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:41.510
stupid as Twitter and the priest or the monsignor gets up and he's giving his

100
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.020
sermon and he says,
lent means slow in French and that,

101
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:48.950
I mean this is a time we're supposed to go with them and look at how we can help

102
00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:52.610
those who are suffering and,
and he said,
we need to slow down.

103
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:56.960
And then he reaches under his Cassick and he pulls out his cell phone and holds

104
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.130
up in front of the whole parish and says,
and put these down.
Yeah.

105
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.590
And I looked around and I was like,
we have a problem.

106
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.600
Society when going to distances up [inaudible] he's holding up his cell phone in

107
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:10.070
front of the bearish telling you to put it down.

108
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:15.020
It's like destroying your relationships here and that was when I look over my

109
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.320
odd who's on her phone and the church is hilarious.
Yeah.

110
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.040
<v 1>Well it's interesting because it's like we can't quite quantify how having</v>

111
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.580
access to this much information so fast.

112
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.930
Just out of nowhere,
basically only within the last say 10 years.

113
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.280
We have just no idea how it's rewiring our brain the way we think,

114
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:36.114
the way we behave.

115
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.751
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:40.270
Each other there while they do all these studies on empathy with the younger

117
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:42.940
kids and how that's,
you need to have those,

118
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.650
one of the things about the world we live in,
even just cancel culture,

119
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:48.484
et Cetera,

120
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.470
I feel like there's this diminishment of being awkward.
You can't,

121
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.920
nobody is allowed to have these awkward interactions,
which is how you,

122
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.600
you might say something wrong and then somebody will have a look on their face

123
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:04.000
and you know,
oh,
I went,
I stepped over a line.

124
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.650
But because everybody's living in so much fear of saying the wrong thing or

125
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.850
they're there,

126
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.810
there isn't this like awkward or they're just on their phones where they can

127
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.970
have text messaging interactions and not hear tone and body language.

128
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.240
So there's this loss of of making mistakes and being awkward and even I'm s and

129
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:29.380
you see it all across the board right now.
Yeah.
So that,
that's been,

130
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.970
it has been interesting.
Just if you sit in a restaurant and you are,

131
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:38.920
say you and I went to eat and you went to the restroom and I just sat there and

132
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:43.420
did not look at my phone,
I would look like a psychopath every month.
God,

133
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:47.830
she's just sitting there looking at the wall.
Right.

134
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.930
And this and the vogue irresistible.

135
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:54.931
He says that there's an inability for us to just be bored.

136
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.040
That as humans we used to just have this idle time and I look at my screen time

137
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.250
and you know,
you'll see your screen report and it'll say something like,
oh,

138
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.940
your screen to irons down 45% you're like hurray.

139
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:10.720
And then it's like to fire him hours to speak to 27 hours.

140
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.820
What am I doing for five and the number of times you pick it up I we're rads or

141
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.410
elaborate.

142
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.270
<v 1>Here's the catch 22 though that the internet and all this connectivity has also</v>

143
00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:23.700
given us,
I mean I can talk about just the two of us.

144
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:27.240
We live in the digital space and we've created things that people appreciate and

145
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:31.440
all of those things.
It's also given us everything that we want in a certain way.

146
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:35.720
Like I'm so appreciative of my life and it's through that connectivity.
I know,

147
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.990
but that doesn't mean that it's not a dangerous sword to wheel a bit I suppose.

148
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.500
<v 2>And I would feel so isolated ideologically.
I do in twice,</v>

149
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.260
like 2016 approaching 2016 being in La,

150
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:51.420
I started feeling like I was going crazy.
I truly,
yeah,

151
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.490
and it was you and people finding people like online and that's how I kind of

152
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:01.470
came out of the space of,
I would say we're just living in a,
on Twitter.

153
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:06.471
I was really just around comedians and writers and then slowly kind of drifted

154
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.920
into political Twitter,
which was always there.

155
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.990
<v 1>Now you're full on.
All right,</v>

156
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.640
<v 2>now I'm on your zone.
I'm not saying hey.
Yeah,
so I'm,</v>

157
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.690
I'm happy to be inducted into this club.

158
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.760
<v 1>Yeah.
All right,
so let's,
let's go there for a second.
So one of the things that,</v>

159
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.790
the reason that I've wanted to have you on for quite some time as I've sort of

160
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.640
been watching through Twitter,
your,
your,

161
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.970
what I would say political awakening is because you strike me as just a sort of

162
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:35.310
old school lefty liberal,
whatever,

163
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:40.311
but you are seriously waking up to or have woken up to just the postmodern

164
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.540
thinking and left this nonsense and all of this stuff about free speech.

165
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.400
And we'll talk about me to in the piece you wrote and,

166
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.120
and a series of other things like it seems like every day I can see you getting

167
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:55.720
like a little more and a little bit more like we are baseball is anyone saying,

168
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.340
<v 2>but this isn't the problem.
So I have,</v>

169
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.360
I have to check myself and these are the questions like that I would have for

170
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:08.190
you.
For instance,
as somebody with what I thought were liberal values,

171
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:08.810
I,

172
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.810
I don't like how in this tribal world it's like the left gets social justice and

173
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:18.210
the right gets family values.
No,
those,
everybody should care about those things.

174
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.690
I know plenty of people on the right who care about social justice and plenty of

175
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:24.000
people on the left who care about family values.

176
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.150
<v 1>How would you define social justice when you say that?</v>

177
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.670
<v 2>Um,
oh gosh.
I mean I think just caring about other people.</v>

178
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:34.510
I feel like there's an idea that people on the right are callous and don't care

179
00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:35.100
about

180
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.410
<v 1>right.
They old one hour about move taxes,</v>

181
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.690
<v 2>right.
Money in themself and essentially are,</v>

182
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.140
there's a callousness I would think that is applied to that.

183
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.920
But I do think that people,

184
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.750
<v 1>well,
I found that to be completely untrue,
but I that I've met these people,
I,</v>

185
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.360
yeah,
I did think that years ago.

186
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.430
<v 2>So my biggest thing that I have to check myself is am I reacting to rejection?</v>

187
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.420
So in being somewhat rejected by the former party,

188
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:08.210
although I don't feel rejected,
I feel like I didn't move and just went,

189
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.350
yeah.
You know,
like they're drifting away.
Yeah.
And I,

190
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.470
I'm,
I kind of,
I explain it to people.

191
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:23.471
Like I was this customer of regular at a bar and I was a regular at the bar and

192
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:26.150
then they took me as a voter for instance.
And they,
yeah.

193
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.420
And I just kind of went to that bar all the time.
They knew me.

194
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.570
I grew up going to that bar with my grandpa and my dad and it was it a family

195
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:36.500
bar tradition.

196
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.390
And then suddenly they stopped caring about me and they started caring about the

197
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:46.391
hipsters are the beards and craft beers and stuff and they stopped caring about

198
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:51.611
just their regular customers and the normal common sense folk and started making

199
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.720
these fancy drinks.

200
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.470
<v 1>I like this metaphor.
I like this metaphor.</v>

201
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.510
<v 2>They somehow lost me as a customer because now I am a registered independent and</v>

202
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.550
you'll see the criticism of on the left,
I see this a lot of,
well,
um,

203
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.390
somebody said something I didn't like and so I stopped believing in and you
know,

204
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.890
equality and women's rights and I abandoned all of my principals and became a

205
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:21.100
conservative and
I don't,

206
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.260
I don't think that's a fair assessment.

207
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.600
That assessment I think has no self reflection,
which is my biggest I,

208
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:30.940
that's really,
people accused me too.
They say,
Oh,

209
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:34.060
you don't call out the right enough.
Well,
I'm not a conservative.
Yeah.

210
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.810
I don't know any,
I'm learning about conservatism,
but I didn't know anything.

211
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.700
I didn't,
I wasn't raised,
I was raised a blue blood,
Yankee,
Democrat,

212
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.950
liberal.
My parents saying for the camp,

213
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.780
my dad sang for the Kennedy is like [inaudible] that was where I came from.
Yeah.

214
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.010
And so coming,

215
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.500
I just wasn't really paying attention and then suddenly I felt like that what's

216
00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:03.100
happening?
How are these,
how,
how is it that they're,

217
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.610
you know,
it's suddenly like punk rock to be conservative.

218
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.370
<v 1>All right.
All right.
I want to back up to this bar metaphor.</v>

219
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.640
I like what you're doing here.
So,
okay,
hipsters come in,

220
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.870
they've got their fancy drinks,
you know,
you're,

221
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:15.220
you don't know where you are anymore.

222
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.310
The Bio that you and your dad and your grandpa were and where do you go?

223
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.660
So you walk out of the bar.

224
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.470
What happens now I'm welcomed with open arms by the outright.

225
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.760
What are you shocked when you go into the other bar next door that you thought

226
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.020
was the evil bar and you realize that,
Whoa,
there's some decent people in this,

227
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.780
in this crazy conservative at world.
People are,

228
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.210
<v 2>well,
I'm always like,
are you,
I'm moved every year and a half growing up.</v>

229
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.020
So I am very sensitive to mob mentality in general.

230
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.320
I'm very aware of groups and how they like to form and tribes and I've always

231
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.170
been the girl on the outside kind of looking at,

232
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:58.171
and so this space that I'm occupying now is not really that unfamiliar to me.

233
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.710
But what was shocking was finding that they weren't evil.

234
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:07.711
These like evil people and that their values,

235
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.260
you know,
we can have differences.
And of opinion.

236
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.610
And that seems to be the thing that concerns me the most is that there doesn't

237
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:20.611
seem to be any tolerance for different differing opinions or nuance,

238
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:22.630
which is what's worrisome.

239
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.980
And so the new bar seems to be a little bit more tolerant.
However,

240
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.700
I'm also aware that they're more than happy.
Happily,

241
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.590
they will more than happily weaponized.

242
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:37.591
Somebody like me as like the disaffected liberal who no longer,

243
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.110
you know,
who is rejected from her tribe.
It's not.
Yeah.

244
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.680
<v 1>Right.
So isn't that true?
So how do they weaponize that?</v>

245
00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:47.820
Cause that people will say that to me.

246
00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:51.260
We'll see you left the left and now the rights embracing you because they just,

247
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.480
they want to use you to show that,

248
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.060
that you're not that bad or that they're not that bad or something like that.

249
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.380
Like,
well there they don't seem to be that bad.
Right?

250
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.381
<v 2>No,
it's true.</v>

251
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:04.220
But what I mean by weaponizes that they will happily abandon me if I don't.

252
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.160
It's not like they're taking me on as one of them,

253
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.100
so they're not taking me in to their tribe for it to protect me.

254
00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:16.101
And the minute that I express any nuance for anything that may not be in

255
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:21.200
alignment with them there,
there will be no defense of me.

256
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.273
I'm pretty,

257
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.810
<v 1>I bet.
I bet that will change.
I bet you think that will change.
Yeah.</v>

258
00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:30.520
Because I go to all these conservative turning point college events and I talk

259
00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:34.510
about being pro choice and gay married and pro weed and for strong prison reform

260
00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:35.440
and against the death penalty,

261
00:15:35.441 --> 00:15:37.900
all these lefty things and they keep inviting me back.

262
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.660
They love the differences that,
I mean that's really what I'm finding.

263
00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:42.280
But I hear you like that.
It's weird.

264
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.110
It's weird to think that's possible when you're in that new bar.
Yeah,

265
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.790
but that's just what I've found.

266
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.360
<v 2>I,</v>

267
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.360
I've found they're more open minded and I can have these discussions with openly

268
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:57.710
about things that I didn't feel like there again,

269
00:15:57.711 --> 00:16:02.711
there was not room for discussion and there have been just the,

270
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.800
the most

271
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.540
my awakening really came when I started noticing that I was self censoring.

272
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:14.660
So I just started recognizing that I was not speaking freely.

273
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.450
And even when I went in to Michael knolls show,

274
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:20.670
I remember we were all just in makeup and talking and I was like,
oh,

275
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.210
it's so nice to be able to just speak freely and not be walking on eggshells and

276
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.180
afraid that I'm going to use the wrong term or what wrong.
Anything.

277
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:34.160
And just that recognizing that that was happening was something that pushed,

278
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.671
you know,

279
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:39.350
I would say it was s where not only was I ignored at the bar,

280
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:43.320
but suddenly I was not sure I wanted to be in that bar anymore.
Yeah.

281
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.960
Because I felt like I wasn't really welcome and part of me.

282
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:51.860
Is it,
am I just old?
You know,

283
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.030
it's just progress and maybe I'm like the old lady that's like,

284
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.760
this doesn't the way,
Dang,
you like art.

285
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.550
<v 1>I seriously hope that pick,
I'm only two years older than you.
Yeah.</v>

286
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.180
<v 2>You know,
I mean there,</v>

287
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.110
there is a certain amount of stuff that I've learned from younger women where

288
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.470
they've there the whole stuff of consent culture for example.
I,

289
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.470
I think that again,
it's,
it's eroding a lot of awkwardness and the like,

290
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.220
can I touch your hair?
Yeah.
It's kind of,

291
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.390
and just human sexuality trying to put that much control on it is crazy to me.

292
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.150
However they,
the younger women are like,

293
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.220
just cause you all bags put up with leg,

294
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:34.820
somebody smacking your ass while your waitressing doesn't mean that we have to

295
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:36.350
and that.
Okay,
fair enough.

296
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.730
<v 1>But that's different than,
than concern culture,
right?
Yeah.
I think most,</v>

297
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.260
most decent people,

298
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.610
I think probably most of those scary conservatives in that bar.
Yeah.

299
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.950
Probably nuts in the lap in the waitresses acid,
that bar actually,
you know what,

300
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:53.400
they're secretly doing it in the first bar you were at the same time,

301
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:56.160
they're pretending that they,
they're all about women and all that.

302
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.730
<v 2>All girls.
The board though.
I mean I've experienced that.
Yeah,
that's bad.</v>

303
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.480
I would say.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

304
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.810
I think my point was really that I just probably turn my head to a certain

305
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:15.610
amount of sexual harassment like that the younger generation just doesn't
accept,

306
00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:16.860
which is not a bad thing.

307
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.510
<v 1>So where do you,
how do you,
you've,
you've written about this a little bit,</v>

308
00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:21.100
how do you draw the lines on all of that?

309
00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:24.670
What you're describing is just sort of basic human emotion with each other and

310
00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:27.910
that we need a certain amount of freedom and ability to make mistakes and

311
00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:32.290
pushing each other and that we have certain desires and that,
you know,

312
00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:35.950
but they can't be just like unbridled desires and all of that with a culture.

313
00:18:35.951 --> 00:18:37.090
Now where are the,
you know,

314
00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:40.720
they want you to sign documents before you have that black people and there's

315
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:43.390
apps where you both have to consent,
we're going to do this,
this,
this and this

316
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:48.390
<v 2>sign can be withdrawn retro actively.
I think you can still look back and say,</v>

317
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:50.020
oh no,
I didn't choose it.

318
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.430
<v 1>What is the point of getting signed to take it back?</v>

319
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.040
There's that ridiculous story from like a year ago,
I forget what school it was.

320
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:58.490
We're both students,
the male,
the female after accused each other of rape,

321
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.700
they both accused each other because they wanted to get the leg up on the other

322
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:04.820
one quick.
Like,
that's how,
so how do you,
how do you manage,

323
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:07.820
I mean if someone that writes about texts and all this stuff,
how do you,

324
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.080
how do you negotiate?

325
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.670
<v 2>I mean this was part of the reason that I,
I think again,</v>

326
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:15.280
when you want to talk about my awakening,

327
00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:17.410
I was the girl that was writing from playboy,

328
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.800
like it was still the 90th because I would,

329
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.520
I didn't go to college and so I didn't have the indoctrination of a lot of this

330
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.860
woke culture.
I'm not woke at all.
And I would say things like,

331
00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:32.260
and my first article,
um,
it was,

332
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:33.963
<v 3>uh,</v>

333
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.970
<v 2>women date assholes because you're a pussy</v>

334
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.040
and it did not go over well with the left or the right.

335
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:45.130
That was the first time that I was just like mutually getting,
yeah.

336
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.580
<v 1>So what was the,
hey,
you were getting from me.</v>

337
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.770
<v 2>The men's rights activists and stuff were saying like,</v>

338
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.720
the men don't generally like being called Pussy is if you,
if you can't,

339
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.170
if,
I mean essentially they're like,
oh,
so if I can't get laid,
I'm a pussy,

340
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:00.780
you know,
like that you screw you.

341
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:05.781
And then that it was like toxic masculinity on the law on from the like extreme

342
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.370
feminists.
And that happened to me a lot.

343
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:11.460
They extreme men and women often,

344
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.460
I don't think they realize how close and the circle they are.

345
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.630
<v 1>What do you make of that whole situation right now that it seems like at some</v>

346
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:20.780
level we're entering like this low grade war of the sexist.

347
00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:23.150
Like this sounds like a bizarre dystopian story.

348
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.240
<v 2>No,
I know.
And it's,
I don't think that,</v>

349
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:34.260
so I don't think you need to emasculate men in order to empower women.

350
00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:38.590
And I feel like this is kind of the,
there's so many double,

351
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.030
it's like,
okay,

352
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:45.540
so you're talking to me about toxic masculinity and you're saying toxic

353
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:48.400
masculinity this and men can't show their emotions.
Oh,

354
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:51.760
but sit the sit down and shut out.
Actually,

355
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:56.760
we don't want to hear from you at all guys,
unless you are,
uh,

356
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.310
a trans man or unless you are a person of color who's gay or if you check some

357
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:07.120
boxes,
we,
you're allowed to speak.
But other than that,

358
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:10.450
if you're a white male,
like shut up.
Well,

359
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:14.200
where does that fall into your toxic masculinity and how is that helpful?

360
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.710
Because from my experience writing for men and hearing from men,

361
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.930
um,
CIS Hetero men,

362
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.330
the red blooded male,

363
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.830
the Alpha male and my kind of dude,
um,

364
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.950
they are struggling.
You know,
they,
they're,
I,

365
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.400
I would,
I did some,
some of my favorite pieces or pieces like on balding or,

366
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.740
um,
premature ejaculation and men,
I'd say,
hey guys,
what do you think about this?

367
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:47.530
And it would be essays,
thousands of words.

368
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.340
No one's really asking them questions,
how they're doing.

369
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:53.620
And when you do ask them,
hey,
how are you doing?

370
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:58.420
It's like a fountain of pain essentially.

371
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.980
<v 1>It's so fascinating to me because as you know,</v>

372
00:22:00.981 --> 00:22:04.430
I've been on tour with Jordan Peterson.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And it's like,

373
00:22:04.431 --> 00:22:07.670
people always say it's angry young men coming to his shows in,
first of all,

374
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:08.840
I don't find them to be angry,

375
00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:11.060
but they are people that are trying to put their lives together.

376
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.080
But I always think it's such an odd criticism because let's pretend it was 90%

377
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.520
angry white,

378
00:22:16.521 --> 00:22:21.521
cisgendered toxic men and he was helping them deal with some of their issues.

379
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.340
That would be a good thing.
Right?
So the blanket accusation of,
Oh,
you know,

380
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:29.900
you're just writing for straight white men or that it's mostly straight white

381
00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:32.480
men that show up to these things.
And I'm not even saying that's the case.
It's,

382
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.130
it's such a low level argument because everyone needs help regardless of their

383
00:22:37.131 --> 00:22:39.470
gender or their skin.
A skin color.

384
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.620
<v 2>Yeah.
And people are,
you know,
women haven't given,</v>

385
00:22:42.621 --> 00:22:47.150
I feel more tools and they just are allowed to express themselves emotionally

386
00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:51.950
and society and men really aren't.
And so it,
they don't have tools,

387
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:55.970
they just don't have as many and they don't feel as comfortable opening up.

388
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.290
I don't feel like men particularly feel comfortable opening up even to other
men,

389
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.240
although they might be getting better at that.

390
00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:06.830
But it does seem like they'll open up to me because they feel comfortable.

391
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.290
I also did,

392
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.440
I just don't really judge anyone for whatever they come to me with.

393
00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:17.360
And I'm certainly not judging someone by the color of their skin or by whatever

394
00:23:17.361 --> 00:23:22.361
their politics might be because I feel like first we have to meet as humans and

395
00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:27.860
I feel like we're all just on this same kind of sinking ship together and you

396
00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:31.910
know,
it's like fighting over the last seat on the titanic.
Like why,
why are we,

397
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.040
what is,
how is this helpful?

398
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:39.041
I don't see that discourse right now being helpful and I don't see how you

399
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.780
basically taking an entire group of people and saying sit down and shut up.

400
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.460
Is is helpful.

401
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.560
I it how are is pressing a whole nother group of people?
Yeah.

402
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.200
How is it doing the same thing that you was done to you?
How does that help?
How,

403
00:23:58.201 --> 00:23:59.034
how?

404
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.770
<v 1>I was having a lunch meeting with somebody just about some business stuff and,</v>

405
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.140
but he didn't actually know that much about my politics.
Right.

406
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.980
Other than what I do.
And we had this really good meeting and then at the end,

407
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.580
something about politics directly came up and he started saying this thing about

408
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:13.900
how it should be all women,

409
00:24:13.901 --> 00:24:17.070
we should give to get rid of all men in politics than it should be all women and

410
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:19.740
blah blah blah,
and we have to topple the patriarchy and everywhere.

411
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.230
And I thought,
hey,
you're talking about [inaudible] he was a white man.
I mean,

412
00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:26.530
so you're talking about taking yourself down [inaudible] he was also struck me

413
00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.990
as very successful.
Probably a million other like you're,

414
00:24:28.991 --> 00:24:31.690
you're like want to take all that down,
but also what are you actually saying?

415
00:24:31.691 --> 00:24:35.770
So it's not inherent that if you just had all women doing things that things

416
00:24:35.771 --> 00:24:39.250
would be better.
But that seems to be the weird place that we're in.
I wouldn't,

417
00:24:39.251 --> 00:24:41.470
I don't think things would be better if we only had men doing it either.

418
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.140
<v 2>No.</v>

419
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.140
And again like you to go back to your point about the war of the sexes w we are,

420
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.890
which is also a weird thing to just because of all of the gender stuff too,

421
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:56.570
it's like this weird war of the sexes.

422
00:24:56.571 --> 00:25:01.190
It's occurring under the s the idea that gender is a social construct.

423
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:03.260
I'm like right,
makes sense.

424
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.340
I feel like I'm losing my mind and I think a lot of people do.

425
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.690
Just normal people.
I mean I really,

426
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.240
I did a piece or I'm doing working on a piece.

427
00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:15.830
Then I asked people that email me like how are you being self son?

428
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.950
How are you self censoring what's happening?
So when he did this on Twitter?
Yeah,

429
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.280
yeah.
And got immediately everyone was like,
don't write this piece.

430
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:25.660
And okay now just started getting attacked by blue check.

431
00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:28.080
Verify journalists write this.
Yeah.

432
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.220
Journalists telling other journalists not to write a piece.
It's crazy.

433
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:34.730
But it's like,
it's like comedians policing other comedians for jokes.

434
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.840
This is another thing that I'm like,
are you kidding me guys?
When,

435
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.530
when did you become like,

436
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.180
I remember when everybody on the right was getting mad about rap music.

437
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:46.280
Like how is this the,

438
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:51.260
how are you the new literally have literacy comics calling for books not to be

439
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.480
Po.
I mean it's,
it's not.
So I,

440
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:58.550
and a lot of these mommies are getting shamed out of mommy groups because

441
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.380
they're not playing by the,

442
00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:06.170
the gender thing or they don't understand it or they're just trying,

443
00:26:06.171 --> 00:26:09.170
people are just trying to catch up and change in like one year.
Yeah.

444
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.470
And so one woman was writing me that,
um,

445
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.860
she went to get a birthday present and she walked into this store.

446
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.640
She lives in a liberal,
you know,

447
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:22.940
I think she's on the east coast in New York somewhere.
And she said,
Oh,

448
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:26.450
I can you wrap this for a girl?
And the woman,

449
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.910
she said,
you would have that I asked for.
And the woman was like,

450
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.320
we don't do that here.
Excuse me.
We have brown,

451
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:41.260
we have white,
we have gray,
we don't wrap for a gender.

452
00:26:41.261 --> 00:26:45.150
And she was rude to her about it and like said a white,
you know,

453
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.900
she didn't know.
And this is turning,

454
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:52.800
and I think this is why I scream to the,
to the left the most,

455
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.220
is that they don't understand that they're pushing people away.

456
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.660
<v 1>How much weight do you think is just that they,</v>

457
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.370
they have this thing where it's like if you don't accept what they accept as

458
00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:07.670
true,
the second they accept it,
you're the bad guy.

459
00:27:07.671 --> 00:27:12.370
So if you don't come around to exactly how they are on trans issues right then,

460
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.491
you know what I mean?

461
00:27:13.491 --> 00:27:17.150
Even if you're respectful of trans people and you're really trying to understand

462
00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:21.440
these issues and understand gender and sexuality and these things,

463
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.330
but if you don't do it the second they do it,

464
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:26.630
if you don't come around to gay marriage the second they do it,
you know,

465
00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:29.690
let's not forget Barack Obama was not for gay marriage the first time he ran.

466
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.100
History will not be too kind to him by these people's estimation.

467
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.450
<v 2>It's that I don't,
most people don't even know.</v>

468
00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:42.080
They're just there and they kind of stumble into these,

469
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:47.240
into these inadvertent,
my friend for example,
who did my makeup,

470
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.450
she said,
um,
she said,

471
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:53.690
my kids are coming home with fully formed opinions about Trump.

472
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.950
They're eight and 11 that she's not giving them.
She said,

473
00:27:57.951 --> 00:28:02.270
so where are they getting these opinions?
I had a family member who

474
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.780
<v 1>are freaking out about that.
I mean,</v>

475
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.090
<v 2>she just,
she says,
you know,
everybody,</v>

476
00:28:07.091 --> 00:28:10.600
they have conversations about it in her home.
She did make up for somebody.

477
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:15.460
She posted a picture of
herself and ankle.
They're just like,

478
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:17.920
hey,
look who I did again,
stumbled into,

479
00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:22.921
and she said she got completely eviscerated on Facebook and didn't even see it

480
00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:27.370
coming.
So I think a lot of people have when they see this,
you know,

481
00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:30.430
these kill shots that they,
they always go,

482
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.820
everybody swarms and other people observe this and the,

483
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:38.050
the public shaming and then it silences them.

484
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.970
So every time these little,

485
00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:43.870
and we don't know how many of these little micro shamings are occurring all

486
00:28:43.871 --> 00:28:48.460
across America.
And what worries me,
well,
not worries me,

487
00:28:48.461 --> 00:28:52.840
but what's interesting to me is how many people there are like me who have,

488
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.280
and you know,
people are coming from the right as well for their own reasons.

489
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.810
Um,
and now they're,
you know,

490
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.880
independence.
They're basically like,
well,
I,
I'm,

491
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:10.890
there's crazy stuff on both sides and I believe in common sense and reason and

492
00:29:12.431 --> 00:29:15.610
nuance and free speech and the,
you know,

493
00:29:15.611 --> 00:29:20.350
scientific method and radical.
It's radical.

494
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.630
I had a dream last night actually.
I was,

495
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.110
I think I was nervous and I had a dream that I was on the show and I said,

496
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.930
I'm coming in hot Dave.
I haven't been on Twitter.

497
00:29:28.931 --> 00:29:31.720
And it is liberating because I don't have to hear anything.

498
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.370
And I can say anything like,

499
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.030
boys and girls are different and you'll dream were like,
don't say that.

500
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.300
<v 1>You're welcome to say it.
In reality with the beauty of this is,</v>

501
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:46.270
so when we post this episode,
God only knows what you've said already,

502
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.760
that one of the Fed the masses and you won't even know for weeks,

503
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.710
but your cousin,
uh,
what's her name,

504
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.150
your cousin man is running your Twitter account now and sharing some stuff and

505
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:55.690
all that.

506
00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:00.690
So do you think there's any chance that some kind of new center can develop

507
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:02.020
here?

508
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.890
<v 2>I think there,
I'm optimists.
I Rhett run optimistic.</v>

509
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.380
I generally think that,
um,

510
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.970
I hope I saw,

511
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.920
I saw Claire's interview and you know,

512
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.070
she was saying we have to share the risk and I love that idea.
Yes,

513
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.130
I love that idea of sharing the rest of that.

514
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.740
But I also have nothing to lose.

515
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.820
I don't have children in school who will be punished by my politics,

516
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:31.420
by their teachers.
I mean,
one of my family members during the election,

517
00:30:31.421 --> 00:30:35.560
she had you tell her kids or teachers were insane because of this stuff.

518
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:38.530
They were coming home and telling her and they were crying and you know,

519
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:41.440
these are adults who are supposed to be teaching children.

520
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:44.800
And then she just said,
I had to tell him like,
your,
your are,

521
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.120
your teachers are insane,
right?

522
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.440
<v 1>You're basically sending your kids to a mental institution all day long and then</v>

523
00:30:49.441 --> 00:30:53.730
you bring it home where you go whack out.
Why did you come up with today?
Yeah.

524
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.240
<v 2>And then,
so I don't have,</v>

525
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:59.290
and I'm not working in a corporation where I have a job that I could lose.

526
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:03.520
I don't deal with Hr.
Thank God.
Because that sounds like a nightmare.

527
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:03.721
<v 1>Well,</v>

528
00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:06.690
you don't have nothing to lose because you've got writing gigs and you've got,

529
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.590
well,
either way for yourself.
I mean the,
the mob can come for anybody,
right?

530
00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:11.550
Like it.
So it's not nothing

531
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.100
<v 2>but people,
I guess I'll probably never know.</v>

532
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.180
Somebody like me will never know what I've lost.
So for Ensigns,

533
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.980
I don't know what doors have shot.
I know that my politics on Twitter,

534
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.930
we'll keep me out of writers' rooms for,
for sure.
Yeah.
And I know,

535
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:32.860
and I actually know that for a fact that even somebody looking for someone who

536
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:36.790
is somewhat Sentras thought that I was too far.
Right.
Which is

537
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.200
<v 1>right.
Well,
that's what they do to everybody.
Crazy.
That's the,</v>

538
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.120
<v 2>I mean,
it's,
so,
I know,</v>

539
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:46.290
I don't know that some show runner won't see my Twitter and say,
no,

540
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:50.070
forget that girl.
She's a Nazi.
Um,
I,

541
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.890
I do know that I had a really brilliant editor,
Joe Don Italia.

542
00:31:54.891 --> 00:31:57.990
He was my first editor of playboy and you said,
die on your own sword.

543
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.020
And I love that because that really is all that I can do and all that we can do.

544
00:32:03.751 --> 00:32:08.751
And the great thing about the Twitter hiatus has been really being able to step

545
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:14.580
back and look at the big picture and perspective and the bigger themes that keep

546
00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:19.170
coming up within these little mini micro outrageous and new cycles that we get

547
00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:21.120
all do you stop by?

548
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.770
And one of those is free speech.
I will die on that hill.

549
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.530
That is a hell I will die on.
I'll be right there with,
yeah,

550
00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:32.910
I will die on that hill.
And I,
and that was the biggest thing that I saw.

551
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.100
Um,
you know,
I have art Tavana,

552
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.090
he has amazing profiles with people.

553
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.500
Nobody will publish because they're just considered toxic.
Yeah.

554
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 1>One that was a great writer.
He,</v>

555
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.570
we were talking about him right before he wrote it and he happened to write a

556
00:32:46.571 --> 00:32:48.340
really nice piece about me and playboy where he,

557
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.970
where he was also critical of me and yeah,
but it was,

558
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.680
but he's an actual journalist and I thought,
yeah,

559
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.620
it took a lot for me to be willing to let him spend a day with me because I had

560
00:32:56.621 --> 00:33:00.010
been thrown under the bus by these guys who have been in my home many times.

561
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.450
But like I watched him for a while and I was like,
he seems decent enough.

562
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.251
<v 2>He is just,</v>

563
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:07.700
he was on my Pi doubts and he's great and he's been checking in with me during

564
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:11.030
this Twitter hate us and said,
I was essentially bananas,

565
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:14.300
but art was the one who I was,
we were talking about this,
you know,

566
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.730
do I have anything to lose?
And I said,
well,
I,

567
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.550
the hard thing for me being off Twitter is that I really can trace every single

568
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:26.060
dollar that I make through Twitter,
whether it's through an editor who found me.

569
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.280
That's how playboy originally found me.

570
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:32.510
That's how I mow most of my patrons come through.
Um,

571
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.120
Twitter and he said,
Roy,

572
00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:38.090
you're just a jar drug addict then started cooking meth in your base.

573
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.670
<v 2>Oh No.
But I do,
I wouldn't have met art.
And so there is this,</v>

575
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.700
again,
I'm optimistic.
I think that we,

576
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.370
there's this double edge sword of like w we are connected and we have,

577
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:58.430
are the conversations that are happening on podcasts that you have that Joe

578
00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.840
Rogan's having.
I know you guys are,
I'll,

579
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.620
I'll paying the price for it and I cannot tell you how many men have told me

580
00:34:05.621 --> 00:34:08.170
Jordan Peterson literally saved their life.

581
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.420
Whatever they want to think about him.

582
00:34:10.421 --> 00:34:14.020
He's helping people in a really tangible way.

583
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:18.160
And that is,
that is opt bads.

584
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.290
That is hopeful for me.
However,

585
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:24.190
when I see that there are less and less outlets for this,

586
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.960
that the gatekeepers seem to be,
um,
you know,

587
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.020
shutting down like no conservative columnists if you're a leftist publication.

588
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.580
The stuff I've seen in terms of d platforming on Patriana,

589
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:42.400
I mean I shed lots of people.

590
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.640
<v 1>You've got that at Tido.
We heard all our friends.</v>

591
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:48.960
I've had a lot of my cause but some of my friends are still out there and and

592
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:53.630
Brown Calamari yardies on there is there and there's a big hat and it's like I,

593
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.390
in that regard I kind of feel bad because we,
cause Jordan,

594
00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.320
Sam and I are leaving did cause like this or like little guys like me.

595
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:03.980
It's like I can totally see you my friend.
There's some things coming.

596
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.050
I mean there's at least two things coming.

597
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.030
I hope so because big and hopefully of these bro.

598
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.060
<v 2>Yeah,
there,
that's what worries me is that I do,</v>

599
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.840
I do believe that being able to have hard conversations talk about things.

600
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:25.120
Here are those things that you don't want to hear but be able to listen to them

601
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.940
know who is saying those things.
I want to know.

602
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:33.180
I don't want them to have to go underground and start groups and you know,

603
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.280
whatever they need to do.
Yeah,
go have your crazy youtube channel.

604
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.220
But then again,
I question the,
you know,
the,

605
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.430
what recently happened in New Zealand,

606
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.460
the these things that would generally be contained to small little groups in

607
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:55.131
like basement somewhere now do have a platform to kind of spread these ideas

608
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.470
quickly.

609
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.110
<v 1>Well,
was so interesting because the,
in the manifesto,</v>

610
00:36:00.111 --> 00:36:03.710
he's basically saying he wants to start this war,
right?

611
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.990
And then what does everyone do on both sides?

612
00:36:05.991 --> 00:36:08.660
They just start handing it to them and blade people,
blaming this person,

613
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:12.070
maybe this person and blaming this person and everyone calling each other Nazis.

614
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.890
And it's like you guys literally,
you're,
you're,
you're,

615
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.280
you're outsourcing your brains to people that are truly,

616
00:36:19.281 --> 00:36:20.570
truly dangerous.
Yeah.

617
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.900
You're saying to anyone that's out there do something crazy,
right?

618
00:36:23.901 --> 00:36:26.540
Something crazy and we're all going to pay attention to it.
It's like,

619
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:30.180
it's like me.
Worst really is the worst possible thing you can do.
Right.

620
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.090
<v 2>And itself,
there's a lot of what I worried about,</v>

621
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:35.490
I wrote this piece for playboy actually.
They'll,

622
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.960
they'll have me write it and it was,
um,

623
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:41.310
Donald Trump is already making America great again and I put it out on an

624
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.300
inauguration.
It was probably a little too soon for people to hear the message.

625
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.450
But essentially it was looking at the silver lining and I sat in,

626
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:52.740
I worry about the self fulfilling prophecy that every,
you know,

627
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:57.720
there's a great quote and that show deadwood and he,
the doctor says,
um,

628
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.990
I've seen more harm done with a man trying to justify their selves in a man

629
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:08.160
seeking to do harm and this is what worries me and what I see where it's like

630
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.720
you would rather have him be in collusion with Russia.

631
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:17.150
You would rather have him like be an ad,

632
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.110
a Nazi or whatever so that you can be right.
Yeah.

633
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.580
Like that's dangerous

634
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.270
<v 1>cause and effect.
You're saying you'd rather us be in world war three,
right,</v>

635
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.280
because Ruth is if he

636
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.070
<v 2>so that you can be right.
Yeah.
Like guys,</v>

637
00:37:31.071 --> 00:37:33.830
some of these things are good that they're not true,

638
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.040
but that's that and you know,
I,
again,

639
00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:40.490
I'm very much about doing work on yourself and keeping yourself in check and

640
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.030
that is something I constantly have to keep.

641
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.650
Even with like the Jessie's mom thing,
it's always all lying.
I was like,

642
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.590
something ain't right about this.

643
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.980
<v 1>But the media goes all in on it.
The candidates,
the democratic hands,
all said,</v>

644
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:57.740
what evidence of our evil,
racist country this is.

645
00:37:57.741 --> 00:37:59.660
I'm sure some of them haven't even deleted the tweet.
Yeah.

646
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.560
<v 2>Split.
Then today's news.
Yeah.</v>

647
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.640
And it's basically everything dropped.
But as you went,

648
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.180
<v 1>we're,
we're holding this for a couple of days.
So it was a few days ago that,</v>

649
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.530
that the,
that the charges against him were all dropped.
Right?
It's like what,

650
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.310
how were these charges dropped?
There's the guys,

651
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:18.410
there's the video of the guys picking up the news.

652
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.500
<v 2>But I had to check myself during that process to make sure that I wasn't just</v>

653
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:27.980
excited that I wasn't so excited to be right.

654
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.610
That I wasn't overlooking the fact that maybe he was actually this thing that

655
00:38:33.651 --> 00:38:36.740
actually happened.
I still don't think thank you dad.
Yeah.

656
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.230
But and through that whole process,
you know,
I think it's,

657
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.420
this is where I think each individual,

658
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.670
and it falls on us to do our due diligence on not just the news and our sources

659
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:51.970
of news,
but on ourselves.

660
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:56.080
And how much are we hoping for something so that we can be right.

661
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.290
That's something I think we all have to,

662
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.370
especially I would say to my friends on the left,

663
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.130
really look at that like,
yeah,
it's,

664
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.390
it's good that even when it came out that he may be faked a crime against

665
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:11.390
themselves and I,

666
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.030
it's good that these guys aren't walking around Chicago beating people.

667
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:16.864
That's a good thing.

668
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.510
<v 1>But in a weird way,
they need to be a Russian,
a Russian,</v>

669
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.220
the narrative they meet right.
For their narrative.
They need the Jesse smell,

670
00:39:25.221 --> 00:39:26.360
that thing to be real,

671
00:39:26.361 --> 00:39:30.500
to prove that America's racist in these things consistently proved not to be

672
00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.970
real.
But let's shift a little bit too,
because,
uh,
you,

673
00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:34.730
you write all sorts of things.
Am I okay?

674
00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:39.731
My usually dive into the topics that are the most controversial that'll get you

675
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:43.540
off Twitter pretty quick.
You just wrote this piece about,
uh,

676
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.330
you don't have to go to college,
basically.
Stop wasting your money.

677
00:39:47.331 --> 00:39:50.510
Stop wasting your money on.
No,
I don't think that was very popular.
Yeah,

678
00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:53.020
you did that in the spectator pretty recently.
Yeah.

679
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:57.710
And the idea was that there are ways to get jobs in the future trade schools and

680
00:39:57.711 --> 00:40:02.711
all sorts of other things that maybe you don't need this brainwashing experience

681
00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:04.180
for four years in the past.
Yeah,

682
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:09.350
<v 2>I was speaking with Carol Roth and she's brilliant and very into finance and you</v>

683
00:40:09.441 --> 00:40:10.230
know she mates,

684
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:15.180
we were talking about this and she said just the idea that it's like the return

685
00:40:15.181 --> 00:40:19.770
on investment for six figures for a five figure return on investment just

686
00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:20.730
doesn't make sense.

687
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.740
And I can only speak from personal experience and I for some people,

688
00:40:25.741 --> 00:40:28.770
college is what you need to do if you're going to specialize.
I,

689
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.920
my argument is that the automatic just go to college mentality and then getting

690
00:40:34.621 --> 00:40:37.610
out with this enormous amount of debt so that you can figure out what you want

691
00:40:37.611 --> 00:40:40.500
to do.
That's an expensive way to figure out why you want to do,

692
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.540
and I realized this pretty quickly into my first year of college.
My,

693
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.240
I would go after my first semester,

694
00:40:48.241 --> 00:40:52.530
I saw my loans and the debt that I was already in after one semester.

695
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.010
And I always wanted to be a writer and I was like,

696
00:40:56.011 --> 00:41:01.011
well I know how to write so I don't need to spend four years doing this and then

697
00:41:02.131 --> 00:41:06.330
get out and have that and then have to take jobs that I hate taking and be

698
00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:08.280
miserable so that I can pay off my debt.

699
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.810
Or when I was working up on a goat farm in northern California,

700
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.200
there was a girl who has the quotes around code by Green go green guy.

701
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.930
Um,
it was like this long term job.
I told my family I was working on,

702
00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:28.540
I go farm and they've,
you know,
like a humble county.
Yeah.

703
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:34.760
And there was a lot of people there who basically they,

704
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:39.740
it was not in their benefit to go into the workforce above,
you know,

705
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:44.120
they were working under the table obviously because then it didn't trigger their

706
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:48.470
student loans.
This is so there's like the deferment and I'm like,
what?

707
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.970
You're an engineer,
why are you,
why are you sitting here with me?

708
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:59.060
And I think that there are a million ways to skin a cat.

709
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:02.300
You know,
you,
we need trade workers,
we need,

710
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.880
we need,
um,

711
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:10.570
just so many different laborers and I've gotten a lot of criticism for this

712
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:13.430
article and a lot of it is fair.
Um,

713
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.990
<v 1>so what is it also that we just don't need certain things that people are being</v>

714
00:42:16.991 --> 00:42:19.960
taught?
It's not only that we need people that have certain skills,

715
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:21.010
like physical skills,

716
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.490
but it's also that a lot of the stuff that people are majoring in college,

717
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.930
if you're majoring in,
you know,
feminist dance or lesbian band,
I,
I mean,
you know,

718
00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:31.270
any of these things,
it's like,
okay,

719
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:34.770
well what do you think you just paid for for all of those years?

720
00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.890
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think I sat in my views like you're,</v>

721
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.000
if you go get a degree in gender studies,

722
00:42:40.001 --> 00:42:42.850
you're really only good for writing blogs on the Internet.
Yeah,
that's,

723
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.750
that's that.
What else are you going to do with that?
Maybe your teach,

724
00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:47.270
but what really,
what

725
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.250
<v 1>leads gender studies.
That's what you do.</v>

726
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.120
<v 2>What do you do though?
I mean,
what do you do with that degree?</v>

727
00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:56.050
So be practical about the,
I'm,
I generally,

728
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:59.110
because I have had to pay for it.
I didn't have,
if you are,

729
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:02.020
if someone's paying for houses or whatever,
go go to college,
get a degree.

730
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.210
There's a lot,
the pushback I've,

731
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.770
I've received that has been the most powerful is that statistically people die

732
00:43:08.771 --> 00:43:11.290
sooner if they don't go to college.
Now I would think,

733
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.320
I think this probably has a lot to do with socio economic factors that are not

734
00:43:16.721 --> 00:43:20.850
necessarily being taken into consideration as Asian correlation.
Right.

735
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.170
But the,
yeah,
exactly.

736
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.310
But I everybody went to college.

737
00:43:27.311 --> 00:43:29.830
So it's also a study that you're like,
well,

738
00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:33.220
there's an entire generation of people that went to college or what about a

739
00:43:33.221 --> 00:43:37.660
generation of people who may be when became trade workers and maybe they went

740
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:42.370
and uh,
whatever Lord taught themselves how to Code Online,

741
00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:45.520
which is what my,
another family member of mine dead.
There's so many.

742
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.780
<v 1>It also sounds like a new version of like of like servitude to the likewhen when</v>

743
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:53.580
Bernie gets out there and he's like free college for everyone,

744
00:43:53.581 --> 00:43:54.780
which we know of course no is not free.

745
00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:58.920
And then he says a guarantee of a federal job.
That sounds horrible.

746
00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:00.960
So if we're going to four,

747
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.660
I mean in effect you're going to force everyone to go to college because the few

748
00:44:03.661 --> 00:44:07.080
people who won't want it will be shamed into doing it and wasting their time

749
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:10.560
when they probably have all sorts of other skills and can do,
all right,

750
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.221
I'll go to school.

751
00:44:11.221 --> 00:44:14.340
They can learn how to do coding or whatever else learned to code.

752
00:44:14.341 --> 00:44:19.020
I don't know if I'm even allowed to say [inaudible] going to go the of guys

753
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.080
they're done,
but like,

754
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.660
and then the guarantee is that you'll get a federal job.
That sounds cool.

755
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.341
So you can work,

756
00:44:26.341 --> 00:44:29.790
you can be a pencil pusher for the government with no real chance of ever

757
00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:32.010
growing,
but you know,
never be fired.

758
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:35.730
So you just stay there forever and just suck money off other people.

759
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.753
That sounds terrible.

760
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.770
<v 2>I'm not a genius by any means,
but I know I don't,</v>

761
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.850
I don't want no one to work for the government.

762
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:48.780
I don't want them to have much of my money to do things where they just don't

763
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:53.520
seem to be that effect of every government institution I've had to deal with.

764
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.120
Yeah,

765
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.490
<v 1>well you got to love it.
The lefties,
Trump is Hitler.</v>

766
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:58.630
There were the government's evil,
the patriarchy,
patriarchy.

767
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.170
What's their answered more money,
give them more money.

768
00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:01.810
<v 2>I had,</v>

769
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.300
I got into it with a friend about this the other night and I felt bad because we

770
00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:09.800
hadn't talked in a while and I didn't realize that he,
he was,
um

771
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.270
<v 4>hmm.</v>

772
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.500
<v 2>As fully</v>

773
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.520
indoctrinated in the approved message as he was.

774
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.420
And I really just tend to ask questions and it's amazing how angry he was

775
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:25.860
getting at my questions.
He said,
you know,

776
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:29.940
I'm tired of all these white supremacists talking.
They can all just shut up.

777
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:33.340
And I said,
okay,
but why do you want to take her?

778
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.870
Like why do you want to give away your guns and cause then he went off on a

779
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:40.380
tangent about that.
And that I'm like,
I just want to know the logic.
That's it.

780
00:45:40.381 --> 00:45:41.010
And he just

781
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:44.010
<v 1>did it ever gets to a logical point because I,</v>

782
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:46.980
I've had these conversations with friends and now sometimes former.
Yeah,

783
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:49.150
<v 2>yeah.
It might be a farmer friend.</v>

784
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.880
<v 1>Do you ever find that like there's,
they always move the goalpost,</v>

785
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.930
they always change the definition of words or they change how history is like,

786
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.920
do you ever find in one of those conversations you can get it to something that

787
00:46:00.921 --> 00:46:01.754
has some shape?

788
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.150
<v 2>We had,</v>

789
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.920
you know how the conversation started because I made the mistake of telling him

790
00:46:10.251 --> 00:46:13.880
that I was doing the Glenn Beck Radio show and I didn't even think twice about

791
00:46:13.881 --> 00:46:15.050
it because I'm used to,

792
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.700
now I occupy a space that's a little bit more centrist and so I got,

793
00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:20.120
I got,

794
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.120
I got lazy then his Fred felling,

795
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.490
yeah,
I just want,
the governor never got up and I got,

796
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:33.320
I was laughing so I was talking to him and he just like lost it on me.

797
00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:35.810
I was like,
you're going on the,
and I said,

798
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.410
I will have this conversation with anyone who's willing to have a conversation

799
00:46:39.411 --> 00:46:40.220
with me about that.

800
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.620
<v 1>What was his implication at Glenn Beck is a white supremacist.</v>

801
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.690
<v 2>Well yeah,
obviously anyone now that that the whole idea,</v>

802
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.310
and this is why I'm not sure how we escaped from the spine area and I was

803
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:53.100
writing about this yesterday and my journal,

804
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.300
they can't run on Twitter anymore and um,
may at the end of this,

805
00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:59.760
if you want me to tweet out something very powerful for you,

806
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:04.670
screenshots of my journal.
Yeah.
Um,
Billy's out,
no,

807
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.560
I was writing about how,
because I'm making sure,

808
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.580
I always try to make sure that I keep myself abreast of the,

809
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.570
of whatever is being written on the left as well.
And

810
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:16.703
<v 4>Aye,</v>

811
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.160
<v 2>I'm not sure how you escaped the binary of essentially the Republican Party is</v>

812
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.250
the party of white supremacy and if you are conservative or Republican,

813
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:32.260
you are basically doing everything to uphold white supremacy.

814
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.160
And they're not saying that's true.
You're just saying,
that's I'm saying this is,

815
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:40.420
yeah,
this seems to be what the messaging is.
That as,
as I understand it,

816
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:45.160
I could be wrong,
but this seems to be what I'm reading and,
and uh,

817
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:46.660
what I,
what I'm hearing,

818
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.170
and I don't know how you escaped that binary.

819
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.770
<v 1>Well,
think you relentlessly,
you have to call these people out,
right?
I mean,
that,</v>

820
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:58.000
that's all you can do.
It's just not the case.
It's just not true.

821
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.160
But they own so much of the media and so much,
right?

822
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.030
It's academia at everything else that these messages keep coming through.

823
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:07.240
And now you've got a friend of yours probably telling you you're a white

824
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:08.770
supremacy.
[inaudible] Glenn Beck.

825
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.180
<v 2>I,
I was,
I was a white supremacist for doing Ben Shapiro's election special.</v>

826
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.430
I mean,
that was,
he

827
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.390
<v 1>white supremacists likes more than an orthodontist.</v>

828
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.080
<v 2>I'm fairly,
apparently you can,
that,
that can be the case.</v>

829
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.430
And so that,
that's,
um,
I recently,

830
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:31.090
I mean,
I stepped into,
I stepped into it and it was my own fault.

831
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:36.091
I hadn't had coffee and I was tweeting recklessly and I,

832
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:38.920
um,
I said something,

833
00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:43.921
I came in defense of that white kid that was on the Gq cover and I was,

834
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:45.551
and I said,

835
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:49.720
like the war on white men and I meant to put quotes on it because yeah.

836
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.590
And I didn't know coffee and this is not an excuse that it was like early and I

837
00:48:53.591 --> 00:48:55.210
was like,
oh,
there's not enough space,

838
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:59.470
we'll get possibly go wrong and not thinking.
And I got,

839
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:03.850
it was like two days of your garbage,
essentially your garbage.

840
00:49:03.851 --> 00:49:07.780
I got called the grand wizard and it is weird when you're,
you know,

841
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:11.740
being called racist used to be like the worst yeah.
In salts.

842
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:16.741
And I grew up learning that that was a horrible and salt and so to have that and

843
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:21.100
somebody kind of stepped James Lindsey,
I actually stepped in and he was like,

844
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:25.150
Bridget,
I see what's happening here.
You are up against,
you know,

845
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.100
like critical theory and you need to just like log out and say nothing because

846
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:35.080
it will all be used as proof that you are a racist essentially.

847
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.660
Yeah.
And it was,
you know,

848
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:41.110
there's parts of it that were upsetting obviously,

849
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:45.030
and then parts of it that I was like,
this is not,
why are you calling me garbage?

850
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.390
Would you say that to my face?

851
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.400
<v 1>Yeah.
Well there are anonymous and they're on Twitter.
Yeah,</v>

852
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.120
<v 2>they're not.
These were blue checks like they weren't,
oh it was,
it was a,</v>

853
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:55.720
it was a,
yeah,
it was a

854
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.370
<v 1>w.
What do you make,
let's just back up to this point that the eye,</v>

855
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.750
cause I saw this happen to you on Twitter,

856
00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:03.900
that there were journalists actually trying to stop you from writing a piece.

857
00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:06.900
What,
where do you,
what do you think about just the state of journalism?

858
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:10.470
Because to me,
to me at the moment,
especially after the last,
you know,

859
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.500
little time with the Mueller investigation or anything like it's over.

860
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:16.200
It really like CNN and MSNBC,

861
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.040
whatever shred of remote credibility they have left,

862
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:22.620
they've destroyed the New York Times is basically destroyed itself.

863
00:50:22.621 --> 00:50:26.120
I don't say any of that with pleasure.
People think I'm saying it like,
Ha,

864
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:29.570
I'm not.
I,
if,
if those guys could just be a little bit better,

865
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.280
what they can self reflect,

866
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:35.240
self reflect or just instead of doubling down every time,
like now,

867
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:38.300
now they're all trying to throw Mueller under the bus cause he didn't do exactly

868
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.100
what they wanted and now we've got to instigate,

869
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.610
investigate him and just more government everywhere.
And it's like,

870
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.810
what are you guys chasing you chasing your own shadow,
right.

871
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.840
<v 2>It's the state of journalism is,</v>

872
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:53.260
is very worrisome to me because it,

873
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.620
and I do sometimes wonder about journalists on Twitter because you need it in

874
00:50:59.261 --> 00:51:02.290
one respect.
But on the other respect,
you see everyone's politics.

875
00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:06.280
So how could anything that you,
they row being unbiased,
you know,

876
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:10.330
where everyone's coming from.
And I do wonder,
did,

877
00:51:10.331 --> 00:51:11.980
do you know Matt,
um,

878
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:17.080
how do you say his last name t to be Eba kb.
He wrote a piece,

879
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.973
a couple of them

880
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.380
<v 1>thing.
Yeah.</v>

881
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.340
<v 2>About,
yeah.</v>

882
00:51:20.341 --> 00:51:23.580
And just had the state of journalism and he's been doing some really great

883
00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:26.070
reporting,
actual journalistic reporting,

884
00:51:26.071 --> 00:51:30.690
and he listed all of the links to every single thing that all of these

885
00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:31.501
organizations,

886
00:51:31.501 --> 00:51:36.300
CNN and the New York Times of sad and he compares it to the WMD.
Um,

887
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.580
you know,
he,
I think he,

888
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:42.690
there are still journalists who are critical of their fellow journalists.

889
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:47.360
And the criticism that came to me when I reached out for self censorship was

890
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:47.791
like,
oh,

891
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:52.190
here comes Bridgette writing another piece about how Trump supporters are self

892
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.910
censored.
No,
actually quite the contrary.
That's not what I'm looking for.

893
00:51:56.911 --> 00:51:57.300
I'm,

894
00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.770
I'm wondering how liberals ourselves censoring and they don't want to hear it.

895
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.270
Generally somebody said,
you know,

896
00:52:03.271 --> 00:52:05.910
and you get the most flack when you're over the target.
Yeah.

897
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:10.290
And I definitely just,
the fact that everyone piled on,
they don't,

898
00:52:10.291 --> 00:52:15.291
they do not want to hear how they might be pushing their own party away.

899
00:52:17.431 --> 00:52:20.100
People in their party.
And these are the people that they need.

900
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.790
There's no more votes to the left to the far left.

901
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.970
You've gone as far left as you can go.
Boys.
And girls aren't different anymore.

902
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:28.150
We can't go anywhere

903
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.940
<v 1>for the last,</v>

904
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.930
well that's why they want to lower the voting age to 16 though know.

905
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:33.110
I mean really that's it.

906
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:36.110
But the lower the voting age change electorial college ads,

907
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.190
members of the Supreme Court.

908
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:40.880
I mean these are all ideas that are being floated by them right now because yes,

909
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:44.560
there's no that that intersectional competing interest,

910
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.300
cacophony can't hold forever.
You run out of people destroyed,

911
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.410
<v 2>come back a little bit and be somewhat reasonable.</v>

912
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.750
<v 1>If only somebody had been talking about this for these last five years.</v>

913
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.580
<v 2>Yeah.
What do you feel?</v>

914
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Do you feel like people are from the left or are kind of waking up as well or do

915
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:11.740
you feel like they're just as the cognitive desinence just like I need to just,

916
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.110
<v 1>I would double down.
Yeah,</v>

917
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.120
the core of the left where the energy of the left is so like Cortez and Omar and

918
00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:22.240
that whole new crew in the democratic socialists who are only holding onto the

919
00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:24.900
word democratic for another year or two and then they'll just be social.
This,

920
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.420
I think they've got all the energy they've got.

921
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:30.360
They feel like they have the young people.
They certainly have the woke media.

922
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.400
And what's happening is,
and this is why I'm actually hopeful,
uh,

923
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.420
because you said you were an optimist.
I always say I'm a world weary optimist.

924
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.160
It's like I believe that.
Yeah,

925
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:40.620
they can keep doing that and they will implode on itself.

926
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:43.310
You're going to have to take down Bernie one day.
He's an old white man.
You'll,

927
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.670
you'll,
you'll destroy each other.

928
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.840
But what I think mostly will happen is the d decent liberals like yourself.

929
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:53.400
We'll just more and more realize that there is something happening center,
right?

930
00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:55.140
Right now that is not racist,

931
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.360
that is based on freedom and liberty and individual rights and is respectful of

932
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.111
differences.

933
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:04.410
And there's some pro choice people there and some prolife people and some gay

934
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:08.130
people and straight people.
And I think that's where the,
the few,

935
00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:12.450
I think that if America will continue as a great nation and a free nation,

936
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:15.720
that's the future of it.
The other thing,
they're not going to stop.

937
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.260
They can't stop.
They've had so many chances to stop Trump president.

938
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.210
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

939
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.040
<v 1>That seems like it would have been a reason to reflect.</v>

940
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.770
<v 2>No,</v>

941
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:27.770
this is the crazy thing is the conversation with my friend who might not any

942
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.850
feed my friend anymore.
He said,
well,
he's not gonna win.
I'm like,

943
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.673
<v 5>yeah,</v>

944
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.690
<v 2>I hear this all the time from people.
How can you say that</v>

945
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.123
he won?

946
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:45.310
You are saying to me the exact same thing that you said in 2016 that you said

947
00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:50.570
was impossible.
Your saying it's impossible.
I'm get like,
how are you saying this?

948
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:54.800
How cognitive dissonance,
I don't understand.
I don't understand that.

949
00:54:54.801 --> 00:54:59.270
That's where I'm at.
That's where I just,
I'm like,
okay,
bye,
bye.

950
00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:03.020
I try to be,
I listened,
but there are certain things where I'm,
I'm like,

951
00:55:03.021 --> 00:55:06.890
I don't understand how you can think.
That's a logical thought to have.

952
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.260
There's no chance.
It's impossible.

953
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.760
<v 1>Yeah.
The thing that just happened,</v>

954
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.410
<v 2>the thing that just happened that you said was impossible and he said,
well,</v>

955
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.410
you have to understand bridges.
Then when you say that to people,

956
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:22.510
you are basically shitting on all of their hope.
And I'm like,
well,

957
00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:26.320
okay,
so now it's my responsibility to take care of everyone else in the world's

958
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:26.711
feelings.

959
00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:30.790
And this is the new thing where you're supposed to just manage everyone in the

960
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:31.600
world's.

961
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.200
One of the first things I learned in Rehab when I was 19 is that it's none of my

962
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:37.340
business how anyone feels about me.
Yeah.

963
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.420
And now it's like apparently I have to make sure everyone around me is okay.

964
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:43.850
And

965
00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.440
<v 1>because then you can never think about yourself.</v>

966
00:55:45.441 --> 00:55:46.790
And that's really what they don't want.

967
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.870
<v 2>It's a,
it's interesting.</v>

968
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.070
<v 1>I agree.
That's what they really want.</v>

969
00:55:50.071 --> 00:55:52.200
They don't want you to be able to think about what you really think.

970
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.230
So they keep you focused on everybody else all the time.

971
00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.370
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean it's,
I think we're living in,
I'm excited.</v>

972
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:04.190
I like,
most people are like,
oh,
they just times that we live.
I love it.

973
00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:08.930
I think it's exciting and I think it's dangerous and terrifying as well.

974
00:56:08.931 --> 00:56:11.130
And there are days,
you know,

975
00:56:11.131 --> 00:56:15.560
when I was getting these emails about how people self sensor it was,

976
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.700
I was in a dark place and my cousin came over Maggie and she said,

977
00:56:19.701 --> 00:56:24.701
we need to get you the f out of this like whole year in because it was hundreds

978
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.850
of hundreds of emails.
But the language people are using.

979
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.720
Thank you for giving me permission to speak freely.
Thank you for allowing me to,

980
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.540
I'm s I F I don't know if this will end up anywhere,

981
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:36.770
but it just feels so good to get that out.
And these,

982
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.660
they assume they're in these things and people saying,
you know,
the,
the,

983
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.150
some of the people on the left trolled man had it all.

984
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.730
They were like these intentionally racist things.

985
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:49.000
But most of the emails I got were very thoughtful and very,

986
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.640
um,
you know,

987
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.690
places there's people are,

988
00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.230
<v 1>well it's not people that are sticking out far right positions,</v>

989
00:57:00.231 --> 00:57:01.130
I think is what you're saying.

990
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.090
People that are just saying maybe I'm for low taxes or something and they were

991
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:06.370
afraid to say it because you're getting oh,
your concerned.

992
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:07.830
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

993
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:12.890
And also just the way that it's infecting policy,

994
00:57:13.441 --> 00:57:18.330
like you say you'd like we've used has been set on here and people say that the

995
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:22.980
politics are downstream of culture.
So just the way that,

996
00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:28.020
uh,
one man was saying,
well,
it's,
um,

997
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:33.680
we really are afraid to criticize the code of certain hires because it could end

998
00:57:35.071 --> 00:57:38.100
you up in HR.
And so,
and he's like,

999
00:57:38.101 --> 00:57:40.320
and this is code that is kind of important.

1000
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:46.600
These are the soft of affects of,
you know,
on the marketplace.

1001
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.680
And then the world of ideas that we can't see that were,

1002
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:57.710
and you can really only see if you ask for people to be truly honest and

1003
00:57:58.561 --> 00:58:01.530
fearless or if people start speaking up,

1004
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.690
but you're not going to see that.
Um,
because it's so subtle.

1005
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:11.400
It's so insidious.
That's the thing about self censorship.
It's so it starts,

1006
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.520
you know,
it starts in the mind and then,

1007
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.710
<v 1>and once you start doing it,
you just keep going.</v>

1008
00:58:16.711 --> 00:58:19.170
It's almost impossible to remember that original person

1009
00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:22.270
<v 2>and it's easier to,
for instance,</v>

1010
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.300
you can't burn a buck if you get it banned before it's even published.

1011
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.820
I mean these are things that I deeply concerned me there more concerning.

1012
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:39.870
I feel like there's a lot of corruption and stuff that that we have to take aim

1013
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:40.930
at.
You know,

1014
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:45.100
I feel like it's our job as citizens and this is really my,

1015
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.030
my big,

1016
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:50.950
where I stand now is kind of with you I guess in the middle and saying like the

1017
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:52.870
center must hold.
We,

1018
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.990
I had abandoned my job as a citizen of looking critically at everybody and the

1019
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:04.270
fact that somebody like myself or you who might be looking critically at things

1020
00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:08.530
on the right and critically on things on the right that's controversial is,

1021
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:14.550
is very bad news for democracy because that is our job as citizens not to be

1022
00:59:14.771 --> 00:59:16.000
loyal to some party.

1023
00:59:16.001 --> 00:59:21.001
It's to be critical of our leaders and all the people who want to leaders,

1024
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:22.160
not

1025
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.140
<v 1>just like on some team.
This isn't like the red sox and the Yankees.</v>

1026
00:59:26.141 --> 00:59:28.610
They shouldn't automatically vote for whoever Katy Perry like,

1027
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.030
I mean Taylor swift silence is definitely

1028
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:38.500
is definitely we are going to do this many times more.
I have no doubt.
I,

1029
00:59:38.501 --> 00:59:43.040
I'm glad we finally did.
We need people like you out there doing this stuff.

1030
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:47.610
We need straight,
white,
heterosexual,
cisgender chicks.
I mean,

1031
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.100
that's basically what you are.

1032
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:53.450
I just think people need to know they're not alone.
I think a lot of people,

1033
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:57.320
what I've realized from the self censorship bed,
people think they're alone.

1034
00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.250
They're not alone.

1035
00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:01.760
If you're a reasonable person out there and you're feeling like you're going

1036
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:06.320
crazy,
you're not alone and there's,
you know,
reach out to you,

1037
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.450
email me,
whatever.
If you feel,
if you're in the dark place,
um,

1038
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:13.940
yeah.
And find,

1039
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.870
find others who you can speak freely with and have conversations with because I

1040
01:00:17.871 --> 01:00:21.230
think that is important.
That's why I'm doing stand up again and we got to go.

1041
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:22.790
We'll do a gig together.
Yeah.

1042
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:25.820
They're together because that's the point of it is just messing around with the

1043
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:28.730
crowd.
We get in that room and we just got,
that would be so fun.

1044
01:00:28.731 --> 01:00:31.760
It's like I want people to look around the room and be like,
yeah,
guess what?

1045
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.250
That guy likes Trump.
You like Bernie.
It's okay.

1046
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:38.480
We're not killing each other now we're going to do that.
Yeah,
that'd be great.

1047
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:42.810
Well,
