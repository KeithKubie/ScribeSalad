00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.070
Here is Marla,
we already know her story.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.290
Many chronic diseases leading
to many medications and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.180
many encounters with
the healthcare system.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.260
As a result,
her chart is large and complex.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.990
And should she visit her PCP,
if she had one, they would need a quick

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.020
overview of it to adequately plan
the visit and her comprehensive care.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.190
Her friend Doris on the left
works out regularly and

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.410
rarely goes to her physician.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.040
Today she's visiting because
she overdid things a bit and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.170
sprained her right knee.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.460
Doris' chart is thin, and there's
really not much else for her PCP to be

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.910
concerned with, other than any routine
preventive care that might be due.
