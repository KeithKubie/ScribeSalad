1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.763
Okay.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
What I did last time with describe to you a certain heat and didn't call the car

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.390
no engine.
So let me refresh your memory on what that was.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.560
The whole engine consisted of a gas

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.240
without some pressure and some volume

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.840
and the gas was subject to a cycle

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.870
and the cycle went like this.
You start at some point a,

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.860
you expand at a certain temperature tea,
you want isothermally,

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.770
you come to the point B.

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.930
So the way you should imagine that is that this gas is placed on a reservoir.

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.830
Who's temperature is frozen?
I mean stuck that t one there's a worse,

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.330
never changed the temperature.

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.560
And what you do is you lift one grain after another of sand.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.540
So you let the gas expand but you don't let it cool down the minute it tries to

15
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.980
call some,
he'll go from below,

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.230
they maintain the temperature and start at that volume and entered that volume.

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.510
During this process,
some amount of heat.

18
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.860
Q one enters the gas.

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.420
Next thing you do,
you let the gas expand some more,

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.780
but not you let it expand.
Ed diabetically.

21
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.620
Aerobatic means you put the whole thing in a heat insulating material so no heat

22
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:36.090
can go in a route.
Now you can see if it expands,

23
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.030
it's going to have to pay for it with its own internal energy.

24
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.380
So the temperature will drop.

25
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.310
So you wait until it drops to a lower temperature t two then you go backwards

26
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.964
like this.

27
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.810
That's when you start compressing the gas by putting some grains of sand back.

28
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.380
But this time the gas is kept in a lower temperature on top of the temperature

29
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:05.130
reservoir t two and you drop more sand on it to compress it.

30
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.720
There is this part
during this portion,

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.640
heat will actually be rejected by the gas.
Why is he rejected?

32
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.090
Because normally when you compress the gas,
you're doing work on it.

33
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.350
The energy should go up,
the energy goes up,
the temperature should go up,

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.210
but you're not letting the temperature go up.

35
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.340
You're forcing it to have the temperature t too.

36
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.950
So it'll reject heat into this heat pack.

37
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.830
And finally you come back to starting point by further compression.

38
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.500
But Idea Batek and antibiotic means it's insulated from the outside world.

39
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.513
No heat flow,

40
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.590
so there are four parts to things you have to notice about the car.
No engine.

41
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.660
In fact,
let me draw a schematic of the cardinal ended.

42
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.930
This is the standard where people draw that the engine takes some heat

43
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.570
from the furnace or t one it has some cure to rejected at the exhaust,

44
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.370
which is a t two added delivers certain Armando work with by the law of

45
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.250
conservation of energy.
I have to be Q one minus Q two

46
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.380
do you understand that the work then by the gas is equal to that and who paid

47
00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:25.070
for it?
If the reservoir upper as a wire furnished the heat,

48
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.700
some heat was rejected downstairs at the difference between the two is the work?

49
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.623
<v 1>No,</v>

50
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.320
<v 0>we call this a cyclic process because at the end of the day the gas has come</v>

51
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:42.950
back to edit this.
That's very important.
If you want to make an engine,

52
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.080
it's not enough to convert.

53
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.170
The whole purpose of heat engines was to burn something and get some work out of

54
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.430
it,
but you don't want it to be a one shot thing.

55
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.970
You want to be able to do it over and over and over again and you can do that

56
00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:59.450
with this engine because after the cycle it's back to where it started and you

57
00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:00.950
can do this any number of times.

58
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.910
Now we define an efficiency for the same engine,

59
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.350
which is what you get divided by what you pay for,

60
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.810
what you get from the dentist.
Of course,

61
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:16.310
the work w and what you pay for is a call that you burn,

62
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.390
which is do you want no writing ws Cuban minus Q two you can write this as one

63
00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:25.280
minus Q two over Q one.

64
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.040
This is true for any engine,
any engine,
even if it's not a car,
new engine,

65
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.070
uh,
by the law of conservation of energy,

66
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.960
you can write something like this anyway,
let,
let me say for the car,
the engine,

67
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:40.310
I got this as the efficiency.

68
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.370
Now why is the efficiency not 100% that's because Q two is not zero.

69
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.080
You can say,
why aren't we building a stupid engine that rejects him heat?

70
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.590
Why not just use all of it in some other fashion?

71
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.360
And that's what we're going to talk about,

72
00:04:56.361 --> 00:05:00.170
but assuming that the engine operates between two temperatures,

73
00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.860
the furnace temperature and the ambient atmospheric temperature,

74
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.440
you can calculate the efficiency for this engine by actually calculating youtube

75
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.333
and Q one.

76
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
That's the simple problem of integrating the work done in going from here to

77
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.540
here.
Do you remember that one minus n r

78
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.760
t one log VB over to be a and downstairs you have an r d to Log VC over vd.

79
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.010
Again,
you got to remember why that is true.
When you go from a to B,

80
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.700
there is no change in internal energy because the temperature is the same.

81
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.990
Therefore the work done and the heat input or equal numerically.

82
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.800
So Q two is the work done in Q one as the worked on there.
So that's what I got.

83
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.410
Then I did a little bit of calculation to show you by using the fact that B c

84
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.650
out of idea Batek curb a and D or an antibody curve,

85
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.110
that these logs actually canceled.

86
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.350
These guys of course cancel to give the final result,

87
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.020
one minus t two over t one that's the bottom line.
Uh,

88
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.220
I don't care what else you remember,

89
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:17.330
but this is something I need for today's discussion.
Efficiency of the car.

90
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:21.410
No engine is one minus p over t one.

91
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.570
Okay?

92
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.570
Now you can say why I'd be interested in this very primitive engine containing a

93
00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:37.110
cylinder and gas and so on.
Uh,
okay.

94
00:06:37.111 --> 00:06:38.610
This is the efficiency of the stupid engine.

95
00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:43.180
I'm sure people can build a better engine,
so hit his car noise clean.

96
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.110
Mister Carlos says,

97
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.730
no engine
can be at my engine.
Okay?

98
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:57.300
That's this claim
by beat my engine.

99
00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.910
He means no engine can be more efficient than my engine

100
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.220
and he's going to demonstrate that.
I'm going to demonstrate that for you.

101
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.320
You don't get something for nothing.

102
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.620
It's based on the following postulate with a told you last time.

103
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.750
I'm just going to write it.
I will repeat it.

104
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.860
We had been apostolate as the second law of thermodynamics.
That is impossible.

105
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.830
Define a process.
The sole result of which is the transfer,

106
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.870
some heat from a cold body to hot body.

107
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.330
We all know you can transfer heat from a cold body to hot body in a
refrigerator.

108
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.180
You take heat out of the freezer and dump it into the room.

109
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.520
No one says that's wrong,

110
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.210
but that's not the sole effect because you get an electric bill at the end of

111
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.370
the month because it's a compressive doing a lot of work.

112
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.610
The claim is not no other agency in the end.

113
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:50.190
Should it be affected in any fashion?
You find the end of the day,

114
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.660
all you had was heat flow uphill.
That's not allowed.
That's a postulate.

115
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.510
You have to grant them that postulate,

116
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.380
which we accept to be phenomenologically valley,
but taking that postulate,

117
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.920
cardinal will not show you that.
No Indian can beat his engine.

118
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.130
The key to the whole car,
no engine is that it is a reversible agent.

119
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.290
Waited versable engine.
I mean at every step in the car and the cycle.

120
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.530
Let's say going from here to here,

121
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.170
I can also go backwards.

122
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.150
I can put a grain of sand and compress the piston or I can take a grain of sand.

123
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.690
It'll go back to where it was.
You'd never far from equilibrium.

124
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:34.810
And if you can go one way you can go the other way.
That also means the car,

125
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:39.811
no engine starting at the point a can go backwards to d then to see then to be,

126
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:44.970
and then two a is the cardinal engine went backwards.

127
00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:46.020
It will look like this.

128
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.920
It will take heed Q one,
sorry.
It'll take heat.
Cute too.

129
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.500
Somebody will give it where and will reject you won at this temperature.

130
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.830
This is the car,
no refrigerator
and that's the car,
no engine,

131
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.190
the cardinal in general refrigerator at the same machine.

132
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.440
We just can make it run one way or the opposite way.

133
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.620
That's what we are going to use.

134
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.980
So let me give you a demonstration a that's for as far as I can tell,

135
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:22.800
it's good enough for our present purpose that you cannot beat cardinal engine.

136
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.320
So let us say a car,
no engine,
take some heat.

137
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.430
Say 100 calories deliverance,

138
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.840
20 calories and work for the next 80 calories is operating between some two

139
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.350
temperatures.
Do you want an t two this is the car.
No,

140
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.420
I'm taking a particular example where the efficiencies what a one fifth

141
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.230
but don't worry about the fact that uh,
yeah,

142
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.890
so it's one fifth so one minus t two over t one should be one field.

143
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.130
Now if you say you have a better engine,
you have a better efficiency.

144
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.820
What you really mean is that your engine can take a hundred calories and deliver

145
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.350
more than 20 calories.

146
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.940
Maybe it'll deliver 40 calories and reject only 60 calories when it's also

147
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:22.110
operating between the same two temperatures.
This is your engine.

148
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.000
You for no why for your engine.

149
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.560
Okay,
you an engine is better than Carlos engine.
That's your claim.

150
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.080
You're not going to get shot down.
So how am I going to shoot this down?

151
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.180
I'm going to run the car,
no engine backwards.
First thing

152
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.260
that I'm going to get a card,
no engine,
which is twice as big as this car.

153
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:52.350
No Indian,
it's not more efficient.
We just got twice as much gas.

154
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.590
If you take a car,
no engine,
do the following things,

155
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.780
run it backwards and make it twice as big.
What will that cardinal engine do?

156
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.150
It will look like this.

157
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.560
It will take up 160 calories from downstairs.

158
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.520
It will want 40 calories input and it'll dump 200 calories upstairs.

159
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.560
So this is a two times car now a little bit,

160
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.980
put a start saying it's cardinal run backwards.

161
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.520
See,
it doesn't take any special genius to make an engine bigger.

162
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.280
It won't be more efficient.
It'll be have the same efficiency.

163
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.440
But if we can build something with one piston,

164
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.620
I can make the same design with the bigger piston or smaller piston.

165
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.060
I'm just saying I wanted it to be twice as big for the following simple reason.

166
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.560
Your Indians giving out 40 units of work.

167
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.140
Mine refrigerated needs 40 to run.

168
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.690
So what we do is we directly take the output from your engine and feed it to my

169
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:52.524
refrigerator.

170
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:55.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.390
<v 0>Okay.
Your heating and didn't mix work.
My referee debris,</v>

172
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.500
refrigerator needs work and I've scaled mine so that it's appetite matters.

173
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.920
Europe.
That's all I've done.
Now let's drop box around.

174
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.610
These guys.
Don't look under the hood and see what you've got

175
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.950
at the end of a full cycle,
when everything is done,
all the gases,

176
00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:19.440
all the Pistons,
everything has come back to where it starts.

177
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.970
But no need to plug this gadget into the wall.

178
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.890
You don't have to plug this into anything because this refrigerator's getting

179
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:33.430
the power from this heat engine.
It doesn't need external power.

180
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.180
I look at the lower reservoir.
I see a hundred calories leaving.

181
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.060
You see that 60 coming down in one 60 going up.

182
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.830
I look at the upper cat reservoir.

183
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.320
I see 200 calories out in and 100 out.

184
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.680
So basically the combined gadgets,

185
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.170
yours and mine are equally,
this get

186
00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:00.290
simply transfers heat from a core body to hot body with no other changes

187
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.670
anywhere in the universe that is not allowed

188
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.750
that for you cannot have an engine more efficient than the car new engine.

189
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.620
The logic is pretty simple.
These numbers,
they picked a representative,

190
00:13:12.621 --> 00:13:16.460
but you can take any number as long as your engine that's better than mine

191
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.120
instead of 40 candidates.
But may 30 calories needed.

192
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.430
If it produced 30 I'll get an engine,

193
00:13:22.431 --> 00:13:25.220
which is one and a half times as bigger than the standard engine.

194
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.600
Run it backwards.
You're 30 will feed my immediate Mangan and you will find,

195
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:30.380
once again,

196
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.670
heat is flowing from a call buddy to hot body with no other changes anywhere in

197
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:38.000
the universe that is forbidden by the postulate.

198
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.080
So this is how Carneros engine,
even though it's a very primitive engine,

199
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.890
is a standard for all Indians.
No engine can be better than the carnival.

200
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.000
And the key to the car new engine is that it's a reversible engine.

201
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.041
He's had more time.

202
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.210
I can show you that all reversible Indians operate in between two temperatures

203
00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.240
will have the same efficiency,
namely that other car,
no engine.

204
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.120
Okay.
Now

205
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.770
what has the car new engine got to do with what I started saying earlier?

206
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.290
You remember I started saying earlier that a certain things,

207
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:19.280
and I would world that seem allowed but don't seem to happen.
Like you know,

208
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.380
drop an egg.
It doesn't come back in your hand.

209
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.430
You let the weight go down and turn the paddle the paddle.

210
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:26.270
He doesn't turn backwards and lift the weight.

211
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.120
I said many things are forbidden and that is a lot that's going to fall,

212
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:31.850
but all of them,
so I'm coming to that law,

213
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.630
but it all started with a person asking you very practical question,

214
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.940
how good can I make an entrance?

215
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.100
And what carbon is telling you is the best efficiency any Indian can have?

216
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.630
Is this that foot even today,
hundreds of years after car?
No.

217
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.300
No company in America or China anywhere can build an internal combustion engine,

218
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:57.590
for example,
who is efficiencies but better than this one?

219
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.220
It's a theoretical maximum.
In reality,

220
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:05.540
efficiency will be less than this because more than Indians have a loss that is

221
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.940
heat leaking out.
That is friction,
that's good for nothing.

222
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.500
So in the end the efficiency will be always lower than this.
Okay.

223
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:17.501
Now let me leave the practical domain and go to more theoretical issues that

224
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:19.250
follow from this.

225
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:25.390
What I want you to notice is the following for the cardinal engine Q one over Q

226
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:31.700
two turned out to be t one over t two right?

227
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.870
I did that for you here.

228
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.610
Therefore I'm going to write it as follows.

229
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:42.611
Q one over t one minus Q two over t two equals zero

230
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.630
that just a simple rewrite but I'm going to write this in another rotation,

231
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.640
my cycle at Fort Parts.
Remember I did this,
then I did this,
then I did this.

232
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:56.474
Then I did that

233
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.080
in the segment I had Q one over t one in this segment that was no Q one or Q two

234
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.600
there was no cute because this is the idea of biotic process.

235
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.830
In this segment I had minus you do over Q two and the last segment I had zero

236
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.310
and the whole thing is you.
In other words,

237
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.500
what I'm telling you is the following

238
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.160
at every stage,

239
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
if you look at the heat absorbed by the system in stage I divided by the

240
00:16:38.921 --> 00:16:43.480
temperature of stage I and you added all of them,
you get zero.

241
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.210
My process at four stages,
stage one is here,

242
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.990
stage Drew's adiabatic states.
Three is this and stage four is zero.
Again,

243
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.030
in this summation,

244
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.930
QY is defined to be doctor Qy is the heat input

245
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.630
in state.
I in the cycle are in the process.

246
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.110
So we defined Q two to be positive even though it was rejected by the engine.

247
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.270
But in this summation,
the agreement I make is Delta Q is positive,

248
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:26.170
but if he comes into the system,
they'll tie cues negative.
He leaves the system.

249
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.680
So why is that important?
Now this is the heart of the whole entropy concert.

250
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.250
Remember I told you there is nothing called the heat in the system.

251
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.500
You cannot look at a gas and say that's the amount of heat in the system.
Why?

252
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.843
Because

253
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.540
if you take a point there and say that someone would have heat in the system,

254
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.770
if you go through some kind of cycle and come back to the same point,

255
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.240
then since you come back to the same point,
internal energy doesn't change.

256
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.210
This is the work done that for the work done is equal to the heat and there's

257
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.850
not zero.
So in this example,

258
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.120
what sort of happened is you'd ever had at added heat,
cute at the system.

259
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.830
So if there is some notion of how much heat is that in the beginning you've got

260
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:22.400
that.
Plus the cue that you added and yet you're back to where you are.

261
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.500
Therefore you cannot define something and that the amount of Q in the system

262
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.850
because you are able to add you to the system and bring it back to where it is.

263
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.450
What happened of course as you added Qid did some work.

264
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.600
But the point is you cannot say the cue here to so and so.

265
00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:41.720
But you can say the energy here to so and so because he become back to the same

266
00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:42.554
point.

267
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.910
P Times v is equal to three is equal to r t and the internal energy for gas.

268
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:49.370
That proportional duties they entered theater turns the old valley.

269
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.300
But now I'm going to tell you,
so listen very carefully.

270
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.260
Energy is a state variable because it comes to the starting value.

271
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.100
If you come to the starting point,
it doesn't matter where you want it off.

272
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:06.380
In the PV diagram,
he does not as state video.

273
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.360
There's nothing called the heat at that point.
Because I am able to go on a loop,

274
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.320
change the value of Cuba or add some cute to it and I come to the same point.

275
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:17.290
So there's no unique queue associated with that point.

276
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.220
But that is a new unique quantity s called entropy,

277
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.900
which has a fixed value at a given point.

278
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.770
And if you go fight the little loop in the PV diagram and you come to the same

279
00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.380
point s we'll return to the starting value.

280
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.370
So who is this s that s is defined by saying the change in the entropy

281
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.370
is the heat you add divided by the temperature in a tiny little process.

282
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.670
If you had some temperature to you,
add a little amount of Q.

283
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.450
<v 1>Okay,</v>

284
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.160
<v 0>keep track of all the changes</v>

285
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.700
and that change will be zero as I showed you in this car,
no cycle.

286
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.500
You can show more generally that if you take any path,

287
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.710
not just the carton was cardinal engine bounded by Adiabatic and Eissa

288
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.120
tournaments,

289
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.120
but any path you take you can show that that Delta Q added up.

290
00:20:19.581 --> 00:20:22.530
It's not zero,
but Delta Q over t namely weight.

291
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.760
The give a weighting factor one over t to the heat you add.

292
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.780
Then the positives and negatives cancel and give you exactly as you.

293
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.630
In other words,
Q one was not cute to Q one is bigger than cute too,

294
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:40.150
but Q one over t one precisely balanced the skew to over tee to the heat

295
00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:45.010
absorbed at higher temperature if divided by t one to compute the change in

296
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:47.020
entropy.
Then in the upper part,

297
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.730
the carbon cycle here and the lower part of the carbon cycle here,

298
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.020
the two canceled as far as the entropy change is concerned,

299
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.980
so entropy is a new variable.
It's a mathematically discovered variable.

300
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.000
What we find is that if I postulate there's a variable called entropy.

301
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:09.410
The change in which in any process is the heat transfer divided by temperature.

302
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.000
Then that has the property that when you go around on a loop,

303
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.640
you come back to net zero change.

304
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.520
That means every point can be associated with the number.

305
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:23.560
You can call it entropy.
Entropy is like a height.

306
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.840
Suppose you're walking around on some landscape.
Each point is a height.

307
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.310
You can walk here and there and come back at at every stage you keep track of

308
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:35.480
the change in height.
If you come back to bed,
you are,

309
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.130
the change in height will add up to zero.
That's what I told you.

310
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.200
In the case of a potential energy function,

311
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.930
it is just like a potential energy function.

312
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.430
Internal Energy and the entropy are now state variables at every point.

313
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.560
The gasses are certainly internal energy and entropy.

314
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.050
The dessert because state variables,
because when you go on a loop and come back,

315
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.960
did return to the starting values.
No,

316
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.010
you have no idea what this quantity stands for.
You agree?
It's bizarre.

317
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.110
We're done.
We understand heat absorbed and he'd rejected.
We understand.

318
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.860
What is Delta Q over t y s divided by t makes a big difference.

319
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:18.510
Why does it produce a new variable?
We can see it as true.

320
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.130
At least in the current cycle.
You can verify in detail that that changed in the,

321
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.160
the total of all the Deltek use over t is in fact zero.

322
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.310
So we'll develop a feeling for what it means,

323
00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:32.430
but historically this is what happened.
People realize,
hey,

324
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:35.670
that's another state video.
We introduced a new available,

325
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.170
we have no idea what it means,

326
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.110
but it is a state variable so we better take it very seriously.

327
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.530
So I'm going to tell you what it means,

328
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.150
but first I want you to get some practice calculating the entropy change for a

329
00:22:48.151 --> 00:22:52.650
couple of processes.
So let us take for example,

330
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.240
one gram of water,
oh,
let's say am grams of some substance.

331
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.190
It's got some specific heats,
C

332
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.890
and I change the temperature,
say from some tea initial present.
The final.

333
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040
I do that by keeping the system starting this system a t one t I and I should

334
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:22.210
never be far from equilibrium.
That's one of the conditions on this.
In fact,

335
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.080
you can say it should be near always near equilibrium.

336
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.510
So the system starts at temperature t initial,
I put it on a heat bath,

337
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.920
which is infinite decimally warmer than this than I let it heat up at that
point.

338
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.350
Then I put it on another reservoir,
slightly harder than this one at all stages.

339
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.600
I want the system to be almost near equilibrium in the sense of calculus.

340
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:51.080
You can make the difference as small as you like provider to do enough number of

341
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:55.430
times and slowly.
I raised this guy from here to here at every stage.

342
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.200
The system as a well defined temperature,

343
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.650
that's a bell defined heat input and I want to add it all up.

344
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.160
So what's the change in entropy as final minus initial is equal to DQ over t

345
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.200
summed over all the parts are actually right.
Listen,

346
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.910
integral as m c Delta t over tea.

347
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.870
Do you see that?
Dqs Mc,

348
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:22.871
Delta t but I got a divided by t and that's integral is done between some

349
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:27.770
initial and final temperature and when we can do this integral,

350
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.150
the trivially Mc log,
the final over t initial,

351
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.260
that is the increase in entropy of some m grams or some substance,

352
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:42.320
a specific EFC that's heated from t initial to the final.

353
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.833
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.640
<v 0>We just getting practice calculating this.</v>

355
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.060
We still don't know what this guy means,
so don't worry about that right now.

356
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.440
If you did not divide by t,
what are they calculating?

357
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.400
Mc Delta t integrated.
It's just MC at times change in temperature.

358
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.160
That's the old calorie metric problem you did.

359
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.450
How many calories does it take to raise the substance from some initial to final

360
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:09.800
temperature that you understand when you divide by teas and think you don't

361
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:10.910
understand.
But anyway,

362
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.020
let's make sure we know how to calculate the increase in entropy when water or

363
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:17.210
something is heated from a lower to a higher temperature.

364
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

365
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.690
<v 0>if you called it from a higher to lower temperature,</v>

366
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.870
you can use the same formula Tfo Rti,

367
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.670
but TFL now is smaller than Tei if you called it.
It's a log of a number.

368
00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:31.890
Less than one is negative and the entropy change,
it'll be negative.

369
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.120
So let me do one more entropy calculation.

370
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.170
That's going to be pretty important for us.
That entropy calculation is this.

371
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.850
Take a gas
and watch it expand.

372
00:25:45.851 --> 00:25:48.760
I used to terminally from some starting point

373
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.060
at some fixed temperature t it goes from v one two V two

374
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.890
what is the change in entropy when it goes from here to here?

375
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.813
<v 1>Again,</v>

376
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.870
<v 0>the system must always be in equilibrium or near equilibrium,</v>

377
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:11.360
so I can plot it as a point in the PB diagram.

378
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.690
So I slowly take green after green to the whole thing I told you and find s two

379
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:22.031
minus x one this is two and this is one that is equal to sum of all the heat

380
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:27.500
transfers divided by temperature at every little step of the way.

381
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.660
But remember this is also the same as p Delta v over t.

382
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.170
Why?
Because on an isothermal the U is zero.

383
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.500
I've repeated it many times,

384
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:48.501
but you got to know this Delta Qsp Delta p but p over t is an r t over be heavy.

385
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.030
You also want to divided by t.

386
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.610
You understand p over t is an Rov,

387
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.970
so p is equal NRT over.
I'm just saying PBS NRT.

388
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:15.970
So p over t is an auto would be now DV over B.

389
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.450
When you somebody integrate,

390
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:22.670
we'll give you an R log B two over the B one.

391
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.110
That is a change in entropy of this gas.

392
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.700
When it went from Walden v one the Malian be two at a given temperature.

393
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.630
You don't have to use calculus to do this.

394
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.660
They said everybody understand why this could've been done a lot easier.

395
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.020
You don't need to do the integral here.

396
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

397
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.060
<v 0>because I showed you in studying the heat engine that the heat transfer queue is</v>

398
00:27:52.281 --> 00:27:55.580
n r t allowed me to over be one.

399
00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.950
Since the whole process takes place at fixed temperature instead of dividing by

400
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:05.840
t at every step.
You can just divide by t overall.
Yes.
Bring the tea here.

401
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.900
That's why this is the tendon entropy.

402
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.960
Other words during the whole process you failed at one temperature than integral

403
00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:19.961
of Delta Q over t is just one over two times the integral of Delta Q which is

404
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:22.370
the total heat transfer.
Anyway,

405
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.400
this is the heat this at the tangent entropy s two minus s one yes,

406
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.390
and our Lord me too.
Over v one

407
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.750
okay,
so what have I done so far?
That's a collectible.

408
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.820
Our thoughts here.
I went to the car,
no engine today

409
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.740
and reminder,
do what efficiency the cardinal engine was.
Then I showed,

410
00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:56.750
you know Indian can be better than the car,
no engine.

411
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.700
That's a separate story that has to do with how efficient things can be.

412
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.080
Then a byproduct with the cardinal engine was this great realization that if you

413
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:11.420
go on a close loop and an everybody stayed,
you add,

414
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.260
you compute the heat absorb but divide by the temperature.
At that point,

415
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.970
the summer fall dose is zero.

416
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:24.640
What that means is that that is a quantity s who's change if it is defined to be

417
00:29:25.191 --> 00:29:28.520
delta Q over t has the property.
That shortage changed in as zero.

418
00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:29.450
When you go around the loop,

419
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.500
that means at every point they can associate an s s is a property of the point

420
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.760
now that exit,
so then,

421
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.450
then I said let's get used to computing change in I two one example of heating a

422
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:48.160
substance of some mass in specific EFC by a temporary bt and the change in

423
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.750
entropy was Mc log,

424
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:55.270
d f over t I you got the lock because integral of Dt over t was logarithm.

425
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.540
Then I took an ideal gas.

426
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.290
I let it expand isothermally I found the entropy change.

427
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.280
I got this answer.
By the way,
here's an interesting exercise.

428
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.830
I don't have time to do it,
but you can ask the following question.

429
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.550
If you tell me that every point that's unique entropy.

430
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.040
The entropy difference between two and one should be independent of how I go

431
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:22.360
from one to two.
You understand good walking on a mountain,
you take two points,

432
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:26.140
they have a high difference and I can find the height difference by going on

433
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:30.190
this path,
keeping track of the change in height or any other path.
In the end,

434
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.530
the height difference between two points is a high difference.

435
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.410
So I could find the entropy another way.

436
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.260
Let me show you another way that is easy for you guys to work out.

437
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.100
Come down like this and go to the right like this and find the entropy change.

438
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.740
You will get the same answer.
I say God on this site.

439
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.220
Okay?
It's too tempting for me to just leave it to you.

440
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:56.390
Let me tell you how it works.
Call this intermediate point.
Um,

441
00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:01.520
give a subsequent Bazuto footballers parameters.
Then in this step,

442
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.630
when you come from here to here,
the entropy change will be,

443
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.860
let's take one more for gas.
When I go from here to here.

444
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.080
Then for one mole of a gas,

445
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:17.590
this heat transferred Dq is see CVD t and a divided by t and I do the integral

446
00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.990
from t one for this point.
[inaudible].

447
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.520
That's the entropy change here.
Then in the horizontal part,

448
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.290
since I'm going at constant pressure,

449
00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.700
I go CP three over tea from tea,

450
00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:39.701
not up to back to [inaudible] because this t one and t two are the same

451
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:40.844
temperature.

452
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.580
I have to add all these to get the entropy change.
No,
it's a two step process.

453
00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:51.210
You come down because you're a constant volume and they're doing something to

454
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:53.400
the gas DQ.
CVD t.

455
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.760
How does [inaudible] at constant pressure DQC PDT,

456
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.590
the definition of specific either Austin volume of constant pressure,

457
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.280
but notice the following c p is equal to c plus R

458
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.950
so put CV plus out here and look what you get.

459
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.540
Then you get CV famous log t not over.

460
00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:22.960
T one plus log,
a t one over t knock,

461
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.110
which we can write this product here

462
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.900
plus our log p one over Tina.

463
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.780
In other words,
this log is log of tea.
Not over t one.

464
00:32:38.781 --> 00:32:43.781
The next is log of t one over t log a plus log B is log of Ab,

465
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.050
but when you do this,
look what happens here.

466
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.860
This on cancel log of one to zero the total entropy change is our log t one over

467
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:56.954
t not

468
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.890
but for the gas,
that constant pressure

469
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.280
using PV equals Rt.

470
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.690
This ratio of temperature is also the ratio of the volumes.

471
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.350
So this one,
I'm sorry,
I should write it more carefully.

472
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.580
Then I say t one I really meant the temperature at this point.

473
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.593
Second Point.

474
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.870
So that temperature or this temperature is also that volume.

475
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.930
The better the initial volume,
which is v one

476
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.940
see this is a confusing problem because Steve one happens to be ti not the

477
00:33:35.941 --> 00:33:38.830
correct way to do this for me would be the right tea,

478
00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:41.910
not over t one time t two over tea.

479
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:46.911
Not then realize the fact that a t two and t one are equal because I'm on a

480
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:50.520
nicer term.
That's what I should've done.

481
00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:53.790
So I should cancel this factor because d two is one,

482
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.960
but here t two over teen art is B two over Overby not which is B two over v one

483
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.530
that's of course the entropy change.
They got in one shot here.

484
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.220
So you can find entropy change anyway you like.

485
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.170
You usually pick the easiest path.

486
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:15.810
All right,
so we have now learned how to find entropy change.

487
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.090
We have no idea what it means.
It seems as if when you hit something,

488
00:34:21.091 --> 00:34:24.420
entropy goes up,
when you call something entropy goes down.

489
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.510
That's certainly correct because Delta Q is positive,

490
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.260
but heating and divided by t.
You may get a logarithm,
but we're not.

491
00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:32.700
Every infant of the small portion,

492
00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:35.760
I'm adding positive numbers and then they cooled things that goes down.

493
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.980
Why not just call it temperature?

494
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.020
Why do you need this new concept called entropy?

495
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.990
So that's what the rest of the lectures about.
It's a very,

496
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:46.080
very powerful and beautiful concepts.

497
00:34:46.081 --> 00:34:48.180
I want to explain that makes sure I get it right

498
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.310
here is now the reason for all this hard work.

499
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.720
Remember I told you that are many,
many,

500
00:34:57.721 --> 00:35:02.721
many phenomena that seemed forbidden in our world and we're not quite sure what

501
00:35:03.091 --> 00:35:06.960
law to invoke to prevent all of them from happening to be one of the law for

502
00:35:06.961 --> 00:35:11.040
each one that says if you drop a bottle and the shatters,
it won't come back.

503
00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:15.360
If can drop an egg,
it won't come back.
If you let hot and cold mix,

504
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:20.660
they're not going to unmixed or if you let a gas trapped in half a room escape

505
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:24.330
of the whole room,
it'll never untrapped and go back to half the room.

506
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.270
A lot of things happen one way but not the other and I said,

507
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.630
I'm looking for a mega law that will prevent all these things from happening.

508
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.330
Now I'm ready to state that law.

509
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.580
This is the third law I the second law of thermodynamics.

510
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.670
Carnot said it one way,
but I'm going to say it in a way that's very,

511
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:42.504
very general.

512
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.200
The second law of thermodynamics says Delta s four the universe is a that zero

513
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:55.680
or positive.
Yeah,
you have it.
That's the great law.

514
00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.940
The law says take any process.

515
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.810
If at the end of the process,

516
00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.190
the entropy of the universe is bigger than it was before,
that will happen.

517
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:14.050
If the entropy of the universe is smaller than it was before,
it will not happen.

518
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.071
No.

519
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:20.520
We have to make sure that this lies anything whatsoever to do with all the other

520
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:23.820
things we have studied and I will show you this one forbit everything that

521
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:26.280
should be forbidden and allow everything that should be alone.

522
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.320
So let me start with the most obvious formulation.

523
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.720
Mr. Car version of the second law was that you cannot have a process in which

524
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.980
some heat cue goes from a hot body to call buddy.
I'm sorry,

525
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.590
this is a loud right.
I caught in the car.
No,

526
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.270
this is not a low

527
00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.140
right.
He can flow downhill,
cannot flow uphill.

528
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.230
Let's see the entropy change the universe for the two cases.
In this case,

529
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.770
this guy,
the change in entropy is the following.

530
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.560
The upper reservoir lost some on cue.

531
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.810
So Delta you as a negative number.

532
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.120
I have some temperature t one the lower reservoir gain queue at temperature t

533
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:23.430
too.
No.
What's the overall sign of this?

534
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.930
Think about it.
T wants bigger than t two so this negative number,

535
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:31.350
the smarter than this positive number.
So the whole thing is positive.

536
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.290
That means it's alone.
It's okay.
Wait,

537
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.590
the same token,
if you take this process when heat flows uphill,

538
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.680
then this reservoir,
losing some heat cube,

539
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.000
I can put the t two other one gains heat.
You are temporary,
the t one,

540
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.310
but this is clearly less than zero because this positive number is smaller than

541
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:54.144
this negative number.

542
00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.790
So that you have a very simple example where if heat flows the wrong way,

543
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.140
the entropy of the universe goes up

544
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.280
and it's very simple.

545
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.960
It's only it's because it is the heat loss of this guy is the heat gain of that

546
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:17.010
guy.
That's the law of conservation of energy.
So energy doesn't change,

547
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.500
but entropy changes because for entropy,

548
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:23.790
it's not the heat transfer t transfer divided by temperature that for a heat

549
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:24.624
lost,

550
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.710
but one temperature and the heat gained at a lower temperature don't cancel when

551
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:32.400
it comes to entropy.
In one case,
the entropy goes up and read aloud.

552
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.410
Another case entropy goes down.
It's not low.

553
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:38.820
Okay,
so let's try.

554
00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.170
So that's certainly one prices that you know should not be allowed.

555
00:38:43.171 --> 00:38:46.420
But it's forbidden by the third law,
by a computation of intro.

556
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.810
So the reason when you put a hot and cold body together,

557
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.630
heat flows from the cold to the hot,
I'm sorry,

558
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:57.350
from the hot to the cold is because that's the way the entropy will go up.

559
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.490
So let's take one more example.

560
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.463
<v 2>Supposed to have</v>

561
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:15.290
<v 0>some mass of water at some temperature t one and an equal mass of water at</v>

562
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.950
temperature t two
one is hard from one is called.

563
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.150
<v 2>I put them together.
What will happen,</v>

564
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:31.670
<v 0>we believe it will then get this big mass.
All are some common temperature.</v>

565
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.171
The star,

566
00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:38.171
which is t one plus t two over to this is just by symmetry is equal mass equals

567
00:39:39.561 --> 00:39:44.330
specific heat.
Where will they meet?
They will meet halfway.
They will meet here.

568
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.250
Energies of course conserved and that Soviet determined in fact where they will

569
00:39:49.251 --> 00:39:52.700
meet.
We'll look at the entropy.
What happens?

570
00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:55.550
The entropy change for the entropy change.

571
00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.130
You should imagine this water being steadily heated by putting it in contact

572
00:40:01.131 --> 00:40:02.330
with a lot of reservoirs,

573
00:40:02.331 --> 00:40:05.840
search never far from equilibrium and slowly bringing it to this point.

574
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:12.250
Then the Delta s total will be m specifically this one.

575
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:20.260
Then Delta p over t starting from t one to t star for one thing and the p over t

576
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.750
from t two to t star.

577
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.840
The other one you understand that they're both made a t star.

578
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.740
Upper limit is the star lower one is t one for one and t two for the other.

579
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.790
So the change in entropy becomes m log.

580
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.920
These star square over t one t two

581
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.200
no.
We have to ask.
Okay,
you got an entropy change from start to finish,

582
00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:55.370
but how do you know it's positive?

583
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.840
Did anybody give some reason why this has to be positive with our looking into

584
00:41:02.841 --> 00:41:04.610
properties of logarithms and so on?

585
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.760
Any reason what?
Yes,

586
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.220
<v 2>that should be
greater than.</v>

587
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.070
<v 0>Yeah.
So that's one way to prove that,</v>

588
00:41:20.071 --> 00:41:22.440
but I'm saying I'm going to prove it to you that way,

589
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.910
but can you think of a reason why at every step of the process,

590
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.040
when I brought this down and when I pushed that up,

591
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.090
the entropy change is always positive.
We need steps.
So let me explain.

592
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.630
Imagine cooling this down a little bit by putting,
taking some heat.

593
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.010
They'll take you out of this guy that's happening or sometimes some temperature

594
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.450
here.
This one is gaining some delta Q but at a lower temperature.

595
00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.283
<v 2>Okay?</v>

596
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.960
<v 0>Therefore,
the gain</v>

597
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.370
has got the same Delta Cuba at a lower temperature.

598
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.210
This is always at an upper temperature throughout the process.
At every stage,

599
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.920
this guy is harder than this guy,

600
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.460
so every calorie of heated gains at a higher temperature.

601
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.510
Every calorie loses is divided by higher temperature.
Every calorie,

602
00:42:09.511 --> 00:42:12.690
this gains so divided,
but lower temperature at every increment.

603
00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:17.070
At every infant small step,
you can see the total entropy change is possible.

604
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.260
Now to prove it,
we will do what he just said.

605
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.510
If you want to prove this as positive,

606
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.720
you want to show that the fellow inside the logarithm is bigger than one.

607
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:32.250
So I'm asking is t one plus t two square over for bigger than t one t two

608
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.880
what I'm saying is Steven Steve to squared bigger than 41 t two if you rearrange

609
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:44.510
this,
you can show the lefthand side becomes t one minus t two square.

610
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:49.610
That's of course a positive number because this should be [inaudible] squared

611
00:42:49.611 --> 00:42:53.240
plus [inaudible] squared plus plus two t one t two and when I bring this guy to

612
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:57.680
the other side will become minus two t one t two and so it's clearly positive.

613
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.810
So when Hart and called meat and reach Luke warm entropy of the universe has

614
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.870
Ghana,
it follows.
Therefore,

615
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.270
if Luke warm spontaneously separated in a hot and cold,

616
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.750
the entropy would go down and that's why that doesn't happen.

617
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.630
That's why if you leave a jar of water at one temperature,

618
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.870
it doesn't spontaneously separate into a part on top,

619
00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:23.650
which is called an a part on bottom because hard set,

620
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.360
the separation would not violate anything.
Okay?

621
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.610
It would not violate the law of conservation of energy,

622
00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.660
but it will violate the law that entropy has to always go up.

623
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.330
So one way is allowed in other ways not allowed.

624
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.550
So you see over and over again that anything that's allowed isn't the direction

625
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:41.510
of increasing entropy.

626
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.480
Anything that's forbidden isn't the direction of decreasing entropy.

627
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.620
But who is this entropy?
What does it mean?

628
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.280
Well that we have not understood at all from any of these calculations because

629
00:43:53.281 --> 00:43:58.260
DQ over tea doesn't speak to us the way the you or Dq or PDV does.

630
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:04.050
So the last part of what I'm going to do is going to explain to you

631
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.280
what is the microscopic basis of entropy.

632
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.030
Why is the entropy going up connect?
Why is that?

633
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.910
Why did we understand the tendency of things to go into that extra of increasing

634
00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:22.470
entropy?
All I've shown you now is that that is mystical quantity called entropy.

635
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.270
Circumstantially,

636
00:44:24.271 --> 00:44:28.950
you find every time something is forbidden is because had it taken place,

637
00:44:28.951 --> 00:44:30.060
entropy would have gone down.

638
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.830
You remember the heat flow in from hot to cold entropy goes up,

639
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.970
allowed Ryan from cold to hot.
Entropy goes down,
not alone,

640
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.040
hot and cold mix and become lukewarm.
Allowed.
Entropy goes up,

641
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.300
lukewarm separates in the hot and cold,
not allowed.
Entropy goes down.

642
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:52.230
So there's definitely a correlation and yet we don't know what it means.

643
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.950
So we're going to talk about what it means for that.

644
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:57.960
I'm going to consider the following process.

645
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.880
I take a gas and I put it in a room in a box where there's a partition or

646
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:10.800
halfway,
the molecules are stuck in the left side.

647
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.940
Gas reached equilibrium and it's done what it can,

648
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.290
which is to spread out over this volume.
Now I suddenly removed the partition,

649
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.793
rip it up.

650
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:28.690
So let's follow this gas initially is the point here.

651
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.773
<v 1>Mm.</v>

652
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.840
<v 0>Then that is a pdf when it goes off the radar,</v>

653
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:40.380
because I told you when you suddenly removed the wall,

654
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.690
the gas is not in a state of equilibrium.

655
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.610
It doesn't even have a well defined pressure.

656
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.130
The minute to room with a walk pressure,
there's something here.

657
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.540
Pressure the zero in the vacuum here.
So you've got to wait a bit.

658
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.500
So gas has gone off the radar.
We cannot talk about what's happening.

659
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.330
Then if you wait long enough,

660
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:02.550
I get a gas that looks like this after some seconds or whatever milliseconds

661
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.620
that is again,
gas in equilibrium.
It's got a certain state.
I can call it

662
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:08.563
<v 1>two.</v>

663
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.660
<v 0>What is the entropy change now?
That's what I want to ask.</v>

664
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.460
What the change in entropy here,

665
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:23.040
because I know that this is allowed.
That is forbidden.

666
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.820
So I want to ask,
did the entropy go up?

667
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.360
Now how do we do the entropy calculation?

668
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.160
Here is a wrong way to do the calculation.

669
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.150
You go back and say delta is a Delta Q over tea,

670
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.600
but this whole box,
I forgot to mention,
I'm sorry,

671
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.650
it's four boxes thermally isolated.
It's not in contact with anything.

672
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.160
I just ripped out the partition in the middle.
That's it.

673
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.510
So you might say ability for thermally isolated Delta Q is zero.

674
00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.970
So you can divide by tea.
You can do what you want.
So this entropy change zero.

675
00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.100
But that is the wrong argument.

676
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.370
Can you think about why that's not the way to do the entropy?

677
00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:06.730
Change the way that's the wrong

678
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.203
<v 1>analysis.</v>

679
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.850
<v 0>First of all,
could that be the right answer?</v>

680
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.100
<v 1>Yes.
Going backwards?</v>

681
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.160
<v 0>Uh,
no,
that is correct.
But I'm saying this computation of entropy,</v>

682
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.250
the one line calculation I did,
namely there is no heat in flow.

683
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.030
The delta Q is zero.
So delta Q over t summed up his answer zero.

684
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.250
That's not how you do the entropy change.

685
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.970
Does that add any condition I made on computing?
Yes.

686
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.283
<v 2>He goes the gas.</v>

687
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:49.303
Uh wait.

688
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.740
<v 0>In fact here is the interesting thing.</v>

689
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.460
What's going to be the temperature difference between before and after,

690
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.490
which is going to be hotter or cooler.

691
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.640
Any views on this?

692
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.810
<v 2>Yep.
You guys added,</v>

693
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.220
ah,
well

694
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.430
<v 0>you can say it is cooler because it was insulated and expanded,</v>

695
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.780
but you cooled down because he expand against an external pressure.
Right?

696
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.390
Even my natal more this piston here,
that is not pressure pushing this gas back.

697
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.860
You understand that it doesn't do any work.
It doesn't take any heat.

698
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.640
So what does that mean in the end when you settle down,

699
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.520
what can you conclude then?
No heat input,
no work done.

700
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.560
So what does that mean in terms of temperature?

701
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.260
Same.
Because the internal energy cannot change.

702
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:51.060
The delta you with zero work done is zero.
So in fact,
this is a bright,

703
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.290
this gas when an expanse will be at the same temperature or you guys are taking

704
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:56.870
up the computer,
Eh,

705
00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.450
where if you let it expand at Coldstone because that is expanding against the

706
00:49:00.451 --> 00:49:04.380
atmospheric pressure.
This gas is expanding into a complete vacuum.

707
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.950
It's gotten no piston to push.
Again,
nothing from outside pushing.

708
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.410
So these two points are at the same temperature.

709
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.640
So the correct answer maybe you didn't catch on,

710
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:19.360
but I will tell you the correct answer is that isn't an entropy increase in this

711
00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:24.361
problem because the final state definitely has a well defined entropy.

712
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:26.770
You can calculate because it's an equilibrium state.

713
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.000
Initial Monessen bell define entropy in between stages.

714
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:35.110
Here are not on the PV diagram because they have not equilibrium states.

715
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.430
So in this experiment,

716
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.630
the way to calculate the entropy change is not to do delta Q over.

717
00:49:40.631 --> 00:49:42.460
T acid happened in this experiment.

718
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.330
What you really want to say is my gas was he at in the beginning?

719
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.830
My guess is that in the end,

720
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.820
both that states of equilibrium both have well defined temperature and I can

721
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:55.480
find the entropy change in going from here to here,
but any process I want

722
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.220
as long as that process keeps the system near equilibrium.

723
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:04.620
Second follow dot bye dot [inaudible] and moving and I had the delta Q over t

724
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:09.980
the correct route for entropy changes is Delta Q over t computed on a path than

725
00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:12.400
with the system.
Never strays from me.
Paypal,
liberty,

726
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:17.410
no your system straight from equilibrium all the time but we are not interested

727
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:17.800
in habit.

728
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.040
Got from here to here we are saying what's the entropy here and watch the

729
00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:23.980
entropy here since it's at the same temperature.

730
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.190
I know one way to go from there to there is to follow the ice up there because

731
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.950
that is connected to points in this particular problem.

732
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.400
Then I know the entropy change just as two minus one is an our log

733
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.310
be too over before.

734
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.350
So here's the sub bullet point I want to explain to you.

735
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:55.430
This is worth understanding.

736
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:58.040
A lot of people do all the problems and get everything right but don't

737
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:59.810
appreciate this particular question.

738
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:06.070
The three expansion of a gas into the vacuum takes it from one equilibrium state

739
00:51:06.111 --> 00:51:08.990
called one another equilibrium state called to

740
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.140
in the actual expansion,

741
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.740
the system went through state which cannot be one shown in the PB diagram.

742
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.980
They were not equilibrium states that didn't have a defined pressure,

743
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:20.300
didn't have well defined temperature.

744
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.440
How do you define a temperature when half the boxes empty?
It doesn't have,

745
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.570
you cannot call it the temperature of the gas.

746
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.860
So what do you mean by Delta Q over tea there is no t only when her set it's

747
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:35.600
down,
there is a t every settled down equilibrium state as well defined entropy.

748
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.610
What we're trying to do is to compute the difference.

749
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:44.230
The way to compute the difference is to forget about what actually happened and

750
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:47.300
instead do the following.
Take the gas

751
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:54.020
like that and turn it this way if you like,

752
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.650
just for convenience for the Piston are at the halfway point,

753
00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.790
put some weights on it.
So the depression equals depression inside

754
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:08.210
and slowly remove little by little and keeping it on a reservoir.

755
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:13.450
Our temperature t one,
which is the temperature at which all of this happened,

756
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:19.370
or at some temperature t
as you remove the grain of sand,

757
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.420
what happens is the gas gets some energy.

758
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.530
That's a delta Q over t.
The reservoir loses some heat.

759
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.970
In fact,
the reservoir loses is the same or what the,

760
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.380
he built a queue at the same temperature t.

761
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.351
So in fact,

762
00:52:36.351 --> 00:52:40.130
what happens in this process is the entropy of the universe does not change at

763
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:44.180
all.
The entropy gain of the gas is entropy,

764
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.500
loss of the reservoir,

765
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:51.650
but I use this as a device for finding the entropy gain of the gas in the other

766
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:52.484
process.

767
00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.040
So this is the part that's absolutely central to this whole argument.

768
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:03.820
Oh,

769
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.820
entropy's is calculated in a real spontaneous expansion of a gas,

770
00:53:09.281 --> 00:53:10.960
but there was no orders or wild,
no nothing.

771
00:53:10.961 --> 00:53:14.830
We just broke the partition and expanded.
That is a change in entropy.

772
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.290
That's an irreversible process,

773
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:22.830
but to find the change in entropy in this problem since one and two have well

774
00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:27.871
defined entropy's we can find the between one and two by going to a different

775
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:32.610
experiments in which it was brought from one to two not in this crazy

776
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:36.000
irreversible way but by putting it contact with the heat bath at that

777
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:40.140
temperature t removing grain after green,
never straying far from equilibrium.

778
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:41.910
That's when we find this change.

779
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:48.150
So you replace the dotted line where you cannot compute anything by a solid line

780
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:51.810
where you can but since the change in entropy between one and two that doesn't

781
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:56.670
depend on how you got there.
That's the answer.
But this process,
right,

782
00:53:56.671 --> 00:54:00.900
you can actually see it is a one in with Delta s of the Universe is actually a

783
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:02.400
zero.
Why?

784
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:06.540
Because you're putting in contact with the reservoir at the same temperature.

785
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:11.790
So the Delta Q over tea for the gas and Delta Q Q over top of the reservoir.

786
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.080
Exactly cancel because they are at the same temperature in Delta Q four one is

787
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:17.370
minus,
they'll take you for the other,

788
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.660
so don't confuse the two processes.

789
00:54:22.661 --> 00:54:26.800
One is a reversible process in which the gas is slowly allowed to expand from

790
00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:30.520
the initial state of the final state by removing grain after the brain off.

791
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:35.370
Some externally applied pressure in a process where the attribute university

792
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.590
doesn't change gas and reservoir change by equal amounts,

793
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.350
but the punchline is I don't care what happens reservoir,

794
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:46.090
I want to know how much the gas gained because that is the gain I need defined

795
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.370
as two minus s one for this process.

796
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.460
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

797
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:55.260
<v 0>so this will be always financial between in real life processes happen in a way</v>

798
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:57.060
in which the entropy of the universe goes up.

799
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.960
Because take this box in the real experiment.

800
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.040
Remember that [inaudible] there's only the box of gas.
It expanded.

801
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:08.580
Its entropy went up,
so entropy of the universe actually went up.

802
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.430
That's waves.
Hello.
The attribute,

803
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:18.600
the university went up by an amount equal to the increase in entropy of the gas

804
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:22.440
when it goes from one to two defined the increase in entropy of the gas.

805
00:55:22.441 --> 00:55:27.150
When it goes from one to two I create a second process in which I can compute

806
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:31.830
the change by letting it go in a sequence of connected dots and finding the

807
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:32.664
change.

808
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:37.350
The way you used to find the change in entropy is not the way the entropy

809
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:39.660
increase took place in the real process.

810
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.340
So I don't think I wanted to beat at any more,

811
00:55:42.341 --> 00:55:45.240
but it's an important point and you should really think about that.

812
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:51.380
All right.
Now
the last point is

813
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:57.980
what?
This,
let's analyze this final formula.
I got what?

814
00:55:57.981 --> 00:56:00.500
Entropy change for three expansion of gas.

815
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:08.430
Let's take a simple case where the gas expanded from some volume,

816
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.180
the bill volume two Times v.

817
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:18.540
What does Esther minus s one s two minus s one is n.

818
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:24.020
Our log to do happens to be the two over one.

819
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.220
The volume has doubled.

820
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:33.030
Let me rewrite this as and k blog too

821
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.120
because number of side as and number of molecules name's Kay.

822
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:46.170
Let me rewrite that as a log of two to the n Times k.

823
00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.520
Now I will tell you what all these factors mean

824
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.840
and that comes from the following dumper dynamics only told you the formula for

825
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:08.380
the change in the entropy of for guests didn't tell you what the entropy itself

826
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:09.214
is.

827
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.590
So the formula for the entropy of a gas without talking about the change and

828
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:17.170
also this formula delta.

829
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:20.440
So delta Q over t doesn't even believe in atoms.
You don't need atoms,

830
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:23.080
you don't need molecules.
You don't need to know what anything is made apart.

831
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.740
In fact,
it was discovered long before Adam's for proven to exist.

832
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:32.700
Boltzmann is the guy who gave the formula for what the entropy of a gas is in

833
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:38.080
terms of what the individual molecules are doing.

834
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.460
That's the punchline of what's called statistical mechanics,

835
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.940
which gives you the microscopic origin of thermodynamics.

836
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.920
Thermodynamics to this stage talked about fluids and solids and gases and

837
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:53.560
nothing there requires that everything we made up of atoms,

838
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.820
you don't have to know what it's made of.

839
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:56.980
But if you're telling me it's made up or Madams,

840
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.470
you have a better idea what entropy means.

841
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:04.510
And here is Boltzmann formula for entropy.
I'm going to write it down.

842
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.420
Boltzmann constant times log omega.

843
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.280
I'll tell you what omega is in a minute.
This such an important formula.

844
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:19.990
It is written in Boltzmann's tombstone.
So when physicists go to Vienna,

845
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:22.030
we skip the archis,
Ra's and everything else.

846
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.860
We go to Boltzmann's tune and we read this formula once more with some passion

847
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:29.710
that the summary of a lifetime of work.

848
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:33.250
But it's a great formula and you will understand once you know the formula,

849
00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:35.560
what all this means.
So let me tell you what Omega means.

850
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.120
I'm going to say in words,
then I'm going to apply to this problem.

851
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.130
If it took any gas,

852
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:47.920
let it be under certain conditions that macroscopically have some pressure and

853
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:48.970
some volume and so on.

854
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.730
So here is the guests at one instant.
Now we believe in atoms.

855
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:58.330
Here are these atoms scattered all over the place?

856
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:06.220
Suppose I wait a little bit.
What does the gas look like?

857
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.740
It looks like that
if you can see every atom,

858
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.230
the atomic configuration has changed,

859
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:19.870
but macroscopically nothing has changed.
Instead of atom a being here,

860
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:24.230
maybe a has gone and bs come here,
and particularly if it divided the volume,

861
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:29.231
it was some number of little cells that you can count on the average.

862
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:31.970
The gas has uniform density.
There's some number of atoms,

863
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:36.920
but every little pubic and formed a little later I more than somebody else moves

864
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:41.840
in macroscopic lead.
It looks the same to me.
Microscopically stuff is going on.

865
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.090
Omega.
Yes,

866
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:51.100
the number of different microscopic arrangements that agree with what is seen

867
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:52.760
macroscopically.

868
00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.100
When I say microscopic arraignments,
I really mean the following.

869
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.210
Give every molecule in name a,
B,
c,
d,
whatever.

870
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:07.100
Then put a here and be here.
See here in d there.
That's one arrangement.

871
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.480
Then permute woody here and be here and see her hernia.

872
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:12.470
That does another idea to my naked eye.

873
01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:15.620
They all look the same but they all produce the same macroscopic effect,

874
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.410
but there are different microscopic arrangements

875
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.850
and you were supposed to take the log of the number of the sediments multiply by

876
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:29.270
this constant called Boltzmann's constant to get the entropy of a state.

877
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:33.230
So now let's apply it to this gas here.

878
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

879
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.110
<v 0>No,
the number of microscopic arrangements if you really wanted to get down to it</v>

880
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.050
requires dividing the box and the tiny little cells,

881
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.890
maybe one cubic millimeter and saying how many items?
I didn't need the region,

882
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.880
but we are going to do a crude calculation in which will only say the following

883
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.150
a that a molecule is on the left.
Artists on the right,

884
01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:02.300
we are saying these are the only two positions open to the gas left or right.

885
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.020
Of course in the left that is a left card and the top left corner bottom.

886
01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:08.390
But don't worry about,
just say that only two things you can do.

887
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.550
It can be on the left or it can be on the right.

888
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:17.110
Now let's ask ourselves if the gas looks like this.

889
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

890
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.970
<v 0>How many ways can it be in this setting</v>

891
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.710
as compared to

892
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.880
how many ways can it be in this setting?

893
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:33.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

894
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.460
<v 0>It is like the following molecules are moving randomly given molecule has got 50</v>

895
01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.950
50 times of being on the left or being on the right.

896
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:50.140
You are demanding that all the and molecules on their own,

897
01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:53.020
there's no partition now on their own,
the on the left hand side

898
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.920
you can see that it's like tossing a coin

899
01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:03.310
and times and wanting heads every time because you want every guy you know,

900
01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:07.930
random process to end up picking left.
So if you want them all to be left,

901
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:12.610
there's only one way to do that.
And that's like saying I tossed a million coins,

902
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.730
I wanted all heads.
There's only one way to do that

903
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.710
so that that engagement,
if you,
we will say,
looks like this left,
left,
left,

904
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:26.190
left,
left,
left for everybody that's the end.
Had been here.

905
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:32.700
Take another one but one molecule,
it's all been here

906
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.320
and all the others that here on the left side that looks like left,

907
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:44.250
left,
left,
right,
left,
left,
left.
But that's one arrangement.

908
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.450
But have I done my complete homework here at our Delmarva arrangements.

909
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:49.490
I want you to think about,

910
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.173
<v 2>pardon me,</v>

911
01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.120
<v 0>this is the only one of the,
I didn't meant for the molecule on the right.</v>

912
01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.300
That's another arrangement in which I can have the second molecule molecule more

913
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.250
Joe Arpaio,
whoever's here,

914
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:10.780
you can pick them in end waste already been one is on the left and minus one on

915
01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:12.580
the right that are more ways in which that can happen.

916
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.060
So your ics one on the right end minus one on the left,

917
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:20.830
but that in ways in which that can happen,
it's like saying if I toss coins,

918
01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.370
I want one head and 99 tails.

919
01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:30.430
Well it turns out that are a hundred ways in which it can happen because the one

920
01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.290
headache got,
could have occurred in one of the a hundred different terms.

921
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:40.330
Now suppose I want to heads and 98 tapes.
Then as you know,

922
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.540
the way to do that is 100 times 99 divided by one time too.

923
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.550
These are some common and Torics you learn in high school,

924
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.960
so you find that if you plot number of heads over the total number

925
01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:01.990
and ask what,
how many ways in which that can happen.

926
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:05.020
All heads can I cut in only one way.

927
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.440
Every coin has to be head one had less.
One Taylor,

928
01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.270
99 heads can occur in end ways,

929
01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:17.230
then it will become more and more and more and you will find the 50 50 chance of

930
01:04:17.231 --> 01:04:21.810
half the number of heads and have the number of tails has the biggest I couldn't

931
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:22.723
rate.

932
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.053
<v 2>Okay,</v>

933
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.140
<v 0>because that's the most number of ways to get 50 50 than anything else and 100</v>

934
01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:33.580
heads is as bad as 100 tails.
Again,

935
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:36.310
there's only one way in which you can get all heads in one way in which you can

936
01:04:36.311 --> 01:04:39.790
get all tails,
but as you start scrambling them that are more and more ways,

937
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.170
that means for the molecule,
you've got a hundred molecules.

938
01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:48.430
The number of states Omega is the largest.

939
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.410
When did equally distributed in fact as the number of molecules scores from

940
01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.700
hundred two thousand two million to 10 to the 23 this function is so sharply

941
01:04:57.701 --> 01:05:02.701
peaked that the approximate formula for Omega when it's at the 50 50 thing is in

942
01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:09.001
fact to the namely all the arrangements waterless belong to this configuration,

943
01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.150
that 40 if you've got back to Boltzmann formula and like let me keep the formula

944
01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:19.180
here and look at sc equals Keylogger Omega,

945
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:20.803
<v 1>then you find</v>

946
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.710
<v 0>as one,
it's when everybody is on the left.</v>

947
01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.030
That is k log one

948
01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:35.100
and s two is 50 50 mix,

949
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.930
half on the left and half on the right.

950
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.010
That entropy is Kellogg to the end.

951
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

952
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:48.130
<v 0>Therefore you can see that's what I wrote down here along to Dm.</v>

953
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.690
So the way you understand entropy is the following.

954
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.700
If I give you a gas

955
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:02.743
<v 1>and ask,</v>

956
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.050
<v 0>will they ever like to be in the left half of the box on their own?</v>

957
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.510
Of course they won't,
but if you start them out that way,

958
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:14.080
you forced them to be on the left.
They'll be on the left.
Question is,

959
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:19.150
if you remove the partition,
what would they likely do?
Unlike coins,

960
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:21.400
which once they land on their head,
they have to stay on the head.

961
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.140
These molecules can move around.
Question as if they were all left to begin with.

962
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:29.740
How long can that possibly last?
If they start moving randomly,

963
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:34.300
they will always end up doing this because there are many,

964
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:36.790
many more ways to do this than to do this,

965
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.540
so things go from one arrangement macroscopic to another,

966
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:48.190
one left to their own device because the final state can be realized and many,

967
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:53.190
many more ways than the initial state.
Similarly,

968
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.720
if you combine a hot gas and the coal gas,
this is hard.

969
01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:01.590
This is called with a terminally insulating partition.

970
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.550
Then all the hearts are on the left.
All the calls are on the right.

971
01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:09.090
If you remove the terminal installation or not even remove it,

972
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.760
replace it by heat conducting thing you went to lead.

973
01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.050
The temperatures would equalize.

974
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.780
So what do you find every time is there's many,

975
01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:22.070
many ways in which you can pack your items.
If you put all the heart on the left,

976
01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.150
all the cold on the right,

977
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:27.140
that can be achieved in fewer ways than in which you let them all go wherever

978
01:07:27.141 --> 01:07:30.910
they like.
So what do you find?

979
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:35.890
This entropy is a direct measure of how disordered your system is.

980
01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:37.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

981
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:41.970
<v 0>One technical measure of disorder is to ask how many microscopic arrangements</v>

982
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.600
can lead to what I see and take the log of that number.

983
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:49.440
And what you find is this has a very low entropy.

984
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.730
This is a very high entropy because this configuration,
in other words,

985
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:57.840
if you took a gas in a whole room and ask will it ever go to this configuration,

986
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.990
that is a slight chance,
it will.

987
01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.790
That chance is one part in to the end where they understand that the 23 so it's

988
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:08.910
not something you should wait for,
but it can happen.

989
01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.990
So the second law of thermodynamics is a statistic,
a law

990
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.680
microscopically,
it's perfectly allowed for the gas too.
Suddenly all the guests,

991
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.050
the whole room can come to where I am.
That's allowed.

992
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:24.290
But you don't hold your breath because that's not likely to happen.

993
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:28.100
The art for that is again,
one part in one over to do some huge number.

994
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.530
On the other hand,
if in this part of the room we really,
some gas,

995
01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.400
everybody quickly spread out because there are more ways to do it.

996
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:41.050
So we understand completely now why certain things occur and why they don't.

997
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:46.190
Because if you took a hot water and cold water,

998
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.650
you're separating them to fast molecules and slow molecules.

999
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.750
As long as they're in different insulated containers,

1000
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.070
that's the best they can do.

1001
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:55.910
But if you put them in contact so they no longer have to be separated,

1002
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:57.950
question is will they remain separated?

1003
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.760
It's like saying I have bunch of coins which are all left and all right,

1004
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.160
but they're allowed to flip as a function of time,

1005
01:09:04.161 --> 01:09:06.980
but they'll never remained that way.
Okay,

1006
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:10.760
so what happened is the coal molecules and heart will mingle and soon the

1007
01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:13.760
container will have cold everywhere and heart everywhere and you will get some

1008
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:17.570
intermediate temperature.
Or if it took two different dyes,
you know,

1009
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.240
water here on top of 54 some red paint,

1010
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:22.700
there'll be initially separated after a while.

1011
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:25.130
They will mix because there's no reason for the heart,

1012
01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:27.740
for the red molecules to stay on the top forever.

1013
01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:31.520
They would like to occupy the whole box and sober the colorless ones and

1014
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:36.170
eventually it will become pink because there's more ways to remain pink than to

1015
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.650
remain separated.
Likewise,

1016
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:43.700
spink spontaneously separated into red and colorless.
Uh,
that is very,

1017
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:46.670
very improbable because entropy for that state will be lower.

1018
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:52.520
So you have to understand the second law of thermodynamics or saying certain

1019
01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.160
things occur because if you go in that direction,

1020
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.680
you can realize that arrangement in more ways.

1021
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.380
And since microscopic motion is random,

1022
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:05.720
it's like tossing coins to ask for an heads.
When you toss and times,

1023
01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:09.110
it's like asking all the molecules to be on the left side of the room to ask for

1024
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:10.400
50 50 heads and tails.

1025
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.870
It's like asking for molecules to populate the room equally.
Yes,

1026
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:19.010
that's called the Arrow of time,
but you've got to be careful about one thing.

1027
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.960
The entropy of a part of the universe can go down just to the entropy of the

1028
01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:25.220
whole universe will not go down.

1029
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:30.250
So all of life is an example of lowering entropy because you know the creation

1030
01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:36.080
of life or the creation of tomatoes out of mud is a highly organizing process.

1031
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:38.450
So the entropy there is really going down,

1032
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.640
but if you kept track of the rest of the world,

1033
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:45.560
you will find that some corresponding increase of entropy somewhere else or take

1034
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:49.010
your freezer.
You know your refrigerator's sucks heat out of your freezer.

1035
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.320
Delta Q over tea for that is negative,

1036
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.680
but somewhere there's bigger heat emitted outside from the exhaust new

1037
01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:55.280
refrigerator.

1038
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.240
If it took care of all of that entropy of the universe will go up or remain
sane,

1039
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:02.330
but it doesn't go down.
All right.

1040
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.160
I have given you guys a three problems.
You should go on the website today.

1041
01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:10.460
Two of them should take about five minutes other than maybe 10 minutes.

1042
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:13.410
I want you to think about calculating entropy changes.

1043
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:17.730
That's part of this syllabus.
As part of our course.
It'll come on line today.

1044
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.480
So I've asked for them to be do either on Friday or Monday.

1045
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.810
I don't know which one,
whichever one marijuana,
but it's a 30 minute exercise.

1046
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:29.670
I was,
I just,
you guys attack it when you go back.
Okay,

1047
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:32.400
so this is it.
This the end of part one.

1048
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:37.710
I'll see probably many of you when we do part two to look at the ENM and quantum

1049
01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:38.544
mechanics

1050
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.600
