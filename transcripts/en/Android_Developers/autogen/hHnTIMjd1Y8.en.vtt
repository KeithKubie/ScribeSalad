demo from Esteban and then Shiva is
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.060
demo from Esteban and then Shiva is
going to be showing the debugger

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
going to be showing the debugger
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.000
going to be showing the debugger
Katherine native tools and Jerome at the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
Katherine native tools and Jerome at the
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860
Katherine native tools and Jerome at the
end with the build system so with that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
end with the build system so with that
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420
end with the build system so with that
I'm gonna turn it over to Esteban it's

from where you are right and learning
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260
from where you are right and learning
all the shortcuts so IntelliJ has

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
all the shortcuts so IntelliJ has
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.859
all the shortcuts so IntelliJ has
several compilations of shortcuts I will

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
several compilations of shortcuts I will
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510
several compilations of shortcuts I will
have while I go through the demo all the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
have while I go through the demo all the
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.870
have while I go through the demo all the
shortcuts written down there but there's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
shortcuts written down there but there's
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.370
shortcuts written down there but there's
one tip if you are um if you're a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
one tip if you are um if you're a
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080
one tip if you are um if you're a
multi-platform there are there are two

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
multi-platform there are there are two
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.270
multi-platform there are there are two
different shortcut setups for mac one

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
different shortcut setups for mac one
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880
different shortcut setups for mac one
that is Mac friendly and the other one

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
that is Mac friendly and the other one
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800
that is Mac friendly and the other one
that is compatible with all platforms so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
that is compatible with all platforms so
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749
that is compatible with all platforms so
if you hear me speaking a shortcut out

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
if you hear me speaking a shortcut out
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.760
if you hear me speaking a shortcut out
loud I'm probably going to be using the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
loud I'm probably going to be using the
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350
loud I'm probably going to be using the
one that is common across all the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
one that is common across all the
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.469
one that is common across all the
platforms so let's begin beef just

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
platforms so let's begin beef just
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480
platforms so let's begin beef just
before we we do the editor part there

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
before we we do the editor part there
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.170
before we we do the editor part there
are two tips that I want to show you for

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
are two tips that I want to show you for
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.060
are two tips that I want to show you for
configuring the the general IDE the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
configuring the the general IDE the
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280
configuring the the general IDE the
first one is the command line launcher

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
first one is the command line launcher
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.399
first one is the command line launcher
so I know if you guys know but you can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
so I know if you guys know but you can
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.289
so I know if you guys know but you can
go and say create command line launcher

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
go and say create command line launcher
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.729
go and say create command line launcher
and that will create this file that you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
and that will create this file that you
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.340
and that will create this file that you
can call from anywhere

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350
can call from anywhere
 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.440
can call from anywhere
to start studio that's cool is handy you

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450
to start studio that's cool is handy you
 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.670
to start studio that's cool is handy you
know you're in a console and you want to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
know you're in a console and you want to
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.860
know you're in a console and you want to
start so you just type studio that's a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
start so you just type studio that's a
 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.230
start so you just type studio that's a
pretty neat but it does more things that

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
pretty neat but it does more things that
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.380
pretty neat but it does more things that
that such as created an I need to put

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
that such as created an I need to put
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.970
that such as created an I need to put
the password and done I'm gonna go to a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
the password and done I'm gonna go to a
 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.400
the password and done I'm gonna go to a
console I think I see yeah

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410
console I think I see yeah
 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.560
console I think I see yeah
if I do studio does that help

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
if I do studio does that help
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.690
if I do studio does that help
that's the shortcut that I just created

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
that's the shortcut that I just created
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.920
that's the shortcut that I just created
but you can see that there are more

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
but you can see that there are more
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.990
but you can see that there are more
options that just studio there is this

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
options that just studio there is this
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.410
options that just studio there is this
and there is merge I'm gonna I have a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
and there is merge I'm gonna I have a
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.710
and there is merge I'm gonna I have a
diff that I run before this actually

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720
diff that I run before this actually
 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.870
diff that I run before this actually
opens Studios diff what is it it's gone

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880
 
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.070
 
this is one of the best dipping tools

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080
this is one of the best dipping tools
 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.840
this is one of the best dipping tools
that I've used and it's really cool to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850
that I've used and it's really cool to
 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.100
that I've used and it's really cool to
be able to have it as a command-line

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
be able to have it as a command-line
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.800
be able to have it as a command-line
tool you can set it up to your get two

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
tool you can set it up to your get two
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.210
tool you can set it up to your get two
or whatever and then then you'll be

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
or whatever and then then you'll be
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.130
or whatever and then then you'll be
using this that you will be hopefully

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
using this that you will be hopefully
 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.630
using this that you will be hopefully
familiar with and you can use this all

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
familiar with and you can use this all
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.210
familiar with and you can use this all
the time you can also do merge from the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
the time you can also do merge from the
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.400
the time you can also do merge from the
command line to and it works so that's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410
command line to and it works so that's
 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.130
command line to and it works so that's
one handy thing to have the next one I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
one handy thing to have the next one I
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.890
one handy thing to have the next one I
want to show you is you know you have a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900
want to show you is you know you have a
 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.800
want to show you is you know you have a
large project and effectively you run

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
large project and effectively you run
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.510
large project and effectively you run
out of memory in studio and things go

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520
out of memory in studio and things go
 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.640
out of memory in studio and things go
back right so if you want it to edit the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650
back right so if you want it to edit the
 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.220
back right so if you want it to edit the
memory settings you need to go to a VM

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230
memory settings you need to go to a VM
 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.200
memory settings you need to go to a VM
options file right how many of you have

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210
options file right how many of you have
 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.730
options file right how many of you have
been to the VM options file and change

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740
been to the VM options file and change
 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.600
been to the VM options file and change
the memory okay that's a lot of people

this is a smart completion so if you do

this is a smart completion so if you do

this is a smart completion so if you do
control space here you know that it

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.090
control space here you know that it
 

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.880
control space here you know that it
offers you all the expressions that you

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:45.890
offers you all the expressions that you
 

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.830

the one that are type correct at the top
 

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.830
the one that are type correct at the top
but if you do control shift space it

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:56.840
but if you do control shift space it
 

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.480
but if you do control shift space it
gives you only the ones that have the

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:58.490
gives you only the ones that have the
 

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.160
gives you only the ones that have the
correct type and you can see that it's

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.170
correct type and you can see that it's

doesn't work so now you enter the
debugger so let's spend the next 10

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:26.200
debugger so let's spend the next 10
 

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.660
debugger so let's spend the next 10
minutes looking at some features in the

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:27.670
minutes looking at some features in the
 

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.730
minutes looking at some features in the
debugger that might help save the day

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:29.740
debugger that might help save the day
 

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.610
debugger that might help save the day
the first thing we want to talk about

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:32.620
the first thing we want to talk about
 

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.740
the first thing we want to talk about
actually three different things one is

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.750
actually three different things one is
 

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.300
actually three different things one is
how do you attach your debugger to a

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.310
how do you attach your debugger to a
 

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.579
how do you attach your debugger to a
process and then about how do you

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:38.589
process and then about how do you
 

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:41.190
process and then about how do you
actually set breakpoints in slightly

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:41.200
actually set breakpoints in slightly
 

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.230
actually set breakpoints in slightly
more interesting ways so that you can

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240
more interesting ways so that you can
 

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.820
more interesting ways so that you can
narrow down the area that you want to

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:44.830
narrow down the area that you want to
 

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.740
narrow down the area that you want to
debug and finally once you're stopped

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:46.750
debug and finally once you're stopped
 

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.019
debug and finally once you're stopped
how do you examine the state of your

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:49.029
how do you examine the state of your
 

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:50.550
how do you examine the state of your
program first let's start with

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560
program first let's start with
 

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.940
program first let's start with
connecting the debugger most the most

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:53.950
connecting the debugger most the most
 

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.920
connecting the debugger most the most
often used is you just launch the

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:55.930
often used is you just launch the
 

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.860
often used is you just launch the
debugger through shift f9 debug app what

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:58.870
debugger through shift f9 debug app what
 

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.260
debugger through shift f9 debug app what
this does is it does a bunch of steps

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.270
this does is it does a bunch of steps
 

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.490
this does is it does a bunch of steps
that you've specified in your run

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:02.500
that you've specified in your run
 

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.010
that you've specified in your run
configuration this has a number of cool

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.020
configuration this has a number of cool
 

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.630
configuration this has a number of cool
features you know you can specify what

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.640
features you know you can specify what
 

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.540
features you know you can specify what
apk to install and more importantly what

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:09.550
apk to install and more importantly what
 

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.310
apk to install and more importantly what
to launch so you would normally launch

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.320
to launch so you would normally launch
 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.199
to launch so you would normally launch
the default activity but you can launch

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:13.209
the default activity but you can launch
 

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:15.630
the default activity but you can launch
a custom activity if you have activity

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:15.640
a custom activity if you have activity
 

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.340
a custom activity if you have activity
aliases or some other activity that you

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:17.350
aliases or some other activity that you
 

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.690
aliases or some other activity that you
would want to launch or you could also

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:18.700
would want to launch or you could also
 

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.240
would want to launch or you could also
launch it URL but what happens if you

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.250
launch it URL but what happens if you
 

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.250
launch it URL but what happens if you
don't want to launch something you don't

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:23.260
don't want to launch something you don't
 

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.510
don't want to launch something you don't
want to install you don't want to build

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:24.520
want to install you don't want to build
 

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.130
want to install you don't want to build
but you just want to connect or let's

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:26.140
but you just want to connect or let's
 

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.110
but you just want to connect or let's
say someone brings your device where

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120
say someone brings your device where
 

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.720
say someone brings your device where
your program is stuck in a bad state so

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:30.730
your program is stuck in a bad state so
 

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.160
your program is stuck in a bad state so
in this particular case I have a program

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.170
in this particular case I have a program
 

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.350
in this particular case I have a program
and it's running over here and I just

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360
and it's running over here and I just
 

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.930
and it's running over here and I just
want to directly connect to it the key

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:36.940
want to directly connect to it the key
 

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.639
want to directly connect to it the key
is just saying attach debugger to

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:38.649
is just saying attach debugger to
 

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:41.730
is just saying attach debugger to
Android process this is also present in

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:41.740
Android process this is also present in
 

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.130
Android process this is also present in
the toolbar when you select this it

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:44.140
the toolbar when you select this it
 

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.720
the toolbar when you select this it
shows you the processes that are running

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:45.730
shows you the processes that are running
 

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.480
shows you the processes that are running
on your connected device and as soon as

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:48.490
on your connected device and as soon as
 

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.460
on your connected device and as soon as
you say ok you select the process then

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:50.470
you say ok you select the process then
 

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.500
you say ok you select the process then
it immediately attaches the debugger to

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:52.510
it immediately attaches the debugger to
 

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.720
it immediately attaches the debugger to
that process so this allows you to

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.730
that process so this allows you to
 

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.060
that process so this allows you to
examine programs when they are in a

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.070
examine programs when they are in a
 

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.120
examine programs when they are in a
messed up state so this is good when

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.130
messed up state so this is good when
 

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.740
messed up state so this is good when
your program has been running for a

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:01.750
your program has been running for a
 

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.640
your program has been running for a
while what do you do if for instance you

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:05.650
while what do you do if for instance you
 

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.549
while what do you do if for instance you
want to debug either second process in

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559
want to debug either second process in
 

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.470
want to debug either second process in
your multi process app or you want to

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480
your multi process app or you want to
 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.819
your multi process app or you want to
debug something that is

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:12.829
debug something that is
 

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.279
debug something that is
you know you wanted attach the debugger

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:15.289
you know you wanted attach the debugger
 

00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:18.279
you know you wanted attach the debugger
as soon as the process starts so Android

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:18.289
as soon as the process starts so Android
 

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:21.909
as soon as the process starts so Android
has a nice API called debug dot wait for

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919
has a nice API called debug dot wait for
 

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:24.759
has a nice API called debug dot wait for
debugger so what this does is that as

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:24.769
debugger so what this does is that as
 

00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:27.130
debugger so what this does is that as
soon as your program starts if it's not

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.140
soon as your program starts if it's not
 

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.080
soon as your program starts if it's not
launched through the ID itself and when

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.090
launched through the ID itself and when
 

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.700
launched through the ID itself and when
it encounters this API it will just

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.710
it encounters this API it will just
 

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.220
it encounters this API it will just
pause your program at this location so

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.230
pause your program at this location so
 

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.409
pause your program at this location so
that you can then connect to it so in

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:35.419
that you can then connect to it so in
 

00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:37.120
that you can then connect to it so in
this particular case I'm going to launch

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.130
this particular case I'm going to launch
 

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.860
this particular case I'm going to launch
this broadcast receiver it obviously

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:38.870
this broadcast receiver it obviously
 

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.940
this broadcast receiver it obviously
doesn't have to be this it can be

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:39.950
doesn't have to be this it can be
 

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.049
doesn't have to be this it can be
anything you go to the show and I launch

00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:44.059
anything you go to the show and I launch
 

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:46.930
anything you go to the show and I launch
this and now you see that the active

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:46.940
this and now you see that the active
 

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.279
this and now you see that the active
whatever you launched is actually

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:48.289
whatever you launched is actually
 

00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:49.840
whatever you launched is actually
waiting because it's waiting for the

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:49.850
waiting because it's waiting for the
 

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.759
waiting because it's waiting for the
debugger to connect at this point you

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:51.769
debugger to connect at this point you
 

00:17:51.769 --> 00:17:53.710
debugger to connect at this point you
can again attach the debugger and now

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720
can again attach the debugger and now
 

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.870
can again attach the debugger and now
you see the second process and this will

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880
you see the second process and this will
 

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.930
you see the second process and this will
come and force right at that the next

00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:58.940
come and force right at that the next
 

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.700
come and force right at that the next
statement so this is really cool when

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:00.710
statement so this is really cool when
 

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.529
statement so this is really cool when
you have something that you want to

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:02.539
you have something that you want to
 

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.590
you have something that you want to
debug really early in your code

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600
debug really early in your code
 

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.960
debug really early in your code
so that is how you attach to cross these

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:07.970
so that is how you attach to cross these
 

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:12.720
so that is how you attach to cross these
now let's look at now let's look at a

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:12.730
now let's look at now let's look at a
 

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.159
now let's look at now let's look at a
few things about how do you set

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:15.169
few things about how do you set
 

00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:17.139
few things about how do you set
breakpoints are in slightly more

00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:17.149
breakpoints are in slightly more
 

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:20.259
breakpoints are in slightly more
interesting ways let's go back here and

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:20.269
interesting ways let's go back here and
 

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:26.610
interesting ways let's go back here and
let's run our app

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:26.620
 
 

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.890
 
so I have I have a break point set up

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:28.900
so I have I have a break point set up
 

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.419
so I have I have a break point set up
that's I mean the application you saw is

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:30.429
that's I mean the application you saw is
 

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:33.360
that's I mean the application you saw is
a pretty simple recycle of you and is

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:33.370
a pretty simple recycle of you and is
 

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.279
a pretty simple recycle of you and is
this break point is it in the bind

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:35.289
this break point is it in the bind
 

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:36.870
this break point is it in the bind
viewholder it's going to stop every

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880
viewholder it's going to stop every
 

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.620
viewholder it's going to stop every
single time so you can keep continuing

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.630
single time so you can keep continuing
 

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.960
single time so you can keep continuing
but this gets super annoying really soon

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:42.970
but this gets super annoying really soon
 

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.060
but this gets super annoying really soon
so what you the first thing that you

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.070
so what you the first thing that you
 

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.340
so what you the first thing that you
probably want to learn is there is an

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.350
probably want to learn is there is an
 

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.380
probably want to learn is there is an
option called mute break points which

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:49.390
option called mute break points which
 

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.330
option called mute break points which
will disable break points throughout

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.340
will disable break points throughout
 

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.130
will disable break points throughout
your program all the all the great

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.140
your program all the all the great
 

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.630
your program all the all the great
points that you've set so this allows

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640
points that you've set so this allows
 

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.700
points that you've set so this allows
your app to continue running without the

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.710
your app to continue running without the
 

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.250
your app to continue running without the
break points and then once you have you

00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.260
break points and then once you have you
 

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.600
break points and then once you have you
program in a certain state where you

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:00.610
program in a certain state where you
 

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.039
program in a certain state where you
actually want the break points enable

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:02.049
actually want the break points enable
 

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:04.710
actually want the break points enable
you can enable it back again that is

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720
you can enable it back again that is
 

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.500
you can enable it back again that is
like a hammer this it just disables all

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:07.510
like a hammer this it just disables all
 

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.299
like a hammer this it just disables all
the break points if you want to be a

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:09.309
the break points if you want to be a
 

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:10.919
the break points if you want to be a
little bit more if you want to have a

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:10.929
little bit more if you want to have a
 

00:19:10.929 --> 00:19:13.019
little bit more if you want to have a
little more control then you start with

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.029
little more control then you start with
 

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:16.139
little more control then you start with
looking at conditional breakpoints what

00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:16.149
looking at conditional breakpoints what
 

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:18.289
looking at conditional breakpoints what
I want you guys to think of is that

00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299
I want you guys to think of is that
 

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:21.299
I want you guys to think of is that
break points are not purely static

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:21.309
break points are not purely static
 

00:19:21.309 --> 00:19:24.029
break points are not purely static
you you get some control over when they

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039
you you get some control over when they
 

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.159
you you get some control over when they
are hit and what do you do when they are

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:26.169
are hit and what do you do when they are
 

00:19:26.169 --> 00:19:28.649
are hit and what do you do when they are
head that that if you get that part then

00:19:28.649 --> 00:19:28.659
head that that if you get that part then
 

00:19:28.659 --> 00:19:30.149
head that that if you get that part then
you can just go through the list and

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159
you can just go through the list and
 

00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:31.260
you can just go through the list and
figure out all the different options

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.270
figure out all the different options
 

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.600
figure out all the different options
around break points the first one let's

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:33.610
around break points the first one let's
 

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.330
around break points the first one let's
say is I want to say - I want to say

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.340
say is I want to say - I want to say
 

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.190
say is I want to say - I want to say
that I want to I want to break on this

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200
that I want to I want to break on this
 

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.430
that I want to I want to break on this
position on this location only on let's

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440
position on this location only on let's
 

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.310
position on this location only on let's
say the let's say the tenth item I'm not

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320
say the let's say the tenth item I'm not
 

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.750
say the let's say the tenth item I'm not
sure if that show properly what I

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760
sure if that show properly what I
 

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.970
sure if that show properly what I
basically said position equals 10 as a

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:50.980
basically said position equals 10 as a
 

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.269
basically said position equals 10 as a
condition there and this means that this

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:54.279
condition there and this means that this
 

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.279
condition there and this means that this
break point will not be here until this

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:56.289
break point will not be here until this
 

00:19:56.289 --> 00:19:58.830
break point will not be here until this
value this variable position has a value

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840
value this variable position has a value
 

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.870
value this variable position has a value
of five and so of 10 so now go here and

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880
of five and so of 10 so now go here and
 

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.970
of five and so of 10 so now go here and
I scroll and now it hits the break point

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:05.980
I scroll and now it hits the break point
 

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.870
I scroll and now it hits the break point
only when our position is actually 10

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880
only when our position is actually 10
 

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.519
only when our position is actually 10
that's the conditional breakpoint now

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:11.529
that's the conditional breakpoint now
 

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:13.139
that's the conditional breakpoint now
there are actually a number of

00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:13.149
there are actually a number of
 

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:16.380
there are actually a number of
conditions that you can set let's go

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.390
conditions that you can set let's go
 

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.710
conditions that you can set let's go
here and over here you see setting a

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720
here and over here you see setting a
 

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.990
here and over here you see setting a
condition is one another option that is

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000
condition is one another option that is
 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.700
condition is one another option that is
really cool is instead of setting a

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:23.710
really cool is instead of setting a
 

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.889
really cool is instead of setting a
condition you can actually evaluate an

00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:25.899
condition you can actually evaluate an
 

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:28.649
condition you can actually evaluate an
expression and if you turn off suspend

00:20:28.649 --> 00:20:28.659
expression and if you turn off suspend
 

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:31.409
expression and if you turn off suspend
then this break point acts pretty much

00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:31.419
then this break point acts pretty much
 

00:20:31.419 --> 00:20:33.330
then this break point acts pretty much
like every time the breakpoint is hit we

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:33.340
like every time the breakpoint is hit we
 

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.100
like every time the breakpoint is hit we
will just log this expression over here

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.110
will just log this expression over here
 

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.260
will just log this expression over here
let's say I want to log an expression

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.270
let's say I want to log an expression
 

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.720
let's say I want to log an expression
that says

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:38.730
that says
 

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:50.740
that says
yes position as

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:50.750
 
 

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.360
 
do this so now I go to the console the

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:55.370
do this so now I go to the console the
 

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.070
do this so now I go to the console the
new feature in 2 or 3 already is that

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080
new feature in 2 or 3 already is that
 

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.919
new feature in 2 or 3 already is that
logcat gets streamed directly into your

00:20:59.919 --> 00:20:59.929
logcat gets streamed directly into your
 

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:02.529
logcat gets streamed directly into your
debug console so you see the lock at

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:02.539
debug console so you see the lock at
 

00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:04.779
debug console so you see the lock at
over here and then we just added a

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:04.789
over here and then we just added a
 

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:06.970
over here and then we just added a
breakpoint at the end which basically

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:06.980
breakpoint at the end which basically
 

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.010
breakpoint at the end which basically
said every time it hits the breakpoint

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.020
said every time it hits the breakpoint
 

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.279
said every time it hits the breakpoint
it'll log an expression so when I scroll

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:12.289
it'll log an expression so when I scroll
 

00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:14.490
it'll log an expression so when I scroll
over here you will see that it keeps

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:14.500
over here you will see that it keeps
 

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.350
over here you will see that it keeps
logging whenever it hits the breakpoint

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360
logging whenever it hits the breakpoint
 

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.940
logging whenever it hits the breakpoint
it will keep logging or whatever

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:18.950
it will keep logging or whatever
 

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.830
it will keep logging or whatever
expression that you have given so this

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840
expression that you have given so this
 

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.180
expression that you have given so this
is extremely useful because you don't

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.190
is extremely useful because you don't
 

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.770
is extremely useful because you don't
have to like if you just want to log

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.780
have to like if you just want to log
 

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.570
have to like if you just want to log
something then you don't have to do a

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:25.580
something then you don't have to do a
 

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.620
something then you don't have to do a
whole rebuild and deploy again the next

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:29.630
whole rebuild and deploy again the next
 

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:37.230
whole rebuild and deploy again the next
I just want to point out a few other

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240
I just want to point out a few other
 

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.880
I just want to point out a few other
conditional options that are there in

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:39.890
conditional options that are there in
 

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.310
conditional options that are there in
breakpoints which is there is one cool

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320
breakpoints which is there is one cool
 

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.960
breakpoints which is there is one cool
feature where you can say that I don't

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:43.970
feature where you can say that I don't
 

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.850
feature where you can say that I don't
want this breakpoint I don't want the

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:45.860
want this breakpoint I don't want the
 

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.260
want this breakpoint I don't want the
program to pause at this breakpoint

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.270
program to pause at this breakpoint
 

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.200
program to pause at this breakpoint
until a different breakpoint was hit so

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.210
until a different breakpoint was hit so
 

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.060
until a different breakpoint was hit so
if you specify this then the program

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.070
if you specify this then the program
 

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.950
if you specify this then the program
will pause at this breakpoint only after

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960
will pause at this breakpoint only after
 

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.299
will pause at this breakpoint only after
the subsequent breakpoint was set and

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:55.309
the subsequent breakpoint was set and
 

00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:57.190
the subsequent breakpoint was set and
you have even more controls you know

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200
you have even more controls you know
 

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.779
you have even more controls you know
there are instance filters so you can

00:21:58.779 --> 00:21:58.789
there are instance filters so you can
 

00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:00.279
there are instance filters so you can
say you only want to stop if it's a

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:00.289
say you only want to stop if it's a
 

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:04.270
say you only want to stop if it's a
certain object set in class so now let's

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.280
certain object set in class so now let's
 

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.480
certain object set in class so now let's
go

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.490
 
 

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:14.290
 
so now let's look at another really cool

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:14.300
so now let's look at another really cool
 

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:20.920
so now let's look at another really cool
feature that the debugger provides so

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:20.930
feature that the debugger provides so
 

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:28.440
feature that the debugger provides so
have this

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.450
 
 

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.840
 
okay so this is the data which is

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:30.850
okay so this is the data which is
 

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.369
okay so this is the data which is
displayed by the recyclerview

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:32.379
displayed by the recyclerview
 

00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:35.249
displayed by the recyclerview
and i have a whole bunch of objects what

00:22:35.249 --> 00:22:35.259
and i have a whole bunch of objects what
 

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:37.649
and i have a whole bunch of objects what
happens if you want to track one

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:37.659
happens if you want to track one
 

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:39.810
happens if you want to track one
particular object throughout the

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:39.820
particular object throughout the
 

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:47.400
particular object throughout the
lifecycle of your program

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:47.410
 
 

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.650
 
so what I can do is let's say I want to

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:49.660
so what I can do is let's say I want to
 

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.540
so what I can do is let's say I want to
track what is going on with the eighth

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.550
track what is going on with the eighth
 

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.620
track what is going on with the eighth
object in my list I can attach a name to

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:55.630
object in my list I can attach a name to
 

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.930
object in my list I can attach a name to
it and this is what you do by marking

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:57.940
it and this is what you do by marking
 

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.140
it and this is what you do by marking
the object and so I say this is date and

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.150
the object and so I say this is date and
 

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.450
the object and so I say this is date and
what that immediately does is that it

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.460
what that immediately does is that it
 

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.850
what that immediately does is that it
this is equivalent of you creating a

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:05.860
this is equivalent of you creating a
 

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.040
this is equivalent of you creating a
variable in the debugger and seeing that

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.050
variable in the debugger and seeing that
 

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.840
variable in the debugger and seeing that
this variable points this to this

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:09.850
this variable points this to this
 

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.630
this variable points this to this
particular object and any time in your

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640
particular object and any time in your
 

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.520
particular object and any time in your
program as long as that object is

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:14.530
program as long as that object is
 

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.410
program as long as that object is
visible you will see it annotated with

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:16.420
visible you will see it annotated with
 

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.480
visible you will see it annotated with
this particular name it's really cool

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:18.490
this particular name it's really cool
 

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.040
this particular name it's really cool
because many times you want to track a

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.050
because many times you want to track a
 

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.840
because many times you want to track a
one particular object I usually end up

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:21.850
one particular object I usually end up
 

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.700
one particular object I usually end up
used to end up writing it on a piece of

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:23.710
used to end up writing it on a piece of
 

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.800
used to end up writing it on a piece of
paper the object reference and your

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:25.810
paper the object reference and your
 

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.630
paper the object reference and your
tracker but instead you just have to

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640
tracker but instead you just have to
 

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.750
tracker but instead you just have to
mark the object and then once it is done

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760
mark the object and then once it is done
 

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.340
mark the object and then once it is done
let's say you go somewhere else in your

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.350
let's say you go somewhere else in your
 

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.250
let's say you go somewhere else in your
program and over here you can actually

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:35.260
program and over here you can actually
 

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.370
program and over here you can actually
see firstly you can see that it is the

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:41.380
see firstly you can see that it is the
 

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.410
see firstly you can see that it is the
same object so in the case that it is a

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:43.420
same object so in the case that it is a
 

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.030
same object so in the case that it is a
single turn for instance and you have

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.040
single turn for instance and you have
 

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.250
single turn for instance and you have
properly marked then you would not you

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:47.260
properly marked then you would not you
 

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.800
properly marked then you would not you
would always see it annotated with us

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:48.810
would always see it annotated with us
 

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.960
would always see it annotated with us
not only that you can actually use this

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:51.970
not only that you can actually use this
 

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.600
not only that you can actually use this
as a conditional over here so here I can

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:54.610
as a conditional over here so here I can
 

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.440
as a conditional over here so here I can
say forecast or equals RT a so this is

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:58.450
say forecast or equals RT a so this is
 

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.410
say forecast or equals RT a so this is
the variable name I gave and if you are

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:01.420
the variable name I gave and if you are
 

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.410
the variable name I gave and if you are
the IntelliJ convention is that you add

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:04.420
the IntelliJ convention is that you add
 

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.050
the IntelliJ convention is that you add
underscore debug label as a suffix and

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:07.060
underscore debug label as a suffix and
 

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.330
underscore debug label as a suffix and
that variable is just available to you

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.340
that variable is just available to you
 

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.600
that variable is just available to you
so now if you do this then we will stop

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.610
so now if you do this then we will stop
 

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.360
so now if you do this then we will stop
at this breakpoint only on the whenever

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.370
at this breakpoint only on the whenever
 

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.520
at this breakpoint only on the whenever
the forecast matches the day we mark so

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:17.530
the forecast matches the day we mark so
 

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.320
the forecast matches the day we mark so
this is really cool when you want to

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.330
this is really cool when you want to
 

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.450
this is really cool when you want to
track specific objects over the course

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:21.460
track specific objects over the course
 

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:27.639
track specific objects over the course
of your program

00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:27.649
 
 

00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:30.619
 
now I want to get into evaluating

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:30.629
now I want to get into evaluating
 

00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:33.680
now I want to get into evaluating
expressions a little bit so let's go

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:33.690
expressions a little bit so let's go
 

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:44.030
expressions a little bit so let's go
over here and I have

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.040
 
 

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.550
 
so I have this expression and what this

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:46.560
so I have this expression and what this
 

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.700
so I have this expression and what this
is is that if the current time if it was

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:49.710
is is that if the current time if it was
 

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.070
is is that if the current time if it was
more than a day since the last sink only

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080
more than a day since the last sink only
 

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.890
more than a day since the last sink only
then show notification but it so happens

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900
then show notification but it so happens
 

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.630
then show notification but it so happens
that I actually want to debug so if I

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640
that I actually want to debug so if I
 

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.760
that I actually want to debug so if I
continue from here if I step through

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:58.770
continue from here if I step through
 

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.240
continue from here if I step through
from here then I go into the if case and

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:02.250
from here then I go into the if case and
 

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.160
from here then I go into the if case and
I but what I really want to debug let's

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.170
I but what I really want to debug let's
 

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.050
I but what I really want to debug let's
say is the else case so now what do you

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.060
say is the else case so now what do you
 

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.040
say is the else case so now what do you
do let's go back to the breakpoint again

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.050
do let's go back to the breakpoint again
 

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.750
do let's go back to the breakpoint again
the easiest thing to do first is you

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760
the easiest thing to do first is you
 

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.000
the easiest thing to do first is you
evaluate this expression so now you see

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.010
evaluate this expression so now you see
 

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.280
evaluate this expression so now you see
the current so the result is true so

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:16.290
the current so the result is true so
 

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.320
the current so the result is true so
you're going to take the if case but

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:18.330
you're going to take the if case but
 

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.820
you're going to take the if case but
what I really want to do is figure out

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:19.830
what I really want to do is figure out
 

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.520
what I really want to do is figure out
why this case was true so now I can see

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.530
why this case was true so now I can see
 

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.160
why this case was true so now I can see
the last thing time this is the

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.170
the last thing time this is the
 

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.720
the last thing time this is the
timestamp in milliseconds but it's

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:26.730
timestamp in milliseconds but it's
 

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.460
timestamp in milliseconds but it's
pretty hard to see what exactly that

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:28.470
pretty hard to see what exactly that
 

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.310
pretty hard to see what exactly that
means so what you can do is you can say

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320
means so what you can do is you can say
 

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.220
means so what you can do is you can say
that I want to view this as a timestamp

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.230
that I want to view this as a timestamp
 

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.530
that I want to view this as a timestamp
now when you do that it actually renders

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:36.540
now when you do that it actually renders
 

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:43.730
now when you do that it actually renders
it as a timestamp and that's pretty cool

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740
it as a timestamp and that's pretty cool
 

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.080
it as a timestamp and that's pretty cool
because now you see that the last thing

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.090
because now you see that the last thing
 

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.600
because now you see that the last thing
was at noon and so obviously the if

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:47.610
was at noon and so obviously the if
 

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.210
was at noon and so obviously the if
condition will always be true now comes

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220
condition will always be true now comes
 

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.890
condition will always be true now comes
the next part you actually want to force

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900
the next part you actually want to force
 

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.840
the next part you actually want to force
it so what you do is you set the value

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.850
it so what you do is you set the value
 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.370
it so what you do is you set the value
to zero and you close and then you can

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380
to zero and you close and then you can
 

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.740
to zero and you close and then you can
evaluate the expression again now the

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:00.750
evaluate the expression again now the
 

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.300
evaluate the expression again now the
result is false and that's because we

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:02.310
result is false and that's because we
 

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.920
result is false and that's because we
were basically just able to from the

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:03.930
were basically just able to from the
 

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.690
were basically just able to from the
debugger set the value of an object and

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700
debugger set the value of an object and
 

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.700
debugger set the value of an object and
you can do this actually for any any

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:07.710
you can do this actually for any any
 

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.610
you can do this actually for any any
field that you want so now if you close

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620
field that you want so now if you close
 

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:16.280
field that you want so now if you close
and step you can now get the LCS without

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.290
and step you can now get the LCS without
 

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:17.840
and step you can now get the LCS without
actually tweaking your program you just

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:17.850
actually tweaking your program you just
 

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:22.880
actually tweaking your program you just
change the value in the debugger the

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:22.890
change the value in the debugger the
 

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.130
change the value in the debugger the
last couple of things so actually let me

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140
last couple of things so actually let me
 

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.480
last couple of things so actually let me
show one more thing here this smart step

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:29.490
show one more thing here this smart step
 

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.650
show one more thing here this smart step
so

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:32.660
 
 

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.780
 
normally when you when you have code

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:35.790
normally when you when you have code
 

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.350
normally when you when you have code
like this which is either methods which

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360
like this which is either methods which
 

00:26:39.360 --> 00:27:01.540
like this which is either methods which
are

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.550
 
 

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.400
 
so I have a method like this then

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.410
so I have a method like this then
 

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.350
so I have a method like this then
typically what and if I want to step

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360
typically what and if I want to step
 

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.260
typically what and if I want to step
into one of these methods what I what

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:08.270
into one of these methods what I what
 

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.430
into one of these methods what I what
used to happen is that you would

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440
used to happen is that you would
 

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.960
used to happen is that you would
actually have to step into each one and

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:10.970
actually have to step into each one and
 

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.220
actually have to step into each one and
then you get out of it and then you go

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:12.230
then you get out of it and then you go
 

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.900
then you get out of it and then you go
back into it so instead there is an

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:13.910
back into it so instead there is an
 

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.550
back into it so instead there is an
option called smart step which will tell

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:15.560
option called smart step which will tell
 

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.260
option called smart step which will tell
you exactly which particular method you

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:17.270
you exactly which particular method you
 

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.780
you exactly which particular method you
want to step into and this is really

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:19.790
want to step into and this is really
 

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.240
want to step into and this is really
useful whenever you have methods you

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.250
useful whenever you have methods you
 

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.180
useful whenever you have methods you
know functions being passed on so you

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:25.190
know functions being passed on so you
 

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.400
know functions being passed on so you
have multiple parameters which take

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:27.410
have multiple parameters which take
 

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.200
have multiple parameters which take
function values and then you can select

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.210
function values and then you can select
 

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.030
function values and then you can select
which particular method you want step

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.040
which particular method you want step
 

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.360

into now let's look at a little bit

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.370
into now let's look at a little bit
 

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.020
into now let's look at a little bit
about the view over here in this stack

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.030
about the view over here in this stack
 

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.360
about the view over here in this stack

we would take you to the platform
 

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.940
we would take you to the platform
sources but the platform sources always

the corresponding to the device the only
 

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.870
the corresponding to the device the only
thing you have to do is make sure that

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880
thing you have to do is make sure that
 

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.400
thing you have to do is make sure that
that particular source is actually

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:31.380
 
finally I want to say a couple of things

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:31.390
finally I want to say a couple of things
 

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.630
finally I want to say a couple of things
about instant run one really cool thing

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640
about instant run one really cool thing
 

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.610
about instant run one really cool thing
about instant run is that if you are

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:35.620
about instant run is that if you are
 

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.070
about instant run is that if you are
debugging or an instant run is enabled

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080
debugging or an instant run is enabled
 

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.049
debugging or an instant run is enabled
you can actually restart an activity

00:28:40.049 --> 00:28:40.059
you can actually restart an activity
 

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:43.950
you can actually restart an activity
from here and that would immediately if

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960
from here and that would immediately if
 

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.810
from here and that would immediately if
I had launched it in instant on mode it

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:45.820
I had launched it in instant on mode it
 

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.980
I had launched it in instant on mode it
would pretty much restart the activity

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:46.990
would pretty much restart the activity
 

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.390

you don't have to go killer and you

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:48.400
you don't have to go killer and you
 

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.360
you don't have to go killer and you
don't have to go to the device and one

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:51.370
don't have to go to the device and one
 

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.280
don't have to go to the device and one
other tip when you are using instant run

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.290
other tip when you are using instant run
 

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:56.940
other tip when you are using instant run
is that you have to manually stop your

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:56.950
is that you have to manually stop your
 

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.160
is that you have to manually stop your
instance or use the stop button to

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.170
instance or use the stop button to
 

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.260
instance or use the stop button to
terminate the application before running

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.270
terminate the application before running
 

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.910
terminate the application before running

bit of because instant-on is new many

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:06.490
bit of because instant-on is new many
 

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.580
bit of because instant-on is new many
people get confused about that that's

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:08.590

avoid this problem because when you
 

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.150
avoid this problem because when you
start creating a new method let's just

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:50.160
start creating a new method let's just
 

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.120
start creating a new method let's just
make a clone of our string to J&amp;I here

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.130
 
 

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.500
 
you can auto complete it from the studio

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:57.510
you can auto complete it from the studio
 

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:02.360

creates the whole stub in C++ so you

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.050
creates the whole stub in C++ so you
 

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.870
creates the whole stub in C++ so you
don't have to worry at all about you

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880
don't have to worry at all about you

don't have to worry at all about you
know whether you've actually got in the

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:06.990
know whether you've actually got in the
 

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.710
know whether you've actually got in the
right java class path here once you

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720
right java class path here once you
 

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.400
right java class path here once you
start editing there's a c++ tool called

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.410
start editing there's a c++ tool called
 

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.370
start editing there's a c++ tool called
doxygen where it gives you Java style

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380
doxygen where it gives you Java style
 

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.840

auto dogs so let's say we want to create

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:17.850
auto dogs so let's say we want to create
 

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.700
auto dogs so let's say we want to create
some sample function you need to add the

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:22.710
some sample function you need to add the
 

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:33.390
some sample function you need to add the
method we're not yeah whatever

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:33.400
 
 

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.350
 
um so as I create this I can whatever I

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360
um so as I create this I can whatever I
 

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:37.950

went in there

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960
went in there
 

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.980
went in there
and then you look up the whole list but

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:40.990
and then you look up the whole list but
 

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.140
and then you look up the whole list but
a couple good ones are

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.150
a couple good ones are
 

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.300
a couple good ones are
I think brief is the heading this is

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:45.310
I think brief is the heading this is

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:57.330
and then when you go down and hit f1 I
 

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:03.860
and then when you go down and hit f1 I
should if I have spelled this correctly

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:03.870
 
 

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.230

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.280
 
yeah it's a good way to get Java style

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:32.290
yeah it's a good way to get Java style
 

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.510
yeah it's a good way to get Java style

so I think in the earlier talked or

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:41.770
so I think in the earlier talked or
 

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.220
so I think in the earlier talked or
mentioned the Auto debugger and I'm just

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:44.230
mentioned the Auto debugger and I'm just
 

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.850
mentioned the Auto debugger and I'm just
going to start this if you ever start

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:47.860
going to start this if you ever start

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.370
and you're like why is it not catching
 

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.340

any of my native breakpoints the first

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:53.350
any of my native breakpoints the first

thing you should always look at is under
 

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.970
thing you should always look at is under
your app configuration do you have the

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:56.980
your app configuration do you have the
 

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.280
your app configuration do you have the
sets of Java if it sets a Java you're

sets of Java if it sets a Java you're
 

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:03.690
sets of Java if it sets a Java you're
going to be pretty sad but when it's set

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:03.700
going to be pretty sad but when it's set
 

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.570

to auto native or hybrid well if it's
 

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.060
to auto native or hybrid well if it's
it's in native you're not gonna catch in

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.070
it's in native you're not gonna catch in
 

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.490
it's in native you're not gonna catch in
the Java breakpoints but I can step into

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:11.500
the Java breakpoints but I can step into
 

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.460
the Java breakpoints but I can step into
my java breakpoint and then I can

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.470
my java breakpoint and then I can
 

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.910
my java breakpoint and then I can
actually set a little-known feature

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:17.920
actually set a little-known feature
 

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.480
actually set a little-known feature
called a memory watch point so I can

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:21.490
called a memory watch point so I can
 

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.070
called a memory watch point so I can
right-click on this and say add watch

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080
right-click on this and say add watch
 

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.230
right-click on this and say add watch
point and this actually adds hardware

let us look at it with the debugger so

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:44.950
let us look at it with the debugger so
 

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.000
let us look at it with the debugger so
if you ever try to figure out what's

this is a really handy way to do it it's

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.150
this is a really handy way to do it it's

so once we've done that let's take that

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.170
so once we've done that let's take that
 

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:05.800
so once we've done that let's take that
away and the other thing we've added the

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:05.810
away and the other thing we've added the
 

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.220
away and the other thing we've added the
debugger for C++ is STL support so you

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:09.230
debugger for C++ is STL support so you
 

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.840
debugger for C++ is STL support so you
can see up here I've created a vector

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:10.850
can see up here I've created a vector
 

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.760
can see up here I've created a vector
and I've added a bunch of pairs to it I

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:12.770
and I've added a bunch of pairs to it I
 

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.130
and I've added a bunch of pairs to it I
can actually start expanding it's fully

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.140
can actually start expanding it's fully
 

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.630
can actually start expanding it's fully
aware of this tail you can have some

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640
aware of this tail you can have some
 

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.760
aware of this tail you can have some
crazy map in here and it should still

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.770
crazy map in here and it should still
 

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.100
crazy map in here and it should still
bender I mean you can interact with the

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.110
bender I mean you can interact with the
 

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.500
bender I mean you can interact with the
STL when you're evaluating your

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:23.510
STL when you're evaluating your
 

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:29.070
STL when you're evaluating your
functions I can say like vector size and

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080
functions I can say like vector size and
 

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.960
functions I can say like vector size and
voila I'm similarly you should be able

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:31.970
voila I'm similarly you should be able
 

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.900
voila I'm similarly you should be able
to edit memory see the results so I

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:34.910
to edit memory see the results so I
 

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.160
to edit memory see the results so I
think that's the debugger stuff we've

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.170
think that's the debugger stuff we've
 

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.440
think that's the debugger stuff we've
added see if I can get us back on time

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.450
added see if I can get us back on time
 

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.680
added see if I can get us back on time

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:29.310
I'd like to hand it over to Jerome for
some great tips thank you alright so as

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320
some great tips thank you alright so as
 

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.990
some great tips thank you alright so as
you know we've worked a lot on

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000
you know we've worked a lot on
 

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.910
you know we've worked a lot on
performance of build whether the build

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920
performance of build whether the build
 

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.390
performance of build whether the build
should be incremental or full and some

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400
should be incremental or full and some
 

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.970
should be incremental or full and some
of the effort that was led by this

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980
of the effort that was led by this
 

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.290
of the effort that was led by this
performance work was the instant run a

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:40.300
performance work was the instant run a
 

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.230
performance work was the instant run a
technology now when installed on got

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240
technology now when installed on got
 

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.240
technology now when installed on got
delivered a lot of people got confused

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.250
delivered a lot of people got confused
 

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.260
delivered a lot of people got confused
about a few things

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.270
about a few things
 

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.880
about a few things
and I would like to clarify some of them

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:47.890
and I would like to clarify some of them
 

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:52.050
and I would like to clarify some of them
today so first of all the way we do

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:52.060
today so first of all the way we do
 

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.580
today so first of all the way we do
instant run is by doing bytecode

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:53.590
instant run is by doing bytecode
 

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.680
instant run is by doing bytecode
instrumentation and do we do have a few

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:55.690
instrumentation and do we do have a few
 

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.020
instrumentation and do we do have a few
fields and a few methods so suddenly

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.030
fields and a few methods so suddenly
 

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.940
fields and a few methods so suddenly
some magic can happen and you can reload

00:35:59.940 --> 00:35:59.950
some magic can happen and you can reload
 

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.920
some magic can happen and you can reload
a class in a living virtual machine

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:01.930
a class in a living virtual machine
 

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.270
a class in a living virtual machine
without having to restart the

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280
without having to restart the
 

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.960
without having to restart the
application now this adding of fields

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:06.970
application now this adding of fields
 

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.910
application now this adding of fields
and methods have sometimes from people

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920
and methods have sometimes from people
 

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.290
and methods have sometimes from people
over the limit of the 65k Dex file limit

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:13.300
over the limit of the 65k Dex file limit
 

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.600
over the limit of the 65k Dex file limit
and that a lot of people were confused

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:15.610
and that a lot of people were confused
 

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.400
and that a lot of people were confused
by that and not knowing how to fix it so

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.410
by that and not knowing how to fix it so
 

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.050
by that and not knowing how to fix it so
I thought I should I should explain how

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.060
I thought I should I should explain how
 

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.580
I thought I should I should explain how
it is so basically if you heat the 65k

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:23.590
it is so basically if you heat the 65k
 

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.110
it is so basically if you heat the 65k
limit which is just what happened here

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.120
limit which is just what happened here
 

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.970
limit which is just what happened here
should probably make this a little

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:26.980
should probably make this a little
 

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.470
should probably make this a little
bigger so you should get a message that

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480
bigger so you should get a message that
 

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.460
bigger so you should get a message that
will tell you that you are over the 65

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:35.470
will tell you that you are over the 65
 

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.050
will tell you that you are over the 65
key limits so as you know the Dex file

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.060
key limits so as you know the Dex file
 

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.000
key limits so as you know the Dex file
format only support 65 key methods or

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.010
format only support 65 key methods or
 

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.940
format only support 65 key methods or
classes Here I am at 70 K so to fix the

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:41.950
classes Here I am at 70 K so to fix the
 

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:48.290
classes Here I am at 70 K so to fix the
problem I just need to to define

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300
 
 

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.950
 
one more girdle thing to say I want

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960
one more girdle thing to say I want
 

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.660
one more girdle thing to say I want
Monty Tex to be true okay so when that

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:53.670
Monty Tex to be true okay so when that
 

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.930
Monty Tex to be true okay so when that
happens and now we can try to build

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:55.940
happens and now we can try to build
 

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.490
happens and now we can try to build
gradall we'll start saying that we are

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500
gradall we'll start saying that we are
 

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.710
gradall we'll start saying that we are
allowing to build the application in

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720
allowing to build the application in
 

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.780
allowing to build the application in
separate different Dex files now there's

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:05.790
separate different Dex files now there's
 

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.730
separate different Dex files now there's
two types of multi decks in on the whate

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740
two types of multi decks in on the whate
 

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.220
two types of multi decks in on the whate
platform there is what we call the

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.230
platform there is what we call the
 

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.670
platform there is what we call the
legacy multiplexing and there is the

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680
legacy multiplexing and there is the
 

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.330
legacy multiplexing and there is the
modern or native multi taxing and

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:16.340
modern or native multi taxing and
 

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.110
modern or native multi taxing and
depending on which platform you're

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:18.120
depending on which platform you're
 

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.450
depending on which platform you're
you're targeting we will use one or the

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460
you're targeting we will use one or the
 

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:20.840
you're targeting we will use one or the
other

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:20.850
other
 

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.170
other
basically the before 21 you will use the

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180
basically the before 21 you will use the
 

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.420
basically the before 21 you will use the
legacy one and 21 and above you will use

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:26.430
legacy one and 21 and above you will use
 

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.410
legacy one and 21 and above you will use
the modern one the problem here is that

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:29.420
the modern one the problem here is that
 

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.650
the modern one the problem here is that
because we are targeting min SDK 19 by

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660
because we are targeting min SDK 19 by
 

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.180
because we are targeting min SDK 19 by
default the the legacy multi decks would

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:38.190
default the the legacy multi decks would
 

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.240
default the the legacy multi decks would
be used okay so we still got to build

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.250
be used okay so we still got to build
 

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.250
be used okay so we still got to build
and it's 12 seconds which is going to be

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260
and it's 12 seconds which is going to be
 

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.380
and it's 12 seconds which is going to be
our baseline for today's demo and we're

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:45.390
our baseline for today's demo and we're
 

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.880
our baseline for today's demo and we're
going to see this number going down as

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:46.890
going to see this number going down as
 

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.460
going to see this number going down as
I'm starting to improve by different

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.470
I'm starting to improve by different
 

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.920
I'm starting to improve by different
settings this this build environment but

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:51.930
settings this this build environment but
 

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.840
settings this this build environment but
first I would like to change a little

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:53.850
first I would like to change a little
 

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.870
first I would like to change a little
bit of code just one line and I'm going

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880
bit of code just one line and I'm going
 

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.640
bit of code just one line and I'm going
to change this for instance so we also

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:01.650
to change this for instance so we also
 

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:07.540
to change this for instance so we also
get a baseline for the incremental built

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:07.550
 
 

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.830
 
so the incremental build will just have

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:09.840
so the incremental build will just have
 

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.330
so the incremental build will just have
one file in theory it should be modified

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:11.340
one file in theory it should be modified
 

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.100
one file in theory it should be modified
much faster but we're going to see that

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.110
much faster but we're going to see that
 

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.630
much faster but we're going to see that
because we are using legacy multi decks

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640
because we are using legacy multi decks
 

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.670
because we are using legacy multi decks
it's not going to be much faster in fact

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680
it's not going to be much faster in fact
 

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.470
it's not going to be much faster in fact
it might actually be more as exactly the

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480
it might actually be more as exactly the
 

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.520
it might actually be more as exactly the
same time 11.5 okay so we are 12 for the

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:22.530
same time 11.5 okay so we are 12 for the
 

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.590
same time 11.5 okay so we are 12 for the
full build 11.5 for the incremental

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:24.600
full build 11.5 for the incremental
 

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.450
full build 11.5 for the incremental
build I cannot say that we are doing a

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460
build I cannot say that we are doing a
 

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.910
build I cannot say that we are doing a
great job at the incremental building

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920
great job at the incremental building
 

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.690
great job at the incremental building
here so first what we should do is to

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700
here so first what we should do is to
 

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.720
here so first what we should do is to
try to switch to native multi decks

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:35.730
try to switch to native multi decks
 

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.460
try to switch to native multi decks
because with native multi dextra virtual

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:37.470
because with native multi dextra virtual
 

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.540
because with native multi dextra virtual
machine is capable of understanding

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:38.550
machine is capable of understanding
 

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.520
machine is capable of understanding
natively that tool application can be

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:40.530
natively that tool application can be
 

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.410
natively that tool application can be
packaged as several decks files and

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420
packaged as several decks files and
 

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.680
packaged as several decks files and
therefore he is a lot less work for the

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:45.690
therefore he is a lot less work for the
 

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.250
therefore he is a lot less work for the
build system to be able to handle this

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.260
build system to be able to handle this
 

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.480
build system to be able to handle this
so to do that we're going to add a

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:50.490
so to do that we're going to add a
 

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.130
so to do that we're going to add a
flavor and this one is going to be set a

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140
flavor and this one is going to be set a
 

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.460
flavor and this one is going to be set a
legacy one

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:56.470
legacy one
 

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.960
legacy one
and that's where we're going to continue

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:57.970
and that's where we're going to continue
 

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.960
and that's where we're going to continue
targeting 19 and then we have a new

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:00.970
targeting 19 and then we have a new
 

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.450
targeting 19 and then we have a new
flavor that we're going to be cooling

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:03.460
flavor that we're going to be cooling
 

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.630
flavor that we're going to be cooling
modern and this one will be targeting 21

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640
modern and this one will be targeting 21
 

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.150
modern and this one will be targeting 21
and a both now if I go to the build

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160
and a both now if I go to the build
 

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.940
and a both now if I go to the build
violence let's let's think first if I go

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:14.950
violence let's let's think first if I go
 

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.440
violence let's let's think first if I go
to the build variant I'm going to switch

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:16.450
to the build variant I'm going to switch
 

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.410
to the build variant I'm going to switch
my legacy debug to my mother and debug

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420
my legacy debug to my mother and debug
 

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.730
my legacy debug to my mother and debug
so now they're going to rebuild do not

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:23.740
so now they're going to rebuild do not
 

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.220
so now they're going to rebuild do not
ask me this again please when I'm going

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.230
ask me this again please when I'm going
 

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.380
ask me this again please when I'm going
to rebuild I'm gonna down rebuild with

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.390
to rebuild I'm gonna down rebuild with
 

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.260
to rebuild I'm gonna down rebuild with
the modern Dex file and that's not going

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:31.270
the modern Dex file and that's not going
 

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.589
the modern Dex file and that's not going
to make a huge change for the full build

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599
to make a huge change for the full build
 

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.599
to make a huge change for the full build
so let's let's wait until it's doing its

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:36.609
so let's let's wait until it's doing its
 

00:39:36.609 --> 00:39:39.359
so let's let's wait until it's doing its
job eleven point six we were at twelve

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:39.369
job eleven point six we were at twelve
 

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:42.510
job eleven point six we were at twelve
so it's not great but slightly better

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520
so it's not great but slightly better
 

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.730
so it's not great but slightly better
but where we're going to start saying a

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:44.740
but where we're going to start saying a
 

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.690
but where we're going to start saying a
big difference is when we switch when we

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:48.700
big difference is when we switch when we
 

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.819
big difference is when we switch when we
do the incremental build okay so when

00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:50.829
do the incremental build okay so when
 

00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:53.670
do the incremental build okay so when
when the incremental build we were also

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680
when the incremental build we were also
 

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.680
when the incremental build we were also
at eleven point five seconds now we add

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:55.690
at eleven point five seconds now we add
 

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.319
at eleven point five seconds now we add
six so we already divided by to do Build

00:39:58.319 --> 00:39:58.329
six so we already divided by to do Build
 

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:00.750
six so we already divided by to do Build
time that's good but I'm sure we can do

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760
time that's good but I'm sure we can do
 

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.059
time that's good but I'm sure we can do
better keep your claps for now first

00:40:06.059 --> 00:40:06.069
better keep your claps for now first
 

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:09.000
better keep your claps for now first
thing that you should always try to do

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.010
thing that you should always try to do
 

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.710
thing that you should always try to do
is to use the letters Gradle plugin

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720
is to use the letters Gradle plugin
 

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.400
is to use the letters Gradle plugin
because we always try to announce stuff

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:13.410
because we always try to announce stuff
 

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.230
because we always try to announce stuff
yes sometimes we break stuff but we try

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240
yes sometimes we break stuff but we try
 

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.829
yes sometimes we break stuff but we try
to fix it

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839
to fix it
 

00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:19.349
to fix it
but for most of the time we try to make

00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359
but for most of the time we try to make
 

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:21.329
but for most of the time we try to make
things better and using the latest

00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:21.339
things better and using the latest
 

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:24.290
things better and using the latest
version will allow you to use the latest

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300
version will allow you to use the latest
 

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.839
version will allow you to use the latest
enhancements so in this case I'm going

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:27.849
enhancements so in this case I'm going
 

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:31.290
enhancements so in this case I'm going
to switch to the latest version and I'm

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:31.300
to switch to the latest version and I'm
 

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.970
to switch to the latest version and I'm
going to continue building exactly the

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:32.980
going to continue building exactly the
 

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.720
going to continue building exactly the
same way but because I want to force a

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:36.730
same way but because I want to force a
 

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:45.430
same way but because I want to force a
complete rebuild let me clean it first

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440
 
 

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.579
 
and run a full built so here I'm getting

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:48.589
and run a full built so here I'm getting
 

00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:50.650
and run a full built so here I'm getting
another type of message and it's telling

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:50.660
another type of message and it's telling
 

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.170
another type of message and it's telling
me that starting with to the two we made

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:53.180
me that starting with to the two we made
 

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.900
me that starting with to the two we made
things better you can now run your decks

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:55.910
things better you can now run your decks
 

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.520
things better you can now run your decks
in process which is going to make things

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:57.530
in process which is going to make things
 

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.800
in process which is going to make things
faster but unfortunately in this

00:40:59.800 --> 00:40:59.810
faster but unfortunately in this
 

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.780
faster but unfortunately in this
particular instance you don't have

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:01.790
particular instance you don't have
 

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.329
particular instance you don't have
enough memory and therefore we revert to

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:04.339
enough memory and therefore we revert to
 

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:06.640
enough memory and therefore we revert to
the old out of process stuff so let's

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:06.650
the old out of process stuff so let's
 

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.650
the old out of process stuff so let's
add more memory to the Gradle daemon and

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:08.660
add more memory to the Gradle daemon and
 

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.599
add more memory to the Gradle daemon and
I cannot stress how important this can

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:10.609
I cannot stress how important this can
 

00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:13.240
I cannot stress how important this can
be when you will start using the Rado

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:13.250
be when you will start using the Rado
 

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.240
be when you will start using the Rado
2.2 you should really look into adding

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.250
2.2 you should really look into adding
 

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.329
2.2 you should really look into adding
more memory to the data Gmail so here

00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:19.339
more memory to the data Gmail so here
 

00:41:19.339 --> 00:41:21.490
more memory to the data Gmail so here
I'm adding for G and I'm going to do

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:21.500
I'm adding for G and I'm going to do
 

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.559
I'm adding for G and I'm going to do
exactly the same thing again I'm going

00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:23.569
exactly the same thing again I'm going
 

00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:26.020
exactly the same thing again I'm going
to clean the project so we get the new

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.030
to clean the project so we get the new
 

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:37.140
to clean the project so we get the new
baseline for the full build

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.150
 
 

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.299
 
so in this case the the message should

00:41:39.299 --> 00:41:39.309
so in this case the the message should
 

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:41.579
so in this case the the message should
be gone and it is gone so now we are now

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:41.589
be gone and it is gone so now we are now
 

00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:44.940
be gone and it is gone so now we are now
in process and we were about 12 seconds

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:44.950
in process and we were about 12 seconds
 

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.799
in process and we were about 12 seconds
earlier we are down to nine seconds for

00:41:46.799 --> 00:41:46.809
earlier we are down to nine seconds for
 

00:41:46.809 --> 00:41:49.620
earlier we are down to nine seconds for
the full build pretty ok let's continue

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.630
the full build pretty ok let's continue
 

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:53.789
the full build pretty ok let's continue
trying to see how much it would take to

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:53.799
trying to see how much it would take to
 

00:41:53.799 --> 00:41:57.930
trying to see how much it would take to
make an incremental change now alright

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:57.940
make an incremental change now alright
 

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.720
make an incremental change now alright
2.3 seconds but it is getting better but

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:00.730
2.3 seconds but it is getting better but
 

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.460
2.3 seconds but it is getting better but
we can do more now we can do more next

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:05.470
we can do more now we can do more next
 

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:06.049
we can do more now we can do more next
thing

00:42:06.049 --> 00:42:06.059
thing
 

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:08.700
thing
instant run has been disabled so far so

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:08.710
instant run has been disabled so far so
 

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.370
instant run has been disabled so far so
let's put it back on so when it's that

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:11.380
let's put it back on so when it's that
 

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.400
let's put it back on so when it's that
one is on we will try to redeliver the

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:14.410
one is on we will try to redeliver the
 

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:17.880
one is on we will try to redeliver the
smallest set of changes each time you do

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:17.890
smallest set of changes each time you do
 

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.009
smallest set of changes each time you do
a build so again let me clean it so

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:20.019
a build so again let me clean it so
 

00:42:20.019 --> 00:42:21.569
a build so again let me clean it so
you're sure to have a clean environment

00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:21.579
you're sure to have a clean environment
 

00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:23.579
you're sure to have a clean environment
to surface so the instant run will not

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:23.589
to surface so the instant run will not
 

00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:26.309
to surface so the instant run will not
only try to reload a classes in the

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319
only try to reload a classes in the
 

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:27.870
only try to reload a classes in the
virtual machine without even restarting

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880
virtual machine without even restarting
 

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.339
virtual machine without even restarting
the application but it will also

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:29.349
the application but it will also
 

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:32.460
the application but it will also
concentrate very much into delivering

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:32.470
concentrate very much into delivering
 

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.249
concentrate very much into delivering
the minimum set of changes required so

00:42:35.249 --> 00:42:35.259
the minimum set of changes required so
 

00:42:35.259 --> 00:42:38.249
the minimum set of changes required so
in this particular case excuse me

00:42:38.249 --> 00:42:38.259
in this particular case excuse me
 

00:42:38.259 --> 00:42:40.140
in this particular case excuse me
in this particular case when you change

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:40.150
in this particular case when you change
 

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.150
in this particular case when you change
a single Java file you will most likely

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160
a single Java file you will most likely
 

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.410
a single Java file you will most likely
only redeliver

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:43.420
only redeliver
 

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.019
only redeliver
the Dex file that corresponds to this

00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:46.029
the Dex file that corresponds to this
 

00:42:46.029 --> 00:42:48.210
the Dex file that corresponds to this
single Java file so that was the full

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:48.220
single Java file so that was the full
 

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.259
single Java file so that was the full
build now let's change again this and

00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:52.269
build now let's change again this and
 

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:55.519
build now let's change again this and
let's measure how much we are down to

00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:55.529
let's measure how much we are down to
 

00:42:55.529 --> 00:42:57.630
let's measure how much we are down to
0.6 now we are talking

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640
0.6 now we are talking
 

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:05.380
0.6 now we are talking
I'm pretty sure

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.390
 
 

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:10.870
 
even better I can go to 0.4 okay so as

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880
even better I can go to 0.4 okay so as
 

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.449
even better I can go to 0.4 okay so as
you can see we start at 12 seconds we

00:43:13.449 --> 00:43:13.459
you can see we start at 12 seconds we
 

00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:16.180
you can see we start at 12 seconds we
are now at 0.4 we related very little

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:16.190
are now at 0.4 we related very little
 

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.269
are now at 0.4 we related very little
changes very little work will be divided

00:43:19.269 --> 00:43:19.279
changes very little work will be divided
 

00:43:19.279 --> 00:43:23.529
changes very little work will be divided
by more than 20 times the build time but

00:43:23.529 --> 00:43:23.539
by more than 20 times the build time but
 

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:24.819
by more than 20 times the build time but
let's do some other changes for instance

00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:24.829
let's do some other changes for instance
 

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:30.459
let's do some other changes for instance
let's take the good source files here

00:43:30.459 --> 00:43:30.469
let's take the good source files here
 

00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:34.479
let's take the good source files here
and let's look into the main file this

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:34.489
and let's look into the main file this
 

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:40.299
and let's look into the main file this
is really small here actually I don't

00:43:40.299 --> 00:43:40.309
is really small here actually I don't
 

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:42.130
is really small here actually I don't
have to do this I can go to the app so

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:42.140
have to do this I can go to the app so
 

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.359
have to do this I can go to the app so
as you can see here I've got a version

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:43.369
