00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.401
Now that we know that finding a midpoint is as simple as averaging x coordinates

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:08.325
and y coordinates, let's go back to this quadrilateral we, we are looking at

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:12.776
earlier. Can you find the midpoint of each side? Don't forget to write these as

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.279
points, so with coordinates
