00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well thank you.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.810
So, we're gonna bring out
our next cartoonist now.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.950 position:56%
As she designed the festival poster,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.510
so if you've seen her drawings
big all around, you know, it.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.260
[ Applause ]

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.520 position:56%
She grew up in Brooklyn and ended up
at the Rhode Island School of Design

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.960
and she landed at The
New Yorker in the 70s

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
when she said they're just
weren't that many women cartoonists

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.210
and she enters this field
and now, all this time later,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.510
she has been described
as the rock star

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.740
of The New Yorker among
the cartoonists.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.060
She, on top of all her other books,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.060
she came out several
years ago the Memoir

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.010 position:56%
About Eldercare, a brilliant memoir.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.310
It's called Yes.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.470
It's called, Can't We Talk
About Something More Pleasant?

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.340
It won the Kirkus prize

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.860
at the National Book
Critics Award Recognition

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.140
and it won the Heinz
award, which I think came

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.690
with maybe quarter million
dollars or something like that?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.990
So that will sustain a
cartoonist a little while longer.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.160
She also recently won the Reuben
award we have with us in Roz

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.030
and Anne, two of the last
three Reuben award winners

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.990
so we're blessed with that and
that's the [inaudible] Society.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.260
If not, so, I can't
recommend more highly,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.940
Can't We Talk About
Something More Pleasant?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.420
if you haven't read it and I just
posted last week a piece that's

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.120
on the post site, it's a
love letter about New York.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.420
It comes out in October.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.910
I can't recommend highly enough
another memoir Going into Town.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.710
Please welcome Roz Chast.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.130
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.030
Yeah, I just I want to step back

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.680
and say I think it was a Small
Press Expo some years back,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.540
you took me aside and you
said I have a story in me.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.840
My parents have died and
I have something to say.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.140
I didn't know what to expect
and you come out with this book

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.950 position:56%
and it just blew me away and we were
talking about writing from reality,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.640
but what was it like for you to
plumb into reality so deeply?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.760
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I think I felt that
I really wanted to tell this story

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.390
for a lot of different reasons.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:46.250
One was that my parents really
were very unique and I felt

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.380
like that whole, my
parents were born in 1912.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.690
They were a lot older than most
of my friend's parents and I felt

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.470
like there were a lot of things
about that whole generation

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.120 position:56%
that was just fading away, but also,
as I said to my editor, you know,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.350
this really should be, maybe should
be shelled in the travel section,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.320
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: because I
felt like this was a country

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.950
that I was visiting that
I didn't even know existed

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.340
and never mind never having
been there, but, you know,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.600
as I said in the book, I thought,
you know, from what I had read

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.030
and all the books I've read
and from movies I'd seen,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.530
that people got really old and
then maybe like they were sick

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.480
for like three weeks
they take to their bed,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.780
you know, that's what happens.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.030
They take to their bed, and then
and then there's a death rattle.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.560
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: And then they
die, you know, And I didn't know

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.230
that it could be that dying was
this incredibly long protract,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.290
excuse me I just got
extremely distracted.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.250
Somebody is holding
up a sign that says,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.940
"say goodbye to Mike and Anne,"

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: So, bye Mike and Anne.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No,
they're up here, not no, just,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.860
&gt;&gt; Anne: Can we leave?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, we're
gonna have one more question.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.460
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Sorry.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.760
I just, alright, alright.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: They're
giving away all my stage tricks.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.600
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Oh, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.650
[laughing]

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, you know,-

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.080
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Have a good trip.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.380
[laughing]

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Speaking of dying
with a death rattle, protracted,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.820
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Sorry.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.320
Sorry. I got so serious.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.620
[laughing]

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, I did have
one thing, before we say goodbye

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.630
to Mike and Anne, [laughing]

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.930
&gt;&gt; Mike: What if we don't go?

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.230
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I miss them.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.530
I miss them already.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I know, I feel
like they were just with us.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.360
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I know, I know.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There are
doors that are supposed to open.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.570
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I know, I know.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, what I did
want to get to, you talk to me

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.560
and we talked about in the 70s,
you went to a New Yorker party

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.500
and it was men who were,
they were even your style,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.380
your style they were somehow
that your style and it was tied

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.580
up with being female and all this
and they were, who is this young,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.020
you know, you were about 24 who
is this young woman interloper?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.720
And I've talked to Dan
about how there's still

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.570
so few women political cartoonists
out there and so unfairly

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.860
or not you kind of have
to be symbols for it.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.380
For kind of standing
for women in your field.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.310
Is it gotten old yet?

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.610
Do you feel empowered yet?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.410
Can you talk about that?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.190
&gt;&gt; Anne: Well, I mean, I know
that I don't want to speak

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.810
for all my female editorial
cartooning colleagues,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.240
but we think of ourselves
as editorial cartoonists.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.840
&gt;&gt; Anne: I mean sure,
we do women's issues

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.250
and I think we bring obviously
a very good, you know,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.460
perspective about it but, you know,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.070
I we're editorial cartoonist
that's what we do.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and
there's no, unlike what Roz talked

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.350 position:56%
about in the 70s or 60s, sort of you
don't fit male peers you haven't run

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.650
across male peers in
your industry who have,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.950
&gt;&gt; Anne: Dismissed?

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Dismissed.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.550
&gt;&gt; Anne: Oh sure.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.740
[laugh] Yeah but, you
know, the more you're in it

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.260
and the longer you're there you
get more respect and you can,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.170
you know, slap them around a bit.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There you go.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.650
Have you been slapped around?

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.260
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No, no I just kind
of like get a sad look on my face.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.030
Prefer what my mother used to
call the psychological, you know,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.440
give him the silent treatment.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.070
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No, I think
that for me it was really,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.390
mostly the older people and, you
know when people have asked me

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.070
about being a female
cartoonist at the New Yorker,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.490
especially when I was younger,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.560
I always say that is
one of so many problems,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.730
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: you know, I was,
it was being, I mean it was 23

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.850
when I started as being like
20 years younger than a lot

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.660
of these-than the youngest
of those people.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.120
Being female, my work
looked totally different,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.710
it was a different sensibility,
so it was just one star

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.460
in the constellation of
like we don't like you.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.760
[laughs]

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah,
Well now you're the Rockstar

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.030
of that constellation.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.330
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: [Groans]

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Well it's true.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.930
Well, you may not have noticed,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.230
but it's time to say
goodbye to Mike and Anne.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.530
[laughs]

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.830
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Goodbye.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Thank you, guys.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.360
[ Applause and laughs ]

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.660
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Oh, these
Mike and Anne?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.690
I thought it was maybe like
somebody else in the audience.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.990
Bye.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.290
&gt;&gt; Mike: [Inaudible]
Can I just tell you one

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.060
of my favorite cartoons I've
ever seen in my life was yours

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.530
and it was a woman reading a
newspaper and it was the obits.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.850
And it was a person's name and
then it says, "older than you,"

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.620
and it said, "younger than you,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.630
about your age, a lot
older than you."

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.510
Because I don't know that's
the way I read the obits.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:49.070
[ Laugh and applause ]

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So, I think

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.740
that the death rattle is
going to come up a lot.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.890
But I want to make sure to get
to your images but, you know,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.370
one thing that we talked about was,
you know, you are growing up here,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.670
and it was Flatbush, right?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.970
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: The
cleverest part of Brooklyn.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.570
Represented.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.710
And so, you grew up with your
parents, you have relatives around,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.580
you're in a tiny bedroom and you,
I think I asked you if you hated it

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.640
and hate with such a mild term
for how you felt about growing up.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.150
Could you talk about that?

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.330
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well
Doctor, [laughs] yeah,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:33.490
I remember that overhead
lights it was, [laughs].

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.110
Yeah, it was just a
different era, you know.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.870
I guess. So yeah.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.880
[laughs] We're clearly
going to switch topics here.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Ok,
[laughs] well let's start with,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.150
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Ah, yes.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Can
they get that one up?

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.290
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I don't
think it's up yet.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: No, it's
not on there but well,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.410
this is when moms dance
and yes so there we go.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
[laughs]. So how much
like real life?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.290
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: This cartoon was
actually inspired by my daughter

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:21.980
when she was around sixteen, and
if you've ever been a teenager

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.710
or had teenage children, you know,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.840
that there's almost nothing
more disgusting in the sight

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.590
of a teenager's eyes and the adult
human body, [laughs] and which,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.250
I don't totally disagree with,
but, if you really want to gill

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.930
that Lily, just do a little dance.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.950
[Laughs] And so, my daughter
was in the living room

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.330
and she was doing her homework
and she had some hip-hop music on

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.420
and I just wanted to see if
she was paying attention.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.390
So, I did this little
dance and she looked up

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.780
and she said mom stop,
you're hurting me.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.650
And I asked her if I
could use it as a cartoon.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.040
And she said okay.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Did
she ask for a cut?

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.150
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No, she
was very kind about it.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Okay,
so, urban trail mix.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.290
[Laughter]

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.840
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: And
so, you have talked

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.130
about how many phobias you have
and how much fear, an entire book

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.040
on an A to Z on your phobias.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.460
Is it just a bottomless
well of phobia material?

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.570
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah, a lot of
things are just very troubling.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.030
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: You know, so yeah.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So, pigeon little.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.530
You know.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:51.330
[ Laughter ]

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: You've
talked about,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.320
you do a lot of when
you go outside something

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.080
about Manhattan inspires you.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.510
Can you talk about that?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:06.180
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I really love
Manhattan a lot it's, you know,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.050
which is why I wrote this
book that's going to come

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.340
out on October 4th
called, Going into Town,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.500
which is what my parents used
to call going into Manhattan

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.340
from Brooklyn, you know,
we would go into town.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.890
And of course, when I was a kid
we called it going into the city

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.210
because Brooklyn wasn't
really the city.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.810
Manhattan was what you meant.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.690
Like when you said you
were going into the city.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.360
I don't know exactly why I loved
it so much from the very beginning.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.980
I think I was just very
distracted from my own, you know,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.790
interior, you know, troubles.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.430
I was trying to explain it to
a friend and sometimes even now

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.470
when I get off, you know, I live
outside of New York an hour outside

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.480
of New York and when I
get off the train and step

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.100
into the street I feel like
just a little anonymous cell

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.160
in a bloodstream and the stream
is moving and I'm just kind

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.590
of in this bloodstream and I
really like that feeling a lot.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.130
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I've never, you
know, fully analyzed why, you know,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.340
why it doesn't cause
me more anxiety,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.780
why I find it sort of calming.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah,
someone should analyze that.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.100
What we talked about, you said
like you're an anxious person.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.810
You went to Connecticut,
you went to the suburbs and,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: That makes me anxious.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: That
makes you anxious?

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.710
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Oh god yeah.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: But
you get into the thrum

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.600
of Manhattan and it allows you.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.900
It frees you.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.200
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.150
But I think also because
the things in Manhattan

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.120
that are anxiety provoking
are things that I know.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.720
Where is in Connecticut, well
there's things like suddenly,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.390
you're in the house and
you hear this weird sound

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.800
and it's coming from the basement.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.400
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: And when you're
in an apartment when you're

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.920
in an apartment house
you don't have to think

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.220
about what's in the basement.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.350
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: You know, I know
that there's a boiler down there

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.660
but I can like blank
it out of my head.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.110
But when I hear sounds coming from
the basement, in the in a house,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.280
I think it's right under my feet,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.540
so like the house could
sort of, you know, blow up.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.230
[Laughs] I don't know
just terrible smells.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.270
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: A branch could fall
on the house and break the roof.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.870
[laughs]

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.170
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: You know, I
have a car I mean you're

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.090
like the house there's
almost no protection.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.010
Somebody could be driving
down the street,

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.970
lose control of the car,
and then BAM the car.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.270
You're like what?

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.570
You're in the living room.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.640
I mean it could really happen.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Wow, so how do
you focus enough to do a cartoon

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.930
when you're thinking
about all the things

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.400
that might befall you while
you're doing the cartoon.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.370
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well, there's
there are medications for that.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.790
There's also caffeine.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:53.640
And sometimes there are times
when I've had a terrible fear

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.480
and then afterwards it
seems really funny to me.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.500
Like one time I was in the
bathtub and I started thinking

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.260
about the oldness of our
house and that the bathtub was

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.220
on the second floor and that
water was really heavy, [laughs]

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.170
and I just started thinking like
do bathtubs ever just kind of,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.700
you know, fall through the floor?

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Wow.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: And then later
it seemed kind of funny to me.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.460
Has that ever have do you known
anyone that that has happened to?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.210
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No, I don't.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.930
I don't know anyone that's happened
to but , you know, things happen.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.800
Somebody, actually this was in
Brooklyn, they were walking,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:40.820
[laughs] this is so terrible.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.200
[Laughter] and a sinkhole
opened up like just,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.000
[laughing] it was for one leg.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.090
Like one leg just fell
into the sinkhole.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Oh my god.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.290
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: It just like I saw
it just like kind of gave way.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:00.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Ya, but
nothing, no other legs.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.870
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: That
was the only leg?

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.470
[laughing]

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Obviously, [inaudible]
he had [laughs] I'm sorry.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.180
He had, this has been a long day.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.030
he had two regular legs [Laughter].

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:22.720
But one of them fell
into the sinkhole.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.680
Oh dear.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: We're never
getting through this one.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.450
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: We're never.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.750
But yeah, I shouldn't be laughing.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: No,
[laughs] that's, I love it.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.780
I love to see it.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.390
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah,
you should Google it.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So, the
last Thanksgiving from,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.150
again from reality,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.990
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah, yes, yes yes.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.990
This is just when you cannot
stand it anymore, you know,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.450
everybody with their , you know,
their things and their needs

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:55.540
and requirements and allergies and
aversions and they're on a special

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.130
on a cleanse and, you
know, they have, you know,

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.580
their special needs it's and
everybody has a different one.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah, is every one

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.820
of us neurotic basically
on some level?

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.120
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I think so.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah, we are all,
some of us own it, some of us don't.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.320
Around family and turkey
and tryptophan it can fully,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.620
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Oh yeah.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So, the
holy trinity, [laughs]

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.190
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: You do some
of the best food humor around.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.580
Just flat out.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.880
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well food is funny.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Food is funny.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.480
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I mean,
the whole thing is kind

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.780
of funny in a certain way.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: From
the sounds and names

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.120
to how just we interact with it.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.420
How food means to us.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.720
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.020
Oh absolutely.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.320
I mean the whole thing
sort of hilarious.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.620
And similarly, in the
acquiring of- [laughs].

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.250
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah, well
there's times where when I'm

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.170
in certain moods, and I'm
doing errands in where I live

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.200
and I realize that
I'm not in the mode

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.470
where I should be talking
to other people.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.930
And, you know, maybe I've been in
my studio for like hours and hours

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:10.740
and hours and then if I don't go
to one of these lines, you know,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.310
some little bee in my
bonnet will say like, "Roz,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.210
talk to other people," and,
you know, make conversation

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.440
and then suddenly, you know,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.170
I'm saying something really
awkward and it's just terrible.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Wow.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.810
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: So yeah.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: When
cartoonists talk.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.420
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah
that's risking things.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.050
Oh, this cartoon came from was
inspired, this is the gifts

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:40.010
from the house of low goals
and this was actually inspired

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.360
by a real ad that I saw.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.170
I was on the train,
the commuter train

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.180
and I saw this ad that
was for Carvel.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.930
And it was, you know,
those funny little cakes

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.290
and there was there was a
little girl she was 7 years old

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.940
with these cute little cat's
eyeglasses and like a party hat on

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.280
and she's surrounded by her family
and her grandparents and friends,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.060 position:56%
and on the cake, is written
congratulations on your new glasses.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.300
[laughs] And I thought,
you know, we really,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.910
you know, this bar is pretty low.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.210
[laughs] So, you know.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: I love it.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.420
So, the fountain of puberty.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.230
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.340
Well. There's a lot of Fountain
of Youth gangs, you know,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.090 position:56%
it's a genre in itself but if you've
ever sat outside of a middle school

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.870
and watched kids come out.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.430
You know.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: There's a lot, ok.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.340
And you do, [laughter].

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.210
You do, again your relationship
humor, no one does it better and,

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.110
you know, I mean, and part of what
I wanted to get to you, [laughter].

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:01.640 position:56%
You talked about in Going into Town,

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:10.330
you talk about your
fascination with the visuals.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.630
This sign.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:18.700 position:56%
Signage to you is this deeply
engaging hieroglyphics and genealogy

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.840
and everything and
you talk about sign.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.140
What do signs mean to you?

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.710
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well,
I love New York how,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:31.450
I say this in the book the
visual density of information.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.500
Everywhere you look, I mean I
suppose that if I knew the names

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.420
of different trees aside from
like I think this is a maple

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.780
and this may be an elm,
but I'm not sure, you know,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.040
then walking in nature might
be very interesting to me.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.650
But, when I'm in New York I love,
you know, the first level of stores

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.090
and then there's like a second
level and then there's the third

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.680
and you see oh my god juggling
equipment and it's still there,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.990
you know, like special, you know,
weird underwear or something.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.760
I mean, it's just like millions,
there's millions and millions

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.200
and millions of stores
it's like that old SNL skit

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.050
with the scotch tape store.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.610
Except it's for real.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.690
There'll be like a story that's
just like scotch tape or ribbons

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.860
or whatever and I just love that.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Do you
put actual real signage ever

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.480
that you've seen very
specific into your cartoons?

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.830
Or is it always with a twist?

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.760
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: It's, you know,
my version of it I guess.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So,
the End of Innocence.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: This is an older
cartoon and it was actually inspired

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:49.770
by life and I remember
I was in high school

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.280
and I really had a lot
of problems with math.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:59.210
Especially as it got more towards
like the calculus end of it.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.150
And it was like they were talking

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.970
in language I had no idea
what they were talking about.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.160
And I was getting so
wound up about it

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.980
and I remember I was
taking this math test

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.110
and it was this really
very clear moment

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.680 position:56%
where I thought this doesn't matter.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.170
You know? It just doesn't matter
if I pass this test or not.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.070
It wasn't like I was gonna go to a
special, it wasn't like I had any,

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.610
you know, desire to go to
MIT or something like that.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.940 position:56%
I mean it just didn't matter and
that had never occurred to me before

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.630 position:56%
because possibly, because my parents
were educators and I was brought

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:45.530
up that, you know, if you got below
90 there was something wrong it was

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:51.560
a cry for help , you
know, it was um, you know,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.600
it had never occurred
to me until that moment.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah, that's
it that just didn't matter.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.730
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah, that
it just didn't matter.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: They
put up the next one.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.400
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Okay, [laughter]

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: And
while we're doing this

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.530
and while we're doing this,
we'll have time in a minute

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.460
for two questions if anyone
wants to come to the microphone.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.760
Again signage.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.750
You, I'm sorry, you're a
genius and how signs work ,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.290
how we interact with them.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.590
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well, I
think that's one thing

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.340
about cartoons that, [laughter] oh.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.530
This this cartoon, I have
a lot of fond memories

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.760
of because it was a very
early cartoon that I sold

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.100
to The New Yorker and the way
it works at the New Yorker is

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.410
that we all submit what we call the
batch and there's about 40 of us,

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.050
you know, on staff and we
submit groups of cartoons.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.940
We don't just submit like one
cartoon we submit whatever,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.240
you know, 6, 10, 8,
cartoons every week, sketches

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.050
and those are called roughs.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.850
And then if you sell one of the
roughs then you take it home

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.120
and you do a finish, and
you do the finished version.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.040
So, this was Lee Lorenz who
is the art the cartoon editor

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.330 position:56%
at the time, aren't editor actually.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.110
He pulled out the sketch
I had done of this cartoon

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:17.150 position:56%
and he said we're going to buy this
one, but the little flag on the side

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.950
of the mailbox, I had it sticking
out like perpendicularly to the box

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.750 position:56%
and attached to the door of the box.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.100
And he said what is that?

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.820
And I said well that's the handle.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.740
That's the handle when
you open up the box

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.850 position:56%
and he looked at me like I was nuts.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.390
And then I think he realized
that I had never had one

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.800
of those kinds of mailboxes.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.880
[laughs] And this was of course
in the days before Google,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.180
so I just sort of made
up what I thought it was.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.150
Which was the handle with
which you opened the door

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.690
or whatever the mailbox
to open it up.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: You hadn't
lived in the suburbs yet.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.890
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: No, I have
never lived in the suburbs.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.530 position:56%
I always lived in an apartment house
where there were about, you know,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.910
mailboxes and you had your little
key and you, you know, did that.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Mailboxes
and boilers and safe bathtubs.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.350
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes, yeah exactly.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Can we
take a question right here?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:23.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Yes, I just like
maybe one comment and a question.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.150 position:56%
I read the daily comics and the
Sunday colored comics and I must say

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.950
that New Yorker has such a,

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.360
which are funny sometimes an
interesting and political comments.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.010
But the New Yorker seems they have
so many weird, creative, ideas.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.420
I mean, you must work with
a lot of interesting people.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.180
I mean, I'm not being weird
being bad but, you know,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.610
just more like out of somewhere.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.160 position:56%
And secondly, what is the difference
to you between a single impact comic

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.790
and then the ones in the newspaper,
you know, the newspapers comics

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.430
where they're sequential there's
a sequential story as opposed

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.890
to the single impact image?

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So,
you're being asked

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.000
to defend the entire eclectic
system of the New Yorker.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.590
No, I'm teasing.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.710
But there is, you know,
there's that range.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.010
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.340
I think it's a different sort
of, well it's most people I know

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.180
at the New Yorker who
are cartoonists they,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.980
it's just, you know, it's personal.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.540
It's like your style and
I think that's one thing

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.710
that the New Yorker
is sort of known for.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.160
And in fact, I don't think
that most of the cartoons

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.500 position:56%
in The New Yorker are not
terribly, when I think of those kind

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.250
of cartoons, I think of them
as kind of very cartoony.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.160
With like googly eyes and like a
big nose and they kind of, to me,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.870
a lot of them look sort of similar.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.360
I'm probably really
wrong about that.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.190
I'm gonna get a lot of hate
mail but one different,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.080
one other big difference
is that with people

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.800
who do the sequential thing they
often have characters that repeat,

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.590
you know, and I think that my
cartoons have a sort of world

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.030
that they come from but
it's not like, you know,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.980
the McGillicuddy's or,
you know, Anne and Mike.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.280
[Laugh]

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: I
knew they'd come back.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:25.740
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah yeah,
they're always leaving.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.990
[Laughter] It's hilarious.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.290
[Laughter].

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.590
Yeah.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.890
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Thank you.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.190
That's interesting.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: And by the way,

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.890
was this your first
cover, speaking of food.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.190
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.490
That was the very first cover.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:42.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: The
history of ice cream.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.130
The family history of
the roots of ice cream.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.390
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes, I'm so, it's
an evolutionary chart of ice cream

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:54.210
but my father's interpretation
of it was

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.900
that it was a doctor telling
you foods you shouldn't eat

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.200
because they were bad for you.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.920
[laughter] I know.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: You don't try
and explain to your parents.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.390
And you do crochet, right?

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.730
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Well, it's
really, it's embroidery.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: So, this was
literally an embroidered cover?

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.660
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Literally
an embroidered cover.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.260
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: And
this was very recent.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.730
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah it was for
a tech issue and Mother's Day.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.030
[laughs]

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: What better way?

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.580
Who else could have
combined those things.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.680
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yes,
and it's a motherboard

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.080
so yeah, it's embroidered.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.380
It was nuts.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.720
I got sort of obsessed
and a lot of fun for me.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah and you
make these brilliant eggs too?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.160
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah pysanky eggs.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yes.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.760
You do a lot.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.370
And speaking of [inaudible
over laughers]

00:27:54.410 --> 00:28:01.600
so what we're gonna do quickly,
I knew it would come back

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.440
to death rattles in
one way or another.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.960
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: Yeah it always does.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: It always.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.920
So, we'll take one quick question

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.840
and then we'll bring
out our next cartoonist.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.140
So please.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.830
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Hi there,
at the risk of being greedy.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.120
Two quick questions, the first
is if you could talk a little bit

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.910
about process, if you work
every day, if you take days off,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.590
how often, for how many hours?

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:28.310
And number two, what illustrators
did you like as a kid specifically?

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:34.620
&gt;&gt; Roz Chast: I work on, the
first question about schedule,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.870 position:56%
The New Yorker is a weekly magazine,
so I sort of work to deadlines

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.160
and I always have other
projects going on.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.070
So, I don't make myself like say,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:52.090
and I'm going to work six
hours every day or eight hours.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:57.010
There are days that, you know, I
mean, there's not so much division

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.810
between when I'm working
and when I'm not working

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:04.050
because I'm always writing down
ideas, studio time, you know,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.500
everything sort of counts.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.730
I'll be working for hours like, you
know, doing the embroidery thing

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.730
or working on the pysanky eggs or
hooking a rug, so, it's just I feel

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.740
like with the kind of stuff
that I do the work life

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:26.030
and the not work life really
flow into each other a lot.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.670
And the other question
was, oh when I was a kid.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.340
I loved Charles Adams and
he was the first cartoonist

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.360
that I fell big-time in love with

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.340
and I also loved Mad
Magazine, Don Martin.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.050
I just thought he was
incredibly hilarious

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.540
and Sam Gross and Gay and Wilson.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.990
I read, you know, National Lampoon
all those people, Rick Geary

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.200
and of course the underground
cartoonists.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.500
Love them too.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.800
I mean I just I love the form.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.100
I just really love the form.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Canva: Yeah well said.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.260

presentation of the Library

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:11.820
