00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.000
Los Angeles operates the largest jail
system in the United States and in fact

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.660
some research shows that Los Angeles
operates the largest jail system in the world.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.420
There's just tons of neighborhoods
where they're spending more than a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
million dollars a year locking people up.
We generated a set of maps showing who

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
was being incarcerated in Los Angeles
and on what charges.  It can do so much

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
harm as it has done in my family.
You've taken resources out of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.830
communities and put it into locking
people up. There's a strong community

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.850
intuition that a large number of people
are being arrested on drug possession

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.559
charges and DUIs. There's a mental issue
that's going on... addiction. We didn't know

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.609
that for sure so the only way was to
conduct a research project and that's

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.980
what we did with Million Dollar Hoods

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.220
So in LA we don't have a vertical city
we have ten million people living in a

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.500
giant strip mall because of that we
don't we can't really talk about million

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.970
dollar blocks.  How do we think of
ourselves living in communities here in

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.750
Los Angeles and we tend to think about
about neighborhoods about hoods.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.120
So we have the race, arrest date, arrest locations that we're going to geocode

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200
So all of this is data that, according to law, law enforcement

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.520
agencies must provide. About a year and a
half ago I began requesting this data

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.630
from the Los Angeles Police Department
and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.340
and I really had to fight and struggle
with them to get access to the data.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.600
As you look through it states and the city are not aligned. You can't just geocode it as is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.580
We'd have to literally one-by-one move... They're shifted.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.920
How long do you estimate it would take to clean that all up. I want to say less than a month but...

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.080
It's unfortunate because the data we got is so dirty unless we want to pay thousands and thousands of

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.240
dollars to geoode all these addresses
then we're stuck with what we have.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.580
Once we are able to successfully geocode these addresses it allows us to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.420
do a now spatial representation of those home addresses.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.360
And see the discrepancies between cost and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.250
incarceration and neighborhoods right. I
think it's the most important data we

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.540
have yeah with the cost and the charges
because it's the two together that show

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.100
you how much we're spending on incarcerating
people for addiction related and mental

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.850
health related issues. The types of
charges that people are being picked up

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.810
for tend to be those that if you are
impoverished or precariously housed

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.510
underemployed that you're more
vulnerable for arrest because you are

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.770
engaging in these kinds of activities
in public rather than doing it inside of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.660
your home. People gonna do what they do. 
The way the police police our community is different.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.360
This is Jody Lane and Avenue
O. What happened to me on the night that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.640
I was pulled over
I stopped immediately... came up to my car

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.630
banged on my window extremely hard. He
started to arrest me immediately and he

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.050
kneed me and he ran in towards me and
pepper sprayed me I took a DUI test on

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.739
the field I passed it. I was found not
guilty I honestly think that I would

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.220
have got shot and killed that night if I
was intoxicated.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.320
OK so for those of you who do have it...

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.100
We're trying to not just bring this data like as a mapping
platform to other people

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.300
but really to educate the population that's being
affected by it. What we did is we began

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.900
holding a series of what we call rebel
mapping workshops where we're teaching

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.180
skills to youth.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.319
Many of the young men in my family have

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.790
been impacted by incarceration. They
separated and fell into different types

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.280
of things like addiction. It led into a
lot of other issues where you know we

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.030
didn't know how to help. It's really a
kind of a source of pride for us in the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.820
sandbox crew to not just be you know
armchair researchers.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.340
So what Million Dollar Hoods teaches us is
that millions of dollars are being spent

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.440
every year on incarceration in just a
few neighborhoods and what it helps us

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.060
to do is to begin to imagine new ways
that we can spend that money.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.290
Jobs and youth centers and healthy
environments and healthy healthy

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.970
communities that's part of a public
safety strategy. You know name it, we

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.419
don't have it here why is it? Why is it?
Historically it has always been racially

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.360
marginalized communities and
impoverished communities that have

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.380
experienced a disproportionate share of
policing here what these Million Dollar

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.810
Hoods maps show is that little has
changed in Los Angeles we are still

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.160
disproportionately targeting communities
of color and working-class communities

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.860
with our policing and incarceration
resources.
