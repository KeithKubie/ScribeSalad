[MUSIC PLAYING]

[APPLAUSE]

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.560
SUNDAR PICHAI: Welcome.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.880
Welcome to Google I/O.
And welcome to Show Line.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.550
It feels really nice
and different up here.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.410
We've been doing it for
many, many years in Moscone.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.760
And in fact, we've been
doing I/O for 10 years.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.010
But I feel we are at a
pivotal moment in terms

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.010
of where we are
going as a company

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.050
and felt appropriate
to change the venue.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.040
Doing it here also allows us
to include a lot more of you.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.481
There are over 7,000 of you
joining in person today.

00:15:21.481 --> 00:15:25.810
[CHEERING]

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.620
And later today,
after the keynote,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.580
you'll be joined by several
Googlers-- product managers,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.210
engineers, and designers.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.850
So hopefully, you'll engage
in many, many conversations

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.500
over the three days.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.160
As always, I/O is being live
streamed around the world.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.490
This year, we have the
largest ever audience.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.010
We are live streaming this
to 530 extended events

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.900
in over 100 countries
around the world,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:55.080
including Dublin, which is
a major techhub in Europe,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.160
Istanbul, which is our oldest
Google Developer Group,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.280
and even to Colombo, Sri Lanka,
which is the largest attendance

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.573
outside of the US
with 2,000 people.

00:16:06.573 --> 00:16:08.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.520
Our largest developer
audience on the live stream

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.610
is from China today with
over 1 million people

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.820
tuning in live from China.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.820
So welcome to those
users as well.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.670
[CHEERING]

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.440
We live in very,
very exciting times.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.520
Computing has had an
amazing evolution.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.480
Stepping back, Larry and
Sergey founded Google

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.900
17 years ago with the
goal of helping users

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.540
find the information they need.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.470
At the time, there were only
300 million people online,

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.770
most of them around big physical
computers on slow internet

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.080
connections.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.790
Fast forward to today, thanks
to the rate at which processors

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.660
and sensors have evolved, it
is truly the moment of mobile.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.890
There are over 3 billion
people connected.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.700
And they are using
the internet in ways

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.700
we have never seen before.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.860
They live on their phones.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.720
They use it to communicate,
learn new things,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.650
gain knowledge,
entertain themselves.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.310
They tap an icon,
expect a car to show up.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.069
They talk to their
phones and even

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.550
expect music to
play in the living

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.730
room or, sometimes, groceries
to show up at the front door.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.210
So we are pushing
ourselves really hard,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.310
so that Google is
evolving and staying

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.130
a step ahead of our users.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.920
All the queries
you see behind me

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.810
are live queries
coming in from mobile.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.080
In fact, today, over
50% of our queries

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.880
come from mobile phones.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.150
And the queries in color you
see behind me are voice queries.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:50.230
In the US, on our mobile app
and Android, 1 in 5 queries,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.510
20% of our queries,
are voice queries.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.420
And that share is growing.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.830
Given how differently
users are engaging with us,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.930
we want to push
ourselves and deliver

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.990
them information,
rich information,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.370
in the context of mobile.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.420
This is why, if you come
to Google today and search

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.730
for Beyonce, you don't
just get 10 blue links,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.970
you get a rich information
card with music,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.940
you can listen to her
songs, find information

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.360
about upcoming show events,
and book it right there.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.810
You can come and
ask us different

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.580
queries-- presidential
elections or Champions League,

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.370
and we again give you
rich in-depth information.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.010
And we do this across thousands
and thousands of categories

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.530
globally at scale.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.022
You can come to Google
looking for news as well.

00:18:42.022 --> 00:18:43.980
For example, if you're
interested in Hyperloop,

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.380
an exciting
technology, we give you

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.690
information with AMP right
there in search results.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.590
And they load instantly, and
you can scroll through them.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.070
Amazing to see how people
engage differently with Google.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.680
It's not just enough
to give them links.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.210
We really need to help them get
things done in the real world.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.330
This is why we are
evolving search

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.020
to be much more assistive.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.240
We've been laying the foundation
for this for many, many years

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.860
through investments in deep
areas of computer science.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.040
We built the Knowledge Graph.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.430
We, today, have an understanding
of 1 billion entities-- people,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.920
places, and things-- and the
relationships between them

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.080
and the real world.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.070
We have dramatically
improved the quality

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.160
of our voice recognition.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.340
We recently started training our
datasets with noisy backgrounds

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.210
deliberately, so that we can
hear people more accurately.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.650
The quality is improved
recently by 25%.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.190
Image recognition
and computer vision,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.300
we can do things which we never
thought we could do before.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.470
If you're in Google Photos
today and you search for hugs,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.170
we actually pull
all the pictures

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.084
of people hugging in
your personal collection.

00:20:03.084 --> 00:20:06.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.460
We have recently
extended this to videos.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.930
So you can say, show
me my dog videos,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.700
and we actually go
through your videos

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.470
and pull out your
favorite videos.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.990
Translation, 10
years ago, we could

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.110
translate, machine-translate
in two languages.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.130
Today, we do that for
over 100 languages.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.420
And every single day, we
translate over 140 billion

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.860
words for our users.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.920
We even do real time
visual translation.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.680
If you're a Chinese user and
you run into a menu in English,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.900
all you need to do is
to hold up your phone,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.770
and we can translate it
into English for you.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.820
Progress in all
of these areas is

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.580
accelerating thanks
to profound advances

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.350
in machine learning and AI.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.360
And I believe we are
at a seminal moment.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.210
We, as Google, have
evolved significantly

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.040
over the past 10 years.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.650
And we believe we are poised
to take a big leap forward

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.790
in the next 10 years.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.880
So leveraging our
state-of-the-art capabilities

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.350
in machine learning and AI,
we truly want to take the next

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.670
step in being more
assistive for our users.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.270
So today, we are announcing
the Google Assistant.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.790
So what do we mean when we
say the Google Assistant?

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.640
We want to be there for
our users, asking them, hi,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.970
how can I help?

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.630
We think of the Assistant
in a very specific way.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.270
We think of it as a
conversational assistant.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.870
You want users to have an
ongoing two-way dialogue

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.500
with Google.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.670
We want you to help get things
done in your real world.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.810
And we want to do it for you,
understanding your context,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.590
giving you control of it.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.410
We think of this as
building each user

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.200
their own individual Google.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.050
We already have elements of
the Assistant working hard

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.710
for our users.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.640
I mentioned earlier that 20%
of queries on our mobile app

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.490
and Android in the
US are voice queries.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.640
Every single day,
people say, OK, Google

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.600
and ask us questions
that we help them with.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.810
And we have started becoming
truly conversational

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.350
because of our strengths in
natural language processing.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.280
For example, you can be in front
of this structure in Chicago

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.170
and ask Google,
who designed this?

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.050
You don't need to say the
beam or the cloud gate.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.850
Understand your context, and
we answer that the designer

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.130
is Anish Kapoor.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.690
Here's another example.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.246
You can ask Google, who
directed "The Revenant"--

00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:52.120
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: "The
Revenant" was directed

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.520
by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.090
SUNDAR PICHAI: And you can
follow that up with a question,

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.150
show me his awards.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.966
Notice that I didn't
say the name, which

00:23:00.966 --> 00:23:02.840
I'm glad, because I find
that name very, very

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.750
hard to pronounce.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.170
And Google could pick
that conversation up

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.590
and return the right to answer.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.240
This has historically
been really

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.230
hard to do for computers.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.925
The reason we are
able to do this

00:23:15.925 --> 00:23:18.330
is because we have
invested the last decade

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.570
in building the world's best
natural language processing

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.300
technology.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.900
And our ability to do
conversational understanding

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.390
is far ahead of what
other assistants can do.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.050
Especially if you look
at follow-on queries,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.640
our studies show that we
are an order of magnitude

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.250
ahead of everyone else.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.100
So today, people are using
Google and asking us questions

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.100
in many, many different ways.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.970
So we put together a short video
so that you can take a look.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.060
[PHONE RINGING]

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.560
-Hello.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.800
-Show me my graduation photos.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.540
-It's 29 degrees and clear.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.836
-Your order has shipped.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.858
-Here are your sports.

00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:46.726
[CHEERING]

00:24:46.726 --> 00:24:47.682
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:47.682 --> 00:24:51.984
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:53.418 --> 00:24:55.750
SUNDAR PICHAI: As
you can see, users

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.640
are already looking to Google
to help them get things done.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.300
But we believe we are
just getting started.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.630
We believe this
is a long journey.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.316
And given it's a
journey, we want

00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:09.190
to talk to you a little
bit about the future.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.320
We want to show you the kind
of things we ask [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.895
to be able to do.

00:25:13.895 --> 00:25:16.400
Now, let me do that
with an example.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.720
Here's a common situation.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.970
It's Friday night.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.770
I'm sure many of you can
relate to it back home.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.735
And I want to take
my family to a movie.

00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:25.970
You know, you normally
pull out your phone,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.680
research movies,
look at the reviews,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.190
find shows nearby, and
try to book a ticket.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.320
We want to be there in
these moments helping you.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.370
So you should be able to ask
Google, what's playing tonight?

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.500
And by the way, today,
if you ask that question,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.420
we do return movie results, but
we want to go a step further.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.620
We want to send your
context and maybe suggest

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.440
three relevant movies which
you would like nearby.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.840
I should be able to look at
it and maybe tell Google,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.160
we want to bring
the kids this time.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.650
And then if that's the case,
Google should refine the answer

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:07.480
and suggest family friendly
options and maybe even ask me,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.610
would you like four
tickets to any of these?

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.930
And if I say, sure,
let's do "Jungle Book,"

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.170
it should go ahead
and get the tickets

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.673
and have them ready waiting
for me when I need it.

00:26:19.673 --> 00:26:24.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.600
As you can see, I engage in
a conversation with Google,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.760
and it helped me get
things done in my context.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.010
And by the way, this is just
one version of the conversation.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.960
This could have gone
many, many different ways.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.050
For example, when Google
returned the results,

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.880
I could've asked, is
"Jungle Book" any good?

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.930
And Google could have
given me the reviews

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.897
and maybe even
shown me a trailer.

00:26:52.897 --> 00:26:54.230
And by the way, I saw the movie.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:58.150
It's terrific and hope
you get to see it as well.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.260
Every single conversation
is different.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.980
Every single context
is different.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.380
And we are working hard
to do this for billions

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.520
of conversations for
billions of users

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.730
around the world for everyone.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.640
We think of the
Assistant as an ambient

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.570
experience that
extends across devices.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.300
I think computing is poised
to evolve beyond just phones.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.870
It'll be in the context
of a user's daily life.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.370
It'll be on their phones,
devices they wear,

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.160
in their cars, and even
in their living rooms.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.530
For example, if you're in one of
the 100 different Android Auto

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.200
models and you're
driving and you say,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.590
let's have curry
tonight, we know

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.880
the Warriors are on tonight
and Steph Curry is playing,

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.170
but do you know all you're
looking for is food.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.190
And we should be
smart, order that food,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.790
and let you know
when it is ready

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.670
and maybe even have it
waiting for you at your home.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.380
Talking about your
home, we've already

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.810
built many, many
products for your home.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:10.510
Today, we have sold over 25
million Chromecast devices.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.570
So we've been thinking
hard about how

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.770
to bring this vision of Google
Assistant into your home.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.030
Credit to the team at Amazon
for creating a lot of excitement

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.680
in this space.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.387
We've been thinking about
our own unique approach,

00:28:25.387 --> 00:28:27.220
and we are getting ready
to launch something

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.790
later this year.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.410
To give you a preview,
I'm going to invite Mario

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.367
from the Chromecast team.

00:28:33.367 --> 00:28:33.867
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:38.657
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:42.968 --> 00:28:44.460
MARIO QUEIROZ: Thanks, Sundar.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.150
Today, we want to give
you an early preview

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.950
of how we're bringing the
Google Assistant to the home.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.000
Our aspiration is to make the
Assistant useful and enjoyable

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.150
in one of the most important
places in your world,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.930
where you spend time
with your family.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.250
When I walk into
my house, I want

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.630
to be able to continue to have
access to the Google Assistant.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.840
But I should be able to interact
with it in a hands-free way

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.270
simply using my voice without
having to take out my phone.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:20.590
This is why we're creating
Google Home, a device which

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:24.920
will be available
later this year.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.700
Google Home lets you enjoy
music and entertainment

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.810
throughout your entire
house, manage everyday tasks

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:38.130
more easily, and ask Google
what you want to know.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.080
All of this will be done by
speaking with the Assistant.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.810
It will let anyone in the
family, kids or adults,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.500
have a conversation with Google.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.112
Google Home is unmatched in
far-field voice recognition,

00:29:52.112 --> 00:29:55.440
since it's powered by more
than 10 years of innovation

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.040
in natural language processing.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.130
I can continue the two-way
dialogue with the Assistant

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.730
that Sundar mentioned
earlier, whether I'm

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.420
standing nearby cooking
dinner or sitting

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.170
across the room playing
a game with my daughter.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.270
With Google Home, we set
out to create and design

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.940
a beautiful product
that's warm and inviting

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.050
and fits naturally in
many areas of the home.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.450
We're designing the top
to blend into your home.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.610
We'll give you the option
to customize the base

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.640
with different
colors and finishes,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.750
including metal and fabric,
to reflect your home style,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.130
whether it be in the
living room, the kitchen,

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.930
or the bedroom.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.320
We're putting a lot
of craftsmanship

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.480
into the hardware design,
including the LED's placement

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.820
and choreography,
the speaker that's

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.490
going to fill the room you're
in with music, the microphone

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.930
system, and the clean
face without any buttons.

00:30:57.678 --> 00:31:02.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.520
This is Google Home.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.780
We think it'll be a
beautiful addition

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.610
to any room in your house.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.490
And we're even more
excited about what

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.610
it's going to do for you.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.670
First, music and
entertainment are

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.870
a big part of what makes being
at home relaxing and fun.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.230
Not long ago, we
introduced Chromecast,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.920
designed to play your
favorite shows, movies,

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.400
and YouTube videos on the
biggest screen in your house.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.160
Last year, we added
Chromecast Audio

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.130
to bring the music you
love to your best speakers.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.530
Chromecast has been one of
the hottest-selling consumer

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.100
electronics products
since the day it launched.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.510
And Google Home will build
on those experiences.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.710
Google Home is a Wi-Fi speaker
that streams music directly

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.750
from the cloud, so you get
the highest quality playback.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:08.130
It will deliver rich
bass and clear highs

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.360
all from a beautiful,
compact form factor.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.920
Of course, you can access songs,
playlists, albums, artists,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.830
and podcasts from your
favorite music services

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.910
just by asking with your voice.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.350
Or if you prefer, you can send
music from your Android or iOS

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.660
device through Google Cast.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.260
And unlike other
home assistants,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.120
Google Cast Support
allows you to control

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.110
other speakers in your home
without complicated setup.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.050
So when you want to listen
to Coldplay in the living

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.010
room on the living
room speakers,

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.910
you can simply say, play "Viva
La Vida" in the living room,

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.980
and it'll start playing.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.530
Cast Support also enables
multi-room playback,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.240
so that you can add
one or more Google home

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.260
devices to a group of
speakers and really blast

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.790
your favorite tunes.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.590
And it lets you control
your video content, too.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.850
Let's say that you want to
watch that episode of Jimmy

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.860
Kimmel or the trendy
YouTube video on your TV.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.140
Just tell Google
Home, and the content

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.405
that will appear on the biggest,
brightest screen in your house.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.320
Next, Google Home will become
more and more of a control

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.710
center for your whole home.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.560
Home is where lots of daily
tasks just need to get done.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.020
Having access to
the Google assistant

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.260
makes this a lot easier.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.250
It's like having a
voice-activated remote control

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.990
to the real world
whenever you need it.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.850
You can do the basics like
setting alarms and timers,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.510
or managing to-do lists
and shopping list.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.710
We're also designing Google
Home to connect your smart home

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.000
seamlessly.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.050
It will support the most
popular home networking systems,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.190
so that you can easily control
your lights, thermostats,

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:11.060
switches, and more, including
our own Nest devices.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.870
Further in the future,
we'll work with developers

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.969
to make it possible to
control things beyond the home

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:21.000
like booking a car, ordering
dinner, or sending flowers

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.699
to mom, and much, much more,
all with just your voice.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:32.170
Third, Google Home lets you
ask Google about anything

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.710
you want to know.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.219
Of course, you
can get the basics

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:41.150
like the weather or facts that
you might find on Wikipedia.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.909
But what makes Google
Home really shine

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.260
is that it has search built in.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.449
It draws on 17
years of innovation

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.969
in organizing the
world's information

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:57.110
to answer questions which are
difficult for other assistants

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.290
to handle.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.980
You might ask, how much
fat is in an avocado,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.770
or what is Draymond
Green's jersey number,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.400
and then follow up that
last question with,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400
where did he go to college?

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.390
Or try something more complex.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:16.671
What was the US population
when NASA was established?

00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:23.280
You will get immediate, accurate
answers from Google each time.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.010
And the Google
assistant not only

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.800
knows a lot about the world,
but it will stand apart

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.840
in how it can also
get to know you

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.940
over time, with your
permission, of course.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.860
It can help you retrieve
your travel itinerary,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.640
your daily schedule,
your traffic to work,

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.220
your package delivery
information, and much more.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:50.400
And as Google keeps getting
better, so will Google Home.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.170
So that's Google Home-- a
beautiful, smart, voice-enabled

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.200
assistant for the whole family.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.540

you want to know.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.570

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.860
it might be like in the future
to have your personal Google

so that we can work with
partners in a more open way

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.880
to deliver awesome
experiences at launch.

more to share soon

ask Sundar back on stage.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.440
Is really exciting to
see the Google assistant

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.610
come to life with
Google Home and help

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.460
get people things done.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.620
To do this well,
as Mario mentioned,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.580
we really need to work with
developers and third parties,

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.450
so that we can provide
these actions for our users.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.430
We already do this a
lot at Google today.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.980
Using Google products,
you can already

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.570
book a movie ticket with
Fandango, get a car with Uber,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.740
listen to music on
Spotify, book a restaurant

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.340
with OpenTable, maybe
record a ride with Strava,

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.150
and many, many more
such use cases.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.020
So we are thinking
about this thoughtfully,

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.470
and we're working on
a comprehensive way

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.009
by which third-party
developers can

00:40:16.009 --> 00:40:17.175
interact with the assistant.

00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:21.980
And we'll be sharing a lot
more in the upcoming months.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.020
I talked earlier that
we are working hard

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.280
at core use cases on mobile.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.350
One such important
use case is photos.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:36.540
Last year, thanks to the
advances in computer vision,

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.050
we approach photos
with a new perspective.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.290
We announced Google
Photo at Google I/O

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:48.950
last year with the goal to
help users find and organize

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.350
their photos and
videos, keep them safe,

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.700
and share them effortlessly
with their family and friends

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.245
on any device.

00:40:57.245 --> 00:41:00.560
We have seen tremendous
adoption with Google Photos.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.650
And just in the past year, we
have seen tremendous adoption.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:09.597
And today, we are at over 200
million monthly active users.

systems have automatically

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.590
applied over 2 trillion labels.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.640
This is what allows us, when
you search for "Pomeranian,"

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.080
to find the right picture.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.040
And by the way, over 24
billion of those labels

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.460
are for selfies.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.950
We even have Pomeranian selfies.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.460
Google Photo shows
what's possible

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:47.270
when you approach an existing
area from a new perspective.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:52.640
Another core use case on users'
phones is communications.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.770
It's an exciting area, and
there is a lot of innovation.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.060
But given our advancements
in machine learning,

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.210
we wanted to approach
this core use

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.720
case with a new perspective.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.642

talk to you more about it.

ERIK KAY: Thanks, Sundar.

00:42:20.768 --> 00:42:25.180
You know, communications is all
about sharing life's moments--

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.555
that great restaurant I
found, the winning shot

00:42:27.555 --> 00:42:31.750
in overtime, my
daughter's recital.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.740
Today I could share moments
like these the second

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.280
they happen just by pulling out
my phone and sending a message.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.225
Communications is such an
important part of our lives.

00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:46.080
And it's an important
focus for Google as well.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.670
What makes me personally
excited about communications

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.960
is the potential
for innovation when

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.970
you combine the power of mobile
with advancements in machine

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.464
learning.

00:42:57.464 --> 00:42:59.380
So today we're giving
you a look at what we've

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.410
been up to with two new
communication apps that

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.560
show what's possible
when we bring

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.870
Google technology to this
essential human activity.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:14.375
The first is a new
messaging app called Allo.

00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:15.324
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:15.324 --> 00:43:15.824
Thank you.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.510
Allo is a smart messaging app.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.960
It learns over time to
make conversations easier,

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.320
more expressive,
and more productive

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.870
by bringing all the richness
of Google right into your chat.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.530
Allo is based on
your phone number,

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.380
so you can easily get in touch
with anyone in your phone book.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.980
This morning, we're
going to walk you

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:47.070
through three areas that
make Allo really special.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.710
First, here are some fun ways
to express yourself and keep

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.676
the conversation going.

00:43:52.676 --> 00:43:55.550
Then we'll talk
about what it means

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.260
to have the Google assistant
built right into your messaging

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.830
app.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:03.620
And finally, we'll tell you how
Allo keeps your conversations

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.860
private and secure.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.720
So let's get started.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.010
On the stage with me
to help demo is Amit.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.480
He leads product management.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:18.337 --> 00:44:19.920
And on the screen
behind me, you could

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:24.750
see Amit's in a conversation
with his friend Joy.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:29.180
So we designed Allo to help
you express yourself and keep

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.100
the conversation going.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.367
So of course, there's
a great selection

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:35.700
of stickers which we've sourced
from independent artists

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.250
and content producers
from around the world.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:43.150
But expression is more than
just emojis and stickers.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.960
So we've added
more features that

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.340
help you say what you mean.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.800
First, let's look
at Whisper/Shout.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.160
We wanted to give you a way to
add more emotion to your words.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.940
Sometimes you want to get your
point across big and bold.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.420
Other times you want to say
things a bit more softly.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.460
Whisper/Shout lets you
express how you really

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.740
feel by making your replies
very big or very small.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.660
Amit, can you show
everyone how that works?

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:18.780
So Amit has typed "yay" and
throws a smiley face in there.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.450
Now watch.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.380
Rather than tapping
the Send button,

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:27.440
he slides it down to Whisper
and slides it up again to Shout.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.507
So down to Whisper
and up again to Shout.

00:45:31.507 --> 00:45:35.403
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.052
Yeah, I think it's
pretty cool, too.

00:45:40.052 --> 00:45:42.260
No more yelling in all caps
to get your point across.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.780
It's also fun to add
emotion to your photos.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.460
And Ink lets you get creative
with the photos you send.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.100
Amit's picked a photo of
his adorable baby girl

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.450
and wrote "ahoy" on the
little sailor, posted it.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.690
It's that simple.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.110
I use Ink all the time.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.850
It's really fun.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.360
Another way Allo
helps you express

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.810
yourself is by letting
you type less, a lot less.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.300
We've taken a page
from the Inbox Playbook

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.969
and built smart reply right
into your chat conversations.

00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:18.963
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.180
This is especially
powerful in messaging

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.347
when you're on the go.

00:46:24.347 --> 00:46:25.930
So now you can keep
your conversations

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.470
going with just a quick tap.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.300
So you could see when
Joy asks, "dinner later?"

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.930
that Amit is offered two smart
reply suggestions-- I'm busy

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.680
and I'm in!

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.290
OK, I promise I won't
act out any more emojis.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:49.020
So Allo uses machine learning
to suggest replies on the fly,

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.720
anticipating what you
might want to say next.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.280
Now, these aren't
just canned replies.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.700
Allo learns over time and
will suggest responses

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.510
based on how you like
to express yourself.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.920
The more you use Allo,
the better the suggestions

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.300
will become.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.971
So the suggestions you
see are unique to you.

00:47:07.971 --> 00:47:10.190
You could say the things
you want without having

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.940
to type a single word.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.300
And since messaging
isn't just about text,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.800
smart replies contain
stickers and emojis, too.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.130
Because as they say, an
emoji's worth 1,000 words.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.514
Do they say that?

00:47:24.514 --> 00:47:27.490
No.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:31.150
Now I want to show you
something really cool.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:35.856
Allo even offers smart replies
when people send photos to you.

00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:39.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.650
This works because in addition
to understanding text,

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.420
Allo builds on Google's
computer vision capabilities

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.370
to understand the content
and the context of images.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.310
In this case, Allo
understood that the picture

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.140
was of a dog, that
it was a cute dog,

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.850
and that even the
breed of the dog.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.510
In our internal
testing, we found

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.150
that Allo was 90%
accurate at determining

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.576
whether a dog deserves
the "cute dog" response.

00:48:09.576 --> 00:48:12.056
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.090
So let's try
something even harder.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.410
When Joy sends a
photo of pasta, we're

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.410
able to identify the
precise details of the image

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.620
and create smart
replies mentioning both

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.920
the linguine and the clams.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.260
What's really cool here
is that we don't just

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.280
identify what's in the image--
Smart Reply actually creates

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:38.774
a conversational response,
something like "yummy,"

00:48:38.774 --> 00:48:40.440
the kind of thing you
would actually say

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.230
in response to a photo of food.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.130
This is only possible
because we've

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.740
married our
strengths in computer

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:50.500
vision and natural
language processing.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.580
And if you think
about it, there's

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.330
a lot of complex
technology at work

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.860
here just to help you say
something as simple and natural

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.850
as "I love linguine."

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.200
So that's a little
how Allo helps

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.260
you express yourself and keep
your conversations going.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.240
The intelligence
behind Smart Reply

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.200
also gives you a taste at
how assistive technology can

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.620
make your message experience
simpler and more productive.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.570
The Google assistant
built right into Allo

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.980
takes it even farther.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.510
So I'm pleased to introduce
one of our leads, Rebecca,

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.630
to tell you more about
the assistant in Allo.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.670
REBECCA MICHAEL: Thanks, Erik.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:36.250
Since you had earlier,
the Google assistant

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.130
is an ongoing
dialogue between you

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:41.820
and Google that helps you get
things done in your world.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.480
It's also designed as an
ambient experience that's there

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.120
for you whenever you need it.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.500
And in messaging,
that really means

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.980
bringing the Google assistant
right into your conversation

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.630
with friends.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.840
So I'm going to show you
how the assistant can help

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.540
in Amit and Joy's conversation.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.450
So they're planning
a dinner, and Joy now

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.050
said she'd like Italian food.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.130
The assistant
intelligently recognizes

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.310
that they could use some tips
for Italian restaurants nearby.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.990
And you can see its
proactive suggestion

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:13.770
at the bottom of
the screen there.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:18.030
Tapping this brings
up restaurant cards

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.660
that everyone in
the chat can see.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.310
These are powered by Google's
Knowledge Graph, which

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.880
means that Allo can help
with all kinds of information

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.342
in the real world.

00:50:29.342 --> 00:50:31.550
So there's some back and
forth about which restaurant

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.340
to go to, and it looks like
they're leaning towards Cuchina

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:34.960
at 7 o'clock.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.520
So Amit taps on the restaurant
card to bring up more details.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.770
Looks good.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.465
Serves pasta, which
we know Joy fancied.

00:50:45.465 --> 00:50:51.610
So Amit can now go ahead and
make a reservation right there

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.790
through OpenTable.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:57.535
The assistant prompts him to
confirm the number of diners.

00:50:57.535 --> 00:51:00.610
And [INAUDIBLE] to eat.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.332
So what we're seeing
here-- [LAUGHS]

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:10.010
What we're seeing here
is completely new.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.620
In the past, Amit would
have had to leave the chat

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.470
to do a Google search, return
with some restaurant options,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:21.250
switch back again to
share the options,

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.590
go out again to make the
reservation in OpenTable,

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.340
and then come back in
to share the details

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.300
with the rest of the group.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:32.430
In Allo, Amit and Joy could
choose and reserve a restaurant

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:37.368
right there in the chat in
a natural and seamless way.

00:51:37.368 --> 00:51:40.812
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:48.820
So OpenTable will be just
one of the many partners that

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.220
will be part of the Google
assistant ecosystem.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.920
And we can't wait
to share more soon

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.400
with the developer community
about how to get started.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.300
Cool.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.970
So we saw some proactive
suggestions from Google there.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.900
You can also call on the Google
assistant directly at any time

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.570
just by typing "at Google,"
as Amit's doing now.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.470
And he's going to ask
for funny cat pics.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.820
Really, Amit?

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.120
OK.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:22.620
Cool.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:27.200
So Google obliges, of course,
with a lovely lineup of cats

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.680
from Google Image search.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.915
Wow, that chin.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.437
OK.

00:52:34.437 --> 00:52:36.270
So you just saw how the
Google assistant can

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.280
be really helpful in groups.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.000
You can also have a
one-on-one chat with Google.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.670
So what we're seeing now
is Amit's contact list.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.500
And Google's appearing
at the top there.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.940
So let's jump in
and have a chat.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.710
Just like with any
other conversation,

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.220
this one picks up right
where you left off.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.560
And the assistant will
remember things like your name

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.340
and even tell you
how it's feeling.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.290
So let's try something
more interesting.

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.240
Amit's a big Real
Madrid fan, and he

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.980
wants to know how they got
on in their last match.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.840
So he asks the assistant,
did my team win?

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.050
Looks like they did.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:13.070
They won their-- yeah.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.740
Some Real Madrid fans out there.

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.322
Cool.

00:53:17.322 --> 00:53:19.030
So they won their last
match to Saturday.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.530
Let's see when
they're playing next.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.747
That's pretty cool.

00:53:24.747 --> 00:53:26.330
They're through to
the Champion League

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:27.657
final at the end of the month.

00:53:27.657 --> 00:53:29.740
And we can keep going like
this and find more news

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.060
about the team just by tapping
on the suggestions there.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.200
But let's go ahead and
tap on their roster.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:38.680
There we go.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.810
We have a carousel with
all their top talent.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.960
And should we check out
everyone's favorite?

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:48.110
OK.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:49.410
There he is-- Mr. Ronaldo.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.910
And let's see some of his
top-- his best tricks.

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:57.990
So Amit only has to
type "best tricks,"

00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.040
and the assistant
understands the context

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.790
in that he means Ronaldo's
best tricks, and responds

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.724
with a YouTube video.

00:54:04.724 --> 00:54:08.028
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.750
We won't play that video
now, but if we did tap it,

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:17.060
it would play right
there in the chat.

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.300
So let's play a game instead.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.570
Amit's asking Google
to play a game.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.920
And OK.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.530
Google's suggesting
the emoji game.

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:30.510
Right.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:34.550
The way this works is Google
provides a string of emoji,

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:37.600
and you have to
guess the film title.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.110
Are you ready?

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:39.670
Yeah!

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:40.540
OK, let's play.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.390
OK.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:49.030
So looks like we've got
a crown and some rings.

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:51.230
Any ideas?

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.250
"Lord of the Rings"?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.280
Oh, I hear "The Princess
Bride" over there.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:55.980
Amit, any ideas?

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.810
"Lord of the Rings."

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:04.850
Oh, it's too easy.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:08.120
OK, we could keep going, but
I think you've got the idea.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.648
So that was obviously-- [LAUGHS]

00:55:12.512 --> 00:55:13.860
Should we keep going?

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.840
No.

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.340
No.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.770
Any ideas?

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:21.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.401
REBECCA MICHAEL: They're good.

00:55:23.401 --> 00:55:23.900
OK.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.590
So this is obviously
a super simple game.

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.880
And there's a bunch more
that you can play in Allo.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.960
But we really think that
the best games will come

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.500
from the developer community.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.600
So that was the
assistant in Allo,

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.150
allowing you to harness all
of the richness and knowledge

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.250
of Google, from search,
YouTubes, maps, photos, as well

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.660
as many of our partners to
have fun and get things done.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.750
As you saw, the
interface is inherently

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.890
personal and conversational.

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:03.470
And the Smart Suggestion chips
help to keep the conversation

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.700
flowing.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.150
But most importantly,
for the first time,

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.770
you can use Google in your
chats with your friends.

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:12.820
And with that, I'll
hand it back to Erik.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.280
ERIK KAY: Thanks,
Rebecca, and thanks, Amit.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.520
I'm really excited about
the possibilities the Google

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.460
assistant brings to messaging.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.340
Now let's talk a bit about
privacy and security.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:33.830
We realize that sometimes
people want to be incognito.

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:36.850
Of course, this applies
to chat as well.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.610
So following in the
footsteps of Chrome,

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:43.930
we've created an
incognito mode for Allo.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:47.140
While all messages in
Allo are encrypted,

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:51.460
chats in incognito mode
are end-to-end encrypted.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.530
Incognito chats have
discrete notifications,

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.595
hiding the sender and
the message contents

00:56:56.595 --> 00:57:00.260
from shoulder surfers
and prying eyes.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.570
Incognito also offers
message expiration,

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:07.190
so you're in control of how
long your private messages stick

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.840
around.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.700
And similar to when you close
an Incognito window in Chrome,

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.430
when you delete an incognito
conversation in Allo,

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:17.850
it's gone forever and no
one could see it again

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:20.290
on your device.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:22.490
With incognito mode,
Allo gives users

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:26.350
additional controls over
their privacy and security.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.160
And we anticipate adding even
more security features to it

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.120
over time.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.320
So that's Allo.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.060
Allo is fast, smart,
and secure, and it

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.940
lets you express yourself
in fun, new ways.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.700
And Allo will be the first
home for the Google assistant

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.140
as it starts to take shape,
bringing the richness of Google

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.530
right into your chats.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:51.340
Now, Allo is all
about messaging,

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:56.380
but let me talk to you a
minute about video calling.

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.490
Just as technology has
helped connect people

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.500
through messaging,
video calling has

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:06.340
brought families and friends
together from around the world.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.130
It can be a magical experience.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.330
So why don't we pick up the
phone and do it more often?

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:18.590
Well, maybe the other person
has a different kind of phone.

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:22.400
Maybe the connection
is a little spotty.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.310
And even when it does
work, getting a call

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.650
can often feel intrusive,
because you're not quite sure

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.540
why the other person's calling.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.050
That's why we
challenged ourselves

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:37.720
to design a video
calling experience that

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.010
would feel magical every time.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:44.760
So I'd like to
introduce you to Duo,

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.370
a simple, one-to-one video
calling app for everyone.

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:51.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.780
Duo is the video
companion to Allo.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.040
It's fast and performs
well even on slow networks.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.860
It's end-to-end encrypted.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.980
It's based on your
phone number, allowing

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.040
you to easily get in touch
with the people you care about.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.480
And it works on both
Android and iOS.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.610
But here's a feature that
makes Allo really special.

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.350
We call it Knock Knock.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.770
Knock Knock shows you a live
video stream of the caller

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.980
before you've even picked up.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.050
Not only can you see who's
calling, but what they're up to

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:33.140
and why they're calling.

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:37.040
A smile, a beach, a
newborn baby can all

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.530
draw you into the
moment, making calls

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:41.990
feel spontaneous and natural.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.140
And once you pick up, Duo
puts you right into the call,

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.760
seamlessly transitioning
from the live preview

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.710
to the live call.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.430
Knock Knock totally
changes what it's

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:53.910
like to receive a video call.

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:56.950
So let's take a look.

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:58.450
[RINGING]

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.430
And almost right on
cue, I'm getting a call

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.780
from my daughter Ava.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.470
I use Ava for all my demos.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.270
So as you can see-- and
Elena, apparently, too

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:13.350
is popping in there.

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:16.250
I haven't even picked up
yet, but Ava's right there,

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.730
smiling and making funny faces.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.880
I can tell she's
really eager to talk.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.390
So let's answer it.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.270
[CHIME]

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.115
AVA: Hi, Dad.

01:00:24.115 --> 01:00:24.910
ERIK KAY: Hi, Ava.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:25.700
Hi, Elena.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.600
ELENA: Hi, Dad!

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.433
ERIK KAY: Hi, girls.

01:00:27.433 --> 01:00:29.930
AVA: Are you done with
your presentation yet?

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:30.730
ERIK KAY: Almost.

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:31.770
I'll be done soon.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.120
Could you wave to everybody?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.830
AVA: Hi, everybody.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.695
ERIK KAY: All right.

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:37.806

01:00:37.806 --> 01:00:38.305
All right.

01:00:38.305 --> 01:00:38.805
Bye.

01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:40.304
I'll talk to you soon.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:41.256
AVA: Bye, Dad.

01:00:41.256 --> 01:00:41.756
ELENA: Bye!

01:00:41.756 --> 01:00:42.724
[PHONE HANGS UP]

01:00:42.724 --> 01:00:46.112
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:47.423 --> 01:00:48.048
ERIK KAY: Oops.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.660
So you just saw how
Knock Knock drew us

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.590
into the conversation
with Ava and Elena

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:03.360
before we even picked it up,
and how fast and smooth it was.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.220
Now, Knock Knock only works
when the video is instant.

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.560
There can't be a gap
between the phone ringing

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.400
and the video appearing.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.350
This is a really hard
technical problem,

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:17.740
but we're uniquely
positioned to tackle it.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.340
Duo was built by the
team that created WebRTC,

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:24.550
the open-source platform that
now powers much of today's

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.490
mobile video communication.

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:30.130
And we know this technology
like no one else.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.260
We used a new
protocol called Quick

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.350
that allows Duo to establish
an encrypted connection

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.170
in a single round trip.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:40.890
We obsessed over every last
detail of video transmission,

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:44.340
hand-tuning and optimizing
codecs, bandwidth probing,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.760
encryption, and more.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.980
The result is the unique
feel of Knock Knock.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.000
You're right there
in an instant.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:58.600
So the other thing that
really sets Duo apart

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.550
is how reliable it
makes video calling.

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.200
Duo works wherever
you are, whether it's

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.210
New York or New Delhi,
Buenos Aires or Butte,

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.890
at home or on the road.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.860
Duo proactively monitors
network quality multiple times

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.430
per second, allowing
to degrade gracefully

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.340
when bandwidth is limited
and to seamlessly switch

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.470
between Wi-Fi and cellular.

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.410
And of course, this all
happens automatically

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:28.310
behind the scenes, so you
don't have to worry about it.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:31.900
All this technology combines
with a smooth interface

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.560
that fades away,
allowing you to focus

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.700
on each other in beautiful
HD video and audio.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.560
This is what makes
Duo a video calling

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.370
experience that feels unlike
anything you've used before.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:48.020
Now I'd like to show you a short
video that shows how Duo brings

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.322
magic back to video calling.

these two new apps--

Allo, a smart messaging app
with expression and the power

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:59.680
of Google assistant;
and Duo, a simple video

of Knock Knock.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.752
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:14.091 --> 01:04:17.950
Now, to talk to you
a bit about Android,

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:20.100
I'd like to invite to the
stage our resident rock

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.950
star, Dave Burke.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:26.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.780
DAVE BURKE: Thanks, Eric.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.880
Hey, I'm Dave.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.500
It's amazing to be
here at Google I/O 2016

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.175
at the Shoreline Amphitheater.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.760
What a great venue.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.260
I think this is
going to be the very

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.290
closest I get to my
childhood dream of being

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:48.850
a rock star on the stage.

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:50.520
There's something
wrong about nerds

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.340
being allowed on a rock star
stage like this, but anyway.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.220
So far we've talked
about the scale of mobile

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.620
and how we're thinking about
evolving our products to be

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.050
smarter and more
assistive through machine

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.510
learning and AI.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:06.620
And a key driver of
this scale is Android.

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.390
As you've heard, this year
marks the 10th anniversary

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.580
of our first
developer conference.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:16.590
It's also been 10 years since
we started working on Android.

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.010
So how are we doing?

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.880
Well, Android is the most
popular OS in the world.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.260
More than 600
Android smartphones

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.880
have launched in the last year
alone-- everything from Disney

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.160
princess phones to metal
unibody devices tricked out

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.210
in titanium.

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:34.070
There's a phone for everyone.

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:36.300
And as Android
continues to expand

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.620
into new screens
like on the wrist

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.160
and in the car on TVs
and connected devices,

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.260
there's increased opportunity
for developers to reach users,

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.740
whether they're at
home or on the go.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.560
Android wear-- there
are now 12 partner

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.010
brands with iconic watch makers
like Tag Heuer and designers

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:58.240
like Michael Kors.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.680
Android TV-- there are now
millions of new Android TV

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.610
devices growing rapidly
with media content and games

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:09.160
from the biggest
names in the industry.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.810
Android auto-- more
than 100 car models

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:15.290
and stereos have launched
with another 100 on their way

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.070
by the end of the year.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.520
And of course, Google Play.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.120
There were $65 billion installs
in the last year alone.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.575
And I'm just in constant
awe of all the amazing apps

01:06:26.575 --> 01:06:29.637
and services that you're
creating that's fueling this.

01:06:29.637 --> 01:06:33.373
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.160
So let's talk about what's
new in the platform.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.960
With the N release, we
wanted to achieve a new level

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.510
of product excellence.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:45.970
So we set about
redesigning and rewriting

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:50.430
many fundamental aspects
of how the system works.

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:54.580
Now, a lot of the features
in N were inspired by users--

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.180
how they use their phones,
what they've told us,

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.750
and how we think we can make
their day to day experience

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:02.200
better and more useful.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.590
This year, we decided to do
something a little different

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:09.220
by releasing early developer
previews of the N release

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.250
before Google I/O.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.770
We want to share our
work in progress with you

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:18.110
as we build it so we have
more time for your feedback.

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:20.290
Also, getting the
platform out earlier

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:23.350
means there's more time for app
developers and device makers

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:25.200
to be ready for
the release later.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.990
I have no idea why, but this
year, the N dessert name

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.590
is proving trickier
than all of the others.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.970
So for the first time ever,
we're going to be inviting

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:45.550
the world to submit their
ideas to www.android.com/n.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.760
We're looking forward to
input, but please don't

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.719
call it "Namey McNameface."

01:07:49.719 --> 01:07:51.510
I should add that we
will reserve the right

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:54.310
to pick the winner.

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:57.530
In the meantime, let's jump
straight in and talk about some

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:01.570
of the biggest changes in N
around performance, security,

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.800
and productivity.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800
Let's start with performance.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.610
We've improved performance
in N in key areas-- graphics

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.260
and run time.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.130
In recent Android releases, we
extended the OpenGL standard

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.910
to bring advanced graphics
capabilities, usually found

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.020
on the desktop and game
consoles, to mobile.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.870
With N, we're making
our biggest leap forward

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:27.649
with the introduction of Vulkan.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:31.370
Vulkan is a modern 3D
graphics API designed

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.670
to give game developers
direct control of the GPU

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:38.700
to produce incredible graphics
and compute performance.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.330
We made a concerted
effort to work

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:43.810
with the industry on Vulkan
so you can use the same APIs

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.550
and graphics assets and shaders
on the desktop as well as

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:48.950
mobile.

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:53.250
Because Vulkan has a lower
CPU overhead than OpenGL,

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.740
game developers
are able to squeeze

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.439
in more effects per frame while
still maintaining a high frame

01:08:58.439 --> 01:08:59.550
rate.

01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:01.710
Let's take a look at
a Nexus 6P running

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:05.339
a new version of the "Need for
Speed" game by Electronic Arts.

01:09:05.339 --> 01:09:07.380
And there are a bunch of
really nice improvements

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.330
in this version,
thanks to Vulkan.

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:11.770
You'll notice the beautiful
graphics and reflections

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.760
and materials on the car, thanks
to physically based rendering.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.479
Also check out the
realistic motion

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:19.529
blur effect which is
computed for every object

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:21.229
at the side of the road.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.790
And there's a really nice water
surface effect on the road.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:27.450
And the shaders for these are
pre-compiled ahead of time

01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:29.689
and can now run anywhere.

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:31.750
So that's graphics performance.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:35.580
We've also spent a lot of
effort working on improving

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.890
the Android runtime.

01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:42.149
First, we've made major
optimizations to our compiler.

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:46.600
The compiler in N performs
anything from 30% to 600%

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.330
faster on major CPU
benchmarks like drystone.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:55.250
Second we've added a new
just in time or JIT compiler.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.490
And JIT compilation means that
app installs are much faster--

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:02.600
75% faster in N. So now
users can get up and running

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.130
in your apps much more quickly.

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:09.280
And also because JIT is more
selective about which methods

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.250
it compiles, we're
also able to reduce

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:16.590
the amount of storage unit
for app code by a full 50%.

01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:19.070
Now, unlike conventional
JIT systems,

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:22.380
the Android runtime uses
profile-guided optimization

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.800
to write compiled code to
flash for the next time you

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.900
run the app.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.890
So this improves performance
and reduces battery consumption.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:33.950
In summary, the new JIT compiler
improves software performance,

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:37.090
makes installs faster, and
reduces the amount of storage

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:40.450
you need for apps
on your device.

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:43.090
Let's talk about another
big area of focus for us--

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:44.630
security.

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.540
We designed Android
from the beginning

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:50.830
with a multi-layered, defense
in depth security architecture.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.950
And Android employs the
latest cutting-edge security

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.800
technologies, things
like SE Linux,

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.360
verified boot integrity,
and full disk encryption.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.340
With N, we're continuing
to strengthen our defenses

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.440
in three key ways.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.120
First, N introduces
file-based encryption.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.560
By encrypting at the file level
instead of the block level,

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.940
we're able to better
isolate and protect

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.870
individual users of the system.

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:20.190
Second, we learned the
importance last year

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:23.470
of hardening the security
of the media framework,

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:25.300
especially since
it's accessing files

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.160
from anywhere on the internet.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.310
So in N, we've split
out key subsystems

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:34.630
into individual SE Linux
protected processes,

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.280
things like codex
and file extractors.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.650
By improving the security
of the media framework,

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:42.950
we improve the security
of the entire device.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.490
Third-- and this
is something that's

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.890
really cool-- N automatically
keeps your phone up

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:51.050
to date with the latest
version of the system software

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:54.210
without you having
to do anything.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:57.710
LIke Chromebooks, new
Android devices built on N

01:11:57.710 --> 01:12:01.150
have two system images.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.340
So when an update is
available, your phone

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.120
will automatically download
the new system image

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.490
in the background.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.390
So the next time you
power up your phone,

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:12.974
it will seamlessly switch
into the new software image.

01:12:12.974 --> 01:12:14.640
You're no longer asked
for your password

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.500
when the phone powers up,
thanks to file-based encryption

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.280
and a new feature
called direct boot.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.380
And that pesky
Android is Upgrading

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.957
dialog is finally gone, thanks
to the new JIT compiler.

01:12:25.957 --> 01:12:29.310
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:31.169 --> 01:12:33.210
I think the best feeling
in the software industry

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.296
is actually deleting
code, by the way.

01:12:36.296 --> 01:12:37.670
This approach to
software updates

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.720
is one of the most loved
features of Chromebooks.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.810
And I'm really excited to
bring it to mobile as well.

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:45.470
So that's some of the ways we're
improving security mechanisms

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:46.770
in the platform.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:49.240
But let's not forget about
all of the security services

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.480
that Google provides to keep
all Android devices safe.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.800
In fact, when you think about
the scale of Android and Google

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.220
Play and the number of
devices and apps out there,

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.830
we're providing one of the most
comprehensive mobile security

01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:06.200
solutions in the world.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.480
Let's take a look
at a few examples.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.350
Google Chrome
protects users when

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:14.310
they're surfing the web through
a system called Safe Browsing.

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.940
Safe Browsing warns
users ahead of time

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.470
when they're about
to go to a site

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:22.940
that we know contains malware
or is known to be deceptive.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:27.680
Today, we're protecting over
one billion mobile Chrome users.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.920
Another example of
how we protect users

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.350
is through the
Google Play store.

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:35.980
All Android apps undergo
rigorous security testing

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.450
before appearing on the store.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:42.510
We review every app to make
sure it meets our policies.

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:45.540
We also run an app security
improvement program

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:48.650
with developers to
identify potential security

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:49.930
vulnerabilities.

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.440
For example, we've worked with
key banking and e-commerce

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.930
applications to ensure
they're using HTTPS properly

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:59.200
to protect against man
in the middle attacks.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.560
Google Play itself is
built on a state of the art

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.260
cloud-based infrastructure
we called Safety Net.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.090
With Safety Net, Google's expert
systems and machine learning

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.110
models analyze billions
of signals every day

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:15.070
to predict bad behavior.

01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:17.490
If an app steps out
of line, Google Play

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:20.510
will block or uninstall
the app, no matter

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:22.710
where it was installed from.

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:25.700
And the scale of Safety
Net is extraordinary.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.860
Every day, we test
over a billion devices

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.060
and over eight billion
installed apps.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.940
And all of this
happens under the hood

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.200
to keep you safe and secure, no
matter what version of Android

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.160
you're on.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.650
Let's move on.

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:45.030
A third area of focus for
us is our continued effort

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:47.100
to improve productivity.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.910
And we've taken a close look at
how people multitask on Android

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.080
to understand what's
working for them

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.060
and where we could improve.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:58.660
And we've particularly focused
on the recent Apps screen.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.410
And what we learned
from our user research

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:03.500
is that over 99% of
the time, people only

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.830
select an app within
the last seven.

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:10.310
So we decided to simplify by
automatically removing apps

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:12.980
in the list that you
haven't used in a while.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.400
This that makes it much
easier to find the app

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.010
that you're looking for.

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:19.690
Also, based on popular
demand, we finally

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:21.470
added a Clear All
button at the top.

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:27.000
Yeah, feels good.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.570
But my absolute favorite
feature is something

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:31.490
that we call Quick Switch.

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:35.000
You can now flip to the previous
app you were in just by double

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.690
tapping the Recents
button from anywhere.

01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:40.950
You can think of it like
a simplified Alt Tab.

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.570
And it's amazingly useful
in so many situations.

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.500
For example, let's say
I'm in a phone call

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.550
and I'm trying to
coordinate an event.

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:49.380
I can flip over to
the calendar app

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.880
I was just in by double
tapping the Recents

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.430
button at the bottom right.

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.270
From there, I can
check my schedule

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:58.060
and then flip back to the dialer
by double tapping the Recents

01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.900
button again.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.410
It's pretty cool.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:03.380
Now, many of you also
asked for the ability

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.440
to display more than one
app at the same time.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.370
So we've invested
a lot of effort

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:12.130
in redesigning our window
management framework in N.

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:14.960
And we're introducing two
powerful new windowing

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.910
modes in this release-- split
screen and picture in picture.

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:23.100
Split screen is designed
for tablets and phones,

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.940
and it's really simple to use.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.480
So for example, let's say
I'm watching a video YouTube

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.360
to learn how to make
the best nachos.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.980
I can long tap on the Recents
button to enter Multi Window

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.860
and from there launch something
like Google Keep, for example.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.230
Now I can update my shopping
list for ingredients

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:42.760
while I'm watching the video.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.000
The second mode,
picture in picture,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.070
is designed for Android TV.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:49.770
And it's a great way to let
you keep watching something

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.290
while you perform another task.

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:55.010
For example, let's say I'm
watching a live TV program

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.544
on retro gaming and they're
talking about "Pac-Man."

01:16:57.544 --> 01:16:59.710
And I want to see if I can
install and play the game

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:00.770
myself.

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:04.200
I can put the live content into
picture in picture mode to keep

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.440
watching it and then go ahead
and perform a voice search

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.820
for "Pac-Man."

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.040
This will then give me an
option to install the game

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.630
from the Play Store, all at
the same time as watching

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.420
the content.

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.130
It's pretty cool.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.520
Notifications is
another area we've

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.590
worked on to improve
productivity in Android.

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:25.410
And it turns out that today,
over half of the notifications

01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:28.910
shown on Android originated
from messaging applications.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:32.190
So we decided to make some
changes to really optimize

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:33.860
for this use case.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.960
We've added a new direct reply
feature, which lets you quickly

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.110
reply to a message like so.

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:42.960
You no longer need
to launch the app

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.410
to fire off a quick response,
so it's a real time saver.

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:48.660
We've also added a
feature to give you more

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.600
control over notifications.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.260
With N, you can long
tap a notification

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.170
to change its visibility.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:58.340
For example, you can block
notifications from a given app

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.800
or set them to
show only silently.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.060
So now you're able to
choose which notifications

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.240
are important for you.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.140
One other area we've worked on
to improve your productivity

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.850
in Android is your ability to
express yourself with emoji.

01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:15.150
And Android is the
first mobile platform

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:20.420
to support the new
Unicode 9 emoji standard.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.520
With this edition are
more human-looking

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.470
glyphs and support for
skin tone variations.

01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:29.935
Unicode 9 also brings
72 new emoji glyphs.

01:18:29.935 --> 01:18:32.060
So now, you can let your
friends know, for example,

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.130
when you're dancing
like the left shark

01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:36.060
while juggling and
eating avocado toast

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.330
in order to win first prize
in that selfie contest.

01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:42.700
Basically, my typical
Friday night-- not.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.530
But more seriously, we're
really committed to this space.

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:48.450
And we're continuing to
work with Unicode consortium

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:51.490
on the next generation of emoji.

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:54.170
In particular, you may have
seen some of our suggestions

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.080
around better representing
women in professional roles.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.288
So thank you for all the
support for apps so far.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:06.750
All right, let's wrap up.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:09.370
Android N is the best
version of Android yet.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.950
I have to say that,
but it's actually true.

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:14.410
We made it faster
and more performance,

01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:16.870
with the powerful new JIT
compiler and Vulkan 3D

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:17.810
graphics.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:20.510
We're continuing to
harden our security

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:23.510
and provide the first truly
seamless software update

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:24.555
system for mobile.

01:19:24.555 --> 01:19:27.300
And we're making
users more productive,

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.230
with better multitasking,
brand-new Multi Windows

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:33.020
support, and improved
notifications.

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.580
In fact, there are over
250 major new features

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.340
in N, everything from
Java 8 language support,

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.520
[INAUDIBLE] to Data Saver,
setting suggestions,

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.080
and much, much more.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.660
You can check out the What's
New in Android session

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.829
later today to learn even more.

01:19:49.829 --> 01:19:52.120
We're still putting the final
touches on the N release,

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.930
and we expect to launch
it later this summer.

01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:56.587
But if you can't
wait until then,

01:19:56.587 --> 01:19:58.170
I'm happy today to
announce that we're

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:00.290
publishing our first
beta quality release

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:03.625
candidate for you to try out
on your main phone or tablet.

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:12.170
Opt in to the new beta program
at www.android.com/beta and run

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:18.040
N on your Nexus 6, 9, 5x, 6P,
Nexus Player, and Pixel C. Now,

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.300
there's one more area in N that
we've been working hard on that

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.080
we haven't talked about yet.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.140
And to tell you more
about what it is

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.550
and how it fits into
our bigger plans,

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:29.500
let me invite up Clay Bavor.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.050
Thank you.

01:20:38.798 --> 01:20:40.450
CLAY BAVOR: Thank you, Dave.

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:41.610
I'm Clay Bavor.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:44.650
And I lead the virtual
reality team at Google.

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:48.640
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.980
And just to get right
to it, virtual reality

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:55.420
is coming to
Android N. So it all

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:59.640
actually started at a Google I/O
two years ago with Cardboard.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.360
And since then, Cardboard
has done some pretty amazing

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.170
things.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:05.340
There are millions of them
out there in the world,

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.260
in all shapes and sizes.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.230
We've enabled
thousands of developers

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:11.500
to build their first VR app.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:16.747
And users have installed over 50
million Cardboard-enabled apps.

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:19.080
We think that's pretty good
for what is, after all, just

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.780
a piece of cardboard.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.240
Now, we love Cardboard.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.820
And for us, it represents
so much of what

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.160
we think VR should be about.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.570
It should be mobile.

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:29.900
It should be approachable.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.920
It should be for everyone.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.270
But we knew it was just
a start, because there's

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:38.080
a limit to how much you can do,
how immersive an experience you

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.790
can create with some Cardboard
and with phones that were

01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:43.580
really only meant to be phones.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.130
We wanted to create
something that

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:47.120
has the best attributes
of Cardboard,

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.800
but which is also comfortable,
richly interactive, and far

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.360
more immersive.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.280
But to create that
kind of immersion,

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.690
you have to solve-- to make your
brain say, yep, I'm somewhere

01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:59.950
else, you have to solve a
lot of really hard problems

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:02.614
across all parts of
the VR experience.

01:22:02.614 --> 01:22:04.030
You have to design
a system that's

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:07.540
capable of rendering at very
high frame rate and resolution.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.360
To make the experience
really comfortable,

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.310
you have to minimize
what's called motion

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:12.690
to photon latency.

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:14.870
That's the delay between
when you move your head

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:18.020
and when the picture updates
to reflect that motion.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.710
And you need to solve for how
you interact with things in VR.

01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:23.360
And when you nail
those things, it just

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.570
feels like you're there.

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:28.440
Well, we've been working
on these problems and more.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.850
And what we've built won't
be available until this fall.

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:34.710
But we'd like to
introduce you to it today.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.710
We call it Daydream.

01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:40.140
Daydream is our platform
for high quality

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.430
mobile virtual reality.

01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:43.310
And in it are all
of the ingredients

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:47.190
you need to create incredible,
immersive VR experiences.

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:49.940
Now, over time, Daydream
will encompass VR devices

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.710
in many shapes and sizes.

01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:55.130
But today is about how Daydream
will enable high quality

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:57.850
VR on Android smartphones.

01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.060
And there are three parts
to it-- the smartphones

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:04.190
themselves, including VR
optimizations to Android N,

01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:07.540
a reference design for a
headset and a controller,

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.670
and apps, both how you get
them, through Google Play,

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:12.500
and the apps themselves.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.150
We've designed and built
each part in concert

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:17.850
with the others, with a
focus on getting the end

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:20.440
to end user
experience just right.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.100
So let's start with smartphones.

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.700
Now, the first thing
we did was look

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.400
at what it takes to
build a smartphone that's

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.770
great at being a
smartphone but also

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.490
at being the core
of a VR system.

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:33.680
And with input from
the major silicon

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.570
vendors and smartphone
manufacturers,

01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:38.940
we've created a set of
phone specifications for VR.

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.810
We call phones that meet
these specs Daydream-ready

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:45.220
The specs include things
like high performance sensors

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.980
for accurate head tracking,
displays with a fast response

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.220
time to minimize blur and
powerful mobile processors.

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.700
And if a phone
meets these specs,

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.510
it'll be capable of delivering
a great VR experience.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.070
But the smartphone itself--
it's only part of the story.

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.230
The operating system,
the software--

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:06.230
it needs to be able to make
use of all these capabilities,

01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:10.010
all while keeping latency
to an absolute minimum.

01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:13.260
So we've introduced what
we call VR Mode as part

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.430
of Android N. We've worked at
all levels of the Android stack

01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:19.320
to optimize it for VR.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.700
We've focused in particular on
performance and latency, which

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.880
we brought down to
under 20 milliseconds.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.430
By adding things like single
buffer rendering and VR system

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:33.910
UI, so notifications and alerts
come through properly in VR.

01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:36.470
And all of this makes for
a really comfortable VR

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:39.360
experience that we think
users are going to love.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.850
Now, it's important--
these improvements are

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:46.070
part of the core of Android
N, so the entire ecosystem

01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.980
can benefit.

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.650
What that means
for developers is,

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:52.440
there are going to be a lot
of Daydream-ready phones.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:57.850
In fact, Samsung, Alcatel,
Asus, Huawei, HTC, LG, Xiaomi,

01:24:57.850 --> 01:25:00.550
and ZTE-- all will
have smartphones

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:02.650
that are compatible with
the Daydream-ready spec,

01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.622
and several will be
available this fall.

01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:12.900
So that's phones, with
Daydream-ready phone specs

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:16.550
and the VR optimizations as
part of Android N. Let's turn

01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:17.940
to headsets.

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:21.350
Now, this is obvious, but a
VR headset, it's something

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:24.200
that you wear on your head.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.340
And because it's
something that you wear,

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.680
there's so many things you
need to get just right.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.740
It has to have great optics.

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:31.840
Has to be comfortable.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.850
The materials need
to feel good, and it

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:37.260
needs to be really easy
to put on and take off.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.660
We've taken what we've
learned in all of these areas

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.350
and we've created
a reference design

01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.680
for headsets that
will work seamlessly

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.880
with Daydream-ready phones.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.767
We're sharing this design with
partners across the ecosystem.

01:25:48.767 --> 01:25:50.350
And there'll be
several of them coming

01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:54.600
to market with the first
available this fall.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.120
Now, when it comes to VR,
everyone thinks about headsets.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.220
But the controller, how
you interact with VR,

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.176
it's just as important.

01:26:03.176 --> 01:26:04.800
We wanted to create
a Controller that's

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.921
optimized for VR that's
both powerful and intuitive.

01:26:08.921 --> 01:26:11.045
So we've been working on
a controller for Daydream.

01:26:11.045 --> 01:26:12.900
It looks like this.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.020
And if we actually
zoom in a little bit,

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.480
you can see the
controller itself.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.180
It's very simple.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:20.410
There are a few buttons
and a clickable touchpad,

01:26:20.410 --> 01:26:22.490
so you can scroll and swipe.

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:25.790
But hidden inside the
controller is the magic.

01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:28.550
We built an orientation
sensor so it knows where it's

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.340
pointing, how it's turning.

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.662
You can do some pretty
awesome things with it.

01:26:32.662 --> 01:26:34.446
Let's have a look.

01:26:34.446 --> 01:26:37.280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.992
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:28.310
[END PLAYBACK]

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.280
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.840
As you can see, the
controller is super flexible.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.140
And the developers we've shared
it with absolutely love it.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.810
Now the controller too will be
part of the reference design

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:42.200
that we're sharing
with partners,

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.020
with the first
available this fall.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.890
So we've talked
about smartphones

01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:49.480
and operating systems,
headsets and controllers.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.310
But ultimately, that's
not what VR is about.

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:54.640
It's about what
you can experience.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.230
So let's turn to apps,
what you can do in VR.

01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:59.850
Now first, if
you're a developer,

01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:02.700
you know that there's a
lot upstream from someone

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.430
using your app or
playing your game.

01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:06.300
Users have to find
it in a store,

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.740
buy it, install it, launch it.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.930
This will all work
seamlessly in Daydream.

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:15.770
And that's because we've
built Google Play for VR.

01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:19.120
Users will be able to browse
and search and buy and install

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.230
VR apps in VR.

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.660
And once you've
installed an app,

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.360
you can keep coming
back to it from what

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.800
we call Daydream
Home, which gives you

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.910
access to all of your
favorite games and apps.

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:31.800
Let's actually talk
about some of those apps,

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.102
the things you can do and
the places you can go.

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:37.310
Our partners, like the "New
York Times" and the "Wall

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:39.860
Street Journal" and CNN
are bringing their VR apps

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.360
to Daydream.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.110
So you'll be able to
experience the world's news

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.110
like you're actually there.

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:49.560
Hulu, Netflix, HBO, even iMacs
are bringing their libraries

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:50.100
to Daydream.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.490
So you'll be able to
watch shows and movies

01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:55.490
in a virtual cinema or
an immersive 3D film

01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.360
in a virtual IMAX theater.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.220
Here's a shot from just one
of the dozens of IMAX films

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.430
that will be available.

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:03.010
And I don't know
about you, but I

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:07.240
am pretty fired up about hanging
out with astronauts in VR.

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.120
So something else that's going
to be awesome in Daydream

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.240
is games.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.300
We've been working with the
likes of Ubisoft and CCP,

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.260
NetEase, and Electronic Arts.

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.350
And these amazing
developers are creating

01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:20.970
games that take advantage of
all that we've talked about.

01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:25.090
And there are some really
neat things in the works.

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:28.800
We've also been working
on some of our own apps.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.260
Google Play Movies is
coming to Daydream,

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:35.120
complete with high
definition, DRM video support.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.440
That means you'll be able
to watch movies and TV

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.760
shows from play, but in
a virtual movie theater.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.520
Street View is
coming to Daydream,

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.950
so you'll be able to walk
the streets of the world

01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:47.820
without having to
fly around the world.

01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.400
And Google Photos will
support VR photos,

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:54.470
so you can step inside and
relive favorite moments.

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:57.410
And there's one more-- YouTube.

01:29:57.410 --> 01:30:01.900
We've rebuilt YouTube
from the ground up for VR.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.900
In it is voice
search, discovery,

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.850
your favorite playlists,
again all in VR.

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:10.980
We've added spatial audio,
improved VR video streaming.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.620
So you'll be able to step
inside the world's largest

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.740
collection of VR videos and
experience places and concerts

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.410
and events like
you're actually there.

01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:21.550
And by the way, you'll
also be able to watch

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:24.750
every single standard
video currently on YouTube,

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.200
but in a very different way.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.850
And we think people
are going to love it.

01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:30.600
So that's Daydream--
our platform

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.940
for high quality
mobile virtual reality,

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.200
Daydream-ready smartphones
with VR optimizations as part

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.490
of Android N, a
comfortable headset,

01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:41.910
and a powerful,
intuitive controller,

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.820
and some amazing
apps and experiences,

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.990
all designed in concert and open
and at the scale of Android.

01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:52.160
Now, Daydream arrives this fall.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.740
But you can get started
developing for it today

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.480
with the latest Android
developer preview.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:01.840
And we'll go to that in more
tomorrow here at 9:00 AM.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.760
So that's it for VR and Android.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.560
To tell you about
wearables in Android,

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.480
I'd like to turn it
over to David Singleton.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.080
Thanks.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.318
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:31:16.282 --> 01:31:18.720
DAVID SINGLETON: Thanks, Clay.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.240
We launched Android Wear
at I/O two years ago.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.150
And since then, we've
partnered with 12 brands

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:28.940
to pair distinctive
styles with the latest

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.950
in wearable technology.

01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:34.060
And the result is an
impressive collection

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:37.780
of over 100 different,
beautiful designs.

01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:41.640
So whether you admire
the heritage of Tag Heuer

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.340
or the iconic design
of Michael Kors,

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:48.150
spend your time hiking a
trail, or riding a wave,

01:31:48.150 --> 01:31:50.340
you can wear what you want.

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.980
And Android Wear works
with Android and iPhones.

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:56.976
Because no matter what phone
you carry in your pocket,

01:31:56.976 --> 01:31:58.350
you should always
be able to wear

01:31:58.350 --> 01:32:00.610
what you want on your wrist.

01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:06.070
And today, I'm sharing a preview
of our biggest platform update

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:09.360
yet-- Android Wear 2.0.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:13.095
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.720
Over the past two
years, we've learned

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:22.090
a lot about what people want
and don't want from a watch.

01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:25.260
We know that the most
important role of your watch

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.200
is helping you stay
connected to what

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.320
matters, to important,
timely information,

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.660
to the people you love,
and to your health, all

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:36.360
from your wrist.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.600
And that's why we're
evolving the platform

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.110
to build even better experiences
for the watch face, messaging,

01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:45.600
and fitness.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.740
Android Wear already
has thousands of watch

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.650
faces you can download.

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:52.400
And now we're making
them even more useful

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.740
by letting any watch face
show data from any app.

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:59.010
So now you can mix
and match the styles

01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:03.240
you love with the information
that's most useful to you.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.270
Let's take a look.

01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:05.930
Jeff [INAUDIBLE]
from the wear team

01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:08.850
has the newest LG
watch with LTE.

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:12.200
And here, you can see a
watch face from Zuhanden.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.940
Jeff has customized it
with his calorie content

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:19.490
from Life Sum, stock information
from Robin Hood, and his tasks

01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:21.120
from To Do It.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.340
If he wants to see
other tasks for today,

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.590
he simply tabs right
there on the watch face

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:28.720
and sees a reminder to call Mom.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.470
And watches are uniquely suited
to connect us to those people

01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:33.580
we love.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.810
You'll never miss a call
from your child's school

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:38.480
or a message from
a close friend.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.930
And that's why we're redesigning
key experiences on the watch

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:44.610
to be even more
intuitive and enabling

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:49.600
new ways to respond to messages
designed just for your wrist.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.740
This includes smart
reply, that knows

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.200
the context of your message,
best in class handwriting

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.880
recognition, and a new keyboard,
all powered by Google's machine

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.100
learning.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.800
And here's what it
looks like when Jeff

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.900
gets a message from a friend.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.450
He taps to reply, chooses
handwriting input,

01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:10.100
and now he uses his
finger to sketch

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.980
big letters on the watch.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.400
The text is recognized
automatically

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.200
and now she knows,
with one more go,

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.452
she knows that he'll
be there at 3 PM.

01:34:21.452 --> 01:34:25.396
[APPLAUSE]

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.060
Many of you want your watch
to be like a personal coach,

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:35.400
helping you stay aware,
motivated, and connected

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.270
to your body.

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.380
First, we're improving
the fitness experience

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:44.990
with Google Fit platform's
automatic activity recognition.

01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:50.690
Second, your apps can exchange
data using the Google Fit API.

01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:54.860
So information like calories
consumed in a nutrition app

01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:58.150
can sync with calories
burned in a running app.

01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:00.350
And finally, we're
expanding the ways

01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:03.350
you can enjoy listening to
music while you work out,

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:06.360
even when you leave
your phone behind.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.280
When you want to
go for a run, you

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.310
can just go with the watch
you're already wearing.

01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:14.480
No need to strap your phone
in an awkward armband.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.110
And thanks to the
hardware sensors

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.410
on your watch and automatic
activity recognition,

01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:22.060
apps like Strava will
start tracking your time

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.270
and distance when
you start running.

01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:26.310
And if you enjoy music
while working out,

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:29.734
you can launch Spotify
right from your watch face.

01:35:29.734 --> 01:35:33.526
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.680
And the best part
of all of this-- you

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.980
don't even need a phone.

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.270
In fact, when Jeff was
showing you the demos,

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:46.246
his phone was turned off.

01:35:46.246 --> 01:35:53.160
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.910
And everything you
saw here today,

01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:57.090
from sending messages
to streaming music,

01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.560
works on just his watch.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.246
With Android Wear 2.0,
apps can be standalone.

01:36:03.246 --> 01:36:04.620
That means the
apps on your watch

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:07.520
can have direct network
access to the cloud

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.440
by a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
or cellular connection.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.310
And that means a fast and
richer on-watch app experience

01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:18.600
for both Android
and iPhone users.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.190
With standalone apps,
watches with cellular support

01:36:21.190 --> 01:36:23.480
become even more powerful.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.980
You'll be able to make calls,
get help from from Google.

01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.240
And use your favorite
apps right on the watch,

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:34.060
no matter where your phone
is or even if it's on or off.

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:36.950
Starting today,
developers can download

01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:39.650
a preview of Android Wear 2.0.

01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:42.740
And everyone will be able to
enjoy these exciting new watch

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.760
experiences in the fall.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.150
It's time for us to re-imagine
what's possible for wearables

01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:52.350
together And we can't wait
to see the incredible things

01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:55.220
that you all build.

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.880
And now, here's one example
from the wider Android developer

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.320
community.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.424
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:37:05.424 --> 01:37:06.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:09.600
-Home is more than just
the place you are in.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.720
It's a feeling.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.110
It was very dangerous
if I will stay in Syria.

01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:18.150
So many Syrians have had
to leave our country.

01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:23.600
We have about 2.5 million
Syrian refugees in Turkey.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.000
Small things that
were easy in Syria

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.360
suddenly become hard
in a foreign land.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.470
I asked myself what I
can do for refugees.

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.150
I know programming.

01:37:34.150 --> 01:37:37.300
[INAUDIBLE] means
[INAUDIBLE] will help Syrians

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.754
navigate a new life in Turkey.

01:37:38.754 --> 01:37:40.170
For example, I
want to rent a car.

01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:42.000
I want to rent a house.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.410
It also helps connect
you with employers,

01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.780
tells you how to
get your children

01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.970
into the schools, anything.

01:37:48.970 --> 01:37:52.610
I love programming, because
it allows me to do anything.

01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:58.050
It seems there is no limit
to what we can accomplish.

01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:00.380
Syria will always
be our country.

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:03.876
But it's possible to make this
new place feel like a home.

01:38:08.358 --> 01:38:09.852
[END PLAYBACK]

01:38:09.852 --> 01:38:12.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:19.380
JASON TITUS: Hi I'm Jason Titus.

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.930
And I lead our developer
product group here at Google.

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:26.010
And as you can see,
software developers

01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:29.700
are changing our
world in a big way.

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.510
In fact, it's hard to find
an aspect of our lives

01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:36.420
that hasn't been touched,
from how we learn,

01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:40.280
to how we get around,
to how we meet people.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.540
You are constantly
finding ways to use

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:47.540
new and emerging technologies
to improve our lives.

01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:49.250
And despite all of
the innovation that

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:51.720
has already occurred,
the opportunities

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.520
ahead are greater still.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.700
But it's really hard
to go from an idea

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:04.545
to building a great product,
to getting in user's hands.

01:39:04.545 --> 01:39:06.170
So I'd like to share
some of the things

01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:08.440
that we've been doing
over the last year

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.600
to make this process
easier on any platform.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.610
Let's start with the web.

01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:20.100
The shift to mobile for the
web platform is well under way.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:23.450
We've recently hit a milestone,
with over a billion people

01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:27.820
using Chrome on
mobile every month.

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:29.970
We've been working on
several initiatives

01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:33.350
to try and make the web work
better on mobile devices.

01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:35.280
I want to talk
about two of them.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.480
First, we've implemented
powerful new web standards

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.280
in Chrome that enable
a new class of website

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.360
to gain app-like behavior,
like working reliably

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.970
on even the worst
networking connection,

01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:52.910
or sending notifications
to reengage users.

01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:56.120
We call websites that use
these features Progressive Web

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.610
Apps, because they get
progressively better, depending

01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:02.190
on the capability
of the web browsers.

01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:04.620
And they can lead to
dramatically better user

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.060
experiences.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.400
Second, we created an
open source project

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.230
called Accelerated
Mobile Pages, or AMP,

01:40:14.230 --> 01:40:18.420
to make it simple to create
extremely fast mobile websites

01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:21.350
using existing web standards.

01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:25.610
On average, AMP pages
loaded four times faster

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:27.850
and use 1/10 as much data.

01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:31.740
These things load
almost instantly.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:35.780
So we're making it easier
to develop mobile websites.

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.150
But we're also investing
in native development.

01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:42.470
We want Android Studio to be
the quickest, most reliable way

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:44.120
to build Android apps.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.002
I'd like to invite Steph
up to tell you more.

01:40:47.002 --> 01:40:48.710
STEPHANIE SAAD
CUTHBERTSON: Thanks Jason.

01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:52.620
I'm Steph.

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.050
I work on the Android team.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:58.130
Android Studio is
our official IDE.

01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:00.420
It's purpose built for Android.

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:03.460
And it was only three years
ago, right here at I/O,

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:06.150
that we showed it
for the first time.

01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:10.710
Since then, it has
built a ton of momentum.

01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:17.090
92% of the top
125 apps and games

01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:21.300
now use Android Studio,
and millions of developers

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:22.880
worldwide.

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.620
Our Android
engineering team sees

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.850
that almost all the
professional developers

01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:28.990
that we connect
with have used it,

01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:31.960
and switched over from
our Eclipse tools.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.690
Your feedback has been
awesome, because it's helped

01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:36.740
us focus on the right things.

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:39.330
We care a lot about
making it great.

01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:41.630
And there's much more to come.

01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:44.080
This morning we'll
release our latest,

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.490
which is Android
Studios 2.2 Preview,

01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:52.750
focusing on speed, smarts,
and Android platform support.

01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:56.110
First speed,
already with 2.1, we

01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:00.570
made building and running
changes 10 times faster

01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:03.960
than it was only six months ago.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.330
Our new Instant Run
feature drove most of this.

01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:09.770
Now, when you hit Run, we
deploy changes directly

01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:11.210
into the running app.

01:42:11.210 --> 01:42:13.240
The emulators are
three times faster.

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:15.890
And push speeds are
even faster than that.

01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:18.120
So all of that
means the emulators

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.550
are now actually faster than the
physical device that's probably

01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:23.630
in your pocket right now.

01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.040
But we want to keep speeding
you up to launch earlier.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.890
One of the things
that you've told us

01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:34.050
is that we could not possibly
make build speeds too fast.

01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:38.350
So with 2.2, we're going to
accelerate build speeds again.

01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:40.400
Plus we know Instant
Run's a long term bet.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.530
So we'll keep
expanding coverage.

01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:44.670
Another thing we want
to do is make it easier

01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:48.090
to write tests to help
drive up app quality.

01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:51.550
So a test recording, now as
you just tap through your app,

01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:54.710
will record, will write all
of your Espresso test code

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:55.690
for you.

01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:57.211
It's basically as if--

01:42:57.211 --> 01:42:59.135
[APPLAUSE]

01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:05.960
It's as if you had
handwritten the code yourself.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.840
And you can run
those tests locally.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.880
Or you can run them with our
IDE integrated Cloud Test Lab,

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.290
to make sure your app runs
well on many Android devices.

01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:17.230
Now one of the things
the engineering team is

01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:19.640
most excited about is
that with 2.2, you're

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.790
going to be able to
build layouts faster.

01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:23.270
And they'll run faster too.

01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:24.650
So let me show you this.

01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:28.930
2.2 includes a rewritten,
feature rich Layout Designer

01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:30.890
with new constraint layouts.

01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:32.370
So what you're
going to see here is

01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:34.036
you'll be able to use
the layout window.

01:43:34.036 --> 01:43:35.700
It's almost like
a sheet of paper.

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:37.170
So you can position
your widgets.

01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:39.290
And once you're
happy, you'll see here

01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:41.500
we save you a ton of
time, because we're

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:45.060
going to automatically add all
the constraints for you, doing

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.300
a bunch of actually very
cool math under the covers.

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:50.290
You'll see the UI here
is now going to adapt.

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.340
So you can try it on
different Android devices.

01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.730
It'll adapt to
different orientations.

01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:57.080
But what you can't see
is behind the scenes,

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.250
your app will run faster too.

01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.360
So many of you here are
professional Android

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.020
developers.

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:04.750
And you know building
rich UI usually

01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:06.570
requires nested layouts.

01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:09.020
And those are hard to
performance tune at times.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:12.610
With constraint layouts,
there is no nesting required.

01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:16.570
So overall, you get the same
rich UI, less work, and better

01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:18.916
performance by default.

01:44:18.916 --> 01:44:20.828
[APPLAUSE]

01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:29.810
Second smarts, we want to help
you write better Android apps.

01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:33.390
The 2.2 Preview includes
a new APK analyzer

01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:36.654
so you can figure out, hey
what's making my app so big.

01:44:36.654 --> 01:44:38.320
This is really useful
for all of you who

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.670
are targeting emerging markets.

01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:41.400
You've talked to us
a lot about this.

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.710
You also asked for
a layout inspector.

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.400
So we have a new
layout inspector in 2.2

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:49.230
so you find out what's
inside your Android layouts.

01:44:49.230 --> 01:44:50.800
When you run code
analysis, you'll

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.180
find a bunch of
new quality checks.

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.580
And that's in addition to the
260 that are already there,

01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:58.620
all designed to
eliminate common classes

01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.510
errors that we see on Android.

01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:03.000
And we integrated
the latest version

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.422
of the wonderful,
IntelliJ IDE 2016.1.

01:45:06.422 --> 01:45:12.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:12.730 --> 01:45:14.230
The third thing I
want to talk about

01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:15.780
is Android platform support.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:18.680
So we developed the IDE
right alongside the platform,

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.680
so we can bring
you the very best.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:24.290
2.2 includes, to name just a
few, support for N's new Jack

01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:26.420
compiler, which is
bringing you wonderful

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.620
Java 8 features like
lambdas, default methods.

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:32.560
And for all you developers who
are working on graphics rich,

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.420
like games and apps, you
know C++ is critical.

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:38.970
And it's because of your request
we've been steadily building

01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:41.090
out C++ support.

01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:44.080
Now we already have C++
editing and debugging.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.460
But in 2.2, you'll find a major
change based on your feedback.

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.760
In addition to
Gradle, for build,

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:55.198
we'll now support
CMake and Indie KBuild.

01:45:55.198 --> 01:45:57.658
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:02.430
And both of those build systems
will work with the debugger.

01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:06.060
And then on top of that, we
made C++ debugging better also.

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.460
So I would really
appreciate it--

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.751
we would really appreciate
it-- if you download and try

01:46:09.751 --> 01:46:12.340
all of this today
and give us feedback.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:14.490
With that, I would love
to pass it back to Jason.

01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:15.682
Thank you very much.

01:46:15.682 --> 01:46:17.626
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:21.801 --> 01:46:23.050
JASON TITUS: Thank you, Steph.

01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:27.300
It's great to see Android
Studio getting so much faster.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.870
And there's one more product
I'd like to talk to you about.

01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:34.400
18 months ago, we
acquired Firebase,

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.760
a great mobile
back-ended service

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:41.460
for storing your apps data and
syncing it across iOS, Android,

01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.886
and the web.

01:46:42.886 --> 01:46:49.780
Since then, its usage has grown
to over 450,000 developers.

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:53.245
We would really admire its
great developer experience.

01:46:53.245 --> 01:46:55.180
And we wanted to figure
out how to bring that

01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:58.250
to other areas of
app development.

01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:01.390
We've been working closely with
companies big and small, all

01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:03.780
over the world,
to explore how we

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:06.610
could make our offering better.

01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:10.510
Today we are announcing the
next generation of Firebase.

01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:11.510
Firebase is--

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:14.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.690
Firebase is now a suite
of integrated products

01:47:21.690 --> 01:47:26.820
to help you build your app, grow
your user base, and earn money.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.940
This is the biggest, most
comprehensive developer update

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.990
we have ever made.

01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:36.550
So at the heart of
the new Firebase

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:40.320
is a mobile analytics tool we've
built from the ground up called

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.720
Firebase Analytics.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.440
It's inspired by
much of the work

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.140
that we've done in the last 10
years with Google Analytics.

01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:54.120
But it's designed specifically
for the unique needs of apps.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.620
It's great for app developers
for a couple of ways.

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.980
First, it gives
you rich insights

01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.872
into what users are
doing inside of your app.

01:48:02.872 --> 01:48:04.330
And it also tells
you where they're

01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:07.990
coming from, with rich
cross-network attribution,

01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:11.310
all of this in a
single dashboard.

01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:14.690
Second, we've
created a new feature

01:48:14.690 --> 01:48:18.030
called Firebase Audiences,
which integrates all of Firebase

01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:19.430
together.

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:22.430
With Firebase Audiences,
you can group users

01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:25.470
based on the criteria
that matters to you most,

01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:30.320
and then take action with
notifications, experiments,

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.100
and even re-engagement
campaigns on AdWords.

01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.050
And the best part,
Firebase Analytics

01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:38.600
works across Android and iOS.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.219
And it is completely
free and unlimited.

01:48:42.219 --> 01:48:44.664
[APPLAUSE]

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:52.680
Surrounding analytics are over
a dozen other major features.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.390
I'm going to cover
some highlights.

01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:58.170
First there's cloud
messaging and notifications,

01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:01.190
which is built on the world's
most popular cloud to device

01:49:01.190 --> 01:49:04.600
messaging platform with
over one million apps,

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.740
sending over 170 billion
messages every day.

01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.280
And now that it's
integrated into Firebase,

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.750
you can send targeted
notifications to your audiences

01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:18.510
without writing any code.

01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:23.991
And like Analytics, it is
completely free and unlimited.

01:49:23.991 --> 01:49:26.446
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.610
Now app quality is
important to all of us.

01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:36.410
If your app crashes,
it's bad for your users.

01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:39.100
And it hurts your business.

01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:42.710
Within Google, teams like
Chrome build and deploy

01:49:42.710 --> 01:49:46.187
across multiple
platforms at scale.

01:49:46.187 --> 01:49:47.770
So we've built on
their infrastructure

01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:50.850
and created Firebase
Crash Reporting.

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:53.950
You can use it to quickly
identify bugs and issues

01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:58.910
and take action to reduce
impact on your users.

01:49:58.910 --> 01:50:01.410
Another aspect of building
a high quality app

01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:05.030
is being able to tune and
experiment with features.

01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:07.040
So we've taken the
same infrastructure

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.740
that we use for our own apps and
created Firebase Remote Config,

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.430
which lets you create
experiments and test app

01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:15.855
configurations at scale.

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:24.500
Finally to help you grow,
we've creating a Dynamic Links.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:27.540
A dynamic link is
just a regular URL

01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:29.800
whose behavior can be
configured depending

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.000
upon where it's tapped.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.540
It persists through the
app install process.

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:38.090
So you can drive installs
while still maintaining

01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:41.800
a superior user experience.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.540
So in this example with
NPR, with dynamic links,

01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:48.515
we were able to take what was
13 taps down to only four.

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:54.790
So as I mentioned, there
are over a dozen features

01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:56.330
of the new Firebase.

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:58.850
And while each of them is
interesting on its own,

01:50:58.850 --> 01:51:03.440
the power of Firebase is in how
they're integrated together.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.500
Here's a quick example.

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.300
First with Crash Reporting,
you can see crashes

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.310
as they're happening.

01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:12.150
Then in Analytics,
you can look at what

01:51:12.150 --> 01:51:14.780
the impact is on your business.

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.900
Once you fix the
crash, you can actually

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:19.080
use Notifications
to reach back out

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.510
and invite users
back into your app,

01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:24.680
or use Remote Config
to offer them a coupon.

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:28.860
And all of this is integrated
into our Google Cloud Platform,

01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.480
so that if you want to do
deeper, more customized

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.740
analysis of your
analytics data, you

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:37.300
could export it to BigQuery,
Google's fully managed,

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.035
petabyte scale data warehouse.

01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:44.210
So I've only
skimmed the surface.

01:51:44.210 --> 01:51:47.030
But we're going to go into
detail later on this afternoon.

01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:49.530
And we have over 30
sessions on Firebase

01:51:49.530 --> 01:51:53.930
throughout I/O. The new
Firebase is available today--

01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:59.500
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.770
--through one easy to install
SDK across Android, iOS,

01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:07.040
and the web.

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.050
Please give it a try.

01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:10.008
We're really interested
to hear what you think.

01:52:10.008 --> 01:52:13.190
And we can't wait to
see what you build next.

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:14.940
And with that, here's
Ellie to give you

01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.360
a preview of a
new Android effort

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.810
that we're working on for you.

01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:19.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:28.690
ELLIE POWERS: Thanks, Jason.

01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:29.630
Hi everybody.

01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:31.600
I'm Ellie from the Android team.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.420
And I'm here with Ficus
Kirkpatrick, our engineering

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:35.670
director.

01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:39.450
We hope that Firebase will make
it a lot easier for all of you

01:52:39.450 --> 01:52:41.180
to build great apps.

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.530
And we're also thinking hard
about how Android app should

01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:46.860
evolve and do more.

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.180
We'll be showing you a
sneak peak of a new project.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.570
We think it's
going to change how

01:52:51.570 --> 01:52:53.730
people experience Android apps.

01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:56.640
And we'll be bringing it to
Android users and developers

01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.580
over the next year.

01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:00.310
Developers like all
of you here have

01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:02.360
built amazing Android apps.

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.150
They unleash the full
power of Android devices,

01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:09.180
seamlessly combining the camera,
sensors, smooth animations,

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.310
and more.

01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:11.760
But you've really
told us that you

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.260
want to be able to bring users
into your apps more quickly.

01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.170
We want to make it easier
for users and developers

01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:20.460
to connect.

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.160
For users to access a
wider range of apps,

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.790
and for developers
to reach more people.

01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:30.080
With the web, you could just
click on a link and land

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.390
on a web page.

01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:34.180
That's one click,
and a few seconds.

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:38.690
What if you could run
any app with one tap?

01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:40.490
That's what we're working on.

01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:44.500
We're evolving Android
apps to run instantly,

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.780
without installation.

01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.680
We call this Android
Instant Apps.

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.620
[APPLAUSE]

01:53:59.791 --> 01:54:01.290
We're going to share
a quick preview

01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:02.640
of what we've been working on.

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.600
And I can't tell
you how much I've

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:08.230
been looking forward to this
moment for a really long time.

01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:11.180
So let's say my friend
Michael sends me this link

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.470
to Tasty on Buzzfeed Video.

01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:15.410
And let's be completely
clear-- let's

01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:18.680
be honest with each other-- I
do not have the Buzzfeed video

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.260
app installed on my phone.

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:25.480
So what we're going to do is
we're going to tap the URL

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.010
and it's going to take me right
into Buzzfeed Videos Android

01:54:29.010 --> 01:54:33.150
app, without installing it.

01:54:33.150 --> 01:54:37.340
Ficus, go.

01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:39.080
What's happening
here is Google Play

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.340
is fetching only the pieces of
the app that we need right now.

01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:44.716
There.

01:54:44.716 --> 01:54:54.380
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:56.750
We are in the Android app.

01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:59.030
And I didn't even
have to install it.

01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:00.980
It was pretty fast too, right?

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:03.950
So here you can see there's
a bunch of different videos,

01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:06.490
showing to make a whole
bunch of different recipes.

01:55:06.490 --> 01:55:09.100
And the videos start
playing automatically.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.830
Remember it's a
real Android app.

01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:16.440
And I can just swipe and go to
the next video really quickly.

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.900
The app was able to open
so fast, because it's

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.290
been split up into modules.

01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:23.640
When Ficus tapped
the link, Google Play

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.680
downloaded only the code
that was necessary to display

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:28.310
this screen.

01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:31.270
And if I want to keep Buzzfeed
Video on my home screen,

01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:36.100
it's simple to install
the app right here.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:38.010
Here's another example.

01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:41.270
BNH Photo and Video has
a beautiful Android app.

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:43.940
But I don't have it on
my phone, because I don't

01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:45.930
shop for cameras every day.

01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:48.200
Now if I'm searching
for something specific,

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:52.770
like a camera bag, I can still
get that same experience.

01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:58.750
With one tap, the app opens up
right to the bag I want to buy.

01:55:58.750 --> 01:56:02.040
Technically this is a deep
link to the Android activity

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.960
BNH wrote to display
this product page.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.700
And that's all Google
Play needed to download.

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.500
I can also swipe here and see
more details about the bag.

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:14.420
Now when I add it to my
cart, the animation there--

01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:15.910
it was pretty slick.

01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:18.250
And at check-out
time, Android Pay

01:56:18.250 --> 01:56:21.570
works just like if I
had the app installed.

01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:24.120
I don't have to pull out my
credit card or type in my name

01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.070
and address.

01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:27.970
With Android Instant apps,
I'm already signed in.

01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:29.450
And I'm ready to pay.

01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:32.315
And so it's going to take me
two taps, not two minutes.

01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:37.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:56:43.257 --> 01:56:45.590
Finally let's see how Android
Instant apps could help me

01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:47.390
when I'm out and about.

01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.010
So I walk up to a parking meter.

01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:50.300
And I need to pay.

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.420
I'm in a real hurry today.

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.980
And I don't have time to
install a parking app.

01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.110
But what if I could
just tap my phone,

01:56:56.110 --> 01:57:00.410
and with NFC, it could bring
up the parking app immediately?

01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:03.510
All I have to do is choose
how long I want to park.

01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:04.990
I'm already done.

01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:07.770
And now Ficus can run off
the stage to his meeting

01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:13.040
and even add more parking time
later if he really needs to.

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.030
So that's Android Instant apps.

01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:18.740
As a user, it's
totally seamless,

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:22.690
from launching the app, to
signing in, to making payments.

01:57:22.690 --> 01:57:26.280
Now as a developer, you'll
update your existing app.

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.440
It's the same Android
API, the same project,

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.980
and the same source code.

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.040
And it can take less
than a day of work,

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.130
depending on how
your app is built.

01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:36.710
You'll modularize your app.

01:57:36.710 --> 01:57:38.790
And Google Play will
download only the parts

01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:42.250
that are needed on the
fly, as we saw here.

01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:43.960
We're really excited
to give developers

01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:47.410
more ways to get their apps
into the hands of users.

01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:49.720
In addition to discovering
your apps in the Play store

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.860
and installing
them, Instant apps

01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:53.890
will provide another on ramp.

01:57:53.890 --> 01:57:56.050
People can use your
Instant app directly.

01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:59.360
And as we showed earlier,
if they want to install it,

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:01.000
that's easy too.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.780
Most importantly, you
will be in control

01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.200
of the experiences you build.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.200
And when you do you
make the update,

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:14.580
your app will be just one tap
away for over a billion people.

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.980
Oh yeah, I almost forgot
to mention one really

01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:17.790
important detail.

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:20.280
So this demo that
Ficus did, he actually

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:23.334
did that on a phone
running Kit Kat.

01:58:23.334 --> 01:58:25.769
[APPLAUSE]

01:58:33.014 --> 01:58:35.430
You should know the Instant
apps is going to be compatible

01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:37.810
all the way back to Jelly Bean.

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:40.666
And we really want for all of
you to be able to try this.

01:58:40.666 --> 01:58:42.790
And we're really going to
make it available to you,

01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:44.790
just as soon as we can.

01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:47.190
But it's a big change in
how we think about apps.

01:58:47.190 --> 01:58:48.730
We want to get it right.

01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:51.320
And so that's going to
take some time for us.

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:53.460
We're working now with a
small set of developers.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:57.170
And we'll be gradually rolling
out access and actually rolling

01:58:57.170 --> 01:59:00.300
out Instant apps to
users later this year.

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.560
We are so excited about
all of the opportunities

01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.910
that this will open up.

01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:08.160
And we can't wait to see
what you are going to build,

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.050
when your app is
just a tap away.

01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:14.206
And with that, I'll
hand it back to Sundar.

01:59:14.206 --> 01:59:16.626
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:24.120
SUNDAR PICHAI: Thank
you, Jason and Ellie.

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:26.790
Firebase is the most
comprehensive developer

01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:29.080
offering we have done to date.

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.650
I'm glad it's available
today, and look forward

01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:33.730
to hearing your feedback.

01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:37.110
We talked a lot today about
machine learning and AI.

01:59:37.110 --> 01:59:41.120
We think there's an opportunity
to accelerate computing,

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:44.550
by working on this
with everyone else.

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:47.400
And so we are trying
to do that in two ways.

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:52.100
First, we are opening up core
components of our machine

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.690
learning systems.

01:59:53.690 --> 01:59:57.190
Last year, we open
sourced TensorFlow,

01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:00.730
so that developers can
embed machine learning

02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:04.370
and deep neural nets
with a single API.

02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:08.770
In 2015, it was the most
forked project on GitHub.

02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:12.650
And it is the number one machine
learning project on that side.

02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:17.670
Last week, we open sourced
a natural language parser,

02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:20.270
which is also built
on top of TensorFlow.

02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:21.770
We are doing these
things so that we

02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:24.320
can engage the
external community

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:28.300
and work on this
together with everyone.

02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:32.020
Second, for developers
and companies out there,

02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:35.690
we are also exposing our
machine learning capabilities

02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:38.160
through our Google
Cloud platform.

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.950
We already have a cloud machine
learning platform under way.

02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:46.030
And you get access to computer
vision, speech, language,

02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:48.030
and translation APIs.

02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:51.380
And we are working on bringing
many more machine learning

02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:55.530
APIs, so that you can get access
to the same great capabilities

02:00:55.530 --> 02:00:57.861
we have inside at Google.

02:00:57.861 --> 02:00:59.610
We believe this will
be one of the biggest

02:00:59.610 --> 02:01:03.300
differentiators for the Google
Cloud platform over time.

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:06.120
And by the way, when you use
Google Cloud platform, you

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:09.690
not only get access to the great
software we use internally,

02:01:09.690 --> 02:01:15.260
you get access to specialized
hardware we build internally.

02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.990
And talking about that
from machine learning,

02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:22.000
the scale at which we need to
do computing is incredible.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.510
And so we've started building
specialized custom hardware.

02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:31.740
We call these Tensor
Processing Units, or TPUs.

02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:35.940
TPUs deliver an order of
magnitude higher performance

02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:40.690
per watt then all commercially
available GPUs and FPGAs.

02:01:40.690 --> 02:01:44.020
And when you use the
Google Cloud platform,

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:47.820
you can take advantage
of TPUs as well.

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:51.880
TPUs are what powered
AlphaGo, Deep Mind's AlphaGo,

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:54.730
in its game against Lee Sedol.

02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:57.720
Go is an ancient
Chinese board game.

02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.690
It has a simple 19 by 19 grid.

02:02:00.690 --> 02:02:02.560
But it is one of the
most complex games

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:04.670
humans have ever designed.

02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:08.120
It has more possible board
configurations, many more

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.290
possible more
configurations, then

02:02:10.290 --> 02:02:13.010
there are atoms in the universe.

02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:15.710
Beating Go, for
computers, was widely

02:02:15.710 --> 02:02:18.190
considered to be the
grand challenge for AI.

02:02:18.190 --> 02:02:20.190
And most people thought
it wouldn't happen

02:02:20.190 --> 02:02:22.140
for another decade or so.

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.510
So we are really
thrilled that AlphaGo

02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:27.640
was able to achieve
this milestone recently.

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.420
One thing worth calling
out, in the second game,

02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:34.190
there was a move 37 by AlphaGo.

02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:36.490
It changed the
course of the game,

02:02:36.490 --> 02:02:39.590
and is now widely considered one
of the most beautiful Go moves

02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:41.680
ever seen in tournament play.

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:46.610
It was not just an intuitive
move but a very creative move.

02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:48.610
We normally don't
associate computers

02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:50.840
with making creative choices.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:56.970
And so to us, this represents a
significant achievement in AI.

02:02:56.970 --> 02:03:00.250
By the way, Lee Sedol
has won every single game

02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:02.190
since he played against AlphaGo.

02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:04.830
And he has even replayed
some of the moves he learned

02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:07.270
from AlphaGo in that game.

02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:08.860
As the state of the
art capabilities

02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:12.320
in machine learning
and AI progress,

02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:14.980
we see them becoming
very versatile.

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.390
And we think it applies
to a wide range of fields.

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:20.640
I want to give you two examples.

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:22.330
First robotics.

02:03:22.330 --> 02:03:26.350
At Google, a bunch
of 20% decided

02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:29.740
to help robots-- trained
robots to pick up objects.

02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:31.300
You can see it behind me.

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:32.290
This is not new.

02:03:32.290 --> 02:03:34.680
You usually do it by
writing control system code.

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:38.020
You program the
robots with rules.

02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:42.150
But this time, they decide to
use deep learning techniques.

02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:45.430
So you create a
continuous feedback cycle

02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:48.650
so that the robots can
learn hand eye coordination

02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:51.460
by themselves,
using deep learning.

02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.110
As you can see
they keep doing it.

02:03:53.110 --> 02:03:55.670
And they keep learning
it over and over again.

02:03:55.670 --> 02:03:58.580
And over time, they get better.

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.000
And they even learn natural
and useful behaviors.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.810
So for example, the robot
is nudging the stapler away

02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:08.310
to pick up that yellow objects.

02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:09.990
We didn't write that rule.

02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:13.040
The robot learnt it
automatically using deep

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:13.920
learning.

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.566
So it's an amazing example of
what machine learning can do.

02:04:16.566 --> 02:04:18.542
[APPLAUSE]

02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:25.980
Another example in healthcare,
diabetic retinopathy

02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:29.310
is the fastest growing
cost of blindness.

02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:32.430
It affects 4.2 million
people in the US,

02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:34.360
and many more worldwide.

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.830
To detect it, you need
to do a scan of guy

02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:39.490
the eye like you see behind me.

02:04:39.490 --> 02:04:42.820
And a highly trained
doctor can detect it.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:46.610
If detected early, the
treatments are effective.

02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:50.710
If detected late, it causes
irreversible blindness.

02:04:50.710 --> 02:04:52.640
And it's very, very
difficult to have

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:56.500
highly trained doctors available
in many parts of the world.

02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:59.580
So we set out to work with
a small team of engineers

02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:03.210
and doctors, and again
use deep learning,

02:05:03.210 --> 02:05:05.940
and started training
on eye scans.

02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:09.300
And over time, our
computer vision systems

02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:12.740
have gotten really good at
detecting diabetic retinopathy

02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:13.700
early.

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:14.790
This is still early.

02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:16.560
And there's a long road ahead.

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:18.590
And we'll work with
the medical community

02:05:18.590 --> 02:05:21.940
to get it in the hands of
as many people as possible.

02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:24.050
But you can see
the promise again

02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:26.570
of using machine learning.

02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:29.360
When I hear about
advancements like these,

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.050
I'm reminded that we live
in an extraordinary period

02:05:32.050 --> 02:05:33.800
for computing.

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:36.820
Weather climate
change, healthcare,

02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:40.480
or education, the most
important struggles

02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:44.670
already have thousands of
brilliant and dedicated people

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:49.090
working to make progress on
issues that affect everyone.

02:05:49.090 --> 02:05:52.900
Now consider what the best
climate change researchers,

02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:57.620
doctors, or educators, can
do with the power of machine

02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:00.070
learning assisting them.

02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:02.540
As you have seen
today, I'm incredibly

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:04.930
excited about the progress
that we are making

02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:07.640
with machine learning and AI.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:11.630
We believe that the real
test is whether humans

02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:17.520
can achieve a lot more with the
support of AI assisting them.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:21.640
Things previously thought to
be impossible may in fact be

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:22.900
possible.

02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:26.390
We look forward to building
this future together

02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:27.420
with all of you.

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:30.835
Thank you for joining
us at Google I/O.

02:06:30.835 --> 02:06:35.396
