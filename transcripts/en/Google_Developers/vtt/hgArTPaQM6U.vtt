PAUL SAXMAN: Hello, everyone,
and welcome to Google Maps

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.530
Developers Live.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm Paul Saxman.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.480
And with me this week
is Mano Marks.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.630
As you probably know, Google
is committed to bringing

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.930
Google Maps and Maps
applications to as many

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.120
different platforms
as possible.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.790
So today we're really excited
to talk about the release of

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.790
the latest version of the
Google Maps SDK for iOS,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.490
version 1.1.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.090
We can also announce that keys
are available to everyone

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.460
through the Google
API's console.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.710
MANO MARKS: We're going to take
a look at some of the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
features of the SDK and how you
can get started with them.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.450
We'll be demoing from
an app that actually

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.640
comes with the SDK.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.710
So once you have the key, you
can put that in the app and

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.840
test it for yourself.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.920
First and foremost, you see
that you get access to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.590
Google's base map, with the same
street map data you get

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.180
on the Android and JavaScript
Maps APIs.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.660
You also get access to our train
and satellite imagery,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.910
the largest and most
comprehensive collection of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.599
imagery in the world.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.860
And we're constantly updating
and improving our data without

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.810
you having to make any updates
or changes to your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.360
application.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.130
There are some other interesting
features here.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.212
For instance, you get markers
with info windows.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.050
We're going to switch over to
the marker sample application.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.930
Here you see the basic Google
Map with a marker on it.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.450
You can do smooth zooming and
panning with gestures.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.300
And because our maps on iOS are
vector based, you can also

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.950
rotate and tilt the map.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.960
Also, you can tailor the content
of the info windows.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.310
Now we're going to check
out the camera sample.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.770
You can programmatically
zoom and tilt the map.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.530
And you can see 3D buildings
come into view, nicely rising

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.780
out of the map.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
Looking over at the ground
overlays demo, you can get

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.460
these ground overlays, which
are images you can place on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.470
top of the map.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.190
And they can be anything from
your own imagery to copies of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.800
old maps to pictures
of flags or logos.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.270
Here we're rotating this Google
logo to show you how to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.430
do rotation in your app.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.960
PAUL SAXMAN: There's a lot more
in the SDK that you get

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.920
access to, such as polylines
and traffic information.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.450
And since it's a Google Map,
you can overlay data on it

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.170
from any of the Google Maps
web services, such as the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.390
Places API or Directions API.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.100
When you're ready to
check it out, visit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.310
developers.google.com/maps,
register for an API key at the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.530
Google API console.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770
And if you have any questions,
head over to Stack Overflow

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.490
for quick answers.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.420
MANO MARKS: Thanks
for joining us.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.670
And see you next week.
