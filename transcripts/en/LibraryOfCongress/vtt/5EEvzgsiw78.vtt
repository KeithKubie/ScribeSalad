&gt;&gt; BARD Express: Tips and Tricks

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.270
&gt;&gt; Judy: Hi, I'm Judy Dixon,
Consumer Relations Officer at NLS.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.020
In this edition of the
BARD Express How-To Series,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.900
I'm going to cover tips and
tricks for using the software.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.940
Help pages are available
for each screen.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.930
Press F1 from the screen
to access its help page.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.160
If you are using BARD
Express with a screen reader,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.820
virtually all of the functions of
the software, including searching,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.560
browsing, downloading, and copying
can be executed using hot keys.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.020 position:56%
Refer to the help pages for details.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.270
Low-vision users can adjust the
font size using the View menu.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.200
Select Font Size Larger
up to four times

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.670
until you reach the
desired font size.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.310
BARD Express allows you
to customize the types

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.520
of information displayed
in any list of titles.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.200
Access a book list from any
of the browse or list options.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.150
After the titles load, use the hot
key Alt+V to access the view menu.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.500
Select Column Configuration
from the view menu.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.680
A dialog box containing a list
of the column headings will open.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.860
The information categories are
type-which is book or magazine,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.480
title, author, subject, annotation,
narrator, series, reading time,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.380
file size, and BARD
ID-which is the book number.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.350
Check the box associated with the
information you want displayed

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.720
for each title.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.560
This feature may be useful if you
have several books on a cartridge

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.390
and limited space, you can
choose titles based on file size

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.940
or if you are browsing
the Recently Added Books

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.230
and Magazines list you can
quickly distinguish between books

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.120
and magazines in the list.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.710
One last trick with BARD Express
is to access all the books

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.840
by a single author or all
the books in a single series

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.160
through the book details screen.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.100
For example I am going to access
the book details of Kill Switch:

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.620 position:56%
A Joe Ledger novel from the Recently
Added Books and Magazines list.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.520 position:56%
On this screen both the author's
name and the series title are links.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.020
By selecting the link Joe Ledger
Novel I can access all the books

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.120
available on BARD in this series.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
By selecting the link
Maberry, Jonathan,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.120
I can access all the books
available on BARD by this author.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.420

transferring books, searching BARD,
