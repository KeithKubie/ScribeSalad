00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.330
Hello and welcome to Monthly Mailbag where
we answer science questions

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.850
that you, our wonderful audience, send in.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.580
Sometimes we tackle the mysteries of the universe,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.309
and sometimes we talk about blind birds.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.050
But this time we're sticking a little bit
closer to home.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.150
I've been particularly excited for this episode,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.600
because it combines some of my favourite things:
physics, mysteries, and showers.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.100
This month we are answering Twitter follower
David's question:

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.560
"Why does the shower curtain billow inwards
when you turn on the shower?"

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.350
It's a great question, David. For those lucky
enough to have glass showers,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:37.000
who may be unfamiliar with this effect, let's
take a little field trip.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.460
Welcome to my shower.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.470
The phenomenon is pretty simple.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.290
You turn on the shower and the shower curtain
kind of attacks you.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.870
Let's see it in action.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.550
Wooh, that's some nice billowing there.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.670
It works best with a powerful stream pointed
downwards.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.340
The simplest explanation is that there's a
chimney effect going on.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.850
That the hot air from the shower is rising
up over the top of the curtain

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
and the cold air in the rest of the room is
sort of coming in from the bottom,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.819
pushing this curtain inwards.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.700
But that can't be right because the water
behind me is actually cold water,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.319
it's how we can get such a powerful stream
by turning both the hot and cold on full blast.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.869
The next explanation is that it's because
of something called the Bernoulli principle.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.859
Which states that fast moving fluids, liquids
or gases,

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.420
have lower pressure than slow moving ones.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.000
When a fluid speeds up, its pressure lowers.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.299
The fast moving water coming out of the shower
head pulls the air around it

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.289
making it move quickly as well.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.869
This fast air has low pressure which sucks
the shower curtain in like a vacuum.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.569
Bernoulli definitely has something to do with
it but it's not the whole picture.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.740
If it was a simple Bernoulli situation, you'd
expect the current

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.969
to get pulled in all along the length of the
water flow, but it doesn't.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.999
It's only the bottom that billows.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:08.360
In 2001 an American engineer named David Schmidt
wanted to get to the bottom of it.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.650
So he enlisted the help of some software.
He simulated a simplified scenario,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.240
without heat, without evaporation or a person
in the shower.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.590
And he found something surprising. A vortex
formed above the spray.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.010
The centre of the vortex, much like the eye
of a storm

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.810
has lower pressure than the rest of the shower.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.260
And it's this vertical vortex that's responsible
for the billowing.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.329
Dr Schmidt won the Ig Nobel Prize, an award
given for

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.230
"achievements that at first make people laugh
and then make people think",

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.360
for this partial solution in 2001.
But that's nearly 17 years ago now

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.819
and I figured computer simulations have come
a long way since then.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.610
So I enlisted the help of engineer Dr Dominic
Flynn at Birmingham City University.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.290
He drew up a model of the shower in CAD and
he fired up the modern version

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.569
of the software used up by David Schmidt in
2001.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.549
And he ran some simulations.

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.319
You can see in this little animation here
the see through box is the shower area.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.409
The solid coloured curtain is the shower curtain.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.590
The water is coming from the circle in the
top right.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.510
Warmer colours represent higher water speeds.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.689
And the colours in the shower curtain represent
displacement,

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.890
how far the shower curtain has moved.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.040
So let's play this simulation.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.720
We can play it again and you can see the movement
at the bottom there.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.890
So we found the same results. Maybe it's helpful
now if you look at the cross section.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.980
It's not the most stable situation in the
world,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.890
but you can see there's definitely a circular
vortex forming.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.939
One big difference between Dominic's simulations
and Dr Schmidt's simulations

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.900
is that Dominic's vortices were quite a bit
lower.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.400
But our shower head was also pointed straight
down in this simulation.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.290
Our simulation is a little bit more complete,
it has heat, but still no person or evaporation

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.579
so were still one step closer but we can't
say we have a full solution.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.709
So let's return to David's question:

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.250
"Why does the shower curtain billow inwards
when you turn on the shower?".

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.829
Shower curtains billow inwards because of
Bernoulli's principle

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.739
but not in a straightforward way.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.650
The fast moving air of a swirling vortex has
low pressure, which pulls the curtain inwards.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.359
The bottom of the curtain is the part that
moves

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.019
because of another key principle of engineering
- the principle of moments.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.709
The part of the lever that moves the most
with a given force

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.030
is the part furthest from the pivot point.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.660
And the pivot here is the curtain rod way
up at the top.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.830
Although it is a flexible material so it gets
a bit more complicated than that.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.900
Now that we know what's going on here are
a few tips that can interfere with the effect.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.300
The pull isn't very strong so you can make
the shower curtain harder to move

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.160
by sewing magnets or weights into the bottom.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.770
Or you can get a curtain made out of a heavier
material.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.430
A curved curtain rod can also interfere with
the effect

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.840
by encouraging the bottom of the curtain to
stick to the tub.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.530
This episode wouldn't have been possible without
the generous time and effort

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.310
given by Dominic Flynn, a fantastic engineer

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.550
who helped us out with these lovely simulations.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.710
I also want to give a shoutout to Dr David
Schmidt who kindly answered

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.040
what must have been the millionth email
about a silly project he did almost two decades

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040
ago.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.870
And this was actually my last episode of Monthly
Mailbag.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.370
I'll be leaving the Ri and heading back to
Canada so I have

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.440
a few other special shoutouts to do before
I go.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.860
I'd like to thank Cassie, Liina and Ed who
decided

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.180
it was a good idea to put me in front of a
camera.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.040
To Ant for taking these videos to the next
level.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.890
And to Sarah and Anand for letting me run
with it.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.440
And really to the whole Ri team for being
so supportive.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.870
And finally, thanks to you, the viewers and
subscribers.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.490
You make all of this possible and worthwhile.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.600
If you want to keep in touch, I'm on Twitter
@farrowjon. See you around.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.630
That reminds me, I think I left the shower
on at home
