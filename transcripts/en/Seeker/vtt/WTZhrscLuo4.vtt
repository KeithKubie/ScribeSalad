00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
Music has charms to soothe a savage beast,
especially if the music is by Insane Clown

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.290
Posse and the beast is a Juggalo.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.890
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears, I’m Jules here for DNews.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.560
Why do we like the music we like?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.960
I’m not talking about genre; there’s no
scientific explanation for why people like

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.900
yodelling, at least not in this episode.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.630
No I mean something more fundamental.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.430
Why do we like the very sounds that make up
all the different genres?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.500
What is it about certain combinations of notes
that strike a chord with us?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.520
Well, for hundreds of years it was thought
that the answer was: physics.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.440
Sound waves from musical notes that are certain
intervals apart interfere with each other,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.180
and depending on the interval the new wave
form they create will have a distinct pattern.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.329
Notes a 5th apart like C to G create a nice
repeating pattern and we call this consonance.1

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.829
But lower that G just a half step to an F
sharp and suddenly the new waveform pattern

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.920
goes crazy: dodging, dipping, diving, ducking
and dodging all over the place.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.280
And this is called dissonance.2

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.159
If a dissonant chord uses two notes that are
close together, like C and C sharp, then the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.990
waveform they generate will be confusing in
your brain.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.280
The frequencies are too close together for
your auditory nerves to distinguish, and the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.299
wave interference will make it sound like
it’s one weird note that’s rapidly getting

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.470
louder and softer, this is known as beating.1

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.280
19th century German physicist and physiologist
Hermann von Helmholtz pointed at the beating

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.021
effect and said that it was the reason we
find dissonant chords ugly and don’t use

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.060
them in our music.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.830
The idea has a nice ring to it, but lately
it’s been turned on its ear.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.380
In 2012 Marion Cousineau of the University
of Montreal and Josh McDermott of New York

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.979
University teamed up to test if beating was
the reason that people are averse to dissonance.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.100
They gathered a group of people who couldn’t
distinguish pitch, melody, or sing in tune,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.369
which is a “musical disorder” called “amusia”.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.950
They played them and a control group, consonant
and dissonant chords, and sounds with and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.119
without beating.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.610
As expected, the amusics couldn’t distinguish
consonant from dissonant chords, and weren’t

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.880
put off by them like the control group was.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.040
Surprisingly though, the group with amusia
disliked the beating just as much as their

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.200
karaoke capable counterparts.3 This suggests
that, yes, while beating may play a part in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.290
our dislike of dissonant sounds, it’s not
the only factor at play.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.819
McDermott reasoned that maybe we’re conditioned
to like the sounds we do by the music we’re

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.650
exposed to.3 In order to study this though,
he’d have to find a group of people who

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.450
had never heard western music, and that wasn't
easy.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.480
Our music is ubiquitous, it’s impossible
to escape Taylor Swift, musically or otherwise-

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.680
we used to date.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.870
But McDermott managed to find 12,000 people
who had never dated or heard the dulcet tones

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.210
of T-dawg Swift.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.450
As an assistant professor at MIT7, Mcdermott
teamed up with Ricardo Godoy of Brandeis University

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.870
to study a remote Amazonian tribe called the
Tsimane . The Tsimane are a farming and foraging

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.069
society with limited exposure to western culture.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.790
McDermott and Godoy played a variety of sounds
to 100 of them, as well as nearby Bolivian

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.980
farmers, city dwellers in Bolivia’s capital
La Paz, and American musicians and nonmusicians.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.670
They found that across the 4 of the 5 groups,
the preference of consonant chords to dissonant

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.620
ones was always there to some degree.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.760
Except within the Tsimane tribespeople.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.819
They showed no preference for one sound over
the other whatsoever.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.970
McDermott and Godoy made sure that they weren’t
dealing with an entire tribe of amusics, they

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.550
responded to what is called “acoustic roughness”,
or rapidly modulating unpleasant tones, the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.550
same as anyone in the other test groups.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.840
This lead the researchers to conclude that
we learn to like the sounds we’re exposed

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.010
to, and preference for chords is not something
hard wired.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.900
So, when you hear a song on the radio for
the first time and hate it, but then can’t

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.269
stop bumping your head to it the next time
you hear it… feel free to blame science

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.810
for your new Katy Perry addiction.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.900
If you’re an avant garde musician out to
change the world’s perception of music,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.260
it’d help if you had a website to spread
your sound.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Yoko Ono dot com is still available.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.989
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.099
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.480
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.379
The four right chords can make me cry, especially
if they’re played loud enough to burst my

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.379
eardrums.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.410

Do you think you could ever learn to like
the sound of a cat walking on a piano?
