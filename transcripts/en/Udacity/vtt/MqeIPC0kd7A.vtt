00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:02.326
So now I want you to write

00:00:02.388 --> 00:00:04.496
the computer code that accepts

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:06.574
arbitrary P₀, P₁, P₂

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:08.148
and calculates

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:09.353
the resulting probability

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:11.578
of a positive test result.
