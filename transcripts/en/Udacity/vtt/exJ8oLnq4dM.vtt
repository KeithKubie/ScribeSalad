A concept of design patterns actually arose in the field of the design of

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.410
buildings, architectural design. In the 1970s Christopher Alexander wrote

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.590
an influential book called A Pattern Language, in which he described various

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.580
patterns which arise in the course of architecting buildings. For example,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.570
think about most of the public buildings that you've entered. You enter into

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.120
an area called an atrium. Aside from enabling the entrance to orient themselves

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.410
spatially, an atrium provide psychological and aesthetic means for adjusting to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.940
the building's purpose. Alexander's book describes many such patterns.
