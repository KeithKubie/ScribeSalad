00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.405
For each equation we have here, we just need to substitute in the expression we

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:08.362
have for each of the functions, and then combine like terms. When we do this,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:13.260
we end up with for part a, the addition 3x cubed minus x squared, and for part

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.219
b, where we have f of x minus g of x, we end up with x cubed minus 3x squared.
