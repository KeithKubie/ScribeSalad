&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.560
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz:
Well, welcome, everyone.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.450
Thank you for being here.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.220
This is an exciting day

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.920
for Frederick Douglass
Family Initiatives.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.300
And my name is Robert Benz.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.750
I am one of the Co-Founders

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.340
of Frederick Douglass Family
Initiatives, along with Ken Morris

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.110
and Nettie Washington Douglass.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.310
And so here's how we're
going to do it today.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.500
We have got some special guests,
some very important people

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.360
that you all will want to know
or at least see when they come up

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.460
and say a few words to us.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.100
And then after they say a few words
we're going to have a conversation

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.510
with you all to talk
about our project and talk

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320
about what abolition means.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.300
And so the name of this project
is One Million Abolitionists.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.090
Does anyone know what
an abolitionist is?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.430
Yes?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Someone who
is trying to abolish slavery,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.510
that's one way of saying it.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.650
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Advocating
for African-American rights.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.150
Okay, we'll get deeply into this
in a few minutes, but the way --

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.830
there's going to be a big finish
to this and you all are going

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.680
to get the very first copies of
the brand-new Bicentennial Edition

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.000
of the Narrative of the Life of
Frederick Douglass and it's going

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.100
to be signed by the direct
descendants of Frederick Douglass

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.400
and Booker T. Washington.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.200
Yes.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.100
Okay, so before we get started we
have to acknowledge the friends

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.860
that we have here today, and
I've got a few to say hello to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.900

before we get started.

to broaden those steps as we go.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.130
Tara Morrison [Assumed Spelling],

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.530
did Tara come in from the
National Park Service?

No, but thank you, Tara.

I don't think I did, but thank you.

And I wanted to say
thank you to a few people

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.970
at the US Marshals Service.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.550

[ Inaudible ]

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.510

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.110
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Oh,
thank you, thank you.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.510
[laughter]

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.060
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.790
I would give you a hint before
we get started that most

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.160
of the answers are
Frederick Douglass today, so.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.070
[laughter] Well, I'm going to
give you all a special welcome,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.200
or I'm not going to give
you a special welcome,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.890
I'm going to have Pam Jackson,
who is with The Library

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.720
of Congress Center for the Book,
come in and say a few words to you.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.240
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.410
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Thank you, Robert.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.740
So I don't have the pop quiz
questions, so I'm the safe speaker,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.930
probably the last safe speaker

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.070
for you guys this morning,
this afternoon.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.370
Thank you all for being here.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.810
I am Pam Jackson, Director for
the Center for the Book and we're

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.360
in the National and
International Outreach Unit

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.660
of The Library of Congress.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.080
And on behalf of Carla
Hayden, Librarian of Congress,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.440
I welcome you here
with us this afternoon.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.900
Thank you for being here.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.640
So it's my job to just share
a little bit about the Library

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.250
and to remind some of us and
share newly with others of us

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.760
that it's the mission of
The Library of Congress

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.330
that we provide a rich enduring
diverse set of knowledge

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.370
and experiences designed to engage,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.300
excite and stimulate the
intellectual and creative endeavors

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.180
of people everywhere and anywhere.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.810 position:56%
And we certainly know that Frederick
Douglass is a model for that for us.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.780
So we're thrilled to be
in the conversation today,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.700
very thrilled to be in
the conversation today.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.640
And as part of being the
country's first cultural,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.670
national cultural institution we
value this conversation even more

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.170
than that.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.390
Also I should mention that
the Center for the Book has

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.560
as its mission the promotion of
libraries and literacy and books

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.520
and reading and poetry
and literature,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.620
and we have that as our mission
because we believe deeply

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.950
in the power of words and ideas
and creativity to be shared,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:51.210
to be relished, and to be used
as a power and a tool for good.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.670
And now I'm speaking to the
first row when I say that,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.150
that we care very much about
defending democracy and we know

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.240
that being literate matters more
than anything else in the power

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.440
and the capacity of people to
live in democratic societies

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.220
and be informed and engaged.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.860
And that's what we're up to
at the Center for the Book,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.370
that's why we're here today
in partnership with you

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.480
at the Frederick Douglass
Family Initiatives, and very,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.900
very glad to welcome you.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.680
Excited for what you're going
to be creating and knowing

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.300
that an abolitionist is a
special, special way of being

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.850
in today's society, with a
very special and critical role

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.720
that you can take on
and make your own.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.380
So thank you for being here with us

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.880
in this conversation
to do just that.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.680
Take care.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.390
[ Applause ]

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.760
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: The place
where we're doing this today,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.060
you guys know this is The Library
of Congress, is the biggest library

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.260
in the world, right,
this is where all

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
of the world's knowledge is stored.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.270
So that woman that just spoke
is in control of almost all

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.170
of the knowledge of the world.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.470
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Almost.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.030
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: And George
Culver [Assumed Spelling],

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.820
he's got the digital
connection to the world.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.630
So that's how The Library
of Congress is about to,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.480
they're about to get their digital
on and be everywhere and put

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.850
that knowledge everywhere.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.170
Now, okay, so when I mentioned
the Frederick Douglass Family

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.870
Initiatives I said that,
I mentioned two names --

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.090
Frederick Douglass and
Booker T. Washington, right?

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.080 position:56%
Now who knows how Frederick Douglass

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.750
and Booker T. Washington
were related?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.920
Anyone? Hands, anyone?

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.220
Yes?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.520
&gt;&gt; Father and son?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.820
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: No.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.120
Anyone else?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.770
Okay, I'm glad you didn't answer

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.750
because the answer is
they're not related.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.630
That was a trick question.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.210
However, they are connected
and they're connected

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.000
in a very special way, and they're
originally connected in one person

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.480
and I'm about to introduce that
one person to you right now.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.700
She is the Chair of the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.440
and her name is Nettie
Washington Douglass.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.240
Say hello to Nettie.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:29.110
[ Applause ]

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.220
&gt;&gt; Nettie Washington Douglass:
Oh, my, good afternoon, everyone.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.520
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.820
&gt;&gt; Nettie Washington Douglass:

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.950
And I have to say Frederick
Douglass still fills a room.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.450
[laughter] Thank you
so much for coming.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.050
How many of you thought you were
going to see him here today?

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
[laughter] I am delighted.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.310
Thank you so very, very
much for joining us.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.170
This is a very special
project and I have my tissue

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.880
because I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to get through it

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.760
without shedding a tear or two.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.450
I suppose I'm supposed to start off
by sharing with you how I happen

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.960
to be related to both Frederick
Douglass and Booker T. Washington,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.570
and let me say it is truly, truly,
truly an honor, it's a privilege.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.140
I don't know why it was me,
but I'm happy that it is.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.280
My father, Frederick
Douglass the III,

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.240
was the great grandson
of Frederick Douglass.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.130
Now you might assume that because
he's the III his father would have

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.910
been Frederick, Jr.,
but that's not the case.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.080
My grandmother told me when
I asked her many years ago,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.380
why did you name him the III?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.170
And she said, well, the first one,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.470
the Frederick Douglass had
passed away and Frederick,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.740
Jr., so the III was next.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.750
So that's why he's the III,
but his father is Joseph.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.270
And my father was a surgeon.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.500
He was commissioned, he graduated

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.010
from the Harry Medical
School [Assumed Spelling],

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.870 position:56%
and he was commissioned to Tuskegee,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.290
where the only black VA hospital
during World War II was located.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.680
So he was on a dinner break and
often the doctors would choose

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.520
to go walk on campus and eat
dinner in the student dining hall

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.560
as opposed to the hospital
cafeteria.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.950 position:56%
So this night he's on his way to
have dinner, and it just so happened

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.010
that a young lady whose name
was Nettie Hancock Washington,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.920
the granddaughter of
Booker T. Washington,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.430 position:56%
who was born in Tuskegee, grew up
in California, was home for a visit.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.390
And she was literally rushing
across campus, a shortcut,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.960
to go wherever she was going
to meet family or friends.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.650
And, as Robert so eloquently
described it

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.560
when he wrote Huffington Post, the
collision between the two families,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.400
and they were married
three months later

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.420
in Booker T. Washington's home.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.240
And I am the product of that
union, and I'm an only child.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.810
So I have the privilege of
joining the families together.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.280
But I like to say that we
know that Frederick Douglass

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.620
and Booker T. Washington
were friends.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.370
I grew up, I spent my summers in
Frederick Douglass' summer home

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.040
in Highland Beach,
and in the living room

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.330
of the cottage was always a picture

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.910
of Booker T. Washington he
had given Frederick Douglass

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.450 position:56%
and he had signed his name on there.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:17.700
And when Frederick Douglass passed
away, I like to say the baton

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.750
of leadership was passed
forward to Booker T. Washington.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.190
But I recently found out, I think
it might have been the last time I

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.480 position:56%
visited a Douglass home that we know
Frederick Douglass died February the

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.790
20th, 122 years ago, but I
didn't know until very recently

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.780
that the day before his
death he wrote a letter

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.390
to Booker T. Washington.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.370
I would like to think, and I don't
know this to be a fact but I would

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.590
like to think it was the
last letter he ever wrote

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.700
and that it would have
gone to his friend,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.930
Booker T. They had
discussed some things.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.200
Frederick Douglass spoke at the
seventh commencement address

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.750
at Tuskegee, and I know they
were in communication about how

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.190
to expand the program at Tuskegee.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.400
So Frederick Douglass
wrote a letter kind

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.820
of summarizing what they had
talked about and having no idea

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.070 position:56%
that generations later they were
going to be in-laws, which I just --

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.600
that's a personal story I
just love sharing that story.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.920
So that's how the two
families were joined.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.550
I would like to, if I
may, just take a moment.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.590
Whenever we do something we have
such support from our family

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.800
and it's not just the
Douglass side of the family.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.950
I would like to thank the
Morris side for coming.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.690
Kenny, Kenneth B. Morris,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.720
Jr. I would like to thank
the Hancock side for coming.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.310
That would be on my
maternal grandmother's side.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.290 position:56%
The Hancock's are being represented.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.160
I thank you for joining us.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.590
And then, of course,
the Douglass family.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.970
We have Kevin and his family.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.620
Kevin and I have the same
relationship to Frederick Douglass.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.070
I thank you for coming.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.380
And Terrence Bailey.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.280
This is, I love showing this.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.600
Terrence is our cousin.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.620
He is truly a Bailey.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.920
Well, we're all Bailey's,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.580
but we know Frederick
Douglass changed his name,

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.190
but Terrence is related to
Frederick Douglass' brother, Perry,

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.150
and he lives on the
eastern shore of Maryland.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.700
And I often talk about I'm an only
child, and Terrence has become

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.330
on the eastern side of
Maryland you've got 200 cousins.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.760
[laughter] So I look forward.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.990 position:56%
Thank you, Terrence, for joining us.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.410
And then Sheila, thank you.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.420
She's from the Hancock side.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.900
And I've been asked to give a
little story about the picture

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.980
that you're looking at, that's
on the front of the cover.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.390 position:56%
You know, it's a standard side pose
of his, but it's very, very special.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.120
And, before I get into that, it
would not be here if it were not

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.550
for a very, very dear
friend of my mother's,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.570 position:56%
who invited me to come to something.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.650 position:56%
She had no idea it was a fundraiser,
and ultimately I was able

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.580
to locate the picture
that I couldn't find

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.970
after my grandmother died.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.250
She'd put it on loan
to the Smithsonian.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.400
And because of Marion
Jones [Assumed Spelling],

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.200
her daughter Christina is
here -- thank you for coming.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.060
Christina wasn't feeling
well, but she came anyway.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.530
I found it, and I found it in
the basement of the Smithsonian.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.660
And it's a long story of
how it used to frighten me

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.290
when I was a child,
but now I love it.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.530
He smiles at me and I am honored.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.780
This picture, it looks like a
photograph, but it really is not.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:38.100
My grandfather, Joseph, his
grandson, Joseph, drew it.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.970
And unframed it's about
almost two-and-a-half feet

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.820
by three feet and that's unframed.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.660
And it hung on my grandmother's
wall at her house

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.410 position:56%
and it did, as a child, frighten me.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.970
But when I recovered it from
the basement of the Smithsonian

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.120 position:56%
and took it to Marlene Morris' house

00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:00.090
and took the top off I swear he was
smiling, thank you for finding me.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.930
And, last but not least,
with the family I have two

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.740
incredible daughter-in-laws.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.570
One is Kenny's, I call her our
Anna of our family because she is

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.670
so supportive of the work that
Kenny is doing in traveling

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.810
around the country
as much as he does.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.630
But I have another daughter-in-law,
who lives in Atlanta,

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.970
and unfortunately she
couldn't be with us today.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:27.310
But her Auntie Mom and Uncle Pop,
right here with us, and I thank you

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.670
so much for coming, the Sherman's,
they live here and they're

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.010
so supportive of us, as well.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.760
The last thing I would like to say,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.620
and I know Robert is
probably going to,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.980
but I'd like to thank Mike
Glenn for being so supportive.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.850
He is just -- well, a couple of
weeks ago at the All Star game,

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.850
he was on the Board of the
National Basketball Retired Players

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.600
Association, but he was
elected as Vice Chairman.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.540 position:56%
And he is a collector of rare books.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.590
He has an incredible
collection of memorabilia.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.640
He has something on
exhibit in Atlanta now.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.290
And before I even met
him he had written a book

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.770
about Frederick Douglass.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.550
And so I went to him last
summer when this concept came

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:17.300
up about what we wanted to do, and
he immediately saw the importance

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.910
of what we were trying to do
and he took it to his Board.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.030
I want to thank him because the NBA
Retired Players Association was our

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.450
first sponsor where they
actually gave money for books.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.410
So, Mike, thank you very, very
much for helping us get started.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.200 position:56%
So, with that, I think I am through.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.450
I thank you again so very much
from the bottom of my heart

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.940
that you would take time out today.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.380
I know some of you probably
are taking breaks from lunch

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.010
or whatever, but it means so much
to us to see the support here.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.880
And, again, from the bottom
of my heart I thank you

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.280
for being a part of this.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.510
Thank you very much.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:18:05.390
[ Applause ]

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.690
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz:
Nettie keeps saying

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.540
in meetings this week how
eloquently I wrote about her,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.820
but I don't recall
specifically about that.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.450
But if anyone is taking notes
it was in a blog I believe

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:24.060
in 2011 honoring Women's
History Month.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.470
Is it Women's History
Month or Women's Month?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.770
&gt;&gt; Women's History.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.070
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz:
Women's History Month, yes,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.740
I should have remembered that.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.230
Yes, it's called Women for Women
and it describes in more detail

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:45.060
that collision at Tuskegee
between Nettie's father and mother.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.400
Nettie, you took my -- thank you.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.920
So we're talking about the One
Million Abolitionists project,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.220
right?

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.200
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Okay, so again
when we say the word, abolitionist,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.310
most of us think about the
idea of ending slavery.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:16.270
How many know that there is
still slavery in the world today?

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.710
I know that, too, and it's true.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.640
And the next person that
I'm going to introduce you

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:29.650
to is the most important person
on the issue of human trafficking

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.470
in the whole world today.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.770
She works for the US
Department of State.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.750
Anyone ever heard of that?

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.860
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Yes, it's very
important, they deal with a lot

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.810
of affairs overseas and some
of them around here, too.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.760 position:56%
But this person is in charge of all.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.380
In fact, her title has the
word, Ambassador, in it.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.610
That means a lot, right?

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:03.730
Let me introduce to you from the
State Department, Susan Coppedge,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.480
Ambassador at Large
in human trafficking

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.700
in the United States and abroad.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.510
Susan?

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:17.710
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.500
&gt;&gt; Susan Coppedge: I
usually like the expectations

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.390
to be a little lower when
I'm going to stand up.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.250
[laughter] But I do want to
thank you so much for asking me

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.560
to say a few words
today, and I'm so thrilled

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.540
at the front row that's here.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.620
This One Million Abolitionists
project is very exciting,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.710 position:56%
and as a proud Georgian I'm happy to
be here with Douglass descendants,

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.150
Nettie Washington Douglass and
Kenneth Morris, so thank you.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.010
You inspire us, inspire us all

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.240
to build upon Frederick
Douglass' extraordinary legacy

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.350
to combat modern slavery today.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.980
My office has long engaged with
the Frederick Douglass Family

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.000
Initiatives and its
Co-Founders Ken and Robert

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.850
because we all value the
importance of the past

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.920
in informing what we're
doing today in the present.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.020
We must understand
antebellum slavery

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.290
and inform what we're doing
today to combat modern slavery.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:19.120
Human trafficking today affects
more than 20 million individuals

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.280
and these are men and women,
they're even children,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.530
transgender individuals, who are
trapped, trapped and enslaved

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:33.610
in factories and on farms,
on fishing boats, in hotels

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.230
and on the streets across our
communities in the US and globally.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.630
In the large conference room

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.380
in my office we have a
portrait of Frederick Douglass.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.450
It's actually not as beautiful
as the portrait on the front

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.830
of the book, but it is our portrait
and we have it there as a reminder

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.480
of the power and courage
of an individual,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.480
an individual who can motivate
my officers as they work

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.980
to fight trafficking around the
world, as they are motivated

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.290 position:56%
and remember that an individual, one
person can make a difference even

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.860 position:56%
under the most trying circumstances.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.450
And before I was the Ambassador
I was a Prosecutor in Georgia,

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.760
and I actually think that was
a really important job, too,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.820
especially for each trafficking
victim whose case I took

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.980
and whose trafficker I prosecuted.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.420
And it's important to pursue
this through law enforcement.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.740
A police officer can
make a difference.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.290
He can see a trafficking victim as
a victim of crime and not someone

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.010
who has committed a crime.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.950
It can also be the citizen who
turns in something suspicious.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.960
It can be the person who talks
to their friends at school

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.420
about what modern day slavery is.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.620
All of these individuals
can make a difference.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.530
Prevention is also an
important part of this program

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.870
so that there isn't
victimization in the first place.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.900
And, again, here the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives is very

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.690
important because they have
been educating and working

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.160
through awareness building
in schools

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.590
and now advocacy in this book.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.370
This will continue
to spread the message

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.890
of what historical
slavery looks like

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.540
and what modern day
slavery looks like.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.150
Frederick Douglass, himself,
was born on the eastern shore,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.170
not very far from where we are
today, and he believed strongly

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.020
in the power of knowledge.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.030
He said, knowledge makes
a man unfit to be a slave.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.260
And it is so fitting that his
descendants are here and they want

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.100
to use knowledge to educate this
generation, but also those of us

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.340
in the room who need
a refresher course.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.780 position:56%
To read this book and to figure out
how you're going to use your talents

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.840
to fight causes that
you feel strongly about,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.000
modern slavery being one of them.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.700 position:56%
Discover your gifts and how they can
be used to help in this great cause.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.520 position:56%
The State Department's
Anti-Trafficking Office welcomes you

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.370
in this fight and we know
that you have it in you.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.450
Read this book and discuss it
with your peers, your parents,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.930
anyone you can find and talk
about what you are going

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.330
to do to make a difference.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.670
We look forward to seeing how this
generation tackles the incredible

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.670
problem of slavery through the
example of Frederick Douglass.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.510
Thank you so much for having
me here today and good luck.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:26.270
[ Applause ]

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.660
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz:
Thank you, Ambassador.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.410 position:56%
You know, if the photo in the office
is not good enough I'm guessing

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:37.520
that for a small six-figure grant
we could license this photo to you.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:44.680
[laughter] I may be
going out on a -- okay.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.310
So now let's talk about people

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.640
who are already excited
about the project.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.280
I want to introduce you to
this gentleman, who is a friend

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.450
of our organization,
has been a friend

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.830
of our organization for awhile.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:05.180
The most amazing I think about
this friend of ours is that he went

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.560
through elementary school,
secondary school and high school

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.190
without ever missing
a day, how about that?

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.690
And he was also drafted in the
first round of the NBA draft.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.250
We've got a couple of former
NBA players in the house today,

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.080
but this one is the Vice Chair

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.090
of the National Basketball
Retired Players Association,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.320
Mike Stinger Glenn.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.120
Mike?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:34.780
[ Applause ]

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.730
I can't stop talking about
that, not missing a day.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.750
[laughter]

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.050
&gt;&gt; Mike Glenn: Thank you very much.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.200
First of all, let me
say I'm very excited

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.090 position:56%
to be here, very honored to be here.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.240
Thank you all for inviting
me and, Nettie,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.040
thanks for all those wonderful
things that you said about me.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.240
And I just want to let everybody
know that as the Vice Chairman

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.610
of the National Basketball Retired
Players Association we are honored

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.070 position:56%
to be a partner with this initiative
and sharing this information

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.040
and knowledge with everybody
throughout the country

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.340
and the world.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.010
So when I took it to
our Board and told them

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.440
of the proposal everybody
had questions about it,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.520
they knew of the book,
and our Board took a vote

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.910 position:56%
and it was a unanimous decision that
we should support and I should go

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.140
to the book launch and
anything else I could do

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.780
to help further the cause.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.180
So the NBA Retired Players
Association very much is in favor

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.070
of everything that the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.370
is doing.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.040
And personally I'd just like
to say just a little bit,

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.320
both my parents were teachers, so
usually when I tell young people

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.890 position:56%
that they kind of feel sorry for me.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.110
They go, oh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, you know?

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.550
[laughter] So I tell them you know
what you were going to do a lot

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.040
of if both your parents were
teachers, a lot of what?

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.340
&gt;&gt; Reading.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.660
&gt;&gt; Mike Glenn: Reading
and studying, yes.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.020
And one of the earliest motivating
factors my mom would always use

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.020
when we had these study periods,
we studied throughout the year

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.130 position:56%
and we even had them in the
summertime, and she'd say now, Mike,

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.850
you can read a book, a newspaper
or magazine of your choice,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.460
but at the end of it I want

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.640
to know what lesson did you
learn from what you read?

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.080
So when we read something we
couldn't just read something,

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.450
we had to answer to Mom, well,
what lesson did you learn, Mike?

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:27.090
So I grew up having to put into
words what lessons I had learned.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.330
And she gave me an example early
of who her hero was and this stayed

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.180
with me throughout my life, many,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.330
many years before I had a
chance to meet Ms. Douglass.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.710
She told about the story
of Frederick Douglass

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.860
and she would kind of dramatize
it and when he was young

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.810
and he had learned
that once you learn how

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.640
to read it would forever
unfit you to be a slave.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.230
And she made me memorize that
and say you always remember that,

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.780
how important it is for you to
read books and gain knowledge,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.920
and how it will impact your life.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.050
So she would keep articles,
when they had a stamp that came

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.340
out of Frederick Douglass
she kept it, and I still have

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.350
that newspaper today and that
was just so many years ago.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.980 position:56%
And I was just so proud to meet all
of the Frederick Douglass relatives,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.520
family, descendants and to
participate in this initiative

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.880
because I know how important
it has been in my life.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.490
And also as a collector, also I'd
like you to know I'm a collector,

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.150
I collect rare books, first edition
books, I have thousands of books.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.700
But my most valued book in my
entire collection is that book

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.310 position:56%
that was published in 1845,
published in the Anti-Slavery Office

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.670
of Boston, Narrative of the
Life of Frederick Douglass.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.530
And then when she told
me they were going

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.960
to reissue it I just thought
it was the greatest thing ever.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.270
I think it's the best book.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.630
It got many reviews as being
one of the best books written

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.150
on an American press at that time.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.830
And in its time period it outsold
Moby Dick, The Scarlet Letter,

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.590
and Leaves of Grass and
many of its contemporaries.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.280
So it's a phenomenal book and
I think we all should read it

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.870
and reread it till it's not
only history, but philosophy,

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.430
faith, prophetic in many ways.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.000
So I'm just glad to
be affiliated with it,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.250
and on behalf of the retired NBA
players, our Board and our members,

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.090
even our current members,
because they're all going to know

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.460
about Nettie, current players
will, too, because we're going

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.140
to make sure to bridge that gap

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.190
between retired players
and current players.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.370 position:56%
And I'm sure they would agree with
me in that we are proud to be a part

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.370
of this and we are thankful,
and we salute all of you

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.170 position:56%
who are here with the same feelings.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.970
Thank you very much.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:46.310
[ Applause ]

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: As a collector of
signed first editions Mike whispered

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.850 position:56%
to me earlier that this signed first
edition is now priced at $5,000

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.620
and who knows what it's
going to be tomorrow.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.680
[laughter] Actually, we
can give you the price.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.730 position:56%
Just before we go to our next guest,

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:14.460
the idea that we had
sometime last year as we began

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.940
to develop this project is
that we would give this away

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.530
to one million young
people with the idea,

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.320
just as Ambassador Coppedge
said and as Mike just said,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.130
knowledge makes a man unfit.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:34.910
It is not an idea that was only
relevant in 1845 or at any time

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:39.270
when Frederick Douglass was alive,
it's an idea that is alive today.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:44.750
And knowledge, education,
reading, understanding is

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.960
so important not just to young
people, but just to everyone

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:56.780
to preserve the freedom that we
believe that we were all born

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.370
with the right, our birthright.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:05.610
So we are -- we don't have the, I
hate to say we don't have the money

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.910
to print a million copies,

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.260
in case anyone thought
by looking at us we did.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.390
[laughter] So we are
going to endeavor to go

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:20.410
out over the next few months
and raise about $4 per book.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.160 position:56%
It's a beautiful hardcover copy book

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:29.170
and hopefully we'll get some
sponsors along the way and people

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.750
who are enthusiastic
enough about the project

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:36.120
to help us raise $4 per
book in their communities

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.660
so that we can come out, present
the book and create conversations

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.770
in communities that are meaningful,
not only to the young people

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:50.770
but to the neighbors and
everyone else who lives

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.520
and breathes in those communities.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.530
Ken and I are starting in Chicago,
in Atlanta, and we'll be in Flint,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:04.350
Michigan as well in a few weeks
where, in case you missed the news,

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:11.870
the Flint water crisis was created
in part because of systemic racism.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.860
And this is what we want
to talk about and address

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.230 position:56%
through discussions about this book.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.960
Okay, next.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.190
So, you know what, did I see --
did Vince, Vince, did you come in?

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:34.760
Oh, now this would be a favorite of
yours, not that the others weren't.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.430
But we were in a meeting with
our new partner on this project,

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:46.030
the National Park Service, and this
guy is so energetic that I felt

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.580
like I had to sleep as soon as --

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:53.230
after he got done talking I felt
like, God, I've got to take a nap.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:59.160
Say hello to Ranger Vince from the
Frederick Douglass Historic Site,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.460
Cedar Hill Home.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.420
Are you from Cedar Hill, Vince,
or just National Park Service?

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.720
&gt;&gt; Vince Vaise: Both.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.020
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Both.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.820
Come on up and say hi to everybody.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:16.150
[ Applause ]

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:20.300
&gt;&gt; Vince Vaise: Just like to say
we are living through a golden age

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.210
in the National Park Service
for African-American history.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:28.760
Two days ago we turned the
lock that opened the door

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.510
to the Carter G. Woodson
Home National Historic Site.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.100
Which as we all know without
Woodson we would not have Black

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.400
History Month.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.700
A lot of us know that.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.330
How many of us in this room know
that one of the other great things

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.250
that Woodson did was to go through

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.940
and organize Frederick
Douglass' papers?

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.070
He did that, and I think that
shows the interconnectedness

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.420
of this history.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.900
And then as we're talking
about getting ready

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.690 position:56%
for the Bicentennial I think we have

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.140
to ask what is the
purpose of a Bicentennial?

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.720
Can we say that Frederick
Douglass is any less important

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.660
in this 199th year of his
birth versus next year,

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.070
as he will be in the 200th year?

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.370
&gt;&gt; No.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.020
&gt;&gt; Vince Vaise: Or perhaps maybe
we all just like round numbers,

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.830
maybe that's what makes 200th
so neat, the 100th anniversary

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.450
or the 200th, maybe it's
a round numbers thing.

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:28.830
But you know what Bicentennials do?

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:35.220
They wake us up from our historical
amnesia because as time goes

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.800
by we forget things,
we forget people.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.540
And when we have a Bicentennial
it is that round number

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.230
that we can hang our hat
on that wakes people up.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.130
We have the choir in
the audience today,

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.310
but what the National Park
Service is doing in partnership

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.900
with the Frederick Douglass Family
Initiative is to carry that legacy

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.650
to a new generation of
Americans, a new generation

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.770
of young people, and
to make it relevant.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.640
Right now in the National
Park Service one

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:09.250
of the initiatives is called the
Urban Agenda, and the idea is

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:15.030
that National Parks can be
catalysts for civic change.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.540
Whether that is a nature park that
could raise the living standards

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.340
in a blighted neighborhood, a
place where people can recreate,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.460
or a historical park, like
Frederick Douglass' Cedar Hill

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.210
where people can take pride

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.110
in the most prominent
resident of Anacostia.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.790
These places are inspirational
and, again,

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.400
they can inspire that
next generation.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.410
So what are we going
to do about that?

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.700 position:56%
Well, in partnering with the
Frederick Douglass Family Initiative

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.600
we're developing a new educational
package, an educational package

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.100
that will be actually

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.660
in the National Park Service
go to students nationwide.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.170
Yes, we want students to visit
Cedar Hill and we plan to have

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:59.980
between 7,000 and 10,000 of
them visit Cedar Hill in 2018,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:05.210
targeting at least 200 additional
school groups, one for each year

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.680
of the Bicentennial you understand.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.380
[laughter] It works, you know?

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.870
But also target students to visit
Cedar Hill that lived in areas

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.810
where Frederick Douglass lived
and grew up, places such as

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:22.070
on the eastern shore of
Maryland, places such as New York,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.180
places such as not only
here in Washington, D.C.,

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.260
Baltimore City, places like that.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.050
And then through the distance
learning, using media,

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.480 position:56%
the widespread media where
students around the world can engage

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.060
and they'll be able
to talk to Kenneth --

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.900
can I call you Kenneth Morris --
Kenneth Morris, they can talk,

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.850
you know, a descendent, I
mean how cool is that to

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.970 position:56%
where kids can be like, yeah, you
know what, when I was a kid I talked

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.720
to this descendent of Frederick
Douglass, I remember that,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.450
and I went to Cedar
Hill with my class,

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.160
and I still have that
book on the shelf.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.370 position:56%
But, ladies and gentlemen, the power
of history is not just in a bunch

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.410
of facts and dates
and names of the past.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.900
If that's what it was, and
when you talk to people

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.860
and they say I've never
liked history,

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.040
that's the way it was
taught to them.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.560
You know, because you're laughing
it probably happened to yourself.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:17.450 position:56%
But the power of history, because if
that's all it is is memorizing facts

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.030
then this is just a grand
game of trivial pursuit.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.430
Can you recall this?

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.360
But the power of history
is the ability of the past

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.400
to influence the present
and to influence the future,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.780 position:56%
and by grooming that next generation
of stewards, to show the relevance

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.030
of what Frederick Douglass
did back then

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.540
to what the National Park
Service is doing today,

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.440
to combine that Frederick Douglass
history with the modern blight

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.720
of human trafficking and
have students understand

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.220
that this stuff is still going
on and that they will be inspired

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:53.200
to take action is a new relevancy,
it will jumpstart that cause.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.010
We have a lot of special exhibits

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.610
that our Curatorial Division
will be putting out this year,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.670
so we're excited to actually
engage in the artifacts

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:06.630
that Frederick Douglass touched
and used, but also again to inspire

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:12.030
that next generation through
education and through civic action.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.300
And maybe 50 years from now, how
many of us will be in this room,

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:21.340
probably not a lot, but those kids
that we will be inspiring this year

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:27.600 position:56%
and 2018 they will be in this room,
they will be carrying that torch on.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.810
And we will that, so remember the
power of history is the ability

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.880
to influence the present
and to influence the future,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.910
and it's that power that we
will be harnessing in 2018.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:43.400
Mr. Benz, it's an honor
to work with you,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.510
the journey has just begin, sir.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:39:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.350
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: I'm officially
shamed about my lack of enthusiasm.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.990
[laughter] But that
was a day at church.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:18.090
I could have gone for
another half hour of that.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:22.380
But I wonder who is next?

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.800
[laughter] No, I know who is next.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.940
Listen, this is an important
conversation that we want

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.880
to put ourselves in the middle of.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.480
We've been having these
conversations

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.550
over the last few years
in our communities

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:44.670
about perceived differences
between us.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:50.170
One thing we want you all to learn
when you're reading this book is

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.890
that there are no differences
between us,

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.370
there are perceived
differences between us.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.100
And the only way that we
can overcome those people

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.520
that are trying to make us believe
that there are differences is

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.660
to unite, is to become one.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.470
And that's what you guys
have to do, that's your jobs.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.400
We'll try, too, we'll do a
little bit of it ourselves.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:20.900
But to show that unity, we are
so proud to have with us as part

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.980
of this project the
National Organization

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.830 position:56%
of Black Law Enforcement Executives,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.700
and I would like to ask Chief
Perry Tarrant to come up

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.230
and say a few words, please?

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.570
&gt;&gt; Perry Tarrant: Well, I'm going
to start by saying good afternoon.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.360
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Perry Tarrant: I wasn't
expecting to find Mr. Douglass here,

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.770
but I thought his best friend
who lives down the street

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.940
on Pennsylvania Avenue
would be here, so.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.340
But having said that, again,
my name is Perry Tarrant.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.680
I'm the President of the
National Organization

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.150
of Black Law Enforcement
Executives, or NOBLE for short.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:13.560
My Executive Director, who is here
locally in the D.C. area is here,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.240
Duane Crawford [Assumed
Spelling], he's in the back.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.450
And I also want to acknowledge
Andrea Dawson [Assumed Spelling],

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.190
who is a member of our organization
who is out of Los Angeles

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.250
who connected me to this
organization or to the initiative.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.400
So you're trying to figure out
what does the National Organization

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.110
of Black Law Enforcement
Executives have to do

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.430
with the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives?

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.450
I'll start off by giving
you a history lesson.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.860
So there's two histories
of policing.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.400
The first history of policing
is the Police Service,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.170
which started in Europe and it
was founded by Sir Robert Peale

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.370
and the concept there was
the people are the police

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.530
and the police are the people.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.620 position:56%
You have the history of policing in
the United States, which started off

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.970
as the police or slavecatchers,
they hunted down runaway slaves

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.930
and returned them as property.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.060
I'm not suggesting to you
that we can't bridge the two

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.660
and bring the two together because
that's what my organization does.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.080
I spend a lot of time in cities
like Ferguson, Missouri, Charlotte,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.420
North Carolina, and a
variety of other cities

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.210
where we've had a number
of recent events.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.660
And the goal of our
organization is exactly in line

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.080
with being an abolitionist.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:27.520
So the intent here with our
organization really is justice

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.630
by action, and that's our motto.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.030
Where the two organizations align

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:38.180
and connect is our organization
absolutely enforces constitutional

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.210
law, not amongst the
community but amongst my peers.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:45.180
I'm the guy who calls those
police chiefs and those sheriffs

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.710
and ask them the hard question.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.830
I'm the guy who gets to call
those police chiefs and sheriffs

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.770
and say we're coming to your
town to find out what happened.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.430
That's what my organization does.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.210
We're about 3,000 strong.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:02.500
We've got chapters all over the
United States, as well as Canada,

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.190
the UK, and the Caribbean.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.180
We leverage all of those
chapters because of our depth

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.130
to have those conversations.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.380
One of our initiatives is a program
we call The Law in Your Community.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.410
Every one of our chapters across
the country has a representative

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.390
or has access to that program,

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:27.160
and what that program does is it's
tailored for youth between the ages

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.470
of 14 to 25 and it's a conversation

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.490
about what your constitutional
rights are.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.150
A lot of folks out there believe

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.850
or think they know what their
constitutional rights are,

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.640
but we have that conversation
and tell you very specifically

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.520
in that contact with law
enforcement what your rights are,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.930
what to expect, if it does not
go well what your redress is.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.080
And I would suggest to you that
three o'clock in the morning

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.680 position:56%
on the side of the road is not the
time to fight for your rights, okay?

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.880
The conversation is comply unless
there is an absolute threat

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.930
to our life at that moment and
then follow-up afterwards using the

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.830
process that we described,
which varies from state to state

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.890
and organization to organization.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:15.060 position:56%
In the United States there are about
18,000 different police departments,

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:20.200 position:56%
which means there's 18,000 different
ways of things happening out there.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:26.490
There's about 800,000
police officers from local

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.570
to Federal across the country.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.260
The value of our organization
and other organizations

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.200
that are very similar and align to
us is to ensure that your rights

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.910
as an individual are protected.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.870
And, again, we're not
looking at the community,

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.620
we're looking at our
peers and making sure

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:50.830
that the equitable administration
of justice, the 14th Amendment,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:55.010
is enforced coast to
coast for every citizen,

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.770
for every person living
in the United States.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.620
And if you read the 14th
Amendment it doesn't say citizen,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.240
it says every person.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.260
I began my law enforcement
career in the State of Arizona,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.770
which was the first state to
have its own immigration law.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:17.050
I'm currently a Chief
in Seattle, Washington.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:20.780
The organization that I represent
is predominantly made up of chiefs

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:26.170 position:56%
and sheriffs and, or command level
personnel again from coast to coast.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.690
This is a natural partnership for
us, this is a natural conversation

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:35.170
for us to have with the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiative.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.850
It's a natural conversation
because we want the same thing

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.200
and that is we want to make
sure that everybody who is

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.800
in the United States has
justice equally applied to them.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.150
Thank you for the invitation
to speak before you.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:50.790
Thank you for being here.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.520
And we are absolutely partners.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.320
Thank you.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:02.370
[ Applause ]

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.010
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: That, what you
just heard was very important stuff

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.810
and I want to congratulate
us for putting together

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.260
such an interesting program today.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.570 position:56%
[laughter] The next person I want to
introduce you to provides the link

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:25.740
between NOBLE and Frederick
Douglass -- what do we call it --

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.360
Frederick Douglass
Family Initiatives.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:38.430 position:56%
And I'm going to raise this a little
bit for Mr. Dawson, a tall man.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:42.890
I want to introduce
you to the gentleman

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:47.830
who has been extremely
valuable to our organization.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:53.450
He's one of the top minds in
the anti-trafficking world today

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:59.020
and he does training for law
enforcement officials all

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:04.270
over the United States and
he provides sage wisdom

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.950
for Frederick Douglass Family
Initiatives, and he's spent a lot

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.980
of time trying to figure out
how to approach this issue

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:17.490 position:56%
of human trafficking in the United
States and I think he's probably got

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.820
as good a take as anyone
in the United States.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.730
Say hello to Lieutenant
Andre Dawson.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:24.530
Thank you.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:44.050
[ Applause ]

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.380
&gt;&gt; Andre Dawson: Hello
and good afternoon.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.680
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.290
&gt;&gt; Andre Dawson: It's an absolute
honor and pleasure to be here.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.420
I've never had the chance
or the opportunity really

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.280
to tell the Frederick Douglass
Family Initiatives how proud I am

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.210
to work with them and today will
be the day for me to say that.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.450
I'm so honored and privileged to
be a part of this organization,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:09.590
and I would like certainly to
make sure I do the best I can

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:13.210
to advance this agenda
as best as I can.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.510
So thank you so much.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.040
[child cries] And that, too.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:24.380
I have to share a personal story
with you, when I got onboard

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:29.080 position:56%
with the Frederick Douglass Family
Initiatives I heard a lot of stories

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.780
about this spiritual connection

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:37.240 position:56%
between the Frederick Douglass
Family, people within the community,

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.860
that there's this connection.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.100
And I've heard multiple
stories of it,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.140
as a matter of fact I met Ken's mom
for the first time during this trip

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.940
and we were sitting
down and having dinner

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.160
and she was sharing these spiritual
connection stories with me.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.360
And I'm going to share one with
you and I'm also sharing this

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.960
with our young people here.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.220
We went to the African-American
Museum on Saturday,

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.050
and it was raining a little bit.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:09.990
And Ken wanted to go visit the
medallions of Frederick Douglass

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.290
and Booker T. Washington.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:13.870
And it was raining a little bit.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.760
And one of the pictures that Ken
wanted to take was him kneeling

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.930
down with the picture, I mean with
the book of Frederick Douglass.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.730
And we were trying to wait for
the weather, the rain to stop

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:28.850
so that Ken can do this,
but when we stood there,

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.460
there was a lady standing there.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.150
And Ken is to her right and she's
literally in between the two of us,

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.950
and I'm looking at this
lady and we're trying

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:43.100
to let her finish doing whatever
it was that she was doing.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.910
And she stood there for several
minutes, I mean to the point

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:50.330
where at some point when she
finished I literally asked her was

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:51.990
she okay?

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.920
And what she said was, you know,
she was looking at the words

00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.190
and those words meant something
to her, and to the point

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.740
of this spiritual connection.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.160
I really wasn't sure if she
was ready for me to tell her

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.420
who was standing to her right

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.300
after what she was going
through, but I did.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.250
I said to your right, and I was
ready to, in case she collapsed

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.680
or something, I was -- to your
right is a direct descendent

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.660
of Frederick Douglass.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.640
And she embraced Ken and what
she said was she didn't know much

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.500
about Frederick Douglass,
but to my point,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:31.000
to my youth here, words do matter.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.220
Appreciate the book that
you were given today.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.440
Embrace the history of
a great man and learn

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.810
about the sacrifices
that shaped the world.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:45.740
It will make a difference
to you, okay?

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.950
The words that I'm going to
share with you, some of them,

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.300
if you get a chance there's an
amazing introduction written

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.250
to this book by Brian
Stevenson [Assumed Spelling].

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:59.030
And I'm going to share the
quote from Frederick Douglass,

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:02.460
who once said, it is easier
to build strong children

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.790
than to repair broken men.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.090
Today is the beginning

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:11.950 position:56%
of one million students making their
own journey of hope and success.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.560
Today is a new beginning for you,

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.660
and I'm glad to be here
to be a part of that.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.990
But we as responsible adults
we have to demonstrate a moral

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:27.590
and social obligation to be
proactive and travel this journey

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:31.460
with Frederick Douglass and help
build these strong children.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.960
Today we introduce the
words of Frederick Douglass

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.660
that will show us all the way.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:47.140
Law enforcement, we won't
arrest our way out of this,

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.580
but we will walk this
journey with you,

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.790
as the Chief just shared with you.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:59.420
I've seen what it looks like,
a 14 year old to be exploited.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:04.090
Six of my 33 years I've spent
specializing in the rescue

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:07.830
and recovery of children who
have been sexually exploited.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.970
Close to my retirement
and what kept me going was

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.660
after I rescued three
law enforcement daughters

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.920
and a high profile
athlete's daughter.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.260
It can happen to anyone anywhere.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:26.780
So what I told my Chief was,
I have to figure out how

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:31.390
to help in some kind of way.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:35.500 position:56%
Because I sit in a very unique seat,
for those last six years I worked

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.260
for the FBI and the Los
Angeles Police Department

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.540
and not very many people
have done that.

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.660
But I traveled the world and when I
did I was able to sit down and talk

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.170
to people and tried to identify
what the best practices were

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:50.930
in bringing those back
to Los Angeles.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:56.470
But today [child cries] -- yes?

00:52:56.470 --> 00:53:01.310 position:56%
[laughter] Today the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiative is making

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:07.210 position:56%
a fight for human rights and deposit
into the lives of these children.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:10.680
[child cries] And you, too.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:17.640
In closing I will share this, if we
as a country are going to subscribe

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.580
to making America great let's begin

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.670
by supporting the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:34.290
and let's work together to
educate one million children.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.980
A protected child is
an educated child,

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:43.900
and all of our children are God's
children and they are all great.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.700
Thank you very much.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:59.160
[ Applause ]

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.530
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: There's a man
who looks like he could protect you

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:06.090
and he's also got a gigantic heart.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.450
We love Lieutenant Andre Dawson.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:13.480
Okay, so just, you know,
Andre referenced the book,

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.640
we are going to, after we have
a little discussion we're going

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.630
to hand out these copies of
the book to the students.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:22.200
We have a couple more.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.500
We do accept bribes.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:29.330
The book is for the students and,
you know, people have called us

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:34.510
and said, how do I get a book?

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.560
And, frankly, we don't,
we're not book publishers,

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.760
we don't know necessarily
how to retail the book

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.150
and we didn't create it for that.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:49.210
If you have a desire to have a
book in your hands and have one

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:53.220
of your own there are a couple
of ways of going about it.

00:54:53.220 --> 00:55:02.660
Again, we wouldn't reject checks
and cash, but what we would really

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:07.250
like you to do is to make
up your minds to go back

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:10.830
to your communities, think
about who might be able to help

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:15.490
in your community, is it the local
PTA, the local car dealership,

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:21.600
the local bank, who is it that
could invest a few dollars

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.280
to help your community
bring a thousand books to it

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.880
or to bring 5,000 books
to our community.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:35.160
And if you do we will come with
the books as an added accessory.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:41.880 position:56%
[laughter] So and we'll hand you one
in person, that becomes your own.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.880 position:56%
So that's the story about the books.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.390
We really want, and
again we're flexible,

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:52.200
but what we really want is
a million books in the hands

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.050
of a million young people
who can go out and begin

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.100 position:56%
to create change in our communities.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:04.330
So now I'm going to introduce
to you my partner in the project

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:11.890
and a partner in the Frederick
Douglass Family Initiatives who Ken

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:16.010
and I have been at
this now for 10 years.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:21.680 position:56%
I just realized it was 10 years
because LinkedIn told me, basically.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.880
[laughter] Congratulations,
it's your 10-year anniversary.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.820
I was waiting for someone
to tell me that,

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:29.880
I just didn't think it
would be a computer.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:37.620 position:56%
Say hello to the great, great,
great grandson of Frederick Douglass

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.920
and the great, great grandson

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.510
of Booker T. Washington,
Kenneth B. Morris, Jr.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:55.600
[ Applause ]

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.290
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris,
Jr.: Thank you, Robert.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:59.410
This is an emotional
day for the family,

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.080 position:56%
for my mom, talked about it earlier.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.340
And to see all of you
here supporting this work

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.160
and supporting the young people
that are in the front row.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.440
On behalf of the Family
of Frederick Douglass

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.550
and Booker T. Washington we
thank you for being here.

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:22.290
We're very humbled that you're
here and we're just excited

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:25.790
to have a conversation with the
students about this project.

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:30.640
But before we jump into that I
just wanted to say a few words

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.740
about what it's like to be a
descendent of Frederick Douglass

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.860
and Booker T. Washington.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:44.460 position:56%
Wow. And as Robert introduced me I
think I heard him say I'm the great,

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.820
great, great grandson
of Frederick Douglass,

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:48.810
is that right, were
there three greats?

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:53.530
Yes, and the great, great
grandson of Booker T. Washington.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.300
And every time I tell people
what my relationship is

00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.500
to these American heroes not only
is it a mouthful trying to spit

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.800
out all those greats,

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:06.360
but it sometimes makes
me feel very far removed.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.340
And you might be sitting there
having a hard time trying

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.950
to imagine what my connection
is to Douglass and Washington.

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.610
It's like trying to picture
what a billion dollars looks

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:21.140
like with all those zeroes or in
the case of the project $4 million

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.530
with all of those zeroes.

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:32.090
But I'd like to talk about my
great grandmother, Fannie Douglass,

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:36.820
who lived to be 103 years old.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:44.360
And she met Frederick Douglass
when she was a little girl.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:54.550
She didn't know that she was going
to grow up and marry his grandson,

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:58.170
who by the way is the artist
on the cover of the book,

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:01.350
but that's what happened.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:08.550
And my Aunt Portia, to whom I was
also very close, she lived to be 95

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:14.090
and she was Booker T.
Washington's daughter.

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:20.150
And I remember being a
little boy and sitting

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:25.970
on my great grandmother
Fannie Douglass' lap

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:38.130 position:56%
and she would tell me what it was
like to know, as she would call him,

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:41.880
the man with the great
big white hair.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:47.160
And I remember sitting
on my Aunt Portia's lap

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.780
and she would tell me firsthand
stories about her father.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:59.120
And when I was thinking about the
generations and how far it seems

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.280
like I'm removed because
some were looking

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.000 position:56%
at me like, wow, that's so far away.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.510
And one evening when I was
thinking about that it hit me,

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:13.630
hands that touched the great
Frederick Douglass and hands

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:17.010
that touched the great Booker
T. Washington also touched mine.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:18.420
So in a sense to be with
all of those greats I stand

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.720
as just one person in
the wave of history.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.020
I stand one person
away from slavery.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.320
Now Rob and I had the
opportunity over the past 10 years

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.760
that we've been doing this work
to dialogue with tens of thousands

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.500
of students, and I think sometimes
most of the kids that we come

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.970
in contact with think that
slavery happened so long ago.

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.270
And when you look at
great heroes and heroines

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.970 position:56%
in the history books it's hard to
imagine that they were living people

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.410
that did so much, they overcame
obstacles and challenges.

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.300 position:56%
In the case of my ancestors and many
others they rose up to affect change

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.600
in the lives of millions of people.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.900
So what I want to do this afternoon

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.200
with you guys is make history
come alive because I want to talk

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.500
about two men that
were born into slavery.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.800
They were born in the
most horrific conditions

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.100
that a human being
could be subjected to,

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.400 position:56%
but yet with the power of education.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.700
Now Frederick Douglass never spent
one day of his life in a classroom.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.000
Can anybody tell me why he
wouldn't have had a chance

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.300
to get an education?

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.600
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.900
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris,
Jr.: That's one reason,

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.200
there were no black schools, but
I'm looking for something else.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.390
Any ideas of why as an enslaved
person Frederick Douglass couldn't

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:57.510
spend any time in a classroom?

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.650
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris, Jr.: Well, not
a lot of people could read or write,

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:06.080
but why do you think it was
that people that were enslaved,

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.030
held in bondage couldn't
read or write?

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.340
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris,
Jr.: No one taught them,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.640
we're getting a little bit closer.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.940
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.090
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris, Jr.:
Well, they were working,

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:24.670
they were enslaved, they
didn't have their own humanity,

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:26.550
they didn't own themselves.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:30.170
The reason that -- what I'm
looking for is that it was illegal

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.760
to teach the slaves
to read and write.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.900
So not only did the Federal
Government want to keep those

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.960
who were enslaved in
physical bondage,

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.590
but most importantly they wanted
to keep them in mental bondage.

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:46.060
And this is a message that's
relevant today, and as you hear

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.950
about this project as we move
forward what we want to do

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.460
when we pass out a million
books between now and the end

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:59.060
of the Bicentennial year in 2018 is
we want young people to be inspired

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.370
by Frederick Douglass's
words and his examples

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:07.850
of courage and taking action.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:12.690
And why has he not become one of
this country's greatest heroes?

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.880
Frederick Douglass was
born Frederick Augustus

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.410
Washington Bailey.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:19.770
He was born on the eastern shore
of Maryland to a black woman

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.600
who was enslaved and to a
white man and it is presumed

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.100
that his father was his master.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.400
He never had a pair
of pants or shoes

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.850
until he was about eight years old.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.930
He used to sleep head first in an
old corn sack on cold winter nights

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:38.240
with his feet hanging out because
that's the only way he could try

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.370
and keep himself warm.

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:44.740
He only saw his mother about four
times his whole life and that's

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.250
because he had been
separated from her.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.240
It was not unusual for the
master to separate the children

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.300
from their mothers
when they were born.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.280
So his mother lived on a
plantation that was 12 miles away.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.450
So in order for her to see her
son she would have to pick cotton

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:04.080
in the fields from sun up to sun
down, walk 12 miles in the middle

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.290
of the night to spend just a
few precious moments with him

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.000 position:56%
until he would fall asleep, and then
she would have to walk 12 miles back

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.550
so she could be back on the
plantation by the time the sun came

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:17.350
up because if she wasn't she
was most likely going to have

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:20.040
to face a brutal beating.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.520
So he was raised by his
grandmother in the early years,

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.960
and his grandmother's
job on the plantation was

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.950
to raise the slave children
until when they were old enough

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.480 position:56%
to begin their life in manual labor.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.290
And on this plantation that was
usually right around six years old.

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:36.970 position:56%
Now Frederick didn't know old he was

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.900
because there were no birth
certificates for slaves.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.220
He was taught someone else owned
him, he did not own himself.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.120
So his grandmother said to him
when he was around six years old,

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.420 position:56%
we're going to go on a long journey.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:54.680
And that journey was a 20-mile
walk to the main plantation

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.580 position:56%
where she would drop him off because
she had done this many times before

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.760
with the other children
she had raised.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.780
Because now he was at the age
where he could begin his work,

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.930
where he enters really what
he called the el slavery.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:13.490
So they made that walk, they made
the last final walk and he arrives

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:15.610
and he kind of runs
out to see where he is.

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:20.490
And when he turns around to look
for his grandmother she's gone.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:24.110 position:56%
So here is a boy, he didn't know who
his father was, he'd been separated

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.750
from his brothers and sisters, he
only saw his mother four times,

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.360
and any person that
showed him any nurturing

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.970
and love is out of his life.

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:33.070
So he's truly alone.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.860
So what we have is a little
boy who has no family,

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.550
he has no home and
he has no country.

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:44.420
And in spite of all that he had
something happen in his life

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:48.070
that he called divine providence.

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.270
Now I have to think that history
is important for a lot of reasons,

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:55.100
but I think history is most
important because we need to know

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.060
where we come from in order
to know where we're headed.

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.920
And right now do you guys realize
we're making history right now,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.580 position:56%
with the launch of this project,
and what's going to come afterwards.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.550
And you all are the first
students that are going

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:11.850
to be getting these books.

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.380
And so what's going to happen
is all the other students

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.920 position:56%
around the country and young people
that we want to connect to are going

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.640
to be looking at you for examples.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.140
So it doesn't seem like it
but making history right now,

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.260
and I'm about to tell you a
story that I want you to listen

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.340
to because had this not
happened the course of history

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:36.220
in our country may have taken a
different turn or a different path.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.900
And that was that Frederick
was chosen

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.870
from among all the slave
children on the plantation to go

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.770
to the eastern shore of
Maryland where he was born,

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.310
Frederick Augustus
Washington Bailey,

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:49.630
to Baltimore to be the house
servant for his master's brother.

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:54.230 position:56%
Now when he got there his slave
mistress had never had slaves before

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.140
and she didn't know
that it was illegal

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.070
to teach him to read and write.

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:03.430
Listen to this, so she begins to
teach young Frederick his ABC's,

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:07.620 position:56%
but when her husband finds out about
it, when Frederick's master found

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.360
out he got mad and he forbade it.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.050
And he looked at his wife, Sophia,
and he looked at little Frederick

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:18.700
and said, you heard today, you
cannot teach a slave how to read

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.360
and write because if you do it
will unfit him to be a slave.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.990
So Frederick quoted his master,
he heard that message and he said,

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:30.680
if you don't want me
to have this I'm going

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.560
to do everything in
my power to gain it.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.920
And he understood right then
that knowledge was power

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.130
and education would be
his pathway to freedom.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:44.390
Knowledge is power, education
is your pathway to freedom,

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:47.460
that is a message that's
relevant today.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.460
So he begins to teach
himself to read and write.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.140
He was very clever in the
way that he would do that.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.840 position:56%
Now remember he's in the big city so
now he's around free black children

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.770
that didn't read and write, but
he's also around white children.

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:01.520
So he trades bread
for reading lessons.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.520 position:56%
He picks up something off the
ground and he scratches with a twig.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.090
What's your name?

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:10.080
Ava. Can you tell me is
this how you write an A?

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.260
And you say, no, this
is how you write an A.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.190
And he would file it away.

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:22.960
So now as he's starting to become
educated, so he started to look

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.990
around and he starts questioning
his conditions and asking questions

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:34.780
like why am I a slave
and why do you own me?

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.500
And so at the age of 20,
now you guys will learn

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.980
about all the details
in the narrative

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.860
if you haven't already read it
so I'm going to really skip ahead

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:48.340
in the interest of time, but at the
age of 20 he would disguise himself

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.170
as a sailor, carry with him
forged identification papers,

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.980
and he would escape slavery.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.110
He would go by train and
boat to New York City

01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:00.260
where he would marry my great,
great, great grandmother Anna,

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.900
and then along the Underground
Railroad they would make their way

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.910
up to New Bedford,
Massachusetts and he would settle

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.250
into New Bedford, Massachusetts.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:11.300
Now here's a point that I'm going
to tell you about taking action

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.860
because this project
is about literacy,

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.710
but it's also about social
services, it's about taking action.

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:20.700
So he gets to New Bedford,
he could have said, well,

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:27.370
I'm in a free state now, yes, I'm
a fugitive slave, but he didn't.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.870
He could have said I'm
going to start a family.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.700
But he looked back and he saw that
there was this legal institution

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.820
of slavery that needed to be
dismantled and he got to work

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.920
to do that, along with
the other abolitionists,

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.970
so he would become an
advisor to President Lincoln

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:45.910
and a statesman and
an American hero.

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:48.830
So what we want to do with this
project, One Million Abolitionists,

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:53.550 position:56%
is we want this book into the hands
of as many young people as possible.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:58.490
And my mom can tell you this and
it's been my experience that ever

01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.520 position:56%
since I was a little boy, I remember
being four or five years old

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.750
and people would come up to me
sometimes with tears in their eyes,

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:11.150
they'd want to hug me, kiss
my cheeks, pat my hair.

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:14.330
And it was hard to understand
the emotional connection

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.180
that so many had to our ancestors,

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.350 position:56%
but it was many years later somebody
came up to my mom at an event

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:24.570
and explained why people
react this way.

01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:26.930
And they'd always remember
where they were

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.170
when they read the
Narrative, how old they were

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:32.120
or what grade they were in, so it
had that kind of impact on them.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.780
And what this person said to my
mom is that Frederick Douglass

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.860
and Booker T. Washington meant
so much to me in my life,

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:44.890 position:56%
that if I could thank them in
person I would, although some people

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:52.150
in the government think they
probably can thank him in person.

01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:56.490
[laughter] But most of this know
that Frederick Douglass is not,

01:09:56.490 --> 01:10:00.370
though his spirit is with
us, so he is still alive.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:05.320
By thanking a person I would, but
because I can't you are the conduit

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.830
to that, so they want
to hug us and touch us.

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:13.920
And that changed my perspective on
this so I really embrace that now.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.050
So history lives in each of us.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:20.170
History doesn't just live in me
because I descend from somebody

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:22.860
that made a difference, but
lives in each and every one

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.550
of you and everybody here.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:27.400
And for those of you that have
done your own family tree,

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:33.140
I'm sure you've found great heroes
and you're smiling, you did.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.530
And we want young people everywhere
to think and to understand

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.960
and discover the same
thing, that we all descend

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.360
from people who made a difference.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.010
And I remember there was a
young girl who was 10 years old,

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:47.200
she raised her hand and she said,
Mr. Morris, my great, great,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.410
great grandmother was born into
slavery, she taught herself to read

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:53.830
and write and then she
freed or liberated herself

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.550
and she became a businesswoman
and a philanthropist.

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:59.620
And she looked at me and she
said, you know what that means?

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:05.250
She said, I have greatness flowing
through my veins just like you do.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.640
And I said, yes, you do.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.340
You have greatness flowing
through your veins, too.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.190
And we heard the quote, it's
easier to build strong children

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.560
than to repair a broken man.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.940
My favorite Frederick
Douglass quote.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.340
My favorite Booker T. Washington
quote is, if you want to lift

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.640
up yourself lift up someone else.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.080
And when you get into
the social service part

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.340
of this project you all are going
to be working in your communities

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:40.210 position:56%
to lift up someone else, which will
lift up your community, your school,

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:45.820
and all the young people that
need hope, need inspiration,

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.950
and they need to connect
to these stories.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:51.050
How many of you guys know that
Frederick Douglass is the father

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.000
of the Civil Rights Movement?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.300
He's the one that started it all.

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:00.570
Well, there's a lot to be learned
and we're excited, and I just want

01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:03.810
to give you a quick story about
the Narrative and then I'm going

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.630
to ask Robert to come up with
me and we're going to engage you

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:12.010
in a conversation with the
time that we have left.

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.860
A lot of work to do.

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:22.500
So Frederick Douglass settled
in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.600
He came into contact with
a white abolitionist,

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.650
William Lloyd Garrison.

01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:29.830
And he attended an
antislavery meeting

01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:31.500
in which Garrison was
speaking and he heard

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.680
that he had this fugitive slave in
the audience and he asked Douglass,

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.270
would you come up and would
you just tell me your story,

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:41.050
tell the audience what it
was like to be a slave?

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:43.520
And so he writes about this
later, he said I was so nervous

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.140 position:56%
and I was shaking from every limb
and my knees were knocking together,

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.920
but he stood up and what he was
able to do, he had a natural gift

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.130
for communication, he was
eloquent, he was charismatic,

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.910
he was actual, he was funny.

01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:58.990
But it was the first time
that the audience was hearing

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:00.470
from somebody really.

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:03.110
Now there had been other slave
narratives that had been written,

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:06.150
but it was the first time the
audience was hearing from somebody

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:07.870
that had experienced
slavery firsthand.

01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:11.220
And that's why when we talk
about human trafficking,

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.550
modern day slavery today the voices
of survivor leaders are important

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:18.750
because you're hearing from people
that have suffered the injustice

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:22.350
and the inhumanity
and the brutality.

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:26.110 position:56%
So the audience is looking at him
and they're thinking, wait a minute,

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.290
that's not what the slave
looks like or sounds like,

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.720
that's not what I've been told.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.450
And so he is shattering this
notion and the public consciousness

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:39.830
about African-Americans
being worthy of citizenship,

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.800
being worthy to be
considered a human being.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:52.040 position:56%
So he would travel from town to town
with Garrison and tell the story,

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.740
people started to doubt that
he had ever been a slave

01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:01.620
because they couldn't
wrap their minds

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.210
around what they were
hearing and seeing.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:07.960
So in order to prove that
he wrote this Narrative,

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.950
which was published in 1845.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.060
It became an instant bestseller.

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:23.590
Now we published 5,000 copies and
the significance of that number is

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:26.700
that was the original run of
Frederick Douglass' Narrative.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:30.220
Now we understand that
he sold 4,000 copies.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:36.470
Our 5,000 copies have already been
committed and will be delivered,

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:41.700
so maybe we've done a little bit
better than Frederick Douglass did.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.230
But that's why he wrote
the Narrative

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:48.700 position:56%
because in it he named names and he
named places, it became a bestseller

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.380
and made him a celebrity, it
made him a household name.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.240
So he would have to flee to
Europe for a couple years

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.310
for a cooling off period,
and while he was

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:02.720
in Europe some abolitionist friends
of his pooled their money together

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.180
and purchased his freedom for
$711 and he was able to come back

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.670
to the United States
and become a free man

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.230
and to really begin his
work as a leading voice

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:13.530
in the abolitionists movement.

01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:15.830
So that's the history
behind this Narrative.

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:19.320
And we know that it has
transformative properties to it

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.620
and we know that young people,
Robert and I have given away more

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.820
than 3,000 copies of another
edition in the past 10 years.

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.120
We've had students and
young people write us

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.160
and tell us how much this
book changed their lives.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.470
So we know that it
will change your lives

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:36.980
and it will inspire
you to do great things.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:42.110
So with that I'd like to ask Mr.
Benz to come up and we're going

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:46.320 position:56%
to ask a few questions about
equality, injustice and other things

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.730
that are a concern in
our communities today.

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.190
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Well, before we
do that I want to remind everyone

01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:52.020
that Frederick Douglass Family
Initiatives is a [inaudible] 501C3

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.820
if you want to make a donation

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.970
to Frederick Douglass Family
Initiatives to help us

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:58.210
with the project or if you
go home and inspire a spouse

01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:00.010
or a family member, to do so.

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.310
We have ...

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.610
&gt;&gt; Kenneth B. Morris, Jr.:
Envelopes on the back table.

01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:03.910
&gt;&gt; Robert J. Benz: Envelopes
on the back table to do that.

01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:05.210
In a moment we're also going to

so if you read the book

you're going to do something

in your community to bring
awareness to something

sounds like kind of an ad campaign

where you have posters everywhere

what we're talking about.

account on a platform like Twitter

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.400
that Frederick Douglass starts to
be critical about his condition

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.300
when he starts to get
educated, we want young people

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:48.270
to take Frederick Douglass' words
and to think about the condition

01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:53.260
of oppression of many people around
the country, people of color,

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.260
the poor and the oppressed, and
how media shapes your consciousness

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:59.750
in who you are and how there are
institutions that can inspire

01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:03.260
to hold people down, there's
systemic racism and issues

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.730
of inequality and injustice.

01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:10.860
Frederick Douglass was about
fighting for human rights for all.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:14.840 position:56%
He spoke up, he was one of the
first statesmen of any race to speak

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.780
out for women's rights
and women's suffrage.

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.230
He spoke out for the
rights of immigrants.

01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:24.230
And it's because he
understood what injustice was.

01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:26.990
And so as we take this
project forward remember

01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:30.640
that this is a project
about human rights

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.900
and that we all have this
history in us and we can carry

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.940
that forward with this work.
