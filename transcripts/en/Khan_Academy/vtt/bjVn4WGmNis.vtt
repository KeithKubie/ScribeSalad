00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's say that we have the
number 5, and we're asked,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.870
what number do we add to
the number 5 to get to 0?

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.620
And you might already know
this, but I'll just draw it out.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.900
So let's say we have a
number line right over here.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
And 0 is sitting
right over there.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.740
And we are already
sitting here at 5.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.995
So to go from 5 to 0, we have
to go five spaces to the left.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.550
And if we're going five
spaces to the left,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.400
that means that we
are adding negative 5.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.780
So if we add negative
5 right here,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.250
then that is going
to get us back to 0.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.750
That is going to get us
back right over here to 0.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.680
And you probably
already knew this.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.900
And this is a pretty maybe
common sense thing right here.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.170
But there's a fancy word for
it called the additive inverse

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.070
property.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.060
And all the additive--
I'll just write it down.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.768
I think it's kind of
ridiculous that it's

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:55.940
given such a fancy word
for such a simple idea--

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.600
additive inverse property.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.650
And it's just the idea
that if you have a number

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.920
and you add the additive
inverse of the number, which

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.320
is what most people call
the negative of the number--

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.530
if you add the negative of
the number to your number,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.920
you're going to get back
to 0 because they have

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.860
the same size, you
could view it that way.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190
They both have a magnitude
of 5, but this is going five

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.060
to the right and then you're
going five back to the left.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.860
Similarly, if you started at--
let me draw another number line

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.310
right over here-- if you
started at negative 3.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.570
If you're starting right
over here at negative 3,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.040
so you've already moved
three spaces to the left,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.030
and someone says, well what
do I have to add to negative 3

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.920
to get back to 0?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.660
Well, I have to move three
spaces to the right now.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.160
And three spaces to the right
is in the positive direction.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.540
So I have to add positive 3.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.270
So if I add positive 3 to
negative 3, I will get 0.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:00.030
So in general, if I have any
number-- if I have 1,725,314

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.170
and I say, what do I need to
add to this to get back to 0?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.010
Well, I have to essentially
go in the opposite direction.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.180
I have to go in the
leftwards direction.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.000
So I'm going to subtract
the same amount.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.880
Or I could say, I'm going
to add the additive inverse,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.270
or I'm going to add the
negative version of it.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.690
So this is going to be
the same thing as adding

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.230
negative 1,725,314 and
that'll just get me back to 0.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.850
Similarly, if I say, what number
do I have to add to negative 7

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.410
to get to 0?

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.430
Well, if I'm already at negative
7, I have to go 7 to the right

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.510
so I have to add positive 7.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.080
And this is going
to be equal to 0.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.460
And this all comes
from the general idea

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.970
5 plus negative 5, 5
plus the negative of 5,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.410
or 5 plus the
additive inverse of 5,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.314
you can just view this as
another way of 5 minus 5.

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:52.730
And if you have
five of something,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.540
and you take away five, you've
learned many, many years ago

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.524
that that is just
going to get you to 0.
