00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.442
I can recall another one like that.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.020
I think it was in ’85, when all that

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.530
androgyny s**t was going on.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.360
What was wild was that the guy who

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.419
looked the most like a bitch
was getting all the women.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.977
Even I had Jheri curls coming out

00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:24.620
and I had my s**t slicked
to the side and all that.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.330
If you wearing baggy s**t
now and you acting hard,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.133
if you from L.A., you
motherf**kers was wearing some

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.357
strange s**t.

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:35.760
We in the club, we getting
our groove on, shaking it up,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.393
and Prince came in.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.550
That's when “Purple Rain” came out, and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.177
Prince was the s**t. You know what I’m sayin’?

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:48.472
Prince had on like a –&nbsp;it was
like a Zorro-type outfit.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:49.730
He had the ruffles that

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.597
come down the front, he had
the big perm fluffed out

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:56.750
and all that.
And this mustache

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.920
that was drawn on his face.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.720
It looked like something that a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.117
figure skater would wear. You know what I’m saying?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.500
And he was with his whole crew, and he

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.713
had this other cat named Micki Free.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.780
And Micki Free was, like, the new cat in Shalamar,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480
that, when he joined the group,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.962
I heard mad cats were like,

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:18.123
“Yo, Shalamar got a new girl in there, man.

00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:19.403
That bitch fine like a motherf**ker.”

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:20.979
They was talking about Micki Free.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.600
OK?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.850
Micki Free is not a girl. Alright?

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.410
They came over where we was at,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.350
Prince talks to my brother.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.717
Hello, Eddie Murphy.

00:01:30.717 --> 00:01:31.550
Prince!

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.383
What's up?

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:33.576
I'm a big fan of your comedies.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:35.397
Ooh, that's hot, Prince.

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:36.560
Would you like to come to my house

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.843
and listen to some music?

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.523
Ooh, that's cool.

00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:40.660
Fruity, get the car.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.420
Assemble your crew.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.429
I'll be outside.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.150
We went up there.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.024
We get there, he puts the
tracks on, tracks was slammin’. You know what I mean?

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:54.360
and we listening to the
music and everything.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.193
We groovin’ at the crib.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:57.540
They got girls over there.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.770
Yeah, nice environment.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.603
It was tight.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.883
This bores me.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.878
Is anyone up for a game of basketball?

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:11.878
[Laughs]

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.400
How about you and your friends

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.121
versus me and the Revolution?

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:22.503
[Laughs]

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.160
So I was like, this n****
must be joking, man.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.140
I mean, I don't know where he's
going with this s**t,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.810
but he was dead serious.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.300
He had his help or whatever go and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.140
get some, like, shorts and sneakers
and gave ’em to us.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.060
And I'm laughing. I'm like,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.370
this is gonna be some funny-ass s**t.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.853
So they come out, right? And I look at them.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.459
And they still got on the same s**t

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.459
they was wearing at the club.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.380
[Laughing]
It was wild.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.830
I was like, I know they
ain't thinking about

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.768
playing ball in that, but they were.

00:02:56.768 --> 00:02:58.290
I said, “Hey, you know what?

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.590
Yo, we gonna call this the
shirts against the blouses.”

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.800
[Laughing]

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.930
And when I said that,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.962
this look came on his face.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:11.050
-Uh-uh.
-He ice grilled me!
-Uh-uh.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.510
And I'm looking back at
him, thinking to myself,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.220
you know, what are you angry about?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.743
I mean, you know where you got that shirt from,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.693
and it damn sure wasn't
the men's department.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:21.740
I mean, I kind of learned something that day.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.050
Never judge a book by its cover.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.662
This cat could ball, man.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.237
Play ball.

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:34.569
He was
crossing cats like Iverson.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.878
Crossed me out!

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:38.350
Made my knees stand together.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.750
He was gettin’ rebounds
like Charles Barkley,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.990
snatchin’ it down.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.150
Shoot the J.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.220
Shoot it!

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.383
Let's run a play.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:47.453
Computer blue.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.666
Darling picky.

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:53.944
They was kind of
settin’ these fruity picks, man.

00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:54.910
You know what I’m sayin’?

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.580
Like, you be trying to check Prince,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.800
and then you got this cat standing

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.507
behind you, and he's getting close to you,

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:01.155
and his hands is out like this.

00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:03.000
You don't really wanna be bent over

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.185
in front of a cat like that.

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:07.070
You know what I’m saying?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.013
Owww!
Prince was incredible!

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.860
Prince, you got a towel, man?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.030
It's kind of hot out here, man.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.430
Why don't you purify yourself

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.603
in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.460
Good!

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.350
In your face, Charlie Murphy.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.990
Good!

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.823
Good hustle.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.149
Yo, man, I'm not on your team.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.866
Uhhnn... Uhhnn... Uhhnn...
Uhhnn... Uhhnn... Uhhnn...

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.150
I mean, it wasn't
even like it was close.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.493
It was a landslide victory.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.703
Game.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.669
Blouses.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.553
I was there!

00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:51.386
I seen it!

00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:52.219
You don't believe me?

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.443
You think I'm making it up?

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:54.276
You think I'm trying to,

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:55.543
uh, you know,

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:58.410
enhance the story because I'm involved

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.380
and try to give myself
an excuse for losing

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.013
’cause I'm telling you
a story about Prince?

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:08.410
I dare you to challenge Prince to a

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.240
game of ball one-on-one.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.123
Challenge him! Aight?

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.100
And then make sure your people
is there to see the game!

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.800
’Cause you might get embarrassed.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.653
Trust me.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.620
Alright. He beat you in basketball,
and then what happened?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.033
After it was all over,

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.425
he took us in the house
and served us pancakes.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.252
Pancakes.

00:05:36.558 --> 00:05:39.558
I gotta admit, though – it was a good game.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.568
I wish I could say the same for you

00:05:42.568 --> 00:05:44.603
and your crew of flunkies.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.830
Do you guys want some grapes?

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.360
I mean, you know, there's
some great storytellers

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.170
in the world that we live in today, man.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.253
Bitches.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.963
Who the f**k can make up that s**t?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.030
We gonna hang out with Rick James tonight.
You know what I’m sayin’?

00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.900
Here he comes out the
room, and I look at him,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.060
and I'm not bulls**tting, man,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.060
I seen, like – like a orange... His
aura or whatever? I seen it.

00:06:22.063 --> 00:06:23.284
It was orange.

00:06:23.284 --> 00:06:24.778
♪ Give it to me baby ♪

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.560
We started kicking it, and
he was mad n*****ish, man,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.980
which was, you know, right up my alley.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.191
I'm one of the baddest
motherf**kers of all time.

00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.375
One of the best singers,

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.290
and one of the best-lookin’
motherf**kers you've ever seen.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.520
Hold my drink, bitch.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.710
He’d walked up to any chick

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.913
and lick the whole
side of their face, man.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.154
I'm Rick James, bitch.

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:48.913
Enjoy yourself.

00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:50.450
[Laughs]

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.520
We got closer, started hanging out.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.780
My brother didn't do any of this s**t.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.250
So at night, when Eddie would break out,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.930
we would all be getting crazy and wild.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.570
If I was hanging with Rick,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.170
he had this thing with me where he

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.330
used to always, like, f**k with me, man.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.240
I don't know what started it.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.193
Charlie, he was hanging out with the big dogs, you know?

00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:12.026
Charlie didn't know.

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:14.470
He was doing crazy things, and
I had to straighten him out.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.400
Sometimes, I had to go upside his head.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.030
Things, like, escalated to the point where, you know,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.550
my man got too familiar, and I ended up

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.034
having to whoop his ass, man. You know? Because

00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:28.290
he would step across
the line...habitually.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.367
He's a habitual line-stepper.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.900
First time, you know, I had to end up

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.900
whooping his ass, uh...we went to Studio 54.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.383
We walking up into the VIP section, and, um...

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.301
I'm looking around and
seeing who was there,

00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:44.851
and looking at the girls

00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:46.510
and everything, and all of
a sudden, I heard someone go.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.607
Charlie Murphy!

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:51.916
That was cold-blooded!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.143
[Laughs]

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.310
He had this ring on to commemorate

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.397
this song he had put out called “Unity.”

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:05.391
And this was imprinted in
that black head of his

00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:08.053
for at least a week.

00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:08.886
Unityyy!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.450
Eddie and
everybody else thought that

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.006
that was the funniest s**t.

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:17.110
So that threw me in a weird
space, ’cause I'm like,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.130
yeah, this is Rick James.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.750
He's a star.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.195
I'm Rick James, bitch!

00:08:23.234 --> 00:08:25.720
This is a celebration, bitch!
[Laughs]

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.270
Maybe I'm overreacting.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.650
I actually went there.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.904
Like, maybe I shouldn't do nothin’.

00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:31.867
But my ghetto side was going,

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:33.881
“Yo, stomp this motherf**ker out right here.

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:36.418
What the f**k is wrong with him?”

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:37.251
I drunk some wine, and

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.677
I'm just getting started, bitches!

00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:40.227
[Laughs]

00:08:40.227 --> 00:08:41.740
He totally just wrote me off, like

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.193
I'm that n**** to steal on. 
You know what I’m sayin’?

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:45.420
But what, he gonna smack me back?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.220
I'm Rick James. He’s Charlie Murphy.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.210
I waited, ’cause I knew
what hotel he was stayin’ in.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.910
Eddie and them went home.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.870
I said, I'll be right back.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.440
I shot over to the hotel,
went up to his room,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.738
knocked on the door.

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:00.260
So then he comes in there, and I said,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.988
“Look, bitch, I'm Rick James. 
Smacked him!”

00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:06.988
[Laughs]

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.990
Oh! Charlie Murphy!

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:13.190
He had his hand cocked
to throw another right hand.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.920
When he was comin’ for it, I just came.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.117
Bow!

00:09:16.117 --> 00:09:17.410
Caught him with the front.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.640
He’ll tell it like he gave me some kind of

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.260
Bruce Lee cross kick or somethin’.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.750
I kicked the s**t out of him, man.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.750
[Screams]

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.798
The wind was knocked out of him.

00:09:33.798 --> 00:09:36.370
And then he screams out,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.203
“Security!”

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.138
The one in the front,
he had crooked eyes.

00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:42.090
His one eye was lookin’ at me,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.140
and the other one was lookin’ at Rick.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.400
Rick had edged over by the window.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.290
Now, Darkness, the tables are turned.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.012
Do with him whatever you'd like.

00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:53.660
You motherf**kers take one more step,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.676
I'm kicking this n**** out
the motherf**kin’ window.

00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.560
Bobby, freeze!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.120
You know you was wrong for
what you did to me earlier.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.434
Look what you did to my face!

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.320
I'm sorry, Charlie Murphy.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.260
It was an accident.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.560
I was having too much fun.

00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.763
I offer you a truce:

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.500
the stickiest of the icky.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.910
You wanna smoke with
the old boy Rick James?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.640
Yo, man, my forehead is bumpin’, man.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.460
Now that you mention it,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.181
I think I'm bleedin’ inside my chest.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.760
But I got the medicine.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.775
Bitch, come over here and
have sex with Charlie Murphy!

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.830
I'm Rick James, bitch.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.663
[Clapping]

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.843
That was how that
particular incident ended,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.113
but it wasn't the last time
I had to whoop his ass...
whoop his ass... whoop his ass...

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.010
Don't you think Charlie's a little

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.140
old to be takin’ karate?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.868
He probably taking it
with the little kids.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.390
Yeah, Charlie whooped my ass in his dreams.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.020
I told you, Charlie had delusions
of grandeur in his head.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.810
The Studio 54 thing, that blew over.
You know what I’m sayin’?

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.500
But then, you know, here we go again.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.049
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.480
[Laughs]

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.118
Rick is incorrigible. You know?

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:03.413
He shows up at my
brother's house f**ked up.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.320
- Nice place, n****.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.608
So he had these dirty cowboy boots on.

00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:13.580
Pushes us out of the
way, barges in our house.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.970
My brother had these brand
new couches –&nbsp;they was suede. Right?

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.620
And he gets on the couch and says,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.114
“Why don't I stretch out?”

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:22.051
[Laughs]

00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:25.020
And just started grinding
mud on this new couch, man.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.463
Yeah, I remember grinding
my feet in Eddie's couch.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.280
You remember why you did it?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.738
’Cause Eddie could buy another one.

00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:34.428
F**k your couch, n****.

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:36.352
Buy another one, you rich motherf**ker.

00:11:36.352 --> 00:11:37.798
F**k your couch, n****!

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.499
F**k your couch!

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.510
Darknesses! Darknesses!

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.750
Because of my complexion,
he used to call me Darkness.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.170
He calls me and my brother Darkness.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.080
He calls us Darkness Brothers.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.695
See, this is long before Wesley Snipes.

00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:52.464
Back then, we was the
blackest n****s on the planet,

00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:53.929
according to Rick James.

00:11:53.929 --> 00:11:56.435
Eddie –&nbsp;both of them
was Brother Darkness.

00:11:56.435 --> 00:11:58.255
Twin Brother Darkness.

00:11:58.255 --> 00:11:59.583
And we standing there lookin’ at him,

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.530
he's lookin’ right in our eyes,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.023
as he grinds his mud.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:05.900
See, I never just did
things just to do them.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.733
Come on.

00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:07.610
I mean, what am I gonna do,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.850
just all of a sudden just jump up

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.309
and grind my feet in somebody's couch

00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:12.280
like it’s, you know, somethin’ to do?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.730
Come on. I got a little
more sense than that.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.729
Yeah I remember grindin’
my feet in Eddie's couch.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:19.562
[Tape rewinding]

00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:23.540
See, I never just did
things just to do them.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.373
Come on.

00:12:24.373 --> 00:12:25.206
I mean, what am I gonna do,

00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:26.530
just all of a sudden just jump up

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.093
and grind my feet in somebody's couch

00:12:28.093 --> 00:12:29.960
like it’s, you know, somethin’ to do?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.410
Come on. I got a little
more sense than that.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.771
Yeah I remember grindin’ my feet

00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:36.570
in Eddie's couch.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.324
But then it was like, you know
what? Let’s handle this.

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:40.907
We went over there.

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:42.990
Hey! Charlie Murphy!

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.643
We held him down, and we
just whaled on his legs.

00:12:46.643 --> 00:12:48.893
Auuughhh!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.850
Auuughhh! You Darkness, you black, midnight,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.339
evil motherf**ker! Black magic, Darkness!

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.100
You raw darkness, you...f**kin’...
delirious...motherf**ker. Ahh!

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.085
You are cold as ice.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.183
But still, Rick James, even after
taking a beating like that...

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:10.809
F**k your couch, n****.

00:13:11.642 --> 00:13:12.770
This motherf**ker’s goin’ out.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.300
His legs is like linguine.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.115
I've been kicked out of
better homes than this!

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.353
I'll be back,

00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:21.800
you black motherf**ker!

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.657
Wide-nose-havin’ motherf**ker!

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.531
They should've never
gave you n****s money!

00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:30.743
You don't know how to appreciate s**t!

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.790
You know you can get another couch!

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.756
What am I gonna do about
my legs, Eddie Murphy?

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:41.530
My brother, you know –&nbsp;he's a lot
more compassionate than I am.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.350
He's lookin’, and the limo's drivin’ off.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.445
And he said, “Wow, man. Rick really needs help.”

00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:49.421
I was like, “Yo, we
just gave him some help.

00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:51.700
Bust his f**kin’ ass and s**t.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.860
I bet you he won't come over here

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.440
and disrespect like that again.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.540
Wrong.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.635
Wrong!

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:59.170
We talkin’ about Rick James, man.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.525
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.

00:14:00.525 --> 00:14:03.707
[Laughs]
