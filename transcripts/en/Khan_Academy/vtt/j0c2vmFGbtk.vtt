00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:02.958
Voiceover: Let's think a little
bit about the labor market.

00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:04.469
In all of these videos,
whether we're talking

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.405
about renting units or hiring people,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.127
these are huge oversimplifications,
but we're doing it

00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:12.402
in this way so we can apply
some of these basic ideas

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.409
that we're being exposed to in this survey

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.541
of microeconomics, so that we can apply

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.408
those basic ideas to real world things.

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:20.802
It's important to realize we're making

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:23.969
huge oversimplifications and
often times the real context

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.122
can be more complicated
or a little bit nuanced,

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:28.135
but it gives us a way of
thinking about things.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:30.924
This is the unskilled labor
market, so people who don't

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:34.595
have any specific training or
experience for a given job.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:36.989
The vertical axis is
their wage rate per hour.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.886
It's essentially the price of labor.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.321
This little gap here
shows I started at zero,

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.923
but then I jumped up to five, six, seven.

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.719
This right here is a quantity of labor.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.719
We're measuring that in
terms of millions of hours

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:48.588
per month.

00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:50.258
Once again, we have this
little gap here, so we can jump

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:54.386
to 20 million hours, 21 million hours.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.990
It's important to realize,
when we think about demand

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.055
in the labor market, we're not talking

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:01.552
about individual consumers, we're talking

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:03.219
about employers.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.593
In most cases, demand comes

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:06.551
from individual consumers,
but now the demand

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.857
is coming from employers.

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:10.390
These are the people who are
essentially buying labor.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.968
The supply is not coming
from corporations.

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.470
The supply is coming from
the people who provide labor,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.689
so now it's coming from
individual workers.

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:21.052
Now it is coming from workers.

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.323
Let's just say that this market starts off

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.724
completely unregulated,
so it has a natural

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:34.989
equilibrium price or
equilibrium wage at $6 an hour

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:38.660
and an equilibrium
quantity of labor supplied,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.046
which is 22 millions of hours per month.

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:47.389
Let's say the government
in this hypothetical city

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.858
or country says, "You know what?

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:52.723
"$6 is a really low wage.

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.056
"We have trouble imagining
how people live well

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:57.048
"off of a $6 an hour wage."

00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:59.256
They say this right over here is too low.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.721
The government does not
like it and maybe many

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.723
of their voters are
people making that wage,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.129
so they say, "Hey, you know what?

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.921
"We are going pass some
well-intentioned legislation.

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.213
"We are going to pass a minimum wage.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.213
"We are going to pass a law, minimum wage,

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:18.722
"that says any employer has
to pay at least $7 an hour."

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.257
$7 an hour.

00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:22.923
It has to be at least $7 an
hour, so this right over here

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:26.990
is a price floor.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.257
This is a minimum price in the market.

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:30.857
When we talked about rent control,

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.461
that was a price ceiling.

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.803
That was a maximum price for rent,

00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:37.391
now this is a minimum price for labor.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:40.991
Since the price floor, this
minimum price, is higher

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:42.924
than the actual clearing
price, it's going to distort

00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:43.963
the market.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:47.397
Our price floor is right over here, $7.

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:52.889
This right over here is our minimum wage.

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.396
What's going to happen here?

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:56.398
If you look at the demand side of things,

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:57.861
the employers are going to say, "Wow!

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.396
"If I have to pay $7 an
hour now, I can only afford

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:04.264
"21 million hours of labor."

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:06.222
They're going to say,
"I can only afford now

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:12.056
"21 million hours of labor,"
but if you look at the workers

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:19.533
they're going to say, "Gee,
if I can make $7 an hour,

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.681
"more people are going
to be willing to work."

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.267
Either an individual might say,

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:26.461
"If I was working 40 hours
a week making $6 an hour.

00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:28.014
"If I'm making $7 an
hour, I'm willing to work

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:29.865
"45 hours a week."

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:31.931
Or there might be a
student who's on the fence,

00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:32.680
who says, "Wow!

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.194
"Now wages have gone up
enough that it makes sense

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:35.264
"for me to work."

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:37.861
There might be someone
who's retired and now,

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.462
at $6 wasn't enough for them
to come out of retirement,

00:03:40.462 --> 00:03:41.594
but $7 is.

00:03:41.594 --> 00:03:44.335
Maybe a stay at home parent
now says $7 is enough

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:45.663
for them to come out of retirement

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:48.329
or not stay at home anymore.

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.693
The labor, the quantity
supplied of labor, in terms

00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:54.650
of hours, will increase.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.049
At $7 an hour, people
will be willing to supply

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.707
that much labor, but
what's going to happen

00:04:02.707 --> 00:04:05.070
in this situation right over here?

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.468
In this situation you
have all of these people

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.373
who want to work, but there's only demand

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.669
for this much work.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.090
Right here, this is going to
be an oversupply of labor.

00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:16.873
Another way to think about
it, there's only jobs

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:21.040
for 21 million people now
and now 23 million people

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.468
want to work.

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:24.956
You're going to have 2
million people who are,

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:27.001
by the classical definition of unemployed,

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.539
people who are looking for work

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.670
who can't find work now.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.707
Once again, this is
completely oversimplified,

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:34.734
because at this point right over here,

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.039
based on the way I just viewed that,

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.735
you would have no
unemployment and we all know

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:40.873
even when the economy is humming maximumly

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:43.611
and there's no regulation,
there is some unemployment,

00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:45.126
just due to frictions in the market,

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.694
people just randomly
quitting jobs or looking

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:51.129
for a new job, so you
could almost view this

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.267
as excess unemployment.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:53.662
Or you could view this as just a very

00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:56.280
oversimplified model and in
the ideal world you'd get

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.861
close to zero unemployment.

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.061
Now you have more people looking for jobs,

00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:02.662
because the wages have
gone, but fewer jobs,

00:05:02.662 --> 00:05:06.159
because the employers
are forced to pay more.

00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:07.994
If we make all of these
assumptions in the model

00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:10.662
and you just want to say how
many fewer jobs are there,

00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:12.462
because this, obviously, we're
talking about more people

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.662
even looking for jobs
because the perceived wages

00:05:14.662 --> 00:05:15.859
have gone up.

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:19.059
In the absolute level,
based on these linear supply

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.790
and demand curves, before there was demand

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.099
for 22 million jobs and that was

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.933
what the quantity demanded
was and that's also

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.682
where the quantity supplied was,

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:30.599
but now its only 21 million.

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.183
Based on this model, you're going

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:36.416
to have 1 million fewer jobs.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.351
When you think about
it in terms of surplus.

00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.722
Before the minimum
wage, the entire surplus

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:48.850
was this entire area over here.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.850
This entire area that's
below the demand curve

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.786
and above the supply curve.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.763
This entire area was the total surplus

00:05:55.763 --> 00:05:58.600
and it was being divided
between the consumer surplus

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.385
and the producer surplus.

00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:02.849
This right over here, between the price

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.684
and the supply curve was
the producer surplus.

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:07.786
The producer surplus, remember
the producers of labor

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:09.349
are the individual workers.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.986
This was the benefit above and beyond

00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:14.452
the opportunity cost that
the workers were getting

00:06:14.452 --> 00:06:17.453
was this area right over here
that I'm doing in dark white

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:20.718
or filled in white and
the consumer surplus

00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:23.715
or the employer surplus here was the value

00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:28.683
that the employers were
getting above and beyond

00:06:28.683 --> 00:06:30.849
the price that they had to pay.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.515
Now, in this situation of a minimum wage,

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:37.787
now this is the set price,
this is the quantity of labor

00:06:37.787 --> 00:06:39.349
that is demanded.

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.451
What you lose now, the
surplus that we lose

00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:45.418
is this quantity right over here.

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:49.719
We could figure out
that area quite easily.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:53.785
Let's see, this height right
over here is 1 million hours

00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:58.435
per month, so it's going to be 1 million.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.183
I'll just write 1, we'll just
remember it's on millions.

00:07:01.183 --> 00:07:09.034
Times this height right over
here, which is $2 per hour.

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:10.391
Times one half.

00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.456
If we just multiply these,
we get this whole rectangle

00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:17.200
for the area of the triangle,
we multiply it times one half.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.323
That gives us exactly 1 and the units

00:07:21.323 --> 00:07:25.391
are dollars per hour times
millions of hours per month,

00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:27.867
gives us millions of dollars per month.

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:35.722
It becomes $1 million
per month of surplus,

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:41.617
of benefit above and
beyond, of total benefit

00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:45.200
that is lost to this market
because of this regulation,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.325
if you assume all of the
things in this model.

00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:50.323
Just like we talked
about in the last video,

00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:54.224
we have a $1 million per
month dead weight loss.

00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:58.535
Now, not everyone loses here.

00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:04.189
Because the price is set up
over here, for the people

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:10.323
who are working those first
21 million hours per month,

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.455
their producer surplus has now increased,

00:08:13.455 --> 00:08:15.790
because the space between
what they're getting

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.392
and their opportunity
cost has now increased.

00:08:18.392 --> 00:08:21.453
For those lucky enough
to actually have a job,

00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:25.655
those workers now do
have a higher surplus,

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:29.456
but for those employers,
which is on the demand side

00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:34.724
right now, who are employing
those first 21 million hours

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:41.057
of labor, they now have a
smaller consumer surplus

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:43.789
or demand surplus or
employer surplus right there.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:50.389
For the first 21 million units
of labor, it's redistributing

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:54.187
the pie between the
employers and the workers,

00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:58.094
but then because you are
making the wage higher,

00:08:58.094 --> 00:09:01.176
it's reducing the overall
demand, so there is,

00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:03.854
if you believe this model,
some job destruction

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:05.467
taking place.
