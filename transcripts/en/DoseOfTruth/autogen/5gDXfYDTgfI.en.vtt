in the next part of this story there's

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
in the next part of this story there's
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.640

some parallels with Abraham and and
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.260
some parallels with Abraham and and
that's built into the narrative I think

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
that's built into the narrative I think
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250
that's built into the narrative I think
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.609
echoing forward otherwise it loses its
its continuity and there's a famine in

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
its continuity and there's a famine in
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.060
its continuity and there's a famine in
the land that Isaac sin and God tells

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
that's really rough that's what are you
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840
that's really rough that's what are you
gonna do about that you know because

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
gonna do about that you know because
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179
gonna do about that you know because
you're you're basically screwed both

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

ways if you have the person you love
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.359
ways if you have the person you love
around then you have to put up with this

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369

trend is creature that they allied

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
trend is creature that they allied
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410
trend is creature that they allied
themselves with and if you if you get

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
themselves with and if you if you get
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999
themselves with and if you if you get
rid of them completely well then you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
rid of them completely well then you
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.500
rid of them completely well then you
know you don't have your child anymore

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
know you don't have your child anymore
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.460
know you don't have your child anymore
so it's

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
so it's
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170
so it's
very very difficult position and so

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
very very difficult position and so
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780
very very difficult position and so
that's another example of the realism I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
that's another example of the realism I
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.300
that's another example of the realism I
think of the stories now Isaac who's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
think of the stories now Isaac who's
 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.640
think of the stories now Isaac who's
hypothetically on his deathbed asks Esau

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
hypothetically on his deathbed asks Esau
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800
hypothetically on his deathbed asks Esau
to hunt for venison because he likes

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
to hunt for venison because he likes
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.450
to hunt for venison because he likes
venison and he's happy that his son is a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
venison and he's happy that his son is a
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.820
venison and he's happy that his son is a
hunter and Rebekah over here is this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
hunter and Rebekah over here is this
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.400
hunter and Rebekah over here is this
and so she conspires with Jacob to to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
and so she conspires with Jacob to to
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.850
and so she conspires with Jacob to to
slaughter two small goats and make his

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
slaughter two small goats and make his
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.490
slaughter two small goats and make his
father some stew because he wants Esau

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
father some stew because he wants Esau
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080
father some stew because he wants Esau
to make him stew out of venison but

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
to make him stew out of venison but
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.620
to make him stew out of venison but
Rebecca who's being I would say let's

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630
Rebecca who's being I would say let's
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.140
Rebecca who's being I would say let's
say slightly deceitful or horribly lying

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
say slightly deceitful or horribly lying
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.840
say slightly deceitful or horribly lying
that would be more accurate

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850
that would be more accurate
 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.850
that would be more accurate
she conspires with Jacob so Jacob kills

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
she conspires with Jacob so Jacob kills
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.430
she conspires with Jacob so Jacob kills
two little goats kids and boils up a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
two little goats kids and boils up a
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.180
two little goats kids and boils up a
stew and then he puts on some goat skins

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190
stew and then he puts on some goat skins
 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070
stew and then he puts on some goat skins
because Esau was a hairy character and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
because Esau was a hairy character and
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.600
because Esau was a hairy character and
and Rebecca dresses Isaac in esau is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
and Rebecca dresses Isaac in esau is
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.280
and Rebecca dresses Isaac in esau is
clothing because Isaac can't see very

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
clothing because Isaac can't see very
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.949
clothing because Isaac can't see very
well at this point and so then Jacob

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
well at this point and so then Jacob
 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.460
well at this point and so then Jacob
goes into his father with the stew and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470
goes into his father with the stew and
 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.870
goes into his father with the stew and
he's trying to disguise his voice but it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
he's trying to disguise his voice but it
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.500
he's trying to disguise his voice but it
doesn't work very well and so Isaac asks

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
doesn't work very well and so Isaac asks
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.690
doesn't work very well and so Isaac asks
him to come close and Jacob puts out his

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
him to come close and Jacob puts out his
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.430

arm with the goat skin on it and and

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440
arm with the goat skin on it and and
 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.979
arm with the goat skin on it and and
Isaac smells him too and he smells like

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
Isaac smells him too and he smells like
 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.949
Isaac smells him too and he smells like
he so and which maybe wasn't the best

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
he so and which maybe wasn't the best
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.170
he so and which maybe wasn't the best
thing but and feels like him and and so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180
thing but and feels like him and and so
 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.370

because Isaac thinks he's on his
