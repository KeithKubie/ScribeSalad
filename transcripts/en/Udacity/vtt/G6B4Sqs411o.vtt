00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.270
What we would like to
build is a procedure for

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.830
reducing a system of equations
to a simple a form as possible.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.450
Ideally, finding the unique
solution of a system if it exists.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.940
We'll start by informally
describing the procedure and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.340
using it to solve some
example systems of equations.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630
Then we'll explore some special cases
that can occur during the algorithm.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.400
Once we have a better intuition about
the algorithm then we'll begin to write

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.850
code which will define
the algorithm's precise operation.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.050
The algorithm we will discuss is
a classic algorithm called Gaussian

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.280
elimination.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.760
Though it is named after the nineteenth
century German mathematician,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.290
Carl Gauss.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.150
The algorithm was known to the Chinese
as early as the second century BCE.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.990
The basic idea of Gaussian elimination
is to gradually clear variables and

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.820
successive equations.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.220
So the first equation will have
all the variables x, y, and z.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.850
Then the next equation will
end up with just y and z.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.610
And then the last equation
will just have z.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.920
That way the last equation just
becomes z equals some number and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.790
then since the second
equation only has y and

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
z and we know the value of z,
this allows us to find the value of y.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.600
Finally, we use the values of y and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.910
z in the first equation to find
the value of x, giving us the solution.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.770
Presuming there is a unique solution,
after all.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.160
We can do this by adding or

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.950
subtracting appropriate amounts of an
equation from all equations underneath.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.060
Let's look at this example system.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.905
x-3y+z = 4.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:43.550
-3x+9y+z = 0 and y-z = 1.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.910
In order to clear the x term
from the second equation,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.860
we can add to three times the first
equation and to the second.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.000
Remember that adding or

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.720
subtracting multiples of
equations is a valid operation.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.000
This transforms the second
equation into 4z = 12.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.540
Now we could go ahead and use the second
equation to find the value of z.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.780
But for now we're going to ignore
the short cut and show how the procedure

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.150
works in general like we did before
with the x term in the first equation.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.990
We want there to be a y term
in the second equation,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.450
so that we can use it to clear y
terms below the second equation.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.820
That way we have successive
loss of variables.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.370
If like in this case, there is no
y term in the second equation,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.250
we look to below the second equation for
one with a y term.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.390
Then we can swap the second equation for
the equation with the y term.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.100
In this case,
we'll swap equations two and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.770
three to get a y term in the second row.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.350
Again, this is one of our
valid equation operations.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.900
Now the second equation is y-z = 1.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.910
And the third equation is 4z = 12.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.450
We have no y terms underneath
the second equation so

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.130
there are no more terms to clear.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.660
Finally, since we're
at the bottom equation

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.330
there are no terms underneath
the z term in the third equation.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.730
Notice that our system of equations
is in a special form each variable

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.410
that appears as a leading term doesn't
appear in any further equations.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.630
this form is sometimes
given a special name,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.770
such as triangular form or
row echelon form.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.690
In this lesson we will
call it triangular form.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.980
However, this system does not
represent the same set of planes

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.630
as the system we started with by
adding and subtracting equations.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.290
We do change the planes involved.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.640
However, we have changed
them in such a way.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.500
That the common intersections
of the planes remains the same.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.610
Once we've reached triangular form,
our next task is to clear upwards.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.550
So that way we isolate each
variable in its own equation.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.480
First, we're going to solve for

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.610
z in the bottom equation by
multiplying it through by one-fourth.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.310
Notice that this is the third equation
operation we had defined earlier.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.926
This gives us the bottom
equation now reading z = 3.

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:11.120
To clear upwards we can add the third
equation to the second equation.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.960
This makes the second
equation become y = 4.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.099
Then subtracting the third equation from
the first equation gives us x-3y = 1.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.200
Notice that z is now in its own column.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.438
Now let's focus on y,
we've already solved for y, y = 4.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:37.020
So the last step is to clear upwards so
that y is also in its own column.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.350
To do this, we add three times
the second equation to the first

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.320
which makes the first
equation become x = 13.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.590
Using just the three operations
we spelled out earlier

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.850
we have found the sole point of
intersection of the three planes

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.400
described in the original
system of equations.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.920
Note that we can check
that the point 13, 4,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.234
3 satisfies all three equations
in the original system.

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:08.447
I'd like to run through this set
of operations one more time but

00:05:08.447 --> 00:05:13.793
this time including a plot of the three
planes that these equations represent.

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:18.014
That way you can see visually what
Gaussian elimination is doing.

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:22.399
One thing to keep in mind is that
the common intersection of the planes

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:26.256
defined by these three equations
should never change during

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:28.650
our operations that we use.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.990
After the first operation, notice that
the green plane has rotated along its

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.650
intersection line with the red plane and
is now entirely horizontal.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.780
The second operation,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.010
which swaps two equations, just changes
the color of two of the planes.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.400
The third operation, which multiplies
equation three by one-fourth,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.940
doesn't change the blue plane at all.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.470
By adding the third equation
to the second equation and

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.990
isolating the y variable.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.360
The green plane which is y = 4, is now
perfectly orthogonal to the y axis.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.160
Next, clearing the z variable
from the first equation

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.220
means that the red plane no longer
has any dependency on the z variable.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.480
Finally, eliminating the y
variable from the first equation

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.630
makes the read plane perfectly
orthogonal to the x axis and

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.240
now the meeting point of the three
planes is easily identifiable.
