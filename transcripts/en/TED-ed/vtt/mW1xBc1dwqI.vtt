00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.197
These are grizzly bears.

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:20.386
As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:21.755
But once you get to know them better,

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.332
they're not as ferocious as you might think.

00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:27.432
They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems,

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.976
but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:32.277
In order to protect them,

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:33.896
it's important to know

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.525
why do grizzlies choose certain areas

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.609
to inhabit in the first place?

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.818
Let's look at a threatened population of bears

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:42.783
living in the rocky mountains of Canada.

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:44.700
Remember those giant claws?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.911
Well, they're not for what you might think.

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.564
They have evolved specifically

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.673
for digging up energy-rich roots.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:53.291
It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants.

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:56.425
The ones that live here are almost vegetarians.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.587
You see, unlike other predators,

00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:00.070
grizzlies have diverse diets

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.009
that can include up to 90% vegetation.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.262
However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult.

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:08.980
In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.183
where it's really nice and green for part of the year

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:13.342
and really cold for the other part.

00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:15.856
If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:17.895
for the cold part of the year.

00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:20.819
So, you either have to migrate like geese

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.515
or hibernate like ground squirrels.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.323
Grizzly bears hibernate.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:28.099
Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.067
During the summer, they have to pack on

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:32.705
enough body fat to survive the winter.

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.207
Without it, they would either starve

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:35.577
or not have enough energy

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:38.120
to successfully produce offspring.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.569
But when you eat mostly plants,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.340
it's hard to gain a lot of weight.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.960
You need to be a highly effective forager.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.593
So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.137
and harvest them like crops

00:01:48.137 --> 00:01:51.703
at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious.

00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:54.749
This will happen in different places at different times.

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.173
In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat

00:01:57.173 --> 00:02:00.545
up to 200,000 berries in a single day.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.924
Therefore, to protect these bears,

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:04.553
researchers want to take a closer look

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.973
at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:11.529
to identify areas of the highest quality habitat.

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:15.455
This begins 700 kilometers up in space.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.579
Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.570
that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.482
Every species of plant reflects

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:25.178
a unique combination of wave lengths,

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.251
called spectral signatures

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.750
that act like different chords on a piano

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.921
but use light instead of sound.

00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:35.509
These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.682
and are combined like frames in a movie

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:39.781
so you can watch the vegetation grow

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:41.759
over an entire summer.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.301
Simultaneously, the movements of bears

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.303
wearing GPS collars are monitored

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.722
to see how they respond to the ebb and flow

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:51.310
of nutrition throughout their habitat.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.351
Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps,

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.739
these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.874
could be used for grizzly bear conservation

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:01.675
in a number of ways.

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:04.735
First, they help calculate the carrying capacity

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:06.116
of the study area.

00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:07.618
In other words, how many bears

00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.841
can the remaining habitat support?

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.501
Is there enough food to go around?

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:13.977
Second, the maps show

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:16.693
where bears will be foraging at specific times.

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.263
We can prevent disturbing the bears

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:19.522
and stressing them out

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:22.828
by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.918
Finally, the maps can be used

00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:26.952
to predict the effects of climate change,

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:28.616
where shifting annual temperatures

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.658
will alter the rate of plant growth,

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:34.009
throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.449
This provides less food

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.574
and increases competition between bears.

00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:41.519
Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.796
These habitat maps made from satellite imagery

00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:45.956
can not only help conserve grizzly bears

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:48.087
but all sorts of different species.

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:49.587
They aid us in understanding

00:03:49.587 --> 00:03:51.340
how ecosystems function,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.715
where they are threatened,

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:54.598
and how we can try to keep our fragile,

00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:57.184
amazing planet intact.
