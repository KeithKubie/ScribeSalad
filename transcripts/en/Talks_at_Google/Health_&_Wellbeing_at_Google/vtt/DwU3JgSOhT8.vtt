[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.395
I'm happy to introduce
Clayton Lewis, who

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:08.880
is the CEO of Arivale.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040
And Arivale was the
startup of the year.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.560
I hope that you read
the description.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.546
He's an Ironman triathlete,
accomplished executive,

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:22.880
a person that's very passionate
about wellness health.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.410
He has a really
kind of rich career

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.020
in this space over the last
couple of decades, I believe.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.890
So today we're going to talk
about what his company's doing,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.500
what his personal motivation
behind the wellness

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.830
is, what are their latest
discoveries in the area, what

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.140
are the tools and the data
that his company's generating,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.960
and how is that influencing
lives of his customers,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.090
of friends, family, community,
and how it can influence

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.040
the world in the near future.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.120
So let's start with--

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.325
like, can you give a
short introspection

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.114
of your motivation
of your successes

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:03.030
so far, your failures?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.120
And we can go from there.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.820
So, for whatever
reason, my whole life I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.660
have been really passionate
around health and wellness.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.270
And so I was raised in small
towns in Wyoming and Idaho.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.580
And my sister shares
a story that when

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.017
she was 6 years old everyone
had a piece of birthday cake,

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:23.475
and then all of a sudden, boom,
the birthday cake was gone.

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:24.340
[SNAPPING] And I threw it away.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.580
I'm like, OK, you've
had your piece of sugar.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.940
And not that you need to
be this crazy or possessed,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.840
which I'm not.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.427
But it's interesting
to think about sort

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.420
of what brings
passion to each of you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.800
and what's most interesting.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
And so my very
first business when

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
I was in college, which was back
in 1977 in eastern Washington,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.070
was I opened a health bar.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.880
And so way before
people were thinking

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.130
about supplements and
juicing, et cetera,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.230
I was just drawn to that.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.750
Then for about a decade
I worked in politics.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.010
And so I was one of the youngest
chiefs of staffs in Congress

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.960
and worked for a
Congresswoman who

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.420
was the only
microbiologist in Congress.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.920
This is sort of the
theme, weaves through.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.520
Then I did five startups
and took two of them public.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.780
And so was fortunate to partner
with really extraordinary

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.870
entrepreneurs and then help
them scale their businesses

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630
very quickly.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.160
Then I went and did a startup
in health and wellness,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.820
and it was backed
by Maveron, which

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.590
is a consumer-only
venture capital

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.630
firm founded by Howard Schultz.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.340
So then Howard and
Dan Levitan asked

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.260
me to join as a
venture capitalist.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.050
And so for eight years I
looked at health and wellness.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.470
And I walked away
thinking, OK, this

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.420
is a very tattered category.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.050
And I think the
wellness category

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.180
has failed for three reasons.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.230
So the first reason
is, people on the whole

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.690
don't wake up and think,
today I want to be healthy.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.360
You know, chocolate
cake, risk of diabetes

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.460
tends to be a
pretty clear choice.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.370
Eat that cake.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.870
You know?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.150
The second-- what's
interesting--

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.280
and especially you know
this in your world--

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.230
data actually paralyzes people.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.600
And so it's so interesting
because consumers are

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400
spending millions of dollars.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.190
You know, how many people do
you know who have a Fitbit?

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.260
They're trying to
take 10,000 steps,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.630
and they have absolutely no
idea where they're going.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.910
Because the data is not linked
to something they care about.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.230
And then finally--
this may be heresy,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.660
but a lot of young, brilliant
entrepreneurs would come in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.920
and say, oh, it's all about
the app or the shiny device.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.800
And we believe passionately
at Arivale you actually need

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.030
a person in the relationship.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.640
So, as a venture capitalist, we
at Maveron target individuals

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.700
we want to back.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.590
And so a gentleman who's our
co-founder, Dr. Lee Hood,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.550
was at the top of my list.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.060
And the reason is, Lee is one
of the first scientists that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.980
mapped the human genome.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.860
He's considered the
father of systems biology.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.320
If you're a scientist it's
an extraordinary honor

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.780
to be invited to join one of the
National Academies of Science.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.020
Lee's one of 15
people in all three.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.630
But then, wearing my
venture capital hat,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.720
Lee's founded or
co-founded 15 companies

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.180
that today are valued
at roughly $200 billion.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.450
So he's always launched
companies into industries.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.870
And so I'd been courting
Lee for about four years.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.877
And he said, Clayton,
let's go have dinner.

00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:15.960
And I'm thinking, game on.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.370
I get to back Lee Hood.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.190
And he said, OK,
science and data

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.720
is to a point where we can look
at individuals as a system--

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.820
look at their genomics,
look at their blood,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.550
look at their gut microbiome,
look at their saliva.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.820
And by taking this holistic
view of individuals,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.700
we can actually help them
optimize their wellness

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.280
and, more importantly,
avoid transitions

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.250
to disease, in both the
short-term and for decades

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.490
to come.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.927
And so he's sharing this
vision with me and he said,

00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:46.260
we're going to change the world.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.880
We're going to launch a brand
new industry, which we're

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.047
calling scientific wellness.

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:51.296
And it's going to be the
biggest company of my career.

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:53.890
And he's the founder of Amgen.
And he points to me and says,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.014
you're going to be the CEO.

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:56.796
And so here I am.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.070
ALEK ICEV: OK.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.570
By the way, for
full disclaimer, I'm

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.530
[? alpha ?]
customers of Arivale.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.180
Whenever the service was
announced I talked to my wife--

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.250
OK, I want to try this.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.220
My background was also
in bioinformatics,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.370
so I was really kind of thrilled
that you guys kind of started

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.520
that, and how the company
is growing and providing

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.400
kind of more features
and uses and so forth.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.980
Right?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.230
So in that vein, can you
explain more with the changes

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.771
that you're facing
in the field, kind

00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:30.270
of bootstrapping on your startup
from ground zero, a growing

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.950
operation.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.450
You know?

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.040
Can you share a little bit
more details about that?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.440
CLAYTON LEWIS: So when
Lee came with this idea

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.850
that it was all about the data--

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.225
because, of course, Lee is a
scientist, so he would think

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:42.660
it was all about the data.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.300
And I shared sort of my
view of what I'd learned

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.316
in the wellness category.

00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:48.690
And, in addition
to my work, I've

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.270
also been on the Harborview
Medical Center Board

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.205
for 14 years.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:55.980
And so we're a trauma I
hospital for 23% of the land

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.910
mass in the United States, and
we're also the public hospital.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.230
So we do about $100
million in charity care.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.370
We treat everyone
exactly the same.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.950
The individuals that work at
Harborview are extraordinary.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.990
I'm also on the board
of the University

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.198
of Washington Medical Center.

00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:10.800
And when I first
joined sort of doing

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.100
volunteer work and governance
work and health care,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.930
I thought, OK, everyone should
have access to health care.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.960
But, of course, as
you dive in, you

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.580
learn it's not
really health care.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.930
It's ill care.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.240
Because on the whole, in
America an average individual

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.097
spends 17 minutes
over the course

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.930
of a year with their
primary care physician.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.710
17 minutes.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.370
So in that 17 minutes
they're basically

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.471
going to make sure you
don't have any symptoms.

00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:39.470
And I have such respect
for health care workers.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.136
I mean, clearly.

00:06:40.136 --> 00:06:41.280
I'm on two boards.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.750
But those individuals are
trained to treat problems.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.750
They're not designed
or trained to optimize

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.400
your current wellness.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.410
So when Lee came
with this idea I

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.210
had been following
another company in town

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.260
where I was trying
to recruit out

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.120
the CEO to start
another business called

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.320
"Free and Clear."

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.210
Now, what I loved
about Free and Clear

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.370
is they had the most
efficacious smoking

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.680
cessation, behavior
change, weight loss program

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.869
in the country.

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:07.410
And it was all about
behavior change.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.827
And they had scaled
to where they

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:11.160
were on boarding-- they had
gone from 40,000 individuals

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.467
a year to 400,000.

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.550
And about a year before
they'd been sold to Alere,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.641
so I raided the company.

00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:17.640
I got their chief
translational science officer,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.848
their head of coaching,
their chief business officer,

00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:21.660
even their director
of finance to come

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.730
help us build this company.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.750
And we decided to
do a test in 2014.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.157
And so basically Lee and I
recruited 108 of our friends

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:32.490
and we did what is called an
"institutional review board

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.390
approved study."

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.994
And it looked a
lot like this room.

00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:35.910
You know, people came.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.640
Everyone thought they were
healthy, all actively-engaged

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.330
in the health care system.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.390
And so we created this
dance dynamic data cloud.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.527
So first we did
whole-genome sequencing

00:07:45.527 --> 00:07:46.860
and we tried to be really clear.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.050
Genes are not your
destiny, but it gives us

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.990
some really interesting
insights into predispositions.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.320
So that's quadrant one.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.670
Quadrant two we looked
at was clinical labs.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.440
And so when you get
a typical physical

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.648
they're going to look at
about 30 different analytes.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.810
We look at north
of 90 because it's

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.690
these analytes that are a
reflection of your life choices

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.760
to date.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.135
Then we take a
saliva measurement

00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:11.342
and we look at four different
day part measurements

00:08:11.342 --> 00:08:13.050
of saliva, because
that gives us insights

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.760
into hormones, cortisol levels.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.340
Are you really
managing the stress?

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.720
Look at gut microbiome.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.420
It's a nascent field, but
in the context of a system

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.070
it's pretty fascinating.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.440
And then, of course,
assign a coach.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.840
And the coaches are
registered dietitians.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.520
So these 108 people, as they
went through this journey--

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.480
I'll share my story.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.549
I was one of them--

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.090
turned out 90% of them
had meaningful nutritional

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.900
deficiencies.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.299
Meaning, nutritional
deficiencies

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.570
impacting the health
journey they were on.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.657
70% over time were moving
towards chronic disease states.

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:46.240
And it doesn't mean on Wednesday
you're going to get diabetes,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.900
but look at heart health
dimensions, diabetes, stress

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.940
markers, optimal nutrition.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.470
And 3% were living
with diseases.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.360
So I'll share some stories.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.972
So at that point I'm a venture
capitalist [? advancing ?]

00:08:56.972 --> 00:08:57.930
in health and wellness.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.450
I was president of the board
of Harborview Medical Center.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.670
In the middle of training
for Ironman Canada--

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.220
and I had done this experiment
about the past four months

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.780
where I'd gone on a paleo diet
because I thought the paleo

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.980
triathletes seemed to be faster,
and I'll have brilliant blood

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.450
markers with this paleo diet.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.387
And I embraced it
wholeheartedly.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.470
And so I sort of said to
Lee, my co-founder, yeah.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.020
I'm going to be the healthiest
person in this study.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.020
And so my data comes back and
the first thing my coach says

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.386
is, you're pre-diabetic.

00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:25.260
And I'm like, oh, there's
been a data switch.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.686
Like, that cannot be me.

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:27.935
ALEK ICEV: A different person.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.434
CLAYTON LEWIS: And so she helps
me understand I have genetic

00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:33.960
variants where I actually
cannot process a paleo diet.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.570
I need rich, dense,
complex carbohydrates

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.270
in every single meal to
normalize my blood sugar

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:39.850
levels.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.224
So how counter-intuitive
is that,

00:09:41.224 --> 00:09:43.530
is that paleo made me
pre-diabetic with very

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.210
high inflammation markers?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.510
So what she then
helped me understand

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.500
is that, of the 108 people, I
had the highest mercury level

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.297
of anyone in the study, to the
point where in the future--

00:09:55.297 --> 00:09:56.880
I like to say-- it
was going to impact

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.500
my neurological functions.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.550
And so think about it.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.840
I get a physical every year.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.339
You know?

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:02.310
I'm actually engaged.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.914
No one's ever told me this.

00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:06.330
So, once again, the value of
a coach, registered dietitian

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.370
backed up by a clinical team,
backed up by a physician.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.910
So she says, you have
variants that about 20%

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.010
of the population have,
where you do not process

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.450
toxins as well as some people.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.510
So that might be the
reason for your buildup.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.270
Do you eat a lot of tuna sushi?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.010
I'm like, no.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.660
I'm a salmon guy.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.660
And so further exploration--
well, how old are you?

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.280
And I was 56 at the time.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.040
Do you have a lot
of old fillings?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.910
And for about a decade
my dentist has said,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.300
you know you should get
these fillings replaced?

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.550
And I'm like, yeah, next year.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.660
Next year.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.730
And so these old
amalgam fillings

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.467
had been leaching
mercury into my body.

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:39.925
Because I have
these variants where

00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:43.289
I don't process toxins as well
as some people, they built up.

00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:45.330
And so all of sudden I've
got insights and reason

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.670
to get these fillings replaced.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.110
Had them all replaced, and
it took my body about a year

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.360
to normalize my mercury levels.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.715
On the more extreme side--

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:54.840
and one of the first things
the coach does is says,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.560
why are you here?

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.059
You know?

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:57.351
What's being healthy look like?

00:10:57.351 --> 00:10:59.142
What do you want to be
doing in five years?

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:00.940
What do you want to
be doing in 10 years?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.731
So this individual
shared-- he and his wife

00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:03.930
are passionate about hiking.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.282
They live to hike.

00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:07.740
And he was starting to have
cartiledge issues in his ankle.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.977
And his physician's sort
of like, early 60's,

00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:10.560
they're there.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.190
That stuff happens.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.640
And so we do the
genetic profile,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.550
and he's got a predisposition
for hemochromatosis, which is

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.310
the body doesn't process iron.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.290
And so then we, on
our standard panel,

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.230
look at ferritin levels, which
is an indication of iron--

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.610
highly elevated.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.920
Now, we're a wellness
company so we don't treat,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.774
we don't diagnose,
we don't prescribe.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.940
So we say, take this data
and go have a conversation

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.265
with your physician.

00:11:34.265 --> 00:11:36.390
We actually got a thank
you note from the physician

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.170
because he said, I didn't have
access to genetic information,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.330
and so I wouldn't have thought
to look at the ferritin levels.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.110
And the great news is that,
when you catch haemochromatosis

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.870
early you just have to donate
blood on a regular basis

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.060
and that normalizes
the iron level.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.642
So we did this study of 108
people, dramatically improved--

00:11:54.642 --> 00:11:56.100
I mean, all of them
said, you know,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.850
you materially
improved my wellness.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.820
And so we decided
to launch a startup.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.250
And so we launched Arivale
two years ago last July.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.280
And as a startup initially
we raise $36 million,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.280
have raised about another
15, and so have raised

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.020
about $50 million to date.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.720
And like every good startup,
have lots of scar tissue

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.552
and lots of successes.

00:12:17.552 --> 00:12:19.260
But what we're most
passionate about is--

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.030
we're at about 4,000
individuals now

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.920
have gone through
the flagship program.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.860
And every individual that signs
up, they get an email from me

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.970
with my cell phone number
and my email address.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.480
And so I talk to lots
and lots of people

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.420
who go through the program,
and just so passionate because

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.870
of the impact that these
individuals on this journey

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.880
of what they're doing
to change their lives.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.670
Does that answer the question?

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.010
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.705
CLAYTON LEWIS: Perfect.

00:12:40.705 --> 00:12:41.371
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:42.810
Great.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.990
So let's spend a little bit into
this kind of very nascent field

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.680
of industry.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.310
For example, I did
the 23andMe test.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.210
You know?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.002
So I guess 23andMe
launched before Arivale.

00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:53.876
CLAYTON LEWIS: Mm-hm.

00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:54.480
Definitely.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.688
ALEK ICEV: And I went with
a different kind of niche,

00:12:56.688 --> 00:12:58.590
providing you more
of introspection

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.890
of what are your
genetical pre-disposition

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.397
for different diseases,
what's your ancestry,

00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:04.230
and everything else.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.480
And I think that they
did it amazingly well.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.550
It had great interface,
great data analysis.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.020
And then somewhere
in the middle,

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.850
they didn't accelerate the
trend to get from that point

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.270
to a full recommendation system.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.770
Right?

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.880
So based on the data,
based on collecting

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.750
on different signals like
your blood test, saliva test.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.070
And basically, you
know, I believe

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.130
that you entered into that
space very efficiently.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.310
I see, like, other
kind of startups kind

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.430
of getting into the area.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.430
So how do you fill
that whole space?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.680
I mean, it's more nascent now.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.400
We have a couple of players.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.334
How do you see that
whole space going?

00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:42.750
CLAYTON LEWIS: So
as an investor I

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.790
met with Anne, the
founder of 23andMe.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.000
And very thankful for what
she's done, because she

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.840
spent hundreds of millions
of dollars creating a brand.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.110
And it's interesting because
both 23andMe and Ancestry--

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.630
what they've done is they've
raised consumer awareness

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.651
to think, OK, genetics.

00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:01.650
I can learn my ancestor,
and that's kind of fun.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.149
You know?

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:03.420
And for $99, what the heck.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.160
It's a transactional purchase.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.330
And so from a general
consumer awareness,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.200
it's sort of either
people are thinking,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.510
I need to know about my
genetics for a disease state,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.670
or let's find out
where I'm from.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.660
And I think Anne's
done a good job there.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.860
What's interesting, obviously,
is that the data she has

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.690
is from a SNP panel.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.050
It's a relatively-limited
amount of genetic information.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.450
And it's one data set,
one moment in time.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.090
And so when we looked at that--

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.580
I've yet to meet a person
who went through 23andMe

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.260
and said, oh, it
changed my life.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.690
I'm much healthier because
of what I've learned.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.660
And so what we've been
very focused on is--

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.460
or even really clear
with our members--

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.960
genes are not your destiny.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.630
And we actually don't even
coach to genetic variants.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.110
We're coaching to the clinical
analytes, but what we're doing

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.700
is looking at the
variants to help

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.190
us understand why
we might be seeing

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.170
what we see in the blood data.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.050
And so first the distinction
is, we're a system--

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.390
genetics, data, gut
microbiome, saliva--

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.440
trying to look at you as
a system because people

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.970
have signals from
different parts.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.270
Second, we refresh people's
blood every six months

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.210
because it's the
change in the analytes,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.160
the change in the data
are, are we moving you

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.540
from red to green?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.830
And I'm in year
three of the program,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.279
and I'm now just turning my
attention to my cortisol level.

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.070
Because I had to get
the diabetes in check,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.680
then I had to get the
cortisol work in check.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.620
And what's important-- we
organize these five health

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.050
dimensions--

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.580
so diabetes risk, heart
health, inflammation,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.100
optimal nutrition-- for
each of you in the room

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.650
they would be stacked
ranked based on what

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.140
we see going on in your blood.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.940
Then within each
health dimension,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.470
the analytes would
be stacked ranked

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.747
to what you need to work
on, what you need to watch,

00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:46.580
and what is optimal.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.740
And what's great about
that is, it's dynamic.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.960
But then let's say you
go to heart health,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.090
we're going to show
you genetic variants

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.910
that impact some of
the lifestyle decisions

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.240
you need to make.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.920
So, for example, we look at LDL.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.620
And I'll geek out
a little bit here.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.980
So our scientists have curated
over 1,000 genetic variants

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.480
related to LDL.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.330
Because what's interesting
is a single genetic variant

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.400
is rare in and of itself
and has limited impact.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.310
But you put 1,000 genetic
variants together--

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.130
we create algorithms, we
look at the weighting.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.216
Some are positive,
some are negative.

00:16:18.216 --> 00:16:19.340
And now we've done studies.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.720
And so it's been
fascinating that for LDL,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.230
the bad cholesterol,
we put roughly--

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.880
at that point we
had 3,000 members--

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.180
into five quintiles
and came up with

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.120
a genetic predisposition
for having high LDL.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.400
And everyone mapped
beautifully to

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.180
their genetic predisposition,
unless they were on a statin.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.419
So then how do we use
that information to coach?

00:16:40.419 --> 00:16:41.960
So let's say you
come in and you have

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.880
a brilliant genetic
predisposition

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.680
and you have really high LDL.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.570
The coach knows
we're going to be

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.240
able to give some interesting
lifestyle recommendations

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.280
that are actually
going to impact that.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.320
Where, on the
flip-side, I genetically

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.180
am screwed from an
LDL perspective.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.690
I eat right, I exercise.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.540
I'm in category
5, and genetically

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.070
that's where I'm going to be.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.069
And so my coach says,
make sure you're

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.650
talking to your physician about
a calcium scan of your heart,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.690
maybe a carotid artery to sort
of see-- are you building up?

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.310
So that's where the genetics,
once again, can bring to life

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.250
to sort of give
visions of, when we're

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.020
looking at all these analytes,
what should we be looking for.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.496
Does that answer the question?

00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:21.162
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:17:21.162 --> 00:17:22.240
Yeah.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.630
So to build up a little
bit on what you said,

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.680
I want to kind of venture
into all the baseline studies.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.756
Right?

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:33.380
Basically, what's a
baseline for health

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.480
for every individual
on many of the tests

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.960
that they are providing?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.500
Right?

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.800
For example, the blood
markers-- they have categories

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.770
for decades that--

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.880
OK, if you're in this category
that everything's fine.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.380
Right?

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.850
But that vary on a individual
to individual basis.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.500
Right?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.475
And then fine-grain--
you go more

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:54.310
into the depth of every scale
then you can have, like,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.820
a more kind of
fine-grained outcome

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.130
for every individual based on
the differences in the genome

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.370
and everything else.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.280
Right?

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.420
And basically all the
devices in the classical kind

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.080
of health industry-- they
rely on those standardized

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.160
measurements.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.350
They're the same for everybody.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.230
Right?

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.700
So are you guys thinking
more about that field,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.980
going more in that--

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.940
CLAYTON LEWIS: So right now
the message is primarily,

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.560
optimize wellness.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:30.210
But what's interesting is to
look at genetic predisposition

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.480
both for wellness
and for disease.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.670
And so we're now launching
some clinical trials.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.900
So I'll give you one example.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.670
Our co-founder, Dr.
Lee Hood, believes

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.710
that Alzheimer's is
probably actually

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.810
eight to 10 different diseases.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.960
And so, if you go in and
understand someone's genetic

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.100
predisposition, well, it
could be then the omic

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.320
that's triggered the
disease-- say it's a protein

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.660
or a metabolite or a clinical
lab or even something

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.830
in your gut--

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.230
if you understood the
genetic predisposition,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.390
for different
individuals then, you'd

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.680
actually look at
different omics to say

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.130
is the disease triggered?

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.720
And if it's triggered,
what would be the right--

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.970
could be in some cases
pharmaceutical-- solution?

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.350
What would be the right
lifestyle recommendation

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.670
to actually slow down or reverse
the transition into the disease

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.426
state?

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:17.550
So this first one we're
launching with Alzheimer's,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.040
we're taking 200
individuals that

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.360
have early cognitive decline.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.205
And the first thing
we're doing is going in

00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.810
and creating these
dense dynamic data

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.860
clouds to understand what's
unique about them genetically.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.634
Then we run-- if you're
not into science,

00:19:31.634 --> 00:19:33.300
you may not know this
publication called

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.790
"Nature Biotechnology,"
but it's considered

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.569
if not the first, the second
most premier scientific journal

00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:40.110
in the world.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.010
It's a peer-reviewed journal.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.994
So we submitted a paper on
the first 108 individuals.

00:19:45.994 --> 00:19:47.910
And what our scientists
did is that we came up

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.310
with a correlation network
where we looked at someone's

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.200
genetic predisposition.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.630
And then we found
what were the signals

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.290
to that genetic predisposition
to metabolites, proteomics,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.310
clinical labs, gut microbiome.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.190
And for this paper the
scientist just pulled

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.380
out 32 different signals.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.830
Of the 32 signals that we
identified the correlations,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.870
turned out two were
already drugs on market.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.610
One's a drug in clinical trial.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.250
And the other 29 there
was no paper or research

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.240
we could find.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.550
Now, what's important
about that is

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.160
that many of you
in this room right

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.210
now may have a disease
that started in your body.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.730
And you may not have
symptoms for a year,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.550
and in some cases for a decade.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.657
But when you finally
have symptoms,

00:20:31.657 --> 00:20:33.990
that's when you're going to
show up and present yourself

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.530
to the health care system.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.720
Well, imagine if we understood
your genetic predisposition

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.049
and we understood which
omic is unique to you

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:44.340
that we should be tracking,
if there's something that's

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.110
relatively high-risk,
and starting

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.560
to do that at a very low cost.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.000
So here's an example.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.990
An individual-- been in
our program for two years--

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.810
very sadly shared with her
coach that she'd been diagnosed

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.540
with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.830
And so stage 4
pancreatic cancer tends

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.370
to be fatal because it's stage
4, because it's asymptomatic

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.690
as it's going through
its whole journey.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.140
So we biobank blood from
every single blood draw,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.920
which we do every six months.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.000
So with the permission of
the individual we went back

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.110
and we analyzed the prior four
blood draws over two years

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.660
and did a really
extensive proteomic panel.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.200
Turns out there's a protein
that was completely out of range

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.861
from the other 3,000
individuals for this individual,

00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:25.860
completely out of range.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.822
And she was the only outlier.

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:29.280
As we did research
on that protein,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.410
it turns out it's linked to
the function of the pancreas.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.030
So imagine if we understood
genetic predisposition

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.470
for pancreatic cancer.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.120
Not hard to do.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.582
Then think if we actually can
identify what is the omic--

00:21:42.582 --> 00:21:44.040
you know, a protein
metabolite that

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.590
says the disease is triggered,
started its journey,

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.780
and knew to intercept it long
before real damage is done.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.740
Another example, the
individual comes in.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.680
She has a protein that in our
first interaction with her

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.812
is materially out of range.

00:21:56.812 --> 00:21:59.020
So we work with an independent
third-party physician.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.010
He called her, said, you need
to go see your physician.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.260
She's like, well, I had the
flu during the blood draw.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:04.930
And he said, OK.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.300
Well, that could have been it.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.200
Six months later,
still out of range.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.960
So once again,
physician referral.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.150
Says she's going to do it.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.940
Doesn't do it.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.020
Six months later.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.040
Now we're 18 months in.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.330
We're like, our chief
translational scientist

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.630
called her and said, we
don't know this is serious,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.970
but you really want to
go have a conversation.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.630
Turns out she had leukemia.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.990
And so once again,
it's interesting now

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.990
as our company is getting older
to look at these transitions

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.360
from wellness to disease.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.760
And, of course,
the big idea here

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.970
is to avoid the transition
to diseases because

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.350
of where the science is.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.360
And so that's part
of what we're doing.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.702
Another example would be--

00:22:41.702 --> 00:22:43.410
because we look at
gut microbiome-- which

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.217
is so nascent.

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:45.300
I mean, it's very nascent.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.883
And what's interesting
is that there's

00:22:46.883 --> 00:22:49.662
companies launching that
are only looking at the gut.

00:22:49.662 --> 00:22:51.120
And we have a number
of individuals

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.870
that are experts in this.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.790
So, as we look at the
bacteria in someone's gut,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.350
there's certain
types of bacteria

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.220
that if you're over
indexed on TMAO, if you

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.100
eat red meat in both the
short-term and the long-term,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.230
you're going to do meaningful
cardiovascular damage

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.310
to your system.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.750
So we now give everyone
a TMAO score to say,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.380
your TMAO is highly elevated.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.417
You, on the whole,
want to avoid red meat

00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:17.250
or we need to figure
out how to drive better

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.840
diversity in your gut if
you're passionate about eating

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.130
red meat.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.290
So there's a few examples.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.910
ALEK ICEV: Wow.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.002
That's impressive.

00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:27.210
So this is what I'm thinking.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.180
Right?

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.460
How do you see the future
going into this field?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.880
Like, one, we here
at Google [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.041
that we live all the
days on real-time data.

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:37.540
Right?

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.765
That keeps coming
100% of the time.

00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:43.390
And we'll process that and we'll
build systems to process that.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.080
Right?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.805
Hearing, in the field--

00:23:46.805 --> 00:23:48.250
you know, it seems
to be nascent.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.750
Right?

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.000
You're taking the blood once per
six months, the microbiome test

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.251
once per year, then you do
a saliva test once per year

00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:55.750
as well.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.540
Right?

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.680
And then the DNA
probably sampling

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.340
gets fixed because
it's your code

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.350
and you don't need
to repeat that.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.116
But then, you know,
how do you see--

00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:07.490
you know, do you see any kind
of future investments going

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.250
into the field to make this
more kind of real-time?

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.270
Now it's hard, right?

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.520
It's hard to inject the
chip and get your blood

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.340
test through a WiFi
real-time transmitted

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.120
so every day you can track
that or get your microbiome

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.790
analyzed every day.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.050
But do you see the
future going there?

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.970
CLAYTON LEWIS: So, three things.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.280
One, when we did our initial
study two and a half years ago,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.300
we were spending $10,000
per individual on the assays

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.810
because both the
number of assays

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.280
and the frequency
of the assays--

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.570
we didn't know where the signal
was going to be coming from.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.236
So for two years we
burned through a lot

00:24:43.236 --> 00:24:46.990
of venture capital where we
were doing all of this data.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.490
We've now reduced the assay
cost down to roughly $1,200,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.865
and we're given all of the
exact same information.

00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:55.990
And so one of the first
things to be thinking about

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.540
is-- of course, you've all
heard about Moore's Law related

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.600
to genetics.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.160
I know when Lee did the
first whole-genome sequence,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.720
god knows how much it was.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.915
We were spending roughly $1,400
on whole-genome sequence,

00:25:07.915 --> 00:25:09.790
and now we're doing a
SNP panel because we're

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.630
getting the same data.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:11.129
You know?

00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:14.200
So in two years the company went
from spending roughly $1,500

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.180
to $175 on genetics, same data.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.990
Second thing that we
did is that, as we now--

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:23.350
with these first 3,000
individuals every six months

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.600
we were doing the
full panel of omics.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.310
Well, now we know
if certain omics

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.750
are in the green
they're not going

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.520
to move into the yellow
or red within six months.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.630
So we do what's called reflexive
testing at a six-month mark,

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.260
full testing.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.660
So what we've got to do
is get the cost down.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.160
You know?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.264
For the first offering
of roughly 70 days

00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:43.430
for all the blood and all
of that genetics right now

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.155
it's $999.

00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:46.780
A lot of people,
that's too much money.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.730
And our goal is to
democratize this.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.697
And so, you know, it
was so sad to follow

00:25:51.697 --> 00:25:52.780
what happened at Theranos.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.540
Because if microfluidics
would have worked,

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.690
that would have been a brilliant
way to make it, A, much easier,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.060
and B, much more affordable.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.567
But we do believe technology
cost and the assay cost

00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:03.400
will be coming down.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.260
So that's job one.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.760
Job two.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.040
Health care is basically
a giant ocean liner.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.920
And it's very slow to change.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.670
But what's been
interesting in my 14 years

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.260
as trustee is that--

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.780
when I first joined
the board our KPIs

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.370
were all around
billings codes where

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.340
we had to bill for the
pill, the device, the hour.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.270
We're now in
volume-based pricing.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.510
So if you show up
and you have an event

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.640
and you're coded for
that event, I show up

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.610
and have the same event and
am coded for that same event,

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.386
you stay three days,
I stay two weeks,

00:26:32.386 --> 00:26:33.760
we're going to
make money on you,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.930
we're going to lose a
boatload of money on me.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.500
And so the primary KPI right
now in the health care system

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.910
is length of stay because it
has very perverse motivations.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.890
And, of course, it's
all billing codes.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.050
And there's very few
billing codes for wellness.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.520
But there are starting to
be some interesting signals.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.940
So the Boeing
Corporation two years ago

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.610
issued an ACO contract where
they said, here's 20,000 lives.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.310
You, major health
care systems, can

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.820
bid to take care of
these 20,000 individuals.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.820
But oh, by the way, it's
a fixed-price contract.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.550
So you're going to
take care of them

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.740
and not raise your
rates for five years.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.070
And historically we raised our
rate every year 12% to 16%.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.670
So we bid on it-- "we" being
the University of Washington

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.740
health care system-- the
Providence St. Joseph

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.260
health care system bid
on it, and off we go.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.820
Three years in
Providence pulled out

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.360
because they couldn't
figure it out.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.770
And we at the University
of Washington's system--

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.290
it's the first time
in the boardroom

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.980
I hear, like, how are we going
to keep these people healthy?

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.480
You know?

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.340
And so actually trying
to think about not

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.500
optimizing treating illnesses,
but actually keeping people

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.250
healthy.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.060
So there's going to
be some change there.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.820
There's going to have
to be some change.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.511
There's three drivers
of human health.

00:27:38.511 --> 00:27:39.760
Three drivers of human health.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.926
Any sense of what they'd be?

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.230
Help me out here.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.961
AUDIENCE: Exercise and rest.

00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:48.210
CLAYTON LEWIS: Exercise, rest.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.374
Great.

00:27:49.374 --> 00:27:50.060
Any other--

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.685
AUDIENCE: Diet.

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:51.560
CLAYTON LEWIS: Diet.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.851
Well, you're generally spot-on.

00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:54.230
So, three drivers.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.110
In the course of your
lifetime, 30% of your health

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.120
is determined by genetics.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.570
60% behavior,
lifestyle, environment.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.660
10% the health care system.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.830
And so think how
crazy it is that we're

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.030
devoting 18% of our GDP
to the tiniest slice.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.459
Now, go one level deeper.

00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:14.250
So what's the primary
tool physicians have?

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:14.990
Pharmaceuticals.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.010
Right?

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.299
So there are studies that
indicate, of the top 10

00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:20.090
grossing drugs in the
United States today--

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.820
the top 10 grossing--
the most effective

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.460
helps one out of four
people that take the drug.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.830
The least effective
helps one out of 24.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.220
So think of the billions
that we're giving people

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.414
these pills that are
actually not helping,

00:28:33.414 --> 00:28:35.330
in many cases hurting,
especially when there's

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:36.740
combinations of them.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.555
Because that is where
that science is to date.

00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:42.500
And so we're in conversations
with some pharmaceuticals

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.220
right now--

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.790
one example.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:49.060
So non-small-cell lung
cancer, late stage.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.710
There's an immunotherapy
that's binary.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.514
Either it works or
it doesn't work.

00:28:54.514 --> 00:28:55.430
If it works, you live.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.110
If it doesn't work, you die.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.470
And they don't know why.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.560
And so that pharmaceutical
company has come to us

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.110
and said, we want to
put 200 people that

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.510
have this disease, late stage--

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.360
we want you, Arivale, to create
these dense dynamic data clouds

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.897
for these individuals
so we can understand

00:29:10.897 --> 00:29:12.980
is there a genetic profile
that this drug actually

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.330
works or doesn't work.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.290
And then, is there
an interesting omic

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.350
that we could identify also that
would help us understand that?

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.130
So n of one data
has the potential

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.920
to make both the health care
system much more effective

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.220
and clearly pharmaceuticals.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.905
I think I got on
a tangent there.

00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:32.571
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.090
Yeah.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.780
So let's go along a little bit
more into that, into this area.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.780
So I'm observing, for
example, what Craig Venter

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.510
is doing with the Human
Longevity Institute

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.190
and that initiative as well.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:49.300
So it seems that they are doing
a slightly similar approach

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.580
to what you have, but on
top of that implementing

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.210
with the detailed, most advanced
MRI scans and all that stuff.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.080
So where do you see,
from the data points

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.724
that you are collecting overall
today, what are you missing?

00:30:00.724 --> 00:30:01.640
One of the big things.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.600
Is that the MRI, something
else, more real-time data?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.520
How do you see the field
growing one, two years from now?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.830
CLAYTON LEWIS: So Craig
Venter has the company

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.210
called Human
Longevity Institute,

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.270
and its price point
is roughly $25,000.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.030
And you go to San Diego,
and it's cool and it's sexy.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.730
But we've had a lot of people go
through HLI and a lot of people

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.520
go through Arivale, and what
they say the distinction is is

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.980
that you assign a coach.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.910
I talk to my coach--
some people every day,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.280
texting and apping with it.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.470
And that coach is
taking that complex data

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.440
and translating it into
actual recommendation based

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.630
on what I'm willing to
do and what I want to do.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.050
So that's distinction one
from a market perspective.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.410
On the assay side, Lee
Hood and his scientist

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.570
at the Institute
of Systems Biology

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.520
continue to have a lot of
assays that they want us to do.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.910
And so for participants
we actually

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.620
do a couple discovery
assays where

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.930
we can't share the data
back because they're not

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.820
yet from CLIA-approved
labs and it's not

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.010
necessarily actionable.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.010
But behind the scenes, in
addition to the blood, saliva,

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:05.180
gut microbiome, we're looking
at proteomics and metabolites.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.910
And that's where there's some
really interesting signals

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:12.230
of when we look at these
correlations of genetic risk,

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.170
then understanding what
omic is that linked to.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.750
And so, as I shared for the
example of the person that

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.690
had pancreatic cancer or
the person who had leukemia,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.450
that was by looking at
proteomics and metabolites.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.870
And we continue to do
discovery work, but part of it

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.550
is-- a nascent
startup that's funded

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.830
by venture capital
is always trying

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.540
to figure out that
balance of where

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.750
to make those investments.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.531
But some of our partners now
are coming to us and saying, OK,

00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:37.530
I'd like to discover it.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.040
So back to Providence
St. Joseph.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.320
They have put 1,000
of their employees

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.356
into Arivale for three years and
they're doing a clinical trial

00:31:45.356 --> 00:31:46.730
where they're
saying, OK, we want

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.619
to be a health care system that
actually keeps people well.

00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:51.410
And so we're putting
1,000 of our employees

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.770
in to learn what is the impact
of scientific wellness in terms

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.610
of reducing health care claims
cost, improving health overall.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.650
Another example
would be Colgate.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.680
So I didn't appreciate, half
of the world's population

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.460
uses a Colgate
product for oral care,

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.760
and so they have
numerous brands.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.310
So they heard about Lee Hood.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.740
They heard about Arivale
P4 medicine and came to us

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.810
and said, the
future of oral care

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.540
is going to be
some degree n-of-1.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.250
And their thesis
is there's about

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.450
five meaningful different
types of oral microbiome.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.150
And based on each of you
in the room maybe falling

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.090
into one of these
five categories,

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.830
they are developing
tooth care or oral care

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.840
that would be much more
impactful for you based

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.430
on your unique microbiome.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.160
And so we're now involved in
a clinical trial with them

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.220
to understand how would we
look at the overall system

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.500
of an individual and determine
what is the right oral care.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.790
So starting to be a lot
of n-of-1 experiments

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.860
to understand we're
unique and, of course,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.357
we're all treated
exactly the same.

00:32:51.357 --> 00:32:51.940
ALEK ICEV: OK.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.980
Cool.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.129
So I'm very optimistic about
your field and I think that--

00:32:57.129 --> 00:32:58.170
CLAYTON LEWIS: Thank you.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.800
I am, too.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.300
[LAUGHS]

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.840
ALEK ICEV: --you are against
taking 18% of our GDP

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.420
and repurposing that in
the long run [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.174
successful to something much
more better for everybody

00:33:09.174 --> 00:33:11.715
that lives in this country and
hopefully in the world, right?

00:33:11.715 --> 00:33:13.020
CLAYTON LEWIS: Yes.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.380
ALEK ICEV: So let's go
kind of one step beyond.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.920
Right?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.630
You know, your personal
thoughts on all the initiatives

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.130
by Aubrey de Grey, [INAUDIBLE]
longevity, where the lines,

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.010
where the borders.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.150
Let's say I'm an
Arivale customer,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.430
I follow all of your
recommendations and advices,

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.040
I'm in the perfect health.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:32.540
You know?

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.110
Like, where is the
frontier beyond that?

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.210
CLAYTON LEWIS: Tell me--

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.043
ALEK ICEV: So Aubrey
de Grey is the guy that

00:33:39.043 --> 00:33:41.340
leads the Longevity
Institute and he's

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.940
one of the most vocal
exponents of basically solving

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:52.250
every disease, cardiovascular,
Alzheimer's, the major cancer,

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.810
the major cause of that.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.820
And then beyond that,
you know, addressing

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.630
the senescence
issues in the body.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.380
And then having a theory
that, at some time point--

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.610
you know, it's not 120 years
the maximum age of humans,

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.659
but it can be extended
for who knows how long.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.199
Right?

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.739
So your thoughts into that.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.530
CLAYTON LEWIS: Well,
I'm going to give you,

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.510
I think, an answer that's
not going to fit in.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.040
So what we aspire to do is help
people optimize their wellness

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.550
and avoid disease for a life
filled with joyful moments.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.489
And actually what we do is--
every week in our team meetings

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.610
coaches get up and share stories
from individuals in terms

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.080
of what they're actually doing.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.429
And the first thing a
coach is going to do

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:35.690
is say, why are you here?

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.840
You know?

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.860
What does it mean to be healthy?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.270
Why do you want to be healthy?

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.365
And of course what's
interesting is,

00:34:39.365 --> 00:34:41.300
most people actually don't
even think about that.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:41.540
You know?

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.920
Have you thought about what you
want to look like in 20 years

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.080
and what you want to be doing?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:45.510
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.551
CLAYTON LEWIS: Excellent.

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:48.360
But not a lot of people have.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.989
And so what we aspire
to do at Arivale

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:54.980
is help people live full,
joyful, robust lives where

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.100
you're not focused on
being ill [INAUDIBLE] well.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.170
But we're actually--
especially me--

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.230
I'm not actually thinking that
living forever is necessarily

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.589
a goal or an aspiration.

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:07.130
And so we have a
little bit of a joke

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.736
internally where right
now if you get to 100

00:35:10.736 --> 00:35:12.110
and you're healthy
and happy, you

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.030
tend to die relatively quickly.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.860
And so our goal is
to get you to 100,

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.915
have you lead full, rich lives,
and then you're on your own

00:35:19.915 --> 00:35:22.290
and you'll probably have a
system failure and go quickly.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.850
And so we actually don't
spend a lot of time thinking

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.739
about beyond the 100s phase.

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:28.322
ALEK ICEV: OK.

00:35:28.322 --> 00:35:28.700
OK.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.650
I'm just going one step further.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.605
One you solve the reality--

00:35:30.605 --> 00:35:31.020
CLAYTON LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.150
That'll be the next startup.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.200
ALEK ICEV: The next startup.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:33.710
OK.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.250
OK.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.430
OK.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.513
AUDIENCE: Is that kind of
like the theory of aging

00:35:36.513 --> 00:35:37.820
is a disease itself.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.890
ALEK ICEV: Yes.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.320
Yes.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.970
Yes.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.460
CLAYTON LEWIS: But also, what's
so interesting about that

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.290
is that, once again, all of us
have these different n-of-1s.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.230
So another story
with Alzheimer's.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.170
So we've taken our
roughly 4,000 clients now,

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.735
we've created polygenic risk
profiles of their likelihood

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:55.100
to have Alzheimer's.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.890
And now we're diving in and
saying, OK, what's unique?

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.480
And so we put them into
five quintiles again.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.040
And so the fifth quintile,
the people at highest risk--

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.640
started to say what's unique
about these individuals?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.710
Well, it turns out the
typical person, as they age,

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.182
the amyloids in your
brain start to increase.

00:36:13.182 --> 00:36:15.140
And so there's an indication
that that actually

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.210
might be a protective
function that helps

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.010
preserve cognitive function.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.457
So for quintile number
5, at highest risk,

00:36:22.457 --> 00:36:24.290
this group, as they're
aging, their amyloids

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.390
aren't increasing.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.920
So once again,
how interesting is

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.010
that when you think about these
major chronic disease states

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.590
that, as we're all
living longer, what

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.240
is the implication
of what we need

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.710
to be looking at
to make sure we're

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.850
living healthy lives as we age?

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.640
ALEK ICEV: OK.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.140
So I have one more
question and then

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.010
we'll give it to the audience.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.460
CLAYTON LEWIS: OK.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.480
ALEK ICEV: So basically,
on scaling things.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.313
I'm like, you [? have a ?]
interesting model

00:36:47.313 --> 00:36:50.210
with personal coaches
and everything else.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.060
Is that scalable?

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.560
Right?

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.425
So basically I think
all of us in this room

00:36:54.425 --> 00:36:56.661
are kind of
fine-tuned to building

00:36:56.661 --> 00:36:59.160
artificial-intelligence systems,
or at least observing them,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.360
into our real lives and
basically automating everything

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.200
that we can.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.745
And to scale.

00:37:04.745 --> 00:37:05.245
Right?

00:37:05.245 --> 00:37:08.030
To build on a world-wide
infrastructure and systems

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.130
across billions of users.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:09.630
Right?

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.049
Can you scale that model?

00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:12.590
CLAYTON LEWIS: So
the back-end of how

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.290
we think about
scaling is that a lot

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.620
of what your company's
been extraordinary at.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.850
And so when we
initially launched,

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.650
the reason I went and
raided Free and Clear

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.920
is that they had scaled
within five years

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.040
from serving 40,000 individuals
a year to 400,000 individuals

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.170
a year with a comparable
coaching program.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.610
But, of course, 400,000
is not very many.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.470
So when we initially launched
the company, for every coaching

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.010
call, the clinical team spent
roughly two hours preparing

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.460
chart notes because we had data
coming from 14 different labs,

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.530
giving the chart
notes to the coach,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.630
and then the coach coming
up with recommendations.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.570
So two hours, to roughly
a 45-minute call.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.090
Two hours of prep and post.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.247
Right now the prep and post
is down to about 20 minutes.

00:37:55.247 --> 00:37:56.830
And the way we've
been able to do that

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.140
is that we have
machine learning that

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.570
is tracking every
single recommendation

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.160
that the clinical team's making.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.890
So now, as the data's
coming in, about 70%

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.660
of the recommendations
are automated.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.090
And so it's the exception
rules that are going back

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.330
out to the clinical team.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.955
And our goal by the end of Q1 is
to get recommendations roughly

00:38:13.955 --> 00:38:15.280
at 95% automated.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.046
Now the control, obviously,
is that the dietitian, who's

00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:19.920
licensed, is looking at
that data and saying,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.730
does that make sense?

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.400
Second thing is that Free
and Clear-- their model

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400
is basically their
coaches, registered

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.350
dietitians, work from home
across the United States.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.380
And so we see it to be a
really interesting opportunity

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.870
in terms of scaling that aspect.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:39.460
Third is leveraging technology
to amplify the relationship.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.530
So right now the
individuals that

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.260
are using the Arivale
app on average

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.302
are checking in on the
app 14 times a day.

00:38:47.302 --> 00:38:48.760
And it's the app
and the bot that's

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.990
extending the relationship.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.730
So, as I said, I'm
working on sleep.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.860
Because, like every startup
CEO, I believe sleep

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.160
is not required.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.304
And so I have a goal right
now with my coach where

00:38:57.304 --> 00:38:58.720
I'm going to quit
working by 10:00

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.400
and I'm going to
go to bed by 11:00.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.500
So my phone-- at 10:00
the Arivale app pops up

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.110
and it says, swipe right if
you're going to quit working.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.270
And then at 11:00 it
pops up and it says,

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.820
you know, swipe right if
you're going to go to bed.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.971
Well, I often don't swipe.

00:39:10.971 --> 00:39:11.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.070
But she sees my Fitbit data on
my dashboard because it's all

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.082
synced together, and so--

00:39:17.082 --> 00:39:18.790
you know, I got a text
from her after I'd

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.206
been on the road
for about a week,

00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:22.240
like, oh, how's that
going five hours a night's

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.290
sleep five days in a row?

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.270
I bet you're really
being a great CEO--

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.296
my goal-- and your
Ironman performance

00:39:27.296 --> 00:39:28.420
is probably right on track.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.380
Isn't it, Clayton?

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:29.879
You know?

00:39:29.879 --> 00:39:33.520
And so how does technology and
bots leverage these objectives.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.410
So there's big
opportunities there.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.300
And then finally, in
the back end right now

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.345
we're building the
Arivale affiliate network.

00:39:39.345 --> 00:39:41.470
And the objective for the
Arivale affiliate network

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.910
is-- we already have
physician groups

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.493
and hospitals coming
to us and saying,

00:39:44.493 --> 00:39:46.480
OK, we want to roll this
out through our panels

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.774
and our patients.

00:39:47.774 --> 00:39:49.690
And what can be interesting
about that is also

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.580
potential reduction in cogs.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.920
Because of the $1,000
in assays right now--

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.000
none if it's reimbursed.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.270
But it looks like, as we're
talking to these physician

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.478
groups, they might be able
to get reimbursed anywhere

00:40:00.478 --> 00:40:02.410
from $250 to $300.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.420
And so, one, it's
about technology

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.220
automating the recommendations.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.760
Two, using technology
to extend and enhance

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.220
the coaching relationship,
not to replace it.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.530
And then a work-from-home
model, and then

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.466
leveraging other systems.

00:40:16.466 --> 00:40:18.340
But we spend a lot of
time thinking about it.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.006
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:40:19.006 --> 00:40:20.480
Cool, cool.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:20.980
All right.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.324
So--

00:40:22.324 --> 00:40:23.990
AUDIENCE: I guess a
couple of questions.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.790
First question.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.920
Like, from your
talk I still wasn't

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.020
be able to quite
figure out what's

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.162
the relationship of your company
with the insurance companies.

00:40:32.162 --> 00:40:34.120
CLAYTON LEWIS: There is
no relationship with us

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.286
and the insurance companies.

00:40:35.286 --> 00:40:39.520
Because insurance is basically
about treating illness

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.910
and getting reimbursed
for curing a problem.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.470
We're about trying
to keep you well.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.686
And the insurance companies
are not very focused.

00:40:46.686 --> 00:40:48.560
Now let me tell you just
a brief story though

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.720
that's interesting.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.880
So I'm always out
raising venture capital.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.570
And so New York Life recently
invested $5 million in us.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.270
And so New York Life
has 7 million clients

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.370
across the United States.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.530
And their business
objective is to have

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.630
you live as long and
healthy as you can,

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.671
because every month you
live is another month you

00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:09.380
pay a premium, and another
month that payout is delayed.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.860
So we're going to do a test
with New York Life, testing

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.030
their brand halo in the
state of California,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.610
where they want to be the
whole insurance company.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.182
And so if they give you peace
of mind for your family,

00:41:19.182 --> 00:41:20.890
for protecting your
business, now they're

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.681
going to introduce
Arivale and say, Arivale

00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:24.940
can help you live a
healthier, longer life.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.590
And then their actuarial teams
are going to go in and say, hm.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.680
If Arivale achieves the results
they have with our first

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.540
4,000, where for
every single analyte

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.330
that's out of range, within
six months we on average drive

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.324
20% improvements.

00:41:38.324 --> 00:41:40.240
Meaning we take analytes
that are out of range

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.860
and move them in range.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.710
They said, we roughly have in
reserves $1.3 trillion dollars.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.940
I mean, a lot of money.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.860
And so could we,
if we help people

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.380
stay healthier longer,
how that might impact

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.649
our overall business model.

00:41:51.649 --> 00:41:52.690
So interesting alignment.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.790
But insurance insurance--
there's nothing yet.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.210
AUDIENCE: Second question is--

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.790
like you said, your company
is just two years old.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:01.581
CLAYTON LEWIS: Yes.

00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:06.050
AUDIENCE: And I would say that's
earliest age for a startup.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.920
So what's your end goal like?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.070
What's your vision?

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.200
Where do you want to be?

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.060
CLAYTON LEWIS: So
three end goals.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.190
One, the democratization
of wellness.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.620
And so our objective
ultimately is

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:21.579
that the wellness industry will
dwarf the sick care industry.

00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:23.620
And so this category that
we're going to launch--

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.290
not just by ourselves,
with a lot of partners--

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.270
that there will be
more money putting

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.140
into staying well and
optimizing wellness

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.806
than there will be
in treating symptoms,

00:42:31.806 --> 00:42:37.210
and it'll be very affordable to
people from all walks of life.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.710
Thank you.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.793
AUDIENCE: Being well won't
produce that much money

00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:41.600
as being sick, right?

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.892
So how do you manage
to tackle that?

00:42:43.892 --> 00:42:45.600
CLAYTON LEWIS: So,
tell me one more time.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.240
Being well--

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.040
AUDIENCE: Being well--
like, if you are well,

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.081
insurance won't
pay for anything.

00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:51.580
Right?

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.050
There's no point
for the insurance--

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.750
I guess, in other
words, how do you

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.940
democratize this wellness
program and how do you sell it?

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.120
Insurances are
basically invested

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.430
in people getting sick.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.870
ALEK ICEV: There
are many entities

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.995
in the industry benefiting
off somebody being sick.

00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:07.953
CLAYTON LEWIS: Exactly.

00:43:07.953 --> 00:43:09.970
So the perverse incentives,
financial incentives

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.240
are our current system.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.710
And so one thing that
will be interesting,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.020
and I think will
start to happen is--

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.880
much like the example
of the Boeing ACO

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.519
I gave you-- the state of
Washington has issued an ACO.

00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:24.060
So we're going to have to change
the incentive of health care

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.060
systems.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.680
And what's happening
right now is

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.290
we're migrating from
volume-based care, which

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.140
is where we're at right
now, to value-based care.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.880
And we're at the
earliest stages of that,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.171
but I actually believe that
is where we're going to go.

00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:39.410
And so when I'm out talking
to health care systems

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.880
and to pharmaceutical companies
I say, look at your outcomes.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.617
Congress alone is not going to
continue to put up with this.

00:43:45.617 --> 00:43:47.950
We all know that the health
care system today is broken.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.870
Way too much money is going in.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:53.434
The challenge is that it's
so slow to change that--

00:43:53.434 --> 00:43:55.350
as a startup here, I was
trying to figure out,

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.040
am I cutting edge or
am I bleeding edge?

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:57.539
[CHUCKLES]

00:43:57.539 --> 00:43:59.530
And so we've got
to figure out how

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.870
to get the right partnerships.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.994
And that's why I was so
excited that Providence St.

00:44:02.994 --> 00:44:05.080
Joseph said, we're
putting 1,000 employees in

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.420
because we actually want
to change the system.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.550
Three weeks ago Spectrum
health care system,

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.892
Grand Rapids, Michigan--

00:44:10.892 --> 00:44:12.850
So they invited me in to
be the keynote speaker

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.320
at their annual meeting.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.530
So 300 people in the room,
all their board members,

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.407
their CEOs.

00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:21.240
And, you know, I'm
basically giving my talk,

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.870
saying, you're the 10%, but
you're taking 18% of the GDP.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:24.880
What's wrong with that?

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.100
You, the physician's,
spend 17 minutes--

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.330
17 minutes.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.079
You can't help those
folks in 17 minutes.

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.870
Let's look at the drugs
you're giving them.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.390
After I gave that talk, which
was somewhat provocative,

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:36.640
they immediately said, we
want to form a joint venture

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.490
with you.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.840
We want to figure out how
to introduce Arivale to keep

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.860
some body of individuals safe.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.620
So we're definitely
plowing early ground there.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.970
And I don't have a clear path.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.119
And so the question is--

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:50.410
everything in life, especially
if you look at business,

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.900
it's gradually,
gradually, then suddenly.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.492
And when the suddenly happens
a transformation takes place.

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:57.200
And Seattle-- we've
driven a lot of them.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.110
So think of real estate.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.800
So I was president and
COO of Market Leader.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.810
And so Market Leader--
what we were doing

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:08.050
is trying to give people the
keys to the multiple listing

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:08.740
service.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:08.806
You know?

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.960
So my mom's been a realtor
forever, and I'm old.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.450
So it used to be in the old
days you couldn't buy or sell

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.520
a house without a
realtor because they

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.470
had the keys to the MLS system.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.015
So I had all the data.

00:45:19.015 --> 00:45:22.030
And so Zillow came along,
opened up the keys,

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.980
and now we have
companies like Redfin.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.062
And we as consumers,
when we buy and sell,

00:45:26.062 --> 00:45:28.270
we go and have a conversation
with our realtor, which

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.300
is very different than we
did before they had data.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:31.800
You know?

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.050
Same thing with travel agents.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.399
Back in the day if you wanted
to find the least expensive

00:45:36.399 --> 00:45:38.440
airline ticket, you had
to go to the travel agent

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.220
because they had all the data.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.070
And so what's interesting
about Arivale is,

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:47.320
we're making our participants
much more sophisticated,

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.961
individuals
understanding their data.

00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:50.710
So a lot of them go
and have conversations

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.110
with their physician, which
are much better-educated

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.650
conversations.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.190
And so we believe also
that, one, there's

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.870
going to be changes by payers.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.360
Two, consumers are going
to demand a different level

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.970
of engagement and expectation.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.580
And then three, as
the prices come down

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.310
and we figure out how to have
conversations with people--

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.100
you know, much like
23andMe, people are curious.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.800
The top-selling item
on Amazon Prime Day--

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.200
top-selling item, 23andMe.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.430
And so think about that.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.920
Consumers now, as I
said at the start,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.430
they're interested in
genetics related to Ancestry.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.470
We've got to get
that bridge now,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.515
genetics about staying well.

00:46:28.515 --> 00:46:30.130
So that's how we think about it.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:30.940
I'm optimistic.

00:46:33.806 --> 00:46:34.472
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:46:34.472 --> 00:46:37.097
I actually had one question that
was related to all this, which

00:46:37.097 --> 00:46:38.770
is that-- do you
know how many, like,

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.040
health dollars that are moving
towards flexible spending

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.590
accounts?

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.130
Because I intuitively
feel like--

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:45.820
I don't know.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.130
Google certainly has told
all of our employees,

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.900
you're probably going
to be better covered

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.400
under our flexible
spending accounts

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.320
than a lot of-- like, the
GHIP, the Health Investment

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.970
Plan, than you will be
under most of the PPO

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:00.910
or whatever it was.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:01.930
CLAYTON LEWIS: Right.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.305
AUDIENCE: For most
cases just you

00:47:03.305 --> 00:47:07.170
end up having less
out-of-pocket expenses

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.710
over the course of a year.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.260
And I sort of wonder
if that's the case,

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.880
that there are more health
spending dollars that

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.650
are moving to people
that have the ability

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.280
to make the decision?

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.069
Is that the case?

00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:23.110
CLAYTON LEWIS: Intuitively,
I think you're right.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.459
I don't have that data.

00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:25.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.541
CLAYTON LEWIS: A
quick example there.

00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:27.490
Intuit.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.770
So Intuit decided
to launch Arivale

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.394
across their organization.

00:47:31.394 --> 00:47:33.310
And the first thing they
did is say, OK, we're

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.851
going to let 200
individuals who have

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.860
Intuit enroll in the program.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.777
Oh, by the way, we--

00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:39.735
Intuit-- have paid our
employees to participate

00:47:39.735 --> 00:47:40.610
in wellness programs.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.720
We're going to charge
them $1,000 for Arivale.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.760
And so we're like, hm.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.420
Great.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.460
So we drop onto
the Inuit campus.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.080
We're there for 48 hours.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.030
And there was only 200 slots.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.640
When registration opened, an
hour and 10 minutes later,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.300
all 200 were taken.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.160
And Intuit had objectives
around BMI, weight,

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.000
they had objectives
around diabetes.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.030
And so within six months, we had
exceeded both of those metrics

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.110
by 50%.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.340
So then they said, OK, we
want to enroll another 200.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.820
And now they're rolling out
throughout their whole company.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:12.020
Now, what Intuit does is
they put $1,000 a year

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.310
into their employees'
HSA account.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.640
And so they now
can use that money

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.600
to pay for the Arivale program.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.470
So we see more and more
where companies are funding

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.930
flexible spending accounts,
health savings accounts

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.212
for people to deploy
against wellness offerings.

00:48:26.212 --> 00:48:27.170
AUDIENCE: Hey, Clayton.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.600
Thanks again for
joining us today.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.641
CLAYTON LEWIS: Of course.

00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:30.450
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.780
Would love to hear your
point of view on the data,

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.190
whether it's with Arivale
or another company,

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:40.700
being used for means that aren't
consistent with your mission.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.750
Because I totally
agree with the mission.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.310
But think insurance
companies using

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.707
that for preexisting
conditions and the like.

00:48:48.707 --> 00:48:51.290
CLAYTON LEWIS: So my old boss,
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter,

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:53.810
actually passed the
GINA Legislation.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.510
And the GINA
Legislation prohibits

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:00.080
discrimination based on
employment and health care,

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.680
doesn't prohibit discrimination
based on long-term disability

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.690
and life insurance.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.680
So, interesting.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.160
Our philosophy is that
you own your data,

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.355
and we will not share
your data with anyone.

00:49:13.355 --> 00:49:15.230
And the first thing that
happens is that when

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.960
your data comes in it's all
de-identified from any personal

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.230
health information.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:23.390
So even if our data sets get
hacked on the research side,

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.480
it's been stripped of all
identifiable information.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.940
And even these relationships
we have with employers

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.910
like Intuit or Colgate or
Providence St. Joseph, we say,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.110
you can't get access to
your employees' data.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.080
And so there has to
be a bright line.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.240
Because one, if
there wasn't people

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.820
wouldn't have confidence
about coming in.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.817
Two, part of what keeps me
up at night is data security.

00:49:44.817 --> 00:49:47.150
Because we've got some of the
most prominent individuals

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.760
in the country, both business
leaders and elected officials,

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.420
in our program.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.610
And they've said, you
know, if my data goes out

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.500
it would take my stock price.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.280
And so not only would it be a
company killing event, but--

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.720
we have eight values.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.570
And one of our values is trust.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.070
Another value is privacy.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.600
That said, you know,
bad stuff happens.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.470
And so it's a small company
with only 175 employees.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.690
We have three on data
security and a team

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.730
we hire outside
firms that come in

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.410
and try to hack us
down to where they'll

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.790
call in to the
customer care line

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:17.998
and say, oh, this is Clayton.

00:50:17.998 --> 00:50:19.670
I need so-and-so's information.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.300
And so we do a lot
of things where

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.630
we're trying to be focused
on protecting that.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:24.948
Does that answer the question?

00:50:24.948 --> 00:50:25.573
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:25.573 --> 00:50:29.930
So just being clear,
insurance cannot use that.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:31.980
CLAYTON LEWIS: They
don't have access to it.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.860
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.727
CLAYTON LEWIS: But to be
clear, the GINA Legislation--

00:50:36.727 --> 00:50:38.560
well, two things that
we're doing right now.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.170
Right now, because we are a
health and wellness company,

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.330
we're only giving you
genetic information

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:44.842
related to health and wellness.

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:46.800
So we're not giving you
information about BRCA.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.460
We're not giving you
information about Alzheimer's.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.209
We're not giving you
information about any

00:50:50.209 --> 00:50:54.380
of those highly-impactful
disease states.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.650
So we're not even
giving you information.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:59.440
The GINA Legislation,
for life insurance

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.590
or for long-term disability--
some insurance companies will

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.810
say, OK, do you have
this information?

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:08.170
And, you know, they're
asking you to disclose.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:11.389
We're not-- you would not
get that information from us.

00:51:11.389 --> 00:51:13.180
Because, A, we haven't
disclosed it to you.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.880
Now, the future is
going to be interesting.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.030
And what I would say
is that the current FDA

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:22.390
is being more thoughtful
about understanding

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.322
that genetic information
should be given to individuals,

00:51:25.322 --> 00:51:26.780
and they should
own their own data.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.430
So there's been some vast
transformations there.

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:33.290
AUDIENCE: I think that
probably answered my question.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.640
So I feel the health
care industry is

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.320
a heavily-regulated industry.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.810
And my only real question is--

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:44.300
I just want you to comment
on the FDA regulations.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:48.070
For example, at one point
FDA prohibits companies

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:51.460
that report relations with
cancer, with [? GINA. ?]

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.440
And then at one point
maybe this ban got lifted.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:03.942
And from your point of view, how
to overcome these challenges?

00:52:03.942 --> 00:52:05.650
CLAYTON LEWIS: So the
FDA is interesting.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.899
As I said, I worked in
Congress for a number of years.

00:52:07.899 --> 00:52:10.540
And the FDA is a
bit of a black box

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:13.040
because there's not, like,
this playbook that says,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.250
OK, this is what's happening.

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.500
And things are
evolving so quickly.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.480
And their positions are
evolving, especially

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.125
with the new administration.

00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:24.430
And so what we decided to do
out of the gate as a business

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.780
is to embrace the
regulatory practice.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.770
So the first thing that happens
when an individual signs up--

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.630
in every state we
operate, we have

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:33.550
an independent
third-party physician.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.950
And that physician orders
all the clinical labs.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:39.250
The clinical labs all
are CLIA-approved labs.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:42.160
And then we have a licensed
professional dietitian,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.110
licensed in the
state where you live,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.894
coaching you on what she or
he is allowed to practice.

00:52:47.894 --> 00:52:49.810
So we made a business
decision out of the gate

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.976
to embrace the regulatory
environment so we wouldn't

00:52:51.976 --> 00:52:53.730
have the 23andMe experience.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.200
We also, because we're trying
to change people's lives,

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.600
we believe it's important to
have the right professionals

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.430
engaged in the conversation.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.450
On the flip-side--

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.290
I'm friends with Senator Patty
Murray and Maria Cantwell.

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:07.720
And Patty Murray is
the ranking Democrat

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.850
on the Senate and Health
Human Services Committee.

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:11.808
So we've been going in
and having conversations

00:53:11.808 --> 00:53:12.910
with her and her team.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.760
And she actually hired a
number of former FDA staffers

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.770
to try to help us
sort of figure out how

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.950
do we have thoughtful
conversations with the FDA

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:24.670
on saying, let's
look at the fact

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.710
that we are scientific data.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.300
Let's look at the
fact that there's

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.160
consumers that take
this information

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.024
and use it in a
very powerful way.

00:53:32.024 --> 00:53:33.940
And once again, thank
you to 23andMe for being

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.500
a leader in this space.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.060
And they went
through and now had

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.790
a number of genetic
variants approved

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.660
where the FDA has looked at how
they present that information.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.410
The FDA has reviewed
it and said, OK, that

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:47.680
is fine to give that information
directly to a consumer.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.180
The FDA, as you
know, originally was

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.220
concerned because
there weren't licensed

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.690
professionals involved.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:54.789
You know, there weren't
physicians reviewing it.

00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:55.830
There weren't dietitians.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.810
And so we've taken a
different business model

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.850
to embrace the current
regulatory environment

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.114
and completely
play by the rules.

00:54:03.114 --> 00:54:04.030
But it is challenging.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.261
Like, the state of New York--

00:54:05.261 --> 00:54:07.510
the state of New York is the
only state that we cannot

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.530
operate in.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.631
And we're going through
their regulatory process.

00:54:10.631 --> 00:54:12.880
It's going to cost us hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.080
and take about a year.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.780
And think about that.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:19.517
49 other states--
we're completely

00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:21.100
embraced their
regulatory environment.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.308
New York is unique in terms
of the amount of money we

00:54:23.308 --> 00:54:24.820
have to spend and the process.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.477
And so there are some legacy
states that are challenged.

00:54:27.477 --> 00:54:29.935
But we love the state of New
York, in case you're watching.

00:54:29.935 --> 00:54:31.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.794
Is there a last--

00:54:33.794 --> 00:54:34.460
ALEK ICEV: Yeah.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.380
I think we are right on time.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.713
CLAYTON LEWIS: Fun conversation.

00:54:36.713 --> 00:54:38.880
ALEK ICEV: So I would
really like to thank Clayton

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.470
for coming here
today to talk to us,

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.429
and I hope everybody
enjoyed the talk.

00:54:43.429 --> 00:54:45.470
CLAYTON LEWIS: I really
loved all your questions.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.511
I brought brochures and
business cards over there

00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:48.850
if you want more information.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.070
And thank you so much.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.278
Thank you for being a member.

00:54:51.278 --> 00:54:52.564
And I loved your questions.

00:54:52.564 --> 00:54:54.230
Great to have the
conversation with you.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:55.121
Thank you.

00:54:55.121 --> 00:54:57.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:58.800
Your questions were great.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.650
Thank you.
