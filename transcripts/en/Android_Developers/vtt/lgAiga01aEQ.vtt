00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.100
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.460
Hello, everyone.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.680
Welcome to Android
Design in Action.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.490
This week's episode is
unlike the other

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.440
episodes that you've seen.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.340
This week we're going
to have a hangout,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.239
Google+ Hangout on air.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.390
Oh, right, that's probably
a good idea.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.650
We're going to have a Google+
Hangout on air to discuss

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.950
design, specifically this show
or other top tips or anything

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.950
that folks may have.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm, as always, your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.000
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys,
Adam Koch.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.480
ROMAN NURIK: And Nick Butcher
unfortunately

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.490
couldn't join today.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.750
I think he's out sick.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.800
We've invited him to the Hangout
just in case he wants

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.830
to join, but he'll probably
stay home and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.790
rest up for next week.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.950
So with that, let's
get started.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.080
We're going to structure the
format of this Hangout not

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.750
like a regular Hangout where
we just talk about stuff.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.100
We're going to go into a few
slides in the very beginning.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.480
We want to talk briefly about
the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 10

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.570
very, very briefly.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.140
And then at the end, we'll have
a few slides, as well.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.209
But for most of this episode,
we'll be talking to the folks

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.400
that have joined to see what
thoughts they may have.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.015
So let's jump into the slides.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.170
So Android Design in Action.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.040
Let's see if I can navigate
this thing.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.010
There we go.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.730
So the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.120
As many of you know these
are the newest

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.280
devices coming from Google.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.340
These are the newest
devices in the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.000
Nexus family of products.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.675
The Nexus 4 is a handset.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:37.220
It's 4.7 inches diagonally.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.360
You can see all the
screen specs here.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.980
The Nexus 10 is a 10-inch
device, so it's a new

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.100
reference device, if you will,
for a 10-inch size, kind of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.870
replacing the Motorola Zoom,
in our opinion, for pure

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.260
Android experiences.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.480
The important thing to note is
that this is I guess the first

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.540
time, Adam, that we've
had such a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.160
high-density tablet display.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.870
Before, almost all tablet
displays, 10-inch tablet

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.910
displays, have been MDPI.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.460
ADAM KOCH: I don't think any
of them have been anything

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.470
other than MDPI.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.070
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.290
So they've all been roughly, I
guess, 1, 280 by 800 pixels,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.330
so this doubles that.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.650
So you now have a crazy number
of pixels on the screen.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.510
The good thing is that the dip
resolution hasn't changed, so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.160
your existing layouts
will just work.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.380
The difference, though, is that
the assets that will be

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.570
used in those layouts, you know
if you have buttons and

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.400
things like that, they'll
be twice the density, so

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.220
basically 320 DPI assets.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.820
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, any assets
I guess shared

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.890
from your phone UI--

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.006
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.590
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, any assets
shared from your phone UI,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.760
obviously the tablet UI on Nexus
10 will just pick those

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.710
up immediately.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.100
But if you have any assets that
are specific to tablet

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.020
layouts, you will need to
update to include XHDPI.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.990
Also for Nexus 4, it's worth
mentioning that the width is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.830
slightly larger than
Galaxy Nexus.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.920
It's 1,280 by 768 as opposed
to 1,280 by 720.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.980
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and that maps
to about 24 extra dips--

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.410
horizontal dips of
resolution--

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.760
for the Nexus 4 as compared to
the Galaxy Nexus or other

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.680
devices like that.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.950
So that's the new devices.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.635
I mean, there's lots and lots of
other stuff to talk about,

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:31.270
but you guys probably know all
these things from all the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.550
different press that's
been out there.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.200
But these are some of the
details that are probably

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.660
important to designers
in thinking

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.900
about these new devices.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.950
And then just to recap.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.670
We now have the Nexus 4, the
Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.230
And here are, again,
their rough screen

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.340
specs, if you will.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.980
The other thing we should
point out is

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.030
that launcher icons--

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.640
as many of you know, when
designing for MDPI tablets, I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.550
guess the older density or the
earlier density for tablets,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.450
you'll also want to provide
an HDPI launcher icon.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.480
Because what the launcher does--
and the launcher is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.190
that home screen, as
many of you know.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.500
What the launcher does is when
it displays an icon for an

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.230
app, it chooses the one bucket
larger icon because it wants a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.640
physically larger icon.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.100
So instead of showing a
48-by-48 dip icon in a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.950
launcher, it actually
chooses to show

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.090
a larger icon launcher.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.540
So to get an icon of that high
resolution, it basically uses

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.060
a shortcut.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.600
It basically looks at the
same asset at a higher

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.100
density and uses that.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.700
So on XHDPI tablets
like the Nexus 10,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.800
that one bucket larger--

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.590
that one size larger icon
is actually XXHDPI or

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.520
480 dots per inch.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.680
The important thing to note
here is that the tablet

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.770
itself, the screen itself,
is not XXHDPI.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.630
It's simply that the framework
and the launcher will be

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.450
looking at XXHDPI.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.860
It'll be looking for an
icon in that folder.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.210
So basically, you want to
provide just the launcher icon

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.430
in 480 DPI and nothing else
because everything else will

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.420
just not be used.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.680
So XHDPI for all your regular
assets, and then your launcher

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.250
icon should be in both
XHDPI and XXHPI.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.480
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.150
I believe this only holds
true for tablet.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.680
So Nexus 7 included, but not for
handsets, is that right?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.710
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.070
All right.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.960
And I think that's really
all the slides we had.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.180
So let's jump into-- let
me just turn off

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.760
the screenshare here.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.750
Let's jump into the
discussion.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.570
So to get started, I'd say we
should all just introduce

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.290
ourselves really quickly.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.220
Like I said, I'm Roman,
and we have Adam here.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.900
Do you guys want to just go
around table to introduce

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.920
yourselves, maybe starting
with Akhil.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.680
AKHIL INDURTI: OK.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.280
Hey, guys.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.400
I'm a 17-year-old Android
developer

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.230
from Ashburn, Virgina.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.570
I've only recently started.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.720
I finished learning Java
extensively, and I'm actually

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.610
going to apply to the Google's
Computer Science Institute in

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.120
the summer.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.650
So hopefully, I can see
you guys there.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.750
I use Fireworks as my program
of choice for design.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.920
And obviously, I like to use
Eclipse because it's easy to

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.170
work with for me.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.940
OK, that's my introduction.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.310
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.280
Do you want to move on to Ed?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.640
ED LEA: Yup.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.700
Hi, I'm Ed.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.560
And I'm a designer
working mostly

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.270
Android, but iOS as well.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.900
And I've worked for a company
called Qiip, and we're working

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.360
on bringing the Qiip hop up to
Holo standards at the moment,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.090
so a bit Gingerbread.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.478
ROMAN NURIK: Very cool.

00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:03.330
All right, Linden, do
you want to go next?

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.630
LINDEN DARLING: G'day.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.860
I'm Linden Darling.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.090
I'm a professional Android
developer based in Australia.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.950
I make my own apps, also provide
Android development to

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.230
banks and other companies
to make their apps.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.650
I do a little bit of dabbling
in design and

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.900
multimedia as well.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.340
ADAM KOCH: Cool, cool.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.520
Linden, where are you
in Australia?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.560
LINDEN DARLING: I'm
in Melbourne.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.995
ADAM KOCH: OK.

00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:33.415
I'm from Melbourne,
originally.

00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:36.960
Hopefully, you've met our
counterparts in Sydney

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.370
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah.
yeah, yeah.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.227
I don't know why they're based
in Sydney to be honest.

00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:45.664
ADAM KOCH: We used to have a
Melbourne office, but it's not

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:48.670
there anymore, actually.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.220
ROMAN NURIK: Cool, all right.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.450
And is it Ron or Ran?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.610
RAN NACHMANY: It's Ran.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.654
ROMAN NURIK: Ran, do you
want to go next?

00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:56.230
RAN NACHMANY: I'm Ran.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.700
I'm an Android developer
from Israel.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.400
So we're covering, I think,
the whole world here.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.650
We're only missing Nick
from the UK, and

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.170
then we' d have Europe.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.790
Actually I'm a GDE, a software
expert, and I'm working a lot

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.260
here in the community and
providing professional

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:22.280
services to companies or
building community events,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.270
talking in them, and so on.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.300
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.980
Well, welcome to the Hangout.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.300
And we have two other
participants, Oscar and--

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.799
I believe it's pronounced
"De-an-dre." I'm not sure.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.679
But if you guys want to
introduce yourselves, feel

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.940
free, although your
video is muted.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.799
If not, then we'll
just move on.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.093
OK, and feel free to
join at any point.

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:50.270
Oh, is it "De-an-dre?" or am
I pronouncing that right?

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.090
DANDRE ALLISON: I'm Dandre.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.640
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, Dandre.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.590
Do you want to introduce
yourself?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.960
DANDRE ALLISON: Sure.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.320
I am a Android developer.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.260
I started a little
over a year ago.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.510
I'm in San Francisco.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.940
I guess I started at the
interesting point where you

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.022
guys were switching to Holo and
3.0, and then Ice Cream

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:18.310
Sandwich came out, and
then Jelly Bean.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:24.240
So it's been a pretty drastic
change since when I started

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.520
and how it is now.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.580
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, Android has
gone under somewhat of a

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.220
reimagining, I guess the core
visual image, and it's visual

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.400
identity has really just gone
under a complete renovation

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680
since maybe, even
two years ago.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.060
So, yeah, that's a great
time to join.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.700
Welcome to Android.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.840
And Oscar, we're assuming that
you're just a bit shy, or

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.010
don't want to join, or have
video meter or such.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.260
But anyway, we'll just
get started.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.720
Feel free to join when
you're ready.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.710
God, I suck at working
Hangouts.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.830
ADAM KOCH: No, no.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.190
It's good, good.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.290
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.410
So guys, do you want to just
start off with any sort of top

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.210
tips that you have or maybe
even like favorite apps or

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.240
anything like that?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.550
The floor is really yours.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.120
What types of things do you
want to talk about?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.980
AKHIL INDURTI: I was wondering
if I could

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.226
show a design maybe?

00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:23.722
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, sure.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.490
Totally.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.796
AKHIL INDURTI: And this
is my Chrome.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.320
I actually showed Roman this.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.310
I emailed him a while back.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.970
And it's basically a
course-organizing app for

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.740
students that I'm currently
working on.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.810
And it lets basically organize
all their courses, and

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.590
assignments, and schedules with
their teachers, and their

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.030
contacts with their teachers.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.170
I have one question.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.020
If you can see my contextual
action bar here, what color

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.270
should I make that?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.230
ROMAN NURIK: Wow, of
all the questions.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.150
So contextual action bars, I
mean, just using the default

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.300
color is generally fine.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.660
In general, you really want
to just hint that it's a

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.750
different mode.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.820
So really maybe a
darker version.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.730
If you do want to change it,
then maybe a slightly darker

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.910
version of your core accent
color which seems to be brown.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.300
I know the general palette is
kind of brown, like a dark

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.230
burnt orange and like
a tan paper.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.740
So maybe something that's
somewhere along the spectrum,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.410
maybe slightly darker.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.200
But I think the big important
point here is that you just

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.360
want to visually indicate that
it's a different mode.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.960
So as long as it's fairly
different from the standard

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.150
action bar, it should be OK.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.824
If anybody else has thoughts
feel free to jump in.

00:11:52.824 --> 00:11:54.430
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, i was just
going to say, I think it's

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.350
fine to leave it, to be honest,
unless you really want

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.275
to get that full theme-y
thing across, albeit

00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:02.750
I think it's fine.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.300
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and in
general, when we talk about

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.555
Holo, there's lots of different
guidelines that fold

00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:14.130
under Holo, this
Holo umbrella.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.510
One of those guidelines
is the visuals, right?

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.045
But I think for me the visuals
are less important, and what's

00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:21.750
more important is the
interactions, right?

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.190
So having the check
box there, right?

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.240
Having the done button there is
far more important than the

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.370
specific color of
the action bar.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.150
That is really up to you as a
designer to choose what looks

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.150
best to you But really, the core
things that you should be

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.960
leaving are the standard
expected interactions like

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.910
pressing the top left area,
which would be a check box to

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.830
close the action mode, having
the action overflow there in

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.860
case there are additional
actions.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.930
So it's really, for me, more
about the interaction side of

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.190
things than the visual
side of things.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.543
Although the visuals are
important, it's really just up

00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:00.460
to you to make them look good.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.960
AKHIL INDURTI: Yeah, and
one more question.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.410
For the check boxes here, if
someone was to click on it, do

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:15.370
you think it's good for the
entire list item to go to the

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.050
bottom of the list, or should
they stay there?

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.670
ROMAN NURIK: The checkbox really
means that it's like a

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.120
completed task?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.400
AKHIL INDURTI: Yeah.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.850
ROMAN NURIK: In general,
I'd say--

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.800
and this is just
a general rule.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.050
Do what people would expect.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.520
In general, what users expect is
what they're used to, what

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.180
they're accustomed to.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.800
And so if there is something on
the system, especially if

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.870
it comes with their device, if
there's a system app or a

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:45.430
platform app that does this
exact thing, then just mirror

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.150
what that does because that's
just what they're going to be

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.210
accustomed to.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:53.320
In this case, I can't think of
anything where a check box

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.850
marks something as completed
that's built into the system.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.060
So in this case, you don't
really have much of a default

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.610
to rely on.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.620
One thing you could consider,
though, is when you interact

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.760
with something, if it's jumping
around, it's going to

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.290
be hard to continually
interact with it.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.870
So let's say you wanted to
check it, mark it as

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.890
completed, and then do
something else to it.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.200
If you mark it as checked and
then it jumps down, your

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.940
finger is no longer at the
relevant target, right?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.290
So you basically have to
jump around there.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.250
That's just another
minor point.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.570
I think it's less important
than following conventions

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.900
because again, that's what
people are going to expect.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.190
But I think in this case, having
it jump around too much

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.365
may be a negative thing.

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:42.940
Does anybody else have
comments on that?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.440
ED LEA: Yeah.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.625
If you did put it to the bottom
of the list, and the

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.470
bottom of the list is actually
off the bottom of the screen,

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.590
then you're probably going
to struggle to

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.780
find that moved item.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.380
So maybe try and distinguish
it a bit more

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.420
than just being checked.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.585
I know a lot of apps change the
color or maybe some kind

00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:04.870
of strikethrough or something
if it's a done item.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.750
That's quite a common pattern.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.332
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and one of
our favorite apps, the Tasks

00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:12.400
app by Team Tasks, they
do exactly that.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.670
They just show an additional
strikethrough as an additional

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.708
visual indicator that something
is checked.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.010
RAN NACHMANY: Actually,
I would go with a

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.380
swipe-to-dismiss instead
of a check box.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.870
ROMAN NURIK: Definitely
another option.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.700
Absolutely another option.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.250
We talked about this, not last
week, but two weeks ago or

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.320
three weeks ago on
that episode.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.220
Swipe to dismiss is definitely
another option.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.850
Nick's very much in
favor of that.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.430
RAN NACHMANY: You can see that
in task management, like

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.700
any.DO, they're doing it.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.140
And I can't think of other apps,
but it's very natural to

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.310
the user to just get things
out of his way.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.070
AKHIL INDURTI: I'm curious
on how you would go about

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.790
implementing the swipe
to dismiss, actually.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.490
I may be going way
over my time.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.190
So I'm probably done but--

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.090
RAN NACHMANY: Actually,
that's easy.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.150
I think, Roman, it's your
library, right?

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.910
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so--

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.700
I don't know if I have
keep pressing around.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.956
God, these Hangouts are
very difficult.

00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:15.930
So yeah, I wrote a library--
well, not a library, a gist on

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.800
GitHub that basically did swipe
to dismiss for you.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.040
So for any list view or any
vertical linear layout, it

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.990
gives you that's swipe
automatically.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.930
But one of the differences is
the item that you swipe to

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.955
dismiss actually
then goes away.

00:16:30.955 --> 00:16:33.520
And so in this case, I don't
really know if you would want

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.060
the item to disappear so much
as you want to change its

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.300
visual state.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.310
You may be able to use some of
the things from that library

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.050
in this app.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.920
But I don't think necessarily
that swiping to hide the item

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.830
would work.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.840
ADAM KOCH: One thing Nick
pointed out the other week was

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.320
a really nice pattern is to
swipe, and then have an Undo

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.430
button hiding underneath, and
then you tap that and it comes

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.720
back again.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.350
Just another thing
to think about.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.900
ROMAN NURIK: All right, Akhil,
maybe you want to show just

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.920
one more screen, then we'll
move on to other topics.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.440
AKHIL INDURTI: Oh,
actually no.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.270
I was done with my
screenshots.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.540
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
well, overall, yeah

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.630
it was a great job.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.540
Like you said, I did
see it before.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.220
You sent me that email.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.260
It's a great job overall.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.410
There are just some
minor things.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.510
But, yeah, following that
through and publishing it on

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.980
Google Play, let us know when
that happens, and we'll make

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.760
sure to take a look and see if
there's any sort of promotion

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.550
we can provide.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.390
But yeah, it's a really great
start to the job there.

00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:31.180
AKHIL INDURTI: All
right, thanks.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.130
ROMAN NURIK: Anyone else want
to either show their work or

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.950
talk about--

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.990
and also one of the options,
if you want to rant about

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.190
something for like a full
minute, by all means.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.740
There's plenty to rant
about, I'm sure.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.070
But if you do want to rant
about it, that's

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.420
just another option.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.590
But also if you have work to
show, if you want to get

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.987
comments from the rest of the
folks here, then that's

00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:56.250
definitely another option.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.020
Any takers?

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.980
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, so I have
a couple things to show.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.440
ROMAN NURIK: Let's see them.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.856
LINDEN DARLING: Can
you hear me?

00:18:03.856 --> 00:18:04.690
ROMAN NURIK: Yup.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.560
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah,
yeah, cool.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.090
OK.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.120
So I'll be real quick.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.940
Obviously, there's the Android
Assets Viewer, which I think

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.820
everyone is going to
find very useful.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.260
Another thing is a little
library that I've been working

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:24.070
on that basically extends and
fixes up the setError

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.770
functionality I'll feature
in Android in a bit.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.520
So I'll quickly show you that.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.850
ROMAN NURIK:
Formidable-validation, that's

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.040
a cool name.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.820
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.950
So it's providing easy
validation for forms as well

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:45.100
as making the feedback
consistent.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.450
So you've got setError
working for any

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.650
TextView-derived class or view.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:03.820
But it doesn't work for, say,
a spinner or a selector.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.260
Basically, you can
add setError.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.260
You can extend any view and make
it setError-able and then

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.390
use this validation manager.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.260
And it will be set the error
on anything that

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.080
got errors on it.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:25.640
So that's stemmed from me having
to provide feedback in

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:32.420
very complex forms
and Android apps.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.140
ROMAN NURIK: So if you have even
like a check box or like,

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.350
for example, I accept the terms
and conditions, if you

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.390
don't check it, you can
have a an error

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.570
bubble show above that.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.040
I'm guessing, right?

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.140
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah,
so that's like a

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.995
dependency sort of.

00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:55.050
It's the way I've categorized or
named something like that.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.730
For instance, here if you're
signing up to a newsletter,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.960
you've clicked the "yeah,
I want to sign up to the

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.070
newsletter" check box.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.700
That then makes the email
address fields necessary.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.580
So if that wasn't checked, then
you wouldn't be getting

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.610
an error frame on that one.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.130
So it's got a couple
validators.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.960
Generally a lot of people are
going to be using the regular

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.622
expression validator, but you
can write your own ones and

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.570
add them in as well.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.590
So, yeah, this is Open Source.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.110
And it would be great if you
guys could have a look, and

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.245
anyone that's interested in
using it or adding to it or

00:20:33.245 --> 00:20:36.720
extending it gets involved,
that would be sweet.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:36.880
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.840
And what was the Android
Assets Viewer?

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.480
I remember reading about
it a little bit.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.515
But do you want to give a brief
overview and maybe show

00:20:43.515 --> 00:20:45.510
some examples?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.500
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, let
me just share that one.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.060
Tell me if you can see it.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:50.910
LINDEN DARLING: Is
that up now?

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.660
ROMAN NURIK: Mm-hm.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.980
LINDEN DARLING: OK, so it's --

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.190
again, it stemmed from, I
suppose, pains that I've found

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:04.160
in different contracts working
quickly to make apps and

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.490
working with designers that are
generally new to Android.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:16.250
So basically, the idea is you
want to provide an easy way to

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.670
show graphics and look at all
of the graphics across your

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.280
different size buckets, all
the drawable variants.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.060
So this does that and
gives a little

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.390
bit of analysis feedback.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:38.230
It's showing you whether your
sizes are right, whether

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.180
you've got odd pixels, or
whether you're going to have

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.850
half-pixels and stuff.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.940
For instance, this
is the assets.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.660
I've uploaded the assets from
formidable-validation, that

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.890
library I just showed you, and
you can see them here, that

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.360
it's showing different sizes.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.950
So you've got your
LDPIs your MDPIs.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:11.934
There's even the XXHDPI in
there, just to be super fresh.

00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:15.800
And here, it's missing an
XXHDPI, but it's saying that

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.100
basically if you were to put
that in, the right size of it,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.380
it's shown in green.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.960
It's 96 by 96.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.310
So it's just providing--

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.840
ROMAN NURIK: Does it look
at which assets

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.490
you currently have?

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:33.300
So if you have some random
assets that's like 40 by 40 in

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.730
MDPI, it will show you what the
equivalent is in XHDPI in

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.750
an empty slot if
it's not there?

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.170
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.690
That's exactly what it's
doing here, right?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:49.140
So all of these are based
off MDPI at the moment.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.180
I might add something to look
at sizing based on other

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.610
buckets if the MDPI
isn't there.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.130
But you can see here that
the MDPI is 48 by 48.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.586
It's suggesting that
the XHDPI--

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.970
well, it's saying that it's
not there, and it

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.200
should be 96 by 96.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.650
You can see, here that TVDPI
is always going to have odd

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.930
pixels or half-pixels.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.330
And so it's I guess a way of
when you're talking to

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.080
designers that are trying to
give you iOS graphics and

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.970
don't want to do any more work,
this is a great way to

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.540
bring them on board and
show them things.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.306
ED LEA: How do you put those?

00:23:39.306 --> 00:23:39.760
LINDEN DARLING: What was that?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.620
Sorry?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.810
ED LEA: How do you actually
put your assets into this?

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.360
LINDEN DARLING: Oh, yeah.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.660
So you just upload either
an APK or a zip file.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.160
If you're afraid that I'm going
to reverse-engineer your

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.640
APK, which I could do anyway
just getting it off the

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.650
market, you can just
zip you're res

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.390
folder and upload that.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.625
So It's looking for a res
folder that's containing

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:09.050
drawable folders.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.975
So you've got your
drawable LDPI--

00:24:12.975 --> 00:24:13.950
no DPIs.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.770
Well, whatever--

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.500
you might have your extra-large

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.070
whatever bucket is there.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.455
It's going to show them all.

00:24:21.455 --> 00:24:23.290
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome All right,
Linden, we're running a

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.440
little low on time, but
what's the fastest--

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.205
LINDEN DARLING: One
last quick thing.

00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:26.750
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, sure.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.910
LINDEN DARLING: One
last quick thing--

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.480
the Device Viewer.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.810
So this is something I added
just recently, and it lets you

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:40.900
view this stuff on real devices,
scaled as though it's

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.535
on that device.

00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:46.910
So it gives you a real quick
glimpse as to how things are

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.170
going to scale and how those
graphics and different buckets

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.700
are going to look on different
devices at their original

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.010
smaller size.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.840
In this case, it's a 9-patch
with scale, and you can get it

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.310
just for what it would look
like at its smallest size.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.370
ROMAN NURIK: And the most
important thing, Linden, how

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.060
do you get to this
awesome tool?

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.240
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, so it's
at celebellum.net--

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.360
which is like cerebellum
if you hold your

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.320
tongue and say it--

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.440
slash androidassetsviewer.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.230
So I'll just show you there.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.310
ADAM KOCH: We can post a
link up in the Google+

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.080
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we'll
definitely post a link

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.620
afterwards.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.650
LINDEN DARLING: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.050
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.460
Let's move on, though,
since we're running a

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.470
little low on time.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.450
I just want to get one last
thing from everybody

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.790
who wants to answer.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.750
What would you like to see in
a future episode of Android

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.490
Design in Action?

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.640
What specific topics would
you like us to cover?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.155
And let's it, I guess,
from Akhil.

00:25:51.155 --> 00:25:53.080
AKHIL INDURTI: Crouton
versus Toasts.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.140
ROMAN NURIK: Crouton
versus Toasts.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.770
AKHIL INDURTI: I'm wondering.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.800
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.260
AKHIL INDURTI: It's a new
library, and I was just

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.080
wondering who's out there
using Crouton right now.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.720
ROMAN NURIK: OK, yeah.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.140
It's an awesome library.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.220
It's definitely interesting to
provide a different and more

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.270
contextual Toast almost.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.380
Definitely a good topic, we'll
keep that in mind.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.375
Dandre, any thoughts?

00:26:19.386 --> 00:26:21.810
DANDRE ALLISON: I'll
pass for now.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:22.820
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.710
All right, Ed or Linden?

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.960
ED LEA: Yeah, I've got
a couple of requests.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.480
And I guess one of them is the
production process from

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:41.090
graphics to developer and how
do you manage that process?

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:46.450
Do you design MDPI and then just
email it over graphics,

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.640
or do you share some repo--

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.080
just the whole production
process would be quite good.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.070
I guess a little bit on fonts
and thoughts on including more

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:05.090
than just the bold and regular,
and whether that's a

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.960
good idea to do or not.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.800
And then tablet apps, a lot of
developers have got mobile

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.670
apps out there, which could
work on a Nexus 7.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.220
How much effort should be put
in to releasing for a tablet

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.180
versus making people wait for
the app and releasing a custom

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.960
type of app?

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.340
ROMAN NURIK: Totally.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.510
And we did have an episode
recently on responsive design,

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.830
but we're definitely going to do
more on tablet design since

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:39.390
it is a nuanced area in
designing for mobile since

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.860
it's like semi-mobile, but
definitely something that

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.310
we're going to continue
to talk about.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.810
And those other suggestions
we're great.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.220
We're definitely going to
looking into that as well.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.360
Linden and Ran, any thoughts on
things we should cover for

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.880
future episodes?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.490
LINDEN DARLING: I mean, the
stuff that Nick and Marie did

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.610
at some conference in Germany,
I saw a video for that where

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.507
they did a redesign on the fly
and showed the thoughts that

00:28:07.507 --> 00:28:10.430
would go in the plan, and
that's really useful and

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.990
interesting.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:15.230
I think something like that
could be good to do again.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.280
ROMAN NURIK: Definitely.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.325
LINDEN DARLING: You do it
with obviously lots

00:28:17.325 --> 00:28:18.060
of different apps.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.246
You guys started doing that with
your looking at apps at

00:28:22.246 --> 00:28:23.060
the moment as well.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.496
But I think having the design
tools out there and showing

00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:31.190
how people can do it
quickly as well.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:37.800
And also tackling the big
problem of making an app look

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:48.750
good on Honeycomb Plus, but as
well as old Gingerbread 2.2,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.200
without, say, using--

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.090
just going for a pure Holo
theme and trying to

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.200
pull that all back.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.000
This is just the main problem.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.180
I know you guys are pushing
for the newest

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.010
style all the time.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:06.610
But the reality is that apps out
there and companies want

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:11.710
to target as much of the market
as they can, and stuff

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.230
just doesn't look that great.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.500
Not everything--

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.960
even Holo, everywhere doesn't
bring everything back, and so

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.380
if there's any tricks or talking
about some of the

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.660
issues there.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.520
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so like maybe
potentially an episode

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.200
dedicated at backward
compatibility and designing

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.200
for earlier devices.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.240
That makes a lot of sense.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.140
Since that is a very pragmatic
view of the current landscape,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.030
is most devices are below
Android 3.0, so definitely

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.850
something we should look at.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.010
OK, and Ran do you have
any thoughts on

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.470
what we should include?

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.380
RAN NACHMANY: Thoughts, and
a request, actually.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.890
I started working
on a project.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.240
It will be basically a
car-mounted tablet.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.720
It will replace the
entertainment system.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.710
And will also talk with some
chip inside the vehicle that

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.040
talks with other vehicles,
other cars, to provide

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.980
collaborative safety.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.770
I don't know if you guys have
heard of that standard.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.640
It's called 11P.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.670
But never mind.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.640
We're not going to look
at that today.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.130
The idea is that it's a 7-inch
tablet that is going to be

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.760
used-- the application
is going to be used

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.490
dedicatedly in a car.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:26.040
It needs to be operated by a
driver or the passenger, but

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.110
also by the driver.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.720
So there needs to
be very little

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.430
interaction with the user.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.000
And obviously, action bar
cannot fit there.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.470
It's too small, things
like that.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.840
So right now, we're banging
our head against the wall

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.800
trying to figure out what will
be the best way or approach to

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.970
show a map, some very
necessary available

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:54.920
information, and that's it, and
still be very responsive

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.100
and intuitive to the
user if he wants

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.960
to go to other screens.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.780
And you've done some amazing job
with the design guide, but

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.300
it's all focused for mobile
phones, and mobile usage, and

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.050
that stuff.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:14.550
And actually, Android is going
to other areas and not just

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.900
handsets, tablets but also--

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.150
[FUZZY AUDIO].

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.090
ROMAN NURIK: So basically
exploring how to design for

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.510
alternative or auxiliary
use cases, right?

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.290
RAN NACHMANY: Exactly.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.920
ROMAN NURIK: So outside of the
standard holding a phone in

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.590
your hand or holding a tablet
in your two hands.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.910
Yeah, definitely something
we can look at.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.750
We'd probably need to see a few
example devices, right?

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.340
A few example use cases.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.390
But definitely we can imagine
what is the next step,

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.040
designing for the next step or
the evolution of Android

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.080
devices in different areas
and different use case.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.270
ADAM KOCH: And there are some
apps that need to do something

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.050
like that anyway.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:56.420
Like navigation apps, for
example, that have catered to

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.391
that use case.

00:31:58.391 --> 00:31:58.960
ROMAN NURIK: Totally.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.990
OK, so we're super low on time,
but we just want to run

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.310
through a few last slides.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.740
We have a little bit more
information to share.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.100
So bear with us for
just a second.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.760
So let's just quickly
run through news.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.690
And there isn't too much news.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.490
Oh, actually the most important
bit of news here is

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.250
that a uistencils.com has
recently released an Android

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.670
tablet stencil kit.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.160
And this is like a physical
metal piece of kit, I guess,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.310
that you plop down on some
paper, you fill in the blanks,

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.730
and you get your standard
iconography.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.140
You get your standard . widgets,
things like that.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.270
So if you're looking to sketch
on real paper with real pens

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.960
and pencils, then try
to get this kit.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.340
We actually do have
an example here.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.140
And you're not going to
be able to see it.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.020
I'll show it after.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.253
But the really cool thing
is that we have

00:32:58.253 --> 00:32:59.400
a few to give away.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:05.310
So we're going to be giving
away about 10.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.550
So the way in which we're going
to do this is that we're

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.590
going to ask the greater
community to take a few

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.060
screens from one of their
favorite apps, or even their

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.490
own app, redesign it using some
of the Holo elements that

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.840
you've see on this show, and
then post it to Google+

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.470
publicly by the end
of the week.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.310
And when you do post, make sure
to use the hashtags ADIA

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.900
and AndroidDesign so
we can see them.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.190
So the first or maybe the best
10-- we don't really know yet.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:38.050
We'll try to send out some
of these stencils.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.460
And these stencils, I think they
retail for like $27 on

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.590
uistencil.com.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.890
So if you want to just get them
and not wait for us to

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.390
look at your stuff, then you
go to uistencils.com

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.790
and get your copy.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:56.215
And we'll post details about
this giveaway at some point on

00:33:56.215 --> 00:34:00.230
Google+ as well, probably
right after this show.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.310
Also, I did two posts
very recently.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.910
First on wizard design, like
designing a wizard, in this

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.090
case, one the lets you order a
sandwich, very, oddly enough.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.159
But it's got all sorts of things
like dependencies, like

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.949
dependent sections and
things like that.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.460
So if you're designing wizards,
check out that post.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.179
And then lastly, cheat sheets.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.179
There's another post I did.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.630
Basically, in the action bar, as
many of you know, when you

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.969
long-press an icon in the
action bar, it shows you

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.520
little toast, a little tool
tip that pops up and

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.449
says what that does.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.080
This is really useful outside
of just the action bar.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.370
So if throughout your UI you
have icon-only UI elements,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.870
you'll want to use something
like this to give the user an

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.570
extra bit of confidence that
what they're about to press

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.850
does what they think.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.170
So this is especially important
in cases where your

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.760
iconography may not make
perfect sense.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.780
So there's a library--

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.180
I guess another GitHub gist that
shows you how you could

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.310
do this, and that's the
apps I have here.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:05.700
So I think that's all the
slides we have today.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.280
Thanks again for
joining, guys.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.020
We're hoping to do a
few more of these

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.790
Hangouts in the future.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.760
For the next few weeks, we'll
probably go back to our

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.200
regularly scheduled Android
Design in Action, where we

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.710
will be doing redesigns.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.000
But look for other invitations
to join another Hangout

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.460
sometime in the next, say, few
weeks or next two months.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.700
So thanks for joining everybody,
and I guess we'll

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.825
see you next week.

00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:33.075
Thanks, guys.
