00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.350
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.390
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.590
Let me introduce our
hosts and guests.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.840
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.620
In the studio, I have
Jeremy Walker.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.090
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.835
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:23.440
JEREMY WALKER: Doing well.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I heard you
got a lot of sleep last night.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.500
JEREMY WALKER: I did.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You
do seem very perky.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.790
I think you can hardly
sit in your chair.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.440
JEREMY WALKER: I can't.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.530
I'm too excited to the demo.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
we'll have to restrain you

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.060
then for the rest of the show.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.870
And then our distinguished
guests, from Telly--

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.200
on my left, I have
Evelio Tarazona.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.890
How are we doing?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.720
EVELIO TARAZONA: We're good.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank
you very much for

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.310
visiting us this morning.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.540
I was told that you guys hit
pretty bad traffic on 101 here

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.816
in Silicon Valley coming down
from San Francisco.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:54.110
EVELIO TARAZONA: Ah, well, it
wasn't that bad, but we are

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.400
here, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.580
And then Adil Lalani, who's
the co-founder and CTO.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How
are you doing, Adil?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.920
ADIL LALANI: Great.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.180
Happy to be here.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.960
So let's talk about Telly.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.110
What we would like to
learn is how did you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.900
come up with the idea?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.790
What is the problem you're
trying to solve?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.400
And then I understand
you came with a cool

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.030
demo for us to see.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.610
So we would like to see some
demos later on as well.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.440
ADIL LALANI: Sure.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So tell us,
how did you come up with the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.280
idea of Telly?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.050
ADIL LALANI: So the idea for
Telly actually came out of

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.100
frustration that my co-founder
and I were facing.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.440
And I think this is a
frustration that a lot of

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.370
people face.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.190
It's that I'm bored,
and I want to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.840
watch some cool videos.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.060
And finding--

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.868
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Like this
one, for example.

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:41.360
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.420
Just finding cool videos to
watch and for the right moment

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.150
is actually pretty difficult.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.220
Unless you know exactly what to
search for, there are just

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.490
too many videos out there.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.260
You don't know which
one to click on.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.350
And that's the problem we're
trying to solve.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.320
And then, you guys working on
Twitvid before on this, right?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.600
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So is Twitvid
still going on?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.020
What's the relationship
between that and your

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.396
discovery app?

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.060
ADIL LALANI: Yeah, sure.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.700
So Twitvid is still alive.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.440
Our Twitvid apps are still
strong on Android and iPhone.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.660
And Telly is an expansion beyond
Twitvid really trying

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.180
to solve the problem
of video discovery.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.560
Whereas Twitvid was more of how
do I share a video easily

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.660
on Twitter, or even
on Facebook?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you seem to
be very focused on video--

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.430
ADIL LALANI: Yes.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --but a small
pivot towards discovery

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.810
with Telly.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.910
ADIL LALANI: Yeah--

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.220
trying to address
a new use case.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.390
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.170
And then you said that the
inspiration for the product

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.910
came out of boredom?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.880
ADIL LALANI: Yeah,
pretty much.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.071
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We don't
hear that very often.

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.205
ADIL LALANI: Ever since the
beginning, my co-founder and I

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:02.360
have been really passionate
about video and just being

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.220
able to share videos
and also being able

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.370
to watch cool videos.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.370
And this is something that we
have been working on for

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.540
nearly three to four
years now.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.050
So we just love the
video space.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.530
And we think, now, this year
is going to be the big year

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.950
for video, especially for mobile
video because of LTE

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.440
and all these smartphones
getting amazing cameras.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.610
Right.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.210
So without further ado,
could you show us

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.870
a little demo about--

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.040
show us how the app works?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.080
And I understand you have a
web version as well as the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.980
mobile version.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.660
ADIL LALANI: Sure.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think you
guys brought in some cool

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.420
screen shots of the mobile app
so we can see the highlights.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.360
So why don't we try
to do that?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.840
ADIL LALANI: Sure.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.720
So as you can see, this
is Telly.com.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.940
And essentially, what we're
trying to do over here is

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.450
trying to get rid of all the
noise and really just focus in

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420
on the video that
you're watching.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.640
And the videos that are shown
to you are suggested or

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.860
recommended by your friends.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.200
So over here, it tells me that
my close friends, Apoorva and

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.460
Evan, are recommending this
Boston crazy mode video.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.480
So I can click here, watch it.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.850
And it should be something
that's fairly interesting and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.210
something I should probably
really like, because my

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.050
friends also like it.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.630
Then if I'm tired of this video,
I could just hit Next

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.320
and move to the next video.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.290
In this case, this is a video
that Telly has recommended for

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.960
me based on my viewing habits,
based on what I like, based on

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.610
many signals.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.760
This next video, again, is
another video that close

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.550
friends liked as well.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.520
So essentially, when you go to
Telly, you are discovering

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.320
videos from your friends
that are recommended.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.760
And also, at the same time,
you're discovering popular

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.430
videos as well.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.210
So I can click Popular, and
these are videos shared by the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.130
Telly community.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.310
These are hand picked--

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.161
today's funniest videos,
pretty much.

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:21.790
And you just swift through.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.770
JEREMY WALKER: I got sucked
into this the other day--

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.310
I was telling you before
the show got started.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.100
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.060
What we noticed--

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.850
this is actually a newer
version of the site.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.680
And before, we used to
have a feed style,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.710
kind of like Facebook.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.830
With this new UI, we noticed
almost triple the amount of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.880
time spent, immediately
overnight.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.980
So it shows that people are
more engaged in this

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.310
experience.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.290
Now, at the same time, this is
where we used the YouTube API

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.580
in some interesting ways.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.040
We have a really cool-- we have
searching for videos.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.590
So I really like Armin
van Buuren--

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.150
trance DJ.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.100
So I'll type in "Armin
van Buuren" here.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.600
And you can see that the auto
complete is showing me the top

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.170
videos from Armin.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.050
And so I can just narrow it down
and say, OK, actually, I

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.890
want to listen to the
top video here.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.500
So I just click on it,
and it'll start

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.790
playing that video.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.630
The other videos in the search
results are actually related

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.520
to the first video that
I just clicked on.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.920
So we pretty much got to the
core of what people want to

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.320
do, which is just
watch videos and

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.052
serendipitously discover them.

00:06:50.052 --> 00:06:50.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.880
And then, you also have
a mobile app, right?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.110
ADIL LALANI: Yes.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is
that something that

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.970
has launched recently?

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.450
ADIL LALANI: Our Android app has
been in the market now for

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.600
a few months.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
And it's doing really well.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.390
So I'll bring up the
Android app.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.831
And I'll let Evelio--

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.740
oops.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.670
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That
disconnected the cable?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.360
ADIL LALANI: I disconnected
a cable?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.610
Oops.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.156
JEREMY WALKER: These are
going to be sweet.

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:26.636
Oh, it doesn't like it.

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:27.710
EVELIO TARAZONA: All right,
you can me what

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.495
screen shot you got.

00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:28.810
ADIL LALANI: The feed.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.510
EVELIO TARAZONA: The feed.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.440
All right.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.350
And in the feed, we've been
working hurriedly to aggregate

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.930
the best videos for you, like
what matters to you, your

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.180
friends that watch or
like certain videos.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.840
Another, we take advantage of
the YouTube library, the

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.340
player library.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.140
I remember last year, it was
hard trying to work with the

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.575
HTML5 player of YouTube.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.370
ADIL LALANI: Yep.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.130
EVELIO TARAZONA: So our
CEO just emailed, I

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.090
think it was you--

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.410
ADIL LALANI: Mmhm.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.923
EVELIO TARAZONA: --or someone
in the YouTube developer

00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:06.370
relationships.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.030
And somehow, they come
up with this player.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.800
We were like, wow, this is
great, because it was really,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800
really a pain in the ass to--

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.570
For those of you those of you
watching who are not familiar

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.740
with it, we have recently
launched the YouTube Android

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.830
Player API.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.110
And this is something that we
announced late December.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.550
And actually, Telly was one of
the Trusted Testers for the

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.210
API before we launched.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.690
So we got a lot of good feedback
from you guys and a

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.215
few bug reports that
we managed to

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:31.150
fix before the launch.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:32.370
EVELIO TARAZONA: Yeah.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.299
So in your feed, you get all
the rich content, whatever.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.770
It's like the Twitvid videos.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.320
You can also get Vimeo
videos, yeah?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.850
Well, mobile, we are working
to support them.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.170
And right now we use
HTML5 player.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.430
And hopefully, someday, also
we are going to get all the

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.270
players native.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.210
For Telly, we use
our own player.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.100
It's pretty much a regular video
with some customization

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.500
on top of it.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.276
If we go further in the
screen shot demo, we--

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:10.270
ADIL LALANI: So now, it's
suggested friends.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.150
EVELIO TARAZONA: OK.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:17.770
So Telly's a social video
network, so we focus on you

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.800
being able to find your friends,
not only your Twitter

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.590
or Facebook friends, but also
to discover new people.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.780
So we try to suggest the top
users we have, also people

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.670
that you might be interested
in following so you can get

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.580
richer content in your feed.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.620
ADIL LALANI: Your profile.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.350
EVELIO TARAZONA: Well, in your
profile, you find mostly the

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:51.240
videos you have liked or
uploaded to Telly now.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.270
But also, you can
find information

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.740
like the regular profile.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.780
It's not much [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.190
ADIL LALANI: And creation.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.030
EVELIO TARAZONA: Well,
that's pretty cool.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.080
We've been working really hard
to match our iOS efforts in

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.320
the creation sides.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.660
We're trying to bring the cool
filters we have in iOS.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.200
So far, we have managed to put
really, really good filters.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.710
It's looking great.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:23.140
Hopefully soon, we can launch
them on Android, hopefully

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.920
taking advantage of the new APIs
in Jelly Bean for media.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.790
So stay tuned for it.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.160
Keep the app installed.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.390
Keep checking for any updates.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.690
We will bring new filters
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the app
will allow me to both consume

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.020
content as well as create
content, right?

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.470
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.720
EVELIO TARAZONA: Yeah.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this is
kind of the Twitvid legacy

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.010
continuing within Telly?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:54.200
ADIL LALANI: But with
more tools to create

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.320
better videos, actually.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.550
ADIL LALANI: And then,
there's also music.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.990
EVELIO TARAZONA: Yeah.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:03.490
So one of the points of having
good creation tools beyond

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.300
just taking the video, we want
to focus also on having great,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.850
great tools to edit
your videos.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.950
So background music was one of
the cool things you can do

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.650
with the app.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.590
You can add music
to your videos.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.740
And you can tune it up,
whatever, if you want the

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.320
audio to be just the song.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.700
Or you can also put in something
in the middle so you

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.750
get whatever the noise or your
voice is in the video, but

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.500
also the music--

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.620
mix it up for you.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.580
We're looking forward to also
creating better tools.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.900
We have a full road
map of awesome

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.270
tools for video editing.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.102
Video editing is one of the--

00:11:46.102 --> 00:11:47.215
it's a hard task, right?

00:11:47.215 --> 00:11:49.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.530
EVELIO TARAZONA: I found myself,
many times, really,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.860
really frustrated with
editing tools.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.280
So we are trying to offer you
a mobile app, solutions, and

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.090
tools so you can easily
create really,

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.911
really beautiful videos.

00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:08.330
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, we
spend quite a few hours

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.658
editing these types of
videos sometimes.

00:12:10.658 --> 00:12:11.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:11.942 --> 00:12:12.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.490
I know Jeremy had a bunch of
questions about how you guys

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.790
implemented the application.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.100
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.980
So I usually like to get into
the technical section.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.420
And I wanted to talk to
you a little about--

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.130
well, actually, let's
just get started.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.870
How did you implement Telly
with the YouTube APIs?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.480
ADIL LALANI: Sure.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.850
So for every video that's being
shared in your social

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.240
graph, Telly is sucking it in.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.740
So we are pulling in all the
videos that your friends are

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.040
sharing, pretty much.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.780
And when we pull in a video,
we are making a call to

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.710
YouTube's API--

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.380
if it's a YouTube video--

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.330
to really get some metadata
around the video, to

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.600
understand if it's playable
on mobile or not, if it's

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.450
embeddable or not.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.850
What are the tags behind the
video so we can properly

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.560
understand it.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.040
And that's important to us,
because we want to serve you

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.690
the right video for the
right situation.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.540
So for example, if you're on
your mobile phone, we'll serve

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.230
you only YouTube videos that
are playable on mobile.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.050
We'll hide all the ones that
can't play on mobile.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.310
Whereas if you're on your
laptop, we'll show you only

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.410
the videos that are embeddable
by YouTube.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.280
So that's one area that we
really used the YouTube API.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.960
The second area is in
the player itself--

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.720
our player integration, and
especially with the Android

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.111
device, using the YouTube SDK.

00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:39.160
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.050
What do you guys use on the
back end, language-wise?

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.830
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.673
It's a combination of
node.js and PHP.

00:13:46.673 --> 00:13:47.380
JEREMY WALKER: Oh, OK.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:47.930
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:48.810
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:54.310
So it sounds like you're using
the data API, the iFrame embed

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.240
player API, and then the
Android player API.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.760
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.440
JEREMY WALKER: Have you guys
tried out the new version

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.120
three of the data API yet?

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.990
ADIL LALANI: Yeah.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.080
We actually had a cool
experience with it.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.110
I can share a little story.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.610
So we had about five million
plus videos that we had to get

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.330
the latest metadata for.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:22.110
And making five million
calls to YouTube's

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.120
V3 API in one day--

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.480
well, basically, it yield
rate limited us.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.020
So what we ended up doing
was we set up a cluster

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.310
of servers on EC2--

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.830
probably hundreds of servers.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.850
And they were all making calls
to YouTube's API just so that

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.140
we can get around the rate limit
and get the information

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.080
in one day.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.450
So we did a little bit of
hacking to play around and

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.340
pull in some data.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.840
JEREMY WALKER: OK, cool.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.865
Is there anything that surprised
you about working

00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:55.940
with the APIs?

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.690
Do you guys--

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.990
EVELIO TARAZONA: Well, in the
Android side, we had this

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.530
interesting issue in the early
stages with the library.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.430
We had seen some black
rectangles around.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.290
I think it was because we were
using a surface view then.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.710
We changed for new APIs, like
surface texture view.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.885
And we eliminated those
black rectangles.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.230
It was much fun, because if
you're taking a screen shot,

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.670
otherwise you don't
get anything.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.360
You get just the regular
screen shot.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.130
But it's on the display,
and so you now have

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.070
a clue about it.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.080
And hopefully, you
guys managed to

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.070
resolve these issues.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.230
I think for the first release,
we don't have that support.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.060
This is something that is being
considered precisely for

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.960
this type of case.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.940
EVELIO TARAZONA: Yeah, because
in our initial field, we were

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.440
trying to bring the inline
playback you get in the web.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.690
You can scroll, and you have
the video playing on it.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.420
But we run into some
issues with the

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.170
2.x version of Android.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.910
So with 4--

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.110
Ice Cream Sandwich and up is a
better experience in this way.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.550
We will try to bring it back.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.920
Right now, we use, as
I just see in the

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.490
screen shots, we use--

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.320
a view itself that is fixed.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.570
So hopefully, someday, we can
bring the cool experience,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.370
with, hopefully,
CoverFlow too--

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.210
with carousel on it.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.700
So we are looking
forward to that.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.040
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.590
Well, do you have anything on
your wish list that you'd like

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.900
to have in the API?

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.160
ADIL LALANI: Yeah, actually,
two big things on my wish

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.470
list, at least.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.650
I'm sure they have some, too.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:45.280
One is a YouTube player SDK for
iPhone, just like you did

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.990
for Android.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:54.240
And the second one is if YouTube
could ping us when a

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.350
video has changed state, almost,
because some videos

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.040
get taken down for copyright
infringement.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.720
Some videos, one day they're
mobile friendly, the next day

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.050
they're not.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.980
So we always have to
find out by asking

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.869
YouTube API all the time.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:18.619
If YouTube's API can just ping
us, that would be, I think, a

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.102
cleaner solution.

00:17:20.102 --> 00:17:21.339
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, we were
just talking about that

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.875
yesterday with Jeremy.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.665
ADIL LALANI: OK.

00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:25.109
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
actually, obviously, both

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:25.894
issues come up.

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:31.440
I would say the fire hose type
of approach is something that

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.930
we've been hearing about
from developers

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.760
for quite some time.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.380
Great.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.810
All right.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.050
So should we look into our
moderator to see what

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:42.900
questions we got?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.320
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:43.580
Sure.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.930
So it looks like we
have a couple.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.660
So actually, this is about
the Telly mobile app.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.450
And they want to know if you can
fling it to Google TV, if

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.090
that's coming anytime soon.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.390
EVELIO TARAZONA: We are
definitely looking forward to

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.250
working on Google TV.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.940
We've seen there is a big place
for us to offer, like

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.520
discover on your TV.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.930
And especially, Google TV is a
good opportunity to get into.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.690
So far, not actually
inconveniences

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.130
are preventing this.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.660
But right now, we are
moving first from

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.920
smartphones to tablets.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.520
Once we have support for
tablets, it's going to be much

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.000
easier to support Google TV.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.870
But we definitely want to
support Google TV, because

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.850
it's an amazing experience
you get in YouTube.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: For those of
you watching, actually, we

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.400
have recently launched the
YouTube Android player API on

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.490
Google TV, as well.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.960
So in December, we had the
mobile experience.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.380
And then just a couple of weeks
ago, we launched Google

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.090
TV support.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.150
So if you're building a Google
TV application, let us know,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.220
because we're looking for a
couple of them to feature.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.370
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
definitely.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.290
And then, of course, is YouTube

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.560
developer relations hiring?

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is that
question addressed to me?

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.320
JEREMY WALKER: It is.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:58.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think so.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.910
So yes, we are hiring.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.990
In fact, if you would like
to learn more, go to

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.990
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.010
And you'll see our job
descriptions on the positions

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.780
that are open.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.710
And the larger Google Developer
Relations team is

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.676
also hiring.

00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:15.170
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.260
Well, that's all we have.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.550
Well, thank you very much for
your time and driving down

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.360
here from the beautiful
city of San Francisco.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.310
It was really fun hosting you.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.740
And thank you for giving
us all the great

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.900
feedback about the APIs.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.180
ADIL LALANI: Great.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.420
Thank you.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.220
EVELIO TARAZONA: Thank you
very much for having us.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.630
And for those of you watching,
we'll see you again next week,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.950
Wednesday, 10:00 AM, Pacific.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.200
Bye.
