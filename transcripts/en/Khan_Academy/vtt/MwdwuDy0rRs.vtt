00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.270
Problem 15.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.270
A restaurant is advertising
3-item combination specials

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.490
that must include a main dish,
a vegetable, and a drink.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.440
OK, so you have to have
at least one of these.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.100
So what are they going
to ask us?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.010
How many 3-item combinations
include a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.675
soft drink and a corn?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.150
So let's reread what
the conditions are.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.370
A restaurant is advertising
3-item combination specials

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.350
that must include a main dish,
a vegetable, and a drink.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.190
So you pick one from each
of these buckets.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.066
So they're already picking two
of the buckets for us.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:50.860
It includes a soft drink, and
it has to include a corn.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.610
So they've essentially already
picked our choices from this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.040
bucket and that bucket
right there.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.420
And they're saying, how many
combinations are left?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.430
Well, we only have
two choices.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.990
We only have freedom
when it comes to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.920
picking the main dish.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.760
Because the problem has already
picked for us our

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.090
vegetable and our drink, the
corn and the soft drink.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.060
And so there's only two possible
main dishes, so those

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.880
are the 3-item combinations
that include a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.230
soft drink and a corn.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.240
There's two possible ones,
chicken and beef.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.470
So it's two.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.880
Just to make sure you understand
that, what are the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.260
two combinations, just
to make it explicit?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.720
Well, one combination is
chicken, corn, and soft drink.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.980
Right?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.440
They're forcing the corn and
the soft drink on us.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.880
And then the other combination
is beef, corn, and soft drink.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.930
That's the second combination,
because they're forcing the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.300
corn and the soft drink on us.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.150
So there's two combinations.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.480
But the way I just thought about
that is this thing has

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.800
been constrained for us, the
vegetable and the drink, so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.780
you can ignore it.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.060
And so how many combinations
of main dishes are there?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.640
Well, there's two.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.530
I just counted them.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.300
Chicken and beef.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.270
Problem 16.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.290
Donald priced six personal
Compact Disc players.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.990
And they wrote the
CD right there.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.970
The prices are shown below.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.450
OK, so these are
six CD players.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080
What is the median price?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.710
So the trick of this
problem is just

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.350
knowing what median means.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.980
Median literally means
the middle price.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.190
So if I were to put all of these
numbers in order, which

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.720
I'm going to do right now, the
median is going to be the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.450
middle number.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.260
So let's put them in order.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.100
What's the smallest
number here?

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.770
21.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.130
Cross that out.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.760
And then we have another 21.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.820
So let me write that down.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.300
I'll cross that out, make
sure I know I used it.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.150
The next largest number is 23.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.100
So let me cross that out.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.370
The next largest number is 25.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.930
Cross that out.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.640
Next largest number is 31.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.910
Cross that out.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.380
And then the next
number is 39.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.910
So what is the middle
number here?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.400
Well, you see we have six
numbers, and, actually, there

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.540
is no middle number.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.780
If we have an even number of
numbers, there's no single

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.490
middle number.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.970
There's two numbers
that we can kind

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.900
of view as the middle.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.610
These two numbers here
are the middle.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.900
Right?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.360
I can't say 23 by itself is the
middle, because there's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.670
two above it and
three below it.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.430
And I can't say 25 is the
middle, because there's two

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.130
below it and three above it.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.050
So when you have an even number
of, I guess, data, like

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.220
you have right here, you
pick the middle two.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.210
If I had the numbers 1,
2, and 3, then I could

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.780
just pick the 2.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.950
But if I have 1, 2, 3,
and 4, I have to pick

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.650
the middle two numbers.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.350
So here I pick the middle two
numbers, and I need a median.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.070
And so what I do is I average
these middle two numbers.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.360
I take the mean, or I go
right in between them.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.520
So what's exactly in
between 23 and 25?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.390
Well, you can do that
in your head.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.460
It's going to be 24.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.670
But if you can't do it in your
head, you literally would just

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.750
add those two numbers, 23 plus
25, and then divide by 2.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.920
So this is going to be
equal to 48 divided

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.690
by 2, which is $24.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.760
And I just explained that to
you, and just in case you got

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.740
the situation where these are
some weird decimal numbers, or

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.310
these were much larger numbers,
where you couldn't

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.700
just say, hey, 24 is right
in between those

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.170
two guys right there.
