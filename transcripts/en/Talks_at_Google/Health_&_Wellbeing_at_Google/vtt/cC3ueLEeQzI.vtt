[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.220
DANIELLE BROWN: Super glad
to have Giselle Carino here

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.900
with us today.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.080
Giselle as the CEO of
the International Planned

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.040
Parenthood Federation in the
Western Hemisphere region.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.810
And today, we really
are going to have

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.150
a conversation about the
state of women's health

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.610
and the state of women's
rights in the region

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.530
and how the International
Planned Parenthood

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.740
Federation is
navigating the region's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.570
rapidly-changing
political, economic,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.230
and environmental landscape.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.960
I am delighted to have a
woman leader here today

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.760
to talk about this important
issue, so welcome, Giselle.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.380
GISELLE CARINO:
Thank you so much.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.100
Thank you for such
a kind introduction.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.550
Thank you all for joining
this conversation.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750
Thank you both John and
Louise for making this happen.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.250
It's a great
opportunity to be here.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.150
Coffee is great.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.297
I look forward to
next opportunity.

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:57.130
Thank you very much.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.900
DANIELLE BROWN: Good.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.310
Well, Giselle, I always like
to start these conversations

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.520
with a personal story.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.870
So can you tell us a little bit
about how you got interested

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.039
in this work and sort of how
you got to where you are today?

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.330
GISELLE CARINO: Well, you
know, I grew up in Argentina,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.600
in rural Argentina.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.940
And when I say
rural, I mean rural.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.490
I remember receiving the
Sunday paper at 4:00 PM.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.300
That's rural.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.940
And I went to an
all-girls Catholic school.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.690
And this is not at all
a comment on faith.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.882
As you just mentioned, we work
with progressive religious

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:34.840
leaders, and I'm part of
the board of Catholics

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
for the Right to Decide.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.637
But I remember we used to be
girls playing one side and boys

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:41.720
playing on the other side.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.350
And I remember always asking
the question, why is this?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.890
I have brothers and cousins,
and we used to play together

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.502
and things were different there.

00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:51.710
And I remember the answers
were not quite satisfying.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.647
And then, as I
grew up, my parents

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.980
would say like, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.680
And across the street, there was
a farming school full of boys,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.020
and I thought that
was really cool.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.604
They used to be
outdoors all the time.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.020
And I said, I want
to be a farmer.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.280
I want to that school.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.440
And they would like,
hmm, not really.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.520
That's for boys.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160
And I was like, why is that?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.012
And again, not a very
satisfying answer to that.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.720
And then, I think all
of it came together

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.830
when I was in secondary school
and one of my best friends

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.760
got pregnant.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.620
And she wasn't rejected
from our school,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.010
but she couldn't be
part of us anymore.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.560
The social stigma associated
with teen pregnancy is huge,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.820
continues to be huge.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.060
And so I think all
of it came together,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.960
and it was clear that it
could have been any of us.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.940
That we needed the
information to be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.649
able to protect ourselves,
to live healthy lives.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.690
And that it wasn't there.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.270
That wasn't available to us.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.450
I also grew up you know during
the dictatorship in Argentina.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.630
I was born in 1976 in June.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.660
Now you know my age.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.480
And the dictatorship began
in March of that year.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.970
So I remember that
crushing sense

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.080
that things would never change.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.820
And then, when democracy
came, that feeling of it

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.340
was in our hands to make that
happen and to protect it.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.394
So I think all of it
had to do with ending up

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:24.560
in Planned Parenthood doing
work for women's rights.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.570
I truly believe that there isn't
the possibility of development

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.946
without half of the
population being included.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.870
And sexual and public
health and rights are key.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.430
Deciding if we want
to have children,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.310
when we want to have
children, with whom

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.080
is critical to us being fully
participants in society.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.544
So all came together there.

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:47.710
DANIELLE BROWN: I love that.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.092
Well, thank you for sharing
your personal story with us.

00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:52.300
And I always appreciate that
because it sort of gives

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.520
a sense for how you got
to where you are today,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.290
which I think a lot of people
always want to know about.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.800
Tell us a little bit about sort
of the wide range of services

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.780
that Planned
Parenthood does provide

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.957
and sort of what the population
you serve looks like.

00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:08.790
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.720
Well, we last year alone
served about six million women

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660
in Latin America
and the Caribbean

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.920
and provided roughly
30 million services

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.540
from pap screening,
cervical cancer screening,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.290
sex education, gender-based
violence services,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.710
access to contraception,
and safe and legal abortion

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.164
when that is allowed
by the local laws.

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:33.580
One thing that I
should mention is

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.460
that we are a global
federation, so we

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.856
have a presence in about 150
countries around the world.

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:42.730
We represent Latin
America and the Caribbean.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.510
We work with 40
independent organizations,

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.239
not-for-profit organizations
that are affiliated to us.

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.780
I don't know.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.740
How many of you do know
of Planned Parenthood

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.160
Federation of America?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.420
Many of you know, right?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.310
Yes, they're our great
partner in the US.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.114
How many of you do know of
IPPF, or International Planned

00:05:03.114 --> 00:05:04.030
Parenthood Federation?

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.670
Probably not too many.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.620
It's OK.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.440
Planned Parenthood
Federation of America

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.910
is our partner in
the US, and like

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.630
that we have partners
in 150 countries

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.630
globally or so, many
of them providing

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.090
full care, comprehensive
sexual and reproductive health

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.910
services for women and men.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.190
About 10% of our
services are to men.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.540
And we have a big
focus on youth.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.050
Across the world
and in particularly

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.370
in Latin America and
the Caribbean, about 40%

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.577
of our services go
to young people.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:40.410
DANIELLE BROWN: And in
a lot of those cases,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.630
are you providing free
or low-cost health

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.247
care to the patients
that come in your door?

00:05:45.247 --> 00:05:46.080
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.320
We not only have clinics
in many of the countries.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.450
There is a game I like
to play when I go.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.732
I spend much of my time
visiting clinics and programs

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:56.190
in Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.100
And when the taxi driver
picks me up from the airport,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.130
I always ask, so do you
know our local clinics?

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.040
Have you been there?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.090
Have your friends went there?

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.980
And the answer to those
questions normally is yes.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.870
They know our clinics because
we've been providing services

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.540
now for 50 years in the region.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.980
But we not only provide the
services in the clinics.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.450
We also run community-based
programs down in communities

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.110
where other people will then go.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.310
And all of those areas are
subsidized, and many of them

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.660
are free of cost indeed.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.100
DANIELLE BROWN: So probably
for a lot of these women,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.060
especially in rural communities,
that Planned Parenthood clinic

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.581
might be the only clinic that
is affordable and accessible

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:40.080
for them.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.840
Is that right?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.131
GISELLE CARINO: Indeed, indeed.

00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:42.740
Yes.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.573
DANIELLE BROWN: So you
have the organization

00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:46.650
for over a decade, which
is quite impressive.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.000
Can you share what's changed
in that time over your service

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.070
with the International
Planned Parenthood Federation?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.670
GISELLE CARINO: Well, you
know, it's interesting.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.230
I am a first-time CEO and
transitioned to become the CEO

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.060
last year--

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.950
arguably, not the best year
to transition to anything

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.230
called Planned Parenthood.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.220
It's a year full of challenges.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.810
And I think my work before
was programmatic work.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.060
I spent time with women
and the communities.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.340
And I think I saw a
great change in them.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.522
So we have been able to lift
many people out of poverty

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:25.980
in Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.220
We still remain as one of
the most unequal regions

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.910
in the world.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.330
That means that
if you are young,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.400
if you are poor, if you are
from an indigenous community,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.190
if you are Afro-descendant, the
way you experience life, health

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.370
services, your
needs are different.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.860
Most of our countries are
considered now middle-income

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.510
countries, and this means
that donors have pulled out

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.770
from the region.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.670
But huge pockets of poverty
and inequality remain.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.720
And the people we
serve are these people.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.210
So we need to continue
investing in these program

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.820
and in these services.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.270
I think we know that we
have done great advances.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.770
We have been there for 60 years.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.560
We have brought contraception
to many of these countries.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.590
Emergency contraception, what is
called the morning after pill,

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.540
it should be called the as soon
as possible because usually you

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.930
can use it up to five days
after having unprotected sex.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.510
But the sooner you
use it, the better.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.700
We brought that many
of the countries

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.820
in which we are working.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:36.000
So we have made great strides
in bringing contraception

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.400
to women, but we know that
we have 23 million women who

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.409
want access to
modern contraception

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.180
and don't have it.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.250
So I think there have been
great advances in general,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.390
but there are huge
challenges that remain.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.739
And we have to continue
working to close that gap.

00:08:53.739 --> 00:08:54.780
DANIELLE BROWN: For sure.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.900
In Silicon Valley here, we're
technologists by and large.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.020
So we always think about the
role of technology in our work.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.180
So has technology played a role
in the work of International

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.707
Planned Parenthood Federation?

00:09:05.707 --> 00:09:06.540
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.400
I think we have made important
investments in technology.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.900
It might seem small
to you, but we

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.720
invested in making sure that
we have electronic health

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.430
records across the world so
that we can not only serve women

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.550
better but also assess the
health outcomes over time.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.011
And that's an investment we
have done over a number of years

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:27.510
now.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.000
We think there are
great opportunities

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.620
for technological innovations.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.200
We're a region with
high connectivity,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.640
and we have in front of
us the largest generation

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.830
of young people ever.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.660
Reaching them is a
huge opportunity.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.910
It's a huge challenge as well.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.610
And I suspect that
Google will know

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.740
how to help us close
that gap because I think

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.540
probably technology
has a key role

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.800
to play in reaching these
people with both information,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.150
education, and actual services.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.340
Unfortunately,
telemedicine, all of that

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.010
is not as developed as
it is here, but we do

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.630
follow very closely and love
to try a few innovations

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.410
that we know are happening in
the United States right now

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.070
and that hold great
potential to bring services

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.294
to women in a much more
cost-effective way.

00:10:24.294 --> 00:10:26.210
DANIELLE BROWN: That's
a fantastic opportunity

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.330
for all of us here to think
about and be involved with,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.590
for sure.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.520
So we do have a powerful
female CEO here in our midst,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.060
and I always like to ask
you a little bit about what

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.000
that year has been like and what
are some of the key leadership

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.310
challenges you faced
and the lessons you've

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.100
learned in that year.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.430
GISELLE CARINO: Well, it
was clearly a tough year.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:55.850
Not only we had a new US
administration not quite

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.720
favorable to our
issues, and everything

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.615
that happens in the US
has an impact overseas.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.280
The US used to have a
leadership role on these issues.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.390
That's no longer the case.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.370
And President Trump
imposed as soon

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.085
as he took office
the global gag rule.

00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:16.460
DANIELLE BROWN:
Talk a little bit

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.710
about that because I'm not
sure everybody's familiar.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.850
GISELLE CARINO: Yeah.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:26.570
Every Republican president since
Reagan put in place something

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.280
called the global
gag rule, which

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.930
limits the ability of
organizations overseas

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:37.160
that receive US funding to
either advocate for changing

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.890
the laws and policies in
relationship to abortion,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.370
to provide abortion services
with their own resources

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.030
even if abortion is
legal in that country.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.630
And the money normally
from the US government

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.410
was for work like access to
contraception, gender-based

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.820
violence.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:01.010
What Trump did was impose a
rule of really unprecedented

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.340
proportions touching
every source of funding

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.210
from the US government,
including tuberculosis,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.660
malaria, HIV/AIDS.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.030
So normally, about $600 million
of US foreign assistance money

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.140
would be gagged as we call it.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.490
In this case, it's
about $8.8 billion.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.670
So this is a policy
that has the potential

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.610
to really do serious damage
to women around the world.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.790
We as an organization
decided not

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.660
to be gagged by this policy.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:49.116
We will give up about
$100 million as a whole.

00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:54.620
And we think this rule is unfair
and unjust and harms women

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.440
and really has the potential of
harming women across the globe.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.400
So that was a big challenge we
faced as soon as I took office

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.860
in, I think, April last year.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.700
We had Brexit in July, and we
had the elections in November.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.080
And this happened
right after in January.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.090
So I think that that was one
of the biggest challenges.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.040
The second one, you
might have heard

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.010
we have had a string of
natural disasters affecting

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.970
in the region over
the past few months--

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:31.520
again, disasters of
unprecedented proportions.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.230
Our clinics have been
badly affected, our teams.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.915
But it's really amazing to see.

00:13:38.915 --> 00:13:40.790
We had the earthquake in Mexico.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.100
The day after, our teams, people
in our office lost their homes.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.250
They show up to work to
provide care for women--

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.490
not in the clinics because
the clinics were damaged--

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.390
in the streets.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:53.810
DANIELLE BROWN: Wow.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.280
GISELLE CARINO: Whatever
that was possible,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.946
they were there to
help women because we

00:13:56.946 --> 00:14:01.040
know that one of the
things that happens when

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.450
natural disasters affect is that
the needs of women and girls

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.980
are normally not the priority.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.420
But life goes on.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.150
People continue to
need contraception.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.433
People continue to
need prenatal care.

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:20.180
And I think it has been amazing
to see the level of response

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.460
in spite of such a
difficult situation.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.990
And maybe, if I am
allowed a second

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.560
to talk about Puerto Rico.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.060
DANIELLE BROWN: Yes, please.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.040
GISELLE CARINO:
Puerto Rico is a case

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.450
that hurts me because the
situation of the island

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.780
was dire before
the hurricanes hit.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.220
And 50% of the population
living below the poverty

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.840
line, many of them women, and
then we have the hurricanes.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.700
And as you know, the response
from the federal government

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.590
has been limited, unsatisfying.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:03.830
I don't know what objective
to use to define it.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.950
We have four clinics
in the island none

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.474
of which are up and running.

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:09.390
DANIELLE BROWN: Still?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.520
GISELLE CARINO: Still because
we don't have electricity.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.970
We raise funding to buy
generators, which is the way.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.190
And it takes a
while for generators

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.930
to get there because
obviously everyone

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.420
is trying to buy generators.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.610
And you can't keep them
running all the time,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.230
so we have some limitations.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:35.300
Gas is a problem,
accessing gas to run them.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.660
And we know the need is there.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.230
We have the infrastructure
to serve women.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.530
We need help to get those
clinics back in order

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.890
and to provide the services
that are very much needed

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.870
because no one else
will be doing that.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.160
So it's I guess a plea of
help for the case of Puerto

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.120
Rico in which the response
has been with contempt

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.165
and is very much in need.

00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:03.290
DANIELLE BROWN: I think
that's a really good point.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.150
And as you point
out, it really has

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.580
been such a challenging year--

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.600
from policy and politics
and natural disasters.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.510
And I can tell that this
work is very personal,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.860
and it's very emotional.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.800
And I really do applaud your
bravery and your courage

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.310
and your leadership.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.840
How do you sort of keep your
staff and your caregivers

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.650
and your providers
sort of motivated

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.330
to do this work in the long run?

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.280
Because it can be
very challenging

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.740
and emotional and taxing.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.770
GISELLE CARINO: We hold
tight to the good things.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.950
These people are fighters.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.790
They've been fighting
in the front lines.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.400
These challenges
are not new to us.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.030
Are bigger, that's right.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:49.310
It's always difficult.
But our teams are there

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.510
serving the needs of women.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.670
There is nothing
more satisfying--

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.910
there is nothing more satisfying
to me and too many of them--

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.140
than when you sit with
women in the waiting rooms

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.710
and when I travel
and get to talk

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.480
to women, the number
of barriers they

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.960
had to overcome to
be there and you have

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.670
the answer to what they need.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.589
There is nothing more
satisfying than being

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.609
able to provide that.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:15.109
And I think that holding tight
to that is what keeps us going.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.030
And the support
of so many of you.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.359
We couldn't do this work
without supporters like you

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.480
who are there to hold
the line and support

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.230
us every step of the way.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.030
So thank you.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.504
Thank you very much.

00:17:28.504 --> 00:17:30.170
DANIELLE BROWN: Thank
you, and thank you

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.560
for motivating your team
of caregivers and providers

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.460
to do this work.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.140
It's really quite incredible.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.360
You talked a little bit
about how often times

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.390
when a young woman
gets to your clinic

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.340
they've overcome a
lot of barriers just

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.700
to get there and be present
that day for their services.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.950
Can you talk a little bit
about some of those barriers

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.917
these women face?

00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:50.750
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.320
And we work to help
them overcome them.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.940
I'll talk a little bit
about our cervical cancer

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.230
work, which I think is a
good indication of that.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.720
Cervical cancer
is still a killer

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.730
for women in Latin
America and the Caribbean

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.240
and across the globe.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.070
And it's caused by a virus
called the HPV virus.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.860
There are many
strains of the virus,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.212
but two that really
cause cervical cancer.

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:17.420
And there is a vaccine that
is available in developed

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.540
countries.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.290
So we partner with
the Ministry of Health

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.480
in Bolivia and our
member association

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.840
there to bring their
vaccine to Latin

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.110
America and the Caribbean.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.570
And it was quite
pricey at the moment.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.390
And normally here, women--

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.430
girls, the vaccination
ranges between I

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.035
think nine and 12 years of age--

00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:42.140
to the pediatrician.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.030
The pediatrician would
offer the vaccine.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.970
The vaccine has three doses,
so you have to go three times

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.850
a year with your
girl for the vaccine.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.840
So when we began looking at this
program, and many of the women

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.480
we serve work in the fields,
selling food in the market.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.020
They can't just take
the day off to do this.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.900
They might not have enough money
to feed their family that week

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.730
if they do so.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.560
So we developed this initiative
and applied the vaccines

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.360
in a pilot program
in the schools

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.060
because we know a high
proportion of the girls

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.060
are in school.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.080
They don't need
their mothers there.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.530
And we have very successful
rates of vaccination,

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.640
higher than any other
vaccination program

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.500
in this pilot initiative.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.130
So we tried to bridge
the gap because when

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.320
you work in
low-resource settings

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.770
we have to be creative and
disruptive in the way we

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.730
think through programming.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.060
So that has been, I
think, a very good example

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.990
of trying to find
people where they are

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.530
and help them overcome the
challenges that they wouldn't

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.610
have otherwise.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.240
DANIELLE BROWN:
That's fantastic.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.330
I want to talk a little
bit about a real issue

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.550
and a real crisis in
our society, which is

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.520
the issue of sexual assaults.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.880
We've seen movements
like metoo start spilling

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.950
out to other countries,
and we've definitely

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.200
been hearing just more and
more about the prevalence

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.800
of sexual assault sort of
to women around the world.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.400
How are you sort of
thinking about that work

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.100
and thinking about
educating girls and women

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.760
about sexual assault, sexual
violence, sexual harassment,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.140
and the impact of
those things to them?

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.140
GISELLE CARINO: You know,
I come from our region

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.390
in which one in three women
has suffered violence.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.720
I think of the 25 countries
with highest homicide rates--

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.110
feminicide we call
them, against women--

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.865
14 are in Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.340
I follow very closely metoo.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.940
I think it's great.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.370
There's it's a lot in
women's storytelling, women

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.660
coming forward and
telling their stories.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.160
I think it was very interesting
to see how that had a trickle

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.854
effect in about 12 countries.

00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:03.020
You have to love the French.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.420
They call it out the pig
or something like that.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.560
I mean, just fabulous.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.510
Very quickly, even in
Argentina a few days

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.120
after the Weinstein
case in the US,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.040
we had a case for a
journalist as well.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.890
I think there is a lot of power
in people telling their story

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.710
and coming forward.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.950
This is not just
about solidarity.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.870
It's about self-exposure.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.050
And we know, those of us
who have worked in violence,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.140
we know that for every woman
that comes forward there are

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.660
at least 10 that haven't.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:43.050
And there a pervasive
element in our society.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.300
Also, in Argentina, we are
home of a movement called

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.470
Ni Una Menos, Not One Less.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.350
This movement kind of
happened organically

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:58.500
as a result of a number of super
high-profile cases of homicides

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.910
against women mostly
by their partners.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.520
And we are 40 million,
and they mobilized

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.580
about a million people
in the first time

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.860
that they got together.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.350
Last year, they mobilized
three million people.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.260
And you could argue
Argentineans like to march,

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.940
but I think it was
incredible the mobilization,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.170
the digital mobilization.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.760
Many people show up at work
dressed in black to mourn,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.860
to show their solidarity.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.210
And I think that's amazing.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.677
I think as a movement,
I like to think we

00:22:32.677 --> 00:22:35.130
are reaching a tipping point.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.760
We no longer have to accept
this as part of our life.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.720
And I think there is a lot
of transformation going on.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.220
And if there is something to
have faith, confidence on,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.140
it's in the ability
of civil society,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.170
of all of us, keeping
this conversation going.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.980
Because loss and
policies will follow,

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.590
but we first need to understand
that this is simply not

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.880
acceptable.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.770
We don't have to put
up with this anymore,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.630
and that's the
conversation that I

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.630
saw going on that
gets me very excited

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.636
because I think this is
the beginning of the end.

00:23:09.636 --> 00:23:11.520
DANIELLE BROWN: Which
is a terrific sort

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.220
of optimistic view, and I
really thank you for that.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.590
You know, you said something
that really struck me.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.810
You said for every one
woman that comes forward

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.200
and reports a sexual
assault or sexual violence,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.320
there is probably 10 more
that haven't reported.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.270
How can technology or how can
our work help more women sort

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.930
of be able to come forward
and get the help they

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.222
need and the support they need?

00:23:35.222 --> 00:23:36.096
GISELLE CARINO: Yeah.

00:23:36.096 --> 00:23:37.770
I think it's what we are seeing.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.000
We have been one of the first
institutions that created

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.180
a health response to violence.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.490
And I think with technology
so much more can be done.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:52.080
I think, as I said, it's
very powerful for women

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.370
to come forward.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.570
And they have done so.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.429
And up here, this is the
conversation happening,

00:23:58.429 --> 00:23:59.470
the regular conversation.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.990
Everybody is talking about this.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.320
And I think technology is
obviously a big part of that.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.450
It couldn't have
happened before.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.305
This is not, I support x.

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:09.397
This is, metoo.

00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:10.230
DANIELLE BROWN: Yes.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.130
GISELLE CARINO: I am
very much part of this,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.570
and I think it was possible
because of the connectivity

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.305
and the platforms we have to
be able to express ourself.

00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:19.680
And I think that's
a great thing.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.060
That's a great thing.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.230
DANIELLE BROWN: For sure.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.720
Tell us a little bit about
how International Planned

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.350
Parenthood Federation is
approaching HIV and AIDS--

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.210
the treatment, the
care, the awareness--

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.700
in the region as well.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.990
GISELLE CARINO: Yeah.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.430
Sexual rights and the
work around HIV/AIDS

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.550
have been central to our work.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.200
We integrated HIV detection
services across our region

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.120
in Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.950
I have gone to the
communities, worked

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.280
with the specific populations
where the virus tends to be

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.930
concentrated in the region.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.330
It has been a critical
piece of our work.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.200
Luckily, there has
been a lot of progress

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.860
in the region on that issue, and
some of our member associations

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.460
even provide treatment--

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.410
one of them, Dominican
Republic, for instance.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.550
So we have been fully involved
over the past 10 years

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.110
in integrated service
delivery on HIV

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.910
and feel very proud of the
accomplishments in that area.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.350
DANIELLE BROWN:
That's wonderful.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.630
I want to turn a little
bit to some of the laws

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.320
and policy in the region.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.800
So certainly, even
in the States,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.750
we're seeing laws
and restrictions

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.870
being passed that make
it harder to have access

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.850
to safe and legal abortion.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.700
Are you seeing that as
well in Latin America

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.450
and the Caribbean?

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.241
GISELLE CARINO: Thank
you for that question

00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:40.590
because, when I talked
earlier about service delivery

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.430
and education, I forgot
to mention that we really

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.470
work around laws and policies
that inhibit access for women's

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.270
exercise of their rights.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.420
We work at the local,
at the regional,

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.670
and we also head
the work at the UN

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.830
on behalf of IPPF
as a whole globally.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.150
What we are seeing
in Latin America,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.750
we have a lot of
laws and policies.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.560
The issue, the
hardest nut to crack,

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.210
is in the implementation
aspects of things

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.220
and making sure that
the money exists

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.845
to support service delivery.

00:26:17.845 --> 00:26:21.550
We are still home to
four countries who

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.300
have a total ban on abortion.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.420
And for those of you who
might not know what that is,

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.780
it's that you can't
access abortion services

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:36.210
in any circumstances, not even
to preserve your own life.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.490
So it's a big challenge we have.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.160
I remember the case
of [? Eperanza. ?]

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.770
She was a 16-year-old from
the Dominican Republic

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:49.110
who was pregnant and had cancer,
and her treatment for cancer

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.610
was denied because
of her pregnancy.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.800
It would put a risk
to her pregnancy.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.070
And in the Dominican Republic,
along with El Salvador,

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.830
Nicaragua, and Honduras,
there are no exceptions.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.930
So she died.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.520
She paid with her life.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.990
The Congress is
still debating a bill

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:16.140
to open some legal exceptions,
but there is much work

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.900
to be done in that regard.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.570
We have a number
of countries that

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.900
have legal exceptions
on the books,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:30.060
but those have not materialized
in the life of women.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:35.150
They might exist on paper, but
the implementation of those

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.530
is oftentimes limited.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.610
And oftentimes, we are one of
the providers in those places

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.120
in which a legal exception
exists for abortion care,

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.240
for legal abortion
care for women.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.756
We just had a big window.

00:27:51.756 --> 00:27:54.510
There was a total ban
on abortion in Chile,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:28:00.000
and we just, I want
to say two months ago,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.060
were able to pass
a legislation that

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.940
allows for three
legal exceptions--

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.440
to preserve the
life of the woman,

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.280
for cases of rape
and incest, and cases

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.690
of fetal malformations
incompatible with life.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.920
And the law is limited in scope.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.630
It's only three circumstances.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:30.160
It was a legacy from the
Pinochet dictatorship.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.150
But it's a big step
forward for Chilean women

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.390
to be able to access
in these circumstances.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.660
And we still have
four more countries

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.780
to be able to overturn
the total bans.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.600
We have the case--

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.342
I don't know if you have
heard or follow the news-- we

00:28:46.342 --> 00:28:47.550
have the case of El Salvador.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.750
Women in El Salvador
go to jail, if they

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.010
are suspected of having had
a miscarriage, for 30 years.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.070
So these are really
are draconian laws that

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.435
need to change.

00:29:02.435 --> 00:29:06.125
And they need to be
changed definitely.

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:08.250
DANIELLE BROWN: And so I
imagine a lot of your work

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.710
as the CEO of the International
Planned Parenthood

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.210
Federation in the
Western Hemisphere

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.240
is working with policy
makers, influencing,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.950
lobbying for change.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.740
How are you finding
the receptivity

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.600
to these issues and
their willingness

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.250
to understand the issues,
learn and adapt, change?

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.560
GISELLE CARINO: We have, I
think, great partnerships

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.590
with the governments.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.850
We have local organizations
that are leading

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.870
the work on the ground just
PPFA is leading the work here

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.640
in the US.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.410
That helps because
the organizations

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.570
have been there for 60 years.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.280
They have a reputation.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.330
They know what we do.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.990
Having said that,
these issues are hard.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.670
And as I said, it's not
only just changing the laws.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.040
Once the laws change,
the real fight begins.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.370
And the fight is making
sure that those services

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.080
are available to women.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.290
So we also act as watchdogs
for the government

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.680
to make sure that the
laws are implemented

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.130
and quite importantly
that there is funding

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.900
to support the provision
of those services

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.300
in the national budgets.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.760
Because, at the
end, we are there

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.460
to support as long,
as much as we can.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.510
But this needs to be part
of the country program.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.900
And that's easier
said than done.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.280
When it comes to
the reality, we have

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.200
laws that have been on the
books for 100 years now.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.910
Implementation is slow.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.202
It's a hard fight, but I
think one worth fighting.

00:30:43.202 --> 00:30:44.410
DANIELLE BROWN: Very much so.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.600
I think you said something
that probably-- it's definitely

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.670
surprised me and maybe
some of our audience, too--

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.670
is that there's a big
difference between getting

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.500
a law passed and the practical
implementation of it.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.970
And I think sometimes
as activists

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.150
we think our work is done
when the law is passed.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.430
So the laws is passed, and
change magically happens.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.140
And I think you're
saying, hey, there's

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.000
actually a long
road between a law

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.450
on the books and practical
implementation on the ground.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.150
Are there steps that can
be taken to sort of shorten

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.410
that gap between passing a law
and practically implementing it

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.557
for the folks you serve?

00:31:15.557 --> 00:31:16.390
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:22.660
We think in our experience
working with health care teams

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.000
in building the
support for the new law

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.800
is critical because you've
got to have providers who

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.050
are ready to provide services.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:34.810
Not only ready, ideologically
ready, technically.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.410
So I think we have learned
that, if you engage health care

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.500
providers from the get-go,
not only they work with women,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.430
they know their stories.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:48.550
They can bring their stories
to the public conversation.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:53.410
But also, they are the ones who
will have to provide services.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:57.100
And that has proved to be, I
think, an important element

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.660
that we have learned
through the work

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.020
we have done in the region.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.130
DANIELLE BROWN: Yeah.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.090
That's very insightful.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.930
Thank you.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.084
John, I just wanted to take
a look, check with you.

00:32:04.084 --> 00:32:05.500
Are there questions
from the door?

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.300
I certainly have a
lot more for Giselle,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.310
but I want to make sure
audience gets their questions.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.420
AUDIENCE: We do
indeed have a couple.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:10.880
DANIELLE BROWN: Great.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.600
AUDIENCE: Start
with one of them.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.080
Molly asks, "I used to
work in public health

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.712
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:32:15.712 --> 00:32:17.170
One of the challenges
I encountered

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.850
was combating
dangerous myths about

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.587
reproductive and sexual health.

00:32:20.587 --> 00:32:22.795
How do you correct these
misconceptions in the field,

00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:24.220
and is there
anything we at Google

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.227
can do to combat this
type of misinformation?"

00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:27.310
GISELLE CARINO: Of course.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.010
I mean, I think we
heard it all in terms

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.410
of myths and misconceptions
about contraception,

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.720
about everything else.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.960
I think I could not
stress enough the need

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.630
to have comprehensive
sexual education

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.780
for young people and as
early as that is possible.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.650
And not any type of
comprehensive sexual education,

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.670
but one that is evidence
based, that talks about power

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.200
and relationships, that
helps kids, young people

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.290
maneuver their life and
their relationships,

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:03.710
and to help them challenge the
social norms around masculinity

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:09.550
that are oftentimes the basis
for machismo and for violence.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.780
I think that's critical.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.650
I think you at Google can help.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.610
As I said, we have the
biggest opportunity ever.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.020
We have the largest generation
of young people in front of us.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.230
Reaching them with the right
information, it's critical.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.255
And I suspect you
will have ideas

00:33:29.255 --> 00:33:31.990
on how you can help us do that.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.430
But it's definitely
something that

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.060
will be an investment that will
pay off in the next 40 years.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.880
We know education pays off.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.560
Comprehensive sexual education
is not the exception to that.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.120
We have plenty of evidence of
that type of sexual education

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.830
that works.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.030
And I think we just need
to be able to reach kids

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.450
in school, out of school
with good information

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.700
so they can actually live
the life they want to live.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.234
And I think it's
critical that we do that.

00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:04.900
DANIELLE BROWN: That's
a great question.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.830
Thank you, Molly.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.610
Another one, John?

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.260
AUDIENCE: One more, actually
following along that one.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.960
"Can you talk a bit about how
you evaluate your programs

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.850
for effectiveness?"

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.790
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:19.840
For every program we run, we do
an evaluation of the program.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.460
Also, each member
association runs evaluation

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.330
of their own programs as well.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.500
Evaluation is critical
for learning for us.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.595
And I think the program I
was talking about in Bolivia

00:34:33.595 --> 00:34:37.360
on cervical cancer is again
a good example because we not

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.780
only look about effectiveness--
is the vaccine effective,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.900
is effective in this setting--

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.750
we also look at, are
there better ways?

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.360
Are the more cost-effective
effective ways of doing that?

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.537
One thing that we are
very happy to know now

00:34:52.537 --> 00:34:54.370
is that the vaccine
that I was talking about

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:58.420
to prevent cervical cancer,
instead of having three doses,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.710
have two doses.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.740
Being able to deliver a program
with two doses as opposed

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.911
to three might
seem a small thing.

00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:07.035
It's a huge thing because
in low-resource settings,

00:35:07.035 --> 00:35:10.080
if you can eliminate one
step, keep the same results,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.620
you can use that
money for other health

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.410
pressing needs in the country.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.110
So we would love
to do much more,

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.585
but we have a commitment to
evaluate everything we do.

00:35:22.585 --> 00:35:23.960
DANIELLE BROWN:
That's fantastic.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.400
You know, one issue we haven't
touched too much on yet

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.140
is maternal mortality.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.500
And I'd love to understand
sort of the prevalence

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.790
or the demographics
in your region

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.760
around maternal mortality
and sort of a little bit

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.700
about the harm reduction
model that sort of really

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.910
helps address that issue.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.160
Can you talk to us about that?

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.050
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.760
Thank you for that question.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.060
The harm reduction model
was developed in Uruguay

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.560
about 10 years ago by a
group of midwives and doctors

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.940
who worked in a public hospital.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.870
And maternal
mortality was always

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.270
relatively low in Uruguay
with one exception,

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:06.040
which was maternal mortality
due to unsafe abortion.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.120
And what happens
in the region is

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.890
that, if you are
a woman of means,

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:20.040
even though the law might
not allow for legal abortion

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.070
you can get an abortion
from your doctor.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.920
The problem is that those
who are not women of means

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.470
simply die from unsafe abortion.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.110
So this is what they
face in Uruguay.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.970
They thought at the moment
that abortion was restricted.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.830
There were a few exceptions
not really known by women

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.640
and not really used
by providers either.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.570
And abortion had a moment, but
it also had a before and an

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:50.010
after where women had
contacts with their providers.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.860
And doing nothing wasn't
what they wanted to do.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.450
So they developed a model that
allows them to educate women

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.850
about what they shouldn't
do if they decide

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:06.660
to pursue an abortion, what not
to insert, the warning signs,

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.660
and also to come back
for care afterwards.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.990
They couldn't probably
help them in the moment--

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.240
only if they were eligible
for the legal exceptions,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.270
otherwise they didn't have
the ability to help them.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.760
But help them with education,
and they could come back

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.560
for care when they need care.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.470
Post-abortion care is legal
in a lot of the countries.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.410
And they thought this
was very important.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.750
At the same time, there was
a new drug called Misoprostol

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.120
that became available
in the region,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.490
and it's a drug
that saves lives.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.970
Women can induce abortions.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.290
It's much safer.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.770
And so providers
would educate women

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.180
on how to use Misoprostol.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.060
They couldn't tell them
where to get Misoprostol

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.270
or they couldn't
prescribe the drug,

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.070
but based on the right
to access information

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.160
they thought women should have
access to the best information

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.910
to preserve their lives.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.530
And this is how they
build the model.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.890
And quite interesting,
the model was

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.360
expanded to several countries
in Latin America and in Africa.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.350
And they dropped maternal
mortality to zero

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.370
in a matter of ten years.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:24.100
And they also paved the way, I
think, for abortion law reform.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:29.670
Uruguay in 2012 passed a law
that decriminalized abortion up

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.030
to 12 weeks in the country.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.710
And I am absolutely convinced
that talking to women,

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.000
educating providers was
key to build support

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.440
around the need of a law that
would allow women to manage

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.680
this part of their lives with
safety and with good health

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.100
outcomes.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.850
So I think the model was
portrayed in "The New York

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.990
Times," and very much
we are proud that they

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.340
were able to create and
have a role to play in such

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.535
a moment in women's lives.

00:39:00.535 --> 00:39:01.410
DANIELLE BROWN: Sure.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.510
Certainly, getting maternal
mortality down to 0%

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:09.270
is an amazing feat,
so thank you for that.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.450
We talked a little bit about
the laws and the restrictions

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.010
that you're seeing
sort of come up

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.260
in Latin America
and the Caribbean,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.600
but talk a little
bit about certainly

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.730
in the US over the
past several years

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.770
there's been a lot of
restrictive laws passed

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.720
making it harder to access
contraception, access

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.350
safe and legal abortion.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.260
How does sort of the
policy in the United States

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.730
and the arguments and politics
sort of around women's health

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.670
impact the work you
do in the region?

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.960
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.990
The US used to be a
place where we looked up

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.060
for leadership on these issues.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.250
And as I said, that's
no longer the case.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.500
But in addition to that, and
in addition to the global gag

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.310
rule that I talked
before that really

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:58.560
curtails the possibility of
organizations to serve women,

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.450
I say that what we
are beginning to see

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:05.830
is a much stronger violent
and aggressive opposition

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.730
in the region,
which is quite new.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.600
We had not seen that before.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.256
In a matter of a
few months, we had

00:40:15.256 --> 00:40:18.200
our offices vandalized
in one of the countries,

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.490
our executive director in
another country with death

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:25.450
threats, and things that we
clearly had not seen before.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.300
We also have something that came
up in Colombia that is called

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:34.210
[? Agenda ?] [? Ideology, ?] a
whole reframing conversation.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.330
And it came right at the
moment of the peace process

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.450
and against all of our
issues really very strongly.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:49.420
And I think we have to think
about as a clear influence

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.860
there has been some
reports recently,

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.310
I think in "The
Guardian" about the role

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:58.510
of the opposition in the
US funding the opposition

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.680
in many of the Latin American
and Caribbean countries.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.680
And I think we are going to
see more of that in the years

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.502
to come.

00:41:06.502 --> 00:41:07.960
DANIELLE BROWN: So
really, the work

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.970
we all do in our
individual regions

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.070
and countries really
is interconnected.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.110
And so playing a
role to actively

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.140
advocate for policies that
advance women's health

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.477
are important for all of us.

00:41:18.477 --> 00:41:19.810
GISELLE CARINO: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:20.779
Very much, very much.

00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:23.070
DANIELLE BROWN: John, any
last questions from the Dory,

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.279
as I ask Giselle just a few
last important questions.

00:41:25.279 --> 00:41:26.903
AUDIENCE: There was
one last one, which

00:41:26.903 --> 00:41:29.560
was a lot of the conversation
around Planned Parenthood is

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.132
on the topic of abortion,
but I understand

00:41:32.132 --> 00:41:34.590
you put an awful lot of effort
into other kinds of services

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.089
as well.

00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:37.780
Could you perhaps touch
on a couple of those?

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.910
GISELLE CARINO: Yes.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.350
If you look at
our annual report,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.580
abortion services are about
5% of the services we provide.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:50.710
About 30% are services
on contraception,

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:56.010
cancer screening, gender-based
violence detection

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.100
and screening and support.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.160
So when you look at the
number of services we provide

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.600
and the division,
you'll see that it's

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.550
a very small proportion.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.130
We feel very proud of the
work we do on abortion,

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.490
but we do much more indeed.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:16.760
And as I said, we have
been leaders in accessing,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.020
in bringing contraception to
Latin America and the Caribbean

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.960
and have done so for
about 60 years now.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.020
So yes, we provide
comprehensive care to women.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.820
We feel we need to serve the
needs of women, all of them

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.330
with no exceptions when it
comes to reproductive and sexual

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.220
care.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.480
And that's how we stand
as an organization,

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.470
and that can be easily
verified by our annual report.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.774
It hasn't changed much
over the years really.

00:42:44.774 --> 00:42:47.440
DANIELLE BROWN: I think that's a
great reminder of the resources

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.440
available to us to learn
about Planned Parenthood

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.170
and the wide range
of work you all do.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.180
So at Google here,
we're coming up

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.840
on our annual Giving Week
Googlers are very involved

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.000
in giving back to the
communities we serve

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.640
and communities around the
world through our time,

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.750
through our money.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.030
What is the best way
for a Googler who

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:12.130
is interested in women's health
and reproductive freedom, what

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.919
is the best way for
Googlers to get involved?

00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:16.960
GISELLE CARINO: Well,
first, thank you, Googlers.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.980
We feel your love.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.370
We are really very
happy to count

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.820
with us one of our supporters.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.620
I think the first thing I
would say, become a supporter.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:27.480
Donate to us.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.690
You can do so through
our website, IPPFWHR.org.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:34.810
This is the moment.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.180
If non of the arguments
before convinced you,

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.270
this is the moment to
double down on women's right

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.410
to reach the birth, to support
all of the progressive causes.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.110
There is no best
time to do that now

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.190
because so much is under threat.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.230
We just learned that you
also have a program that you

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.530
can spend your time with us.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:57.490
We would love.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.670
I think you have a lot
of ideas and thoughts

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.250
that could be very useful to us.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.130
And I think, finally,
again, you can

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.460
help us bridge the gap in the
most difficult issues we are

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.990
facing and will make a
difference in the next 50 years

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.690
in the region.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.800
So I'd love to engage in the
conversation on how that could

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.670
help in accessing young
people, working together

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.430
to be able to enable that.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.280
So I think there are many ways.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.790
And of course, collaborating and
supporting your local Planned

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.350
Parenthood as well.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.150
We are a global
movement, and the support

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.175
is needed everywhere.

00:44:35.175 --> 00:44:36.550
DANIELLE BROWN:
That's fantastic.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.145
So I want to end
on a positive note.

00:44:39.145 --> 00:44:42.940
You did talk about it is a
challenging time for women's

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.280
reproductive rights, for
issues of health care,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.000
for sexual violence and
assault. But in talking to you,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.980
I can tell that you
have a lot of hope

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.580
and a lot of optimism
for a better future.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.020
And can you tell us
sort of maybe a story

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.165
or share a few
thoughts about sort

00:44:58.165 --> 00:45:02.480
of how you keep that hope and
optimism alive in this work

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.830
which is so important?

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.850
GISELLE CARINO: It's
difficult, Danielle.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.650
There are days in which I don't
feel necessarily this way.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:13.190
I think we have to keep
an eye on the long fight.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.020
We've been here for 60 years.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.640
We'll be here for 60 more.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.070
We are not going to
give up on women.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.050
And we have seen the
change that happens.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.690
And if one keeps their
eye on that long game,

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.680
we know things are possible
and change will come.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.470
It will require a lot of effort.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.590
It's a back and forth.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:36.020
It's never a straight
line to the finish.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.960
There is never a finish.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.360
But I have a lot of confidence
in the role of civil society

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.460
organizations,
organizations like ours,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.840
who will not give up.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.650
And I think it's
very clear to us

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.360
that this is a fight worth
fighting if anything.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.654
So yeah, that keeps me going.

00:45:53.654 --> 00:45:55.820
DANIELLE BROWN: Well,
Giselle, I've got to tell you,

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.170
I think you instilled a great
deal of hope and optimism

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.937
for me today certainly and I
know for our audience members.

00:46:02.937 --> 00:46:04.520
And I just want to
thank you for that.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.960
I think we touched on a lot of
issues today and I think really

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.750
gave Googlers listening
and the world listening

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.176
a sense of sort of some of
the issues that we're facing

00:46:14.176 --> 00:46:15.800
and the importance
of getting involved.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.480
So I just want to thank you.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.820
We're very grateful for
you and your knowledge

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.310
and, most importantly, your
hope and your optimism.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.324
So thank you.

00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:24.740
GISELLE CARINO:
Thank you so much.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.340
Yeah.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.590
[APPLAUSE]
