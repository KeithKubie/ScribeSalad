that we released a collection in Google
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.800
that we released a collection in Google
Play called the beautiful design

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
Play called the beautiful design
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.040
Play called the beautiful design
collection for summer 2013 and this is a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
collection for summer 2013 and this is a
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.590
collection for summer 2013 and this is a
collection of 11 apps that highlighted

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
collection of 11 apps that highlighted
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.430
collection of 11 apps that highlighted
some of the kind of best of class or I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
some of the kind of best of class or I
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830
some of the kind of best of class or I
guess some of the best designed apps on

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
guess some of the best designed apps on
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280
guess some of the best designed apps on
Google Play so in today's episode we're

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
Google Play so in today's episode we're
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.729
Google Play so in today's episode we're
gonna look through these different apps

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739
gonna look through these different apps
 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.979
gonna look through these different apps
on our tablet here and we're going to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
on our tablet here and we're going to
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410
on our tablet here and we're going to
talk about some of the some of the best

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
talk about some of the some of the best
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920
talk about some of the some of the best
kind of design details in each app and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
kind of design details in each app and
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.270
kind of design details in each app and
then we'll I think we'll have time to go

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
then we'll I think we'll have time to go
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.279
then we'll I think we'll have time to go
through all 11 apps and then we have a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
through all 11 apps and then we have a
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.540
through all 11 apps and then we have a
couple of things at the end that will

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
couple of things at the end that will
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.720
couple of things at the end that will
show as well so with that and any other

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
show as well so with that and any other
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.270
show as well so with that and any other
intro guys Before we jump in a little

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
intro guys Before we jump in a little
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.600
intro guys Before we jump in a little
bit about how these apps work I think

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
bit about how these apps work I think
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910
bit about how these apps work I think
the idea behind this collection is that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
the idea behind this collection is that
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920
the idea behind this collection is that
these applications which you know really

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
these applications which you know really
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690
these applications which you know really
embrace the design guidelines but kind

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
embrace the design guidelines but kind
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.480
embrace the design guidelines but kind
of also go beyond that and really kind

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
of also go beyond that and really kind
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.820
of also go beyond that and really kind
of you know how that that level above

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
of you know how that that level above
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.249
of you know how that that level above
that adds the polish that makes it a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
that adds the polish that makes it a
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.080
that adds the polish that makes it a
beautifully designed application

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
beautifully designed application
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.660
beautifully designed application
absolutely so let's see so the the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
absolutely so let's see so the the
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340
absolutely so let's see so the the
collection from the blog post that we

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
collection from the blog post that we
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.609
collection from the blog post that we
that we posted about this collection

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619
that we posted about this collection
 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.690
that we posted about this collection
talks a lot about attention to detail

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
talks a lot about attention to detail
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.960
talks a lot about attention to detail
and it's not really about just kind of

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970
and it's not really about just kind of
 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.819
and it's not really about just kind of
you know getting the 80% of the app or

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
you know getting the 80% of the app or
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380
you know getting the 80% of the app or
90% of the app looking great it's really

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
90% of the app looking great it's really
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990
90% of the app looking great it's really
just adding that final 10% of fit and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
just adding that final 10% of fit and
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.760
just adding that final 10% of fit and
finish and polish that again like Nick

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
finish and polish that again like Nick
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.170
finish and polish that again like Nick
said goes above and beyond just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
said goes above and beyond just
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.690
said goes above and beyond just
following the guidelines and really kind

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
following the guidelines and really kind
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.569
following the guidelines and really kind
of you know stressing that you know that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
of you know stressing that you know that
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100
of you know stressing that you know that
every single part of the app must be

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
every single part of the app must be
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139
every single part of the app must be
must be polished and really kind of used

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
must be polished and really kind of used
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.240
must be polished and really kind of used
to think about every single flow that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
to think about every single flow that
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.120
to think about every single flow that
the user would go through and so these

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
the user would go through and so these
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.850
the user would go through and so these
11 apps we found contain some of these

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
11 apps we found contain some of these
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.859
11 apps we found contain some of these
you know masterfully crafted design

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
you know masterfully crafted design
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229
you know masterfully crafted design
details and so that's why these are

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
details and so that's why these are
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210
details and so that's why these are
chosen obviously this is only 11 apps

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
chosen obviously this is only 11 apps
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.600
chosen obviously this is only 11 apps
there are tons more

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
there are tons more
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.450
there are tons more
apps out there in Google Play this is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460
apps out there in Google Play this is
 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.180
apps out there in Google Play this is
just kind of the first set of gifts the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
just kind of the first set of gifts the
 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.600
just kind of the first set of gifts the

series you should expect more in the
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.670
series you should expect more in the
future in the coming I guess different

really long Google+ post that talked

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800
really long Google+ post that talked
 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.190
really long Google+ post that talked
about kind of you know where the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
about kind of you know where the
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.560
about kind of you know where the
guidelines you know sit in terms of the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570
guidelines you know sit in terms of the
 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.780
guidelines you know sit in terms of the
design process you know how you should

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
design process you know how you should
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.180
design process you know how you should
approach the guidelines what types of

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
approach the guidelines what types of
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.640
approach the guidelines what types of
decisions you should be thinking about

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650
decisions you should be thinking about
 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.140
decisions you should be thinking about
where you should introduce it we should

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150
where you should introduce it we should
 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.790
where you should introduce it we should
begin introducing branding and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800
begin introducing branding and
 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.890
begin introducing branding and
consistency and things like that and so

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
consistency and things like that and so
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.870
consistency and things like that and so
if you're it while we're on the topic I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
if you're it while we're on the topic I
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.850
if you're it while we're on the topic I
guess of the beautiful design collection

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860
guess of the beautiful design collection
 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800
pattern so pattern is is basically an

different wallpapers and actually these
 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.930
different wallpapers and actually these
wallpapers are all pattern tiles hence

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940
wallpapers are all pattern tiles hence
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.850
wallpapers are all pattern tiles hence
the name pattern so they kind of tile

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860
the name pattern so they kind of tile
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.320
the name pattern so they kind of tile
across they're not just you know one big

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330
across they're not just you know one big
 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.449
across they're not just you know one big

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539
meaning you know it works on tablet
 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.110
meaning you know it works on tablet
works on phone works at 7-inch and so on

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120
works on phone works at 7-inch and so on
 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.160
works on phone works at 7-inch and so on
and so you know

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170
and so you know
 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.380
and so you know
this app right now is one of the the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390
this app right now is one of the the
 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.720
this app right now is one of the the
best examples of a kind of a very nice

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730
best examples of a kind of a very nice
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.120
best examples of a kind of a very nice
standard responsive design where

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130
standard responsive design where
 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.500
standard responsive design where
basically on a tablet here you see

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510
basically on a tablet here you see
 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.860
basically on a tablet here you see
multiple columns of of patterns or of

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870
multiple columns of of patterns or of
 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.570
multiple columns of of patterns or of
wallpapers and on a phone you'd actually

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
wallpapers and on a phone you'd actually
 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.400
wallpapers and on a phone you'd actually
see fewer columns maybe just one column

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
see fewer columns maybe just one column
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.160
see fewer columns maybe just one column
and two columns in landscape and then

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170
and two columns in landscape and then
 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.200
and two columns in landscape and then
you have your kind of core navigation on

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210
you have your kind of core navigation on
 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.200
you have your kind of core navigation on
the left you basically can jump in

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210
the left you basically can jump in
 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.850
the left you basically can jump in
between or switch between different

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860
between or switch between different
 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.060
between or switch between different
sections and then you can you know open

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070
sections and then you can you know open
 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.770
sections and then you can you know open
up one of these wallpapers and you know

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
up one of these wallpapers and you know
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.150
up one of these wallpapers and you know
one of the nice touches is that you know

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160
one of the nice touches is that you know
 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.010
one of the nice touches is that you know
they have these very subtle animations

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
they have these very subtle animations
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.050
they have these very subtle animations
here don't let you kind of see more and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060
here don't let you kind of see more and
 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.400
here don't let you kind of see more and
actually it also kind of goes into

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410
actually it also kind of goes into
 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.210
actually it also kind of goes into
lights-out mode so you actually fade out

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220
lights-out mode so you actually fade out
 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.670
lights-out mode so you actually fade out
or you dim the the navigation bar and

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680
or you dim the the navigation bar and
 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.860
or you dim the the navigation bar and
the status bar in the process now one of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870
the status bar in the process now one of
 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.910
the status bar in the process now one of
the last things I wanted to mention

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920
the last things I wanted to mention
 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.400
the last things I wanted to mention
about this app and obviously the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410
about this app and obviously the
 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.870
about this app and obviously the
responsive design I think for me is one

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880
responsive design I think for me is one
 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.490
responsive design I think for me is one
of the biggest things about it that

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500
of the biggest things about it that
 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.150
of the biggest things about it that
makes it so great

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160
makes it so great
 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.590
makes it so great
one of the last things is that you know

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600
one of the last things is that you know
 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.480
one of the last things is that you know
there are subtle little touches here and

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
there are subtle little touches here and
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.420
there are subtle little touches here and
there like letting you rotate the

automatically on a schedule and then
also just kind of the overall fit and

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130
also just kind of the overall fit and
 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.440

big Pinterest user myself but that
 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.940
big Pinterest user myself but that
doesn't mean I can't play with the app

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950
doesn't mean I can't play with the app
 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.350
doesn't mean I can't play with the app
and use the app and see how its

beautifully designed so the first thing

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850
beautifully designed so the first thing
 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.160
beautifully designed so the first thing
you'll notice and this is kind of

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170
you'll notice and this is kind of
 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.630
you'll notice and this is kind of
interesting because there's no sort of

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640
interesting because there's no sort of
 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.060
interesting because there's no sort of
standard action bar and of course if

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070
standard action bar and of course if
 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.110
standard action bar and of course if
you've listened to any of our shows

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120
you've listened to any of our shows
 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.700
you've listened to any of our shows
we're always talking action bar action

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710
we're always talking action bar action
 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.980
we're always talking action bar action
bar action bar but in this case they've

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990
bar action bar but in this case they've
 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.870
bar action bar but in this case they've
actually gone through sort of almost

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
actually gone through sort of almost
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.030
actually gone through sort of almost
like a hybrid between top level tabs

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040
like a hybrid between top level tabs
 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.370
like a hybrid between top level tabs
which you may see in an app like say the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380
which you may see in an app like say the
 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.410
which you may see in an app like say the
people app and the sort of standard

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420
people app and the sort of standard
 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.120
people app and the sort of standard
action bar where you have branding only

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130
action bar where you have branding only
 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.180
action bar where you have branding only
in the top left and it actually works

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190
in the top left and it actually works
 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.090
in the top left and it actually works
nicely because on their website they

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100
nicely because on their website they
 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.760
nicely because on their website they
have the same design and layout so you

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770
have the same design and layout so you
 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.140
have the same design and layout so you
can see here they've still got the set

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150
can see here they've still got the set
 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.700
can see here they've still got the set
of standard interaction patterns of

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710
of standard interaction patterns of
 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.710
of standard interaction patterns of
swiping between the

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720
swiping between the
 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.480
swiping between the
tabs where the middle tab is really sort

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490
tabs where the middle tab is really sort
 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.750
tabs where the middle tab is really sort
of home or browse your stream and the

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760
of home or browse your stream and the
 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.370
of home or browse your stream and the
left tab while it does have a search

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380
left tab while it does have a search
 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.370
left tab while it does have a search
icon it's more of a like discover tab or

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380
icon it's more of a like discover tab or
 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.480
icon it's more of a like discover tab or
something like something along those

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490
something like something along those
 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.650
something like something along those
lines and so that's of the first thing I

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660
lines and so that's of the first thing I
 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.690
lines and so that's of the first thing I
want to call out the second thing is

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700
want to call out the second thing is
 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.270
want to call out the second thing is
this multi-column layout and that's a

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280
this multi-column layout and that's a
 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.300
this multi-column layout and that's a
game very similar to their website and

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310
game very similar to their website and
 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.740
game very similar to their website and
this is really nice because obviously

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750
this is really nice because obviously
 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.870

the reading experience and the
application does a lot of stuff but it

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360
application does a lot of stuff but it
 

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.420

so for example the user interface here

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.350
so for example the user interface here
 

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.780
so for example the user interface here
the action bar and so forth is all quite

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.790
the action bar and so forth is all quite
 

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.000
the action bar and so forth is all quite
muted so it immediately receives out the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.010
muted so it immediately receives out the
 

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.560

the action bar heights and once again we

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:22.329
example and the affordances jump right
back so you know you can check the time

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:22.339
back so you know you can check the time
 

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:24.640
back so you know you can check the time
or multitask another app or he's one of

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:24.650
or multitask another app or he's one of
 

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.700
or multitask another app or he's one of
the action bar options so it just gets

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:27.710
the action bar options so it just gets
 

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.740
the action bar options so it just gets
out of your way and it just works I love

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.750
out of your way and it just works I love
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.570
out of your way and it just works I love
that focus on the reading experience and

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:31.580
that focus on the reading experience and
 

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.070
that focus on the reading experience and
the same thing is true of their kind of

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:33.080
the same thing is true of their kind of
 

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.510
the same thing is true of their kind of
pagination model so you can either read

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:34.520
pagination model so you can either read
 

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.250
pagination model so you can either read
it in a clip like an endless stream so

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.260
it in a clip like an endless stream so
 

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.470
it in a clip like an endless stream so
you swiping up and down or you can swipe

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480
you swiping up and down or you can swipe
 

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.960
you swiping up and down or you can swipe
left and right to change like a

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:40.970
left and right to change like a
 

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.420
left and right to change like a
paginating content model and and I love

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:43.430
paginating content model and and I love
 

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.680
paginating content model and and I love
the fact that there's no you know you

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:44.690
the fact that there's no you know you
 

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.449
the fact that there's no you know you
can imagine that one way of implementing

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:46.459
can imagine that one way of implementing
 

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:47.740
can imagine that one way of implementing
that interface would be some kind of

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:47.750
that interface would be some kind of
 

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.720
that interface would be some kind of
toggle switch or machinery in order to

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:49.730
toggle switch or machinery in order to
 

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.140
toggle switch or machinery in order to
do it

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.150
do it
 

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.460
do it
but instead of doing that they just

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.470
but instead of doing that they just
 

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.019
but instead of doing that they just
listen to what you try you're trying to

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:53.029
listen to what you try you're trying to
 

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:56.170
listen to what you try you're trying to
use it so if you scroll vertically then

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:56.180
use it so if you scroll vertically then
 

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.790
use it so if you scroll vertically then
it'll give you a vertical stream screen

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800
it'll give you a vertical stream screen
 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.500
it'll give you a vertical stream screen
of content and if you scroll

00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.510
of content and if you scroll
 

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.760
of content and if you scroll
horizontally then it'll just

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:00.770
horizontally then it'll just
 

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.710
horizontally then it'll just
automatically flip into this pagination

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720
automatically flip into this pagination
 

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.400
automatically flip into this pagination
content

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.410
content
 

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.620
content
so again it just reduces all the

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:05.630
so again it just reduces all the
 

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.820
so again it just reduces all the
machinery around it and just really

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:06.830
machinery around it and just really
 

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.320
machinery around it and just really
really focuses on getting out of your

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.330
really focuses on getting out of your
 

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.670
really focuses on getting out of your
way and letting you get to the content

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680
way and letting you get to the content
 

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.590
way and letting you get to the content
so really really great attention to

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600
so really really great attention to
 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.950
so really really great attention to
detail this up mm-hmm yeah it's I'd say

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:14.960
detail this up mm-hmm yeah it's I'd say
 

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.660
detail this up mm-hmm yeah it's I'd say
that it's one of the best kind of in

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:16.670
that it's one of the best kind of in
 

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.290
that it's one of the best kind of in
reading experiences you know if at all

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:20.300
reading experiences you know if at all
 

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.390
reading experiences you know if at all
you need to build an app that lets you

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:22.400
you need to build an app that lets you
 

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.790
you need to build an app that lets you
kind of read through large chunks of

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800
kind of read through large chunks of
 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.760
kind of read through large chunks of
content a large body copy definitely

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.770
content a large body copy definitely
 

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.290
content a large body copy definitely
look at this up is kind of a shining

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300
look at this up is kind of a shining
 

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.390
look at this up is kind of a shining
example how to do that right yeah it

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:31.400
example how to do that right yeah it
 

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.770
example how to do that right yeah it
looks a lot different ones that's filled

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:32.780
looks a lot different ones that's filled
 

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.140
looks a lot different ones that's filled
out with yeah all right shall we move on

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.150
out with yeah all right shall we move on
 

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.970
out with yeah all right shall we move on
to timer so timer is a very very simple

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:42.980
to timer so timer is a very very simple
 

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.240
to timer so timer is a very very simple
app it's so timer is basically an app

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.250
app it's so timer is basically an app
 

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.000
app it's so timer is basically an app
that it's it's just that it's a timer it

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.010
that it's it's just that it's a timer it
 

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.760
that it's it's just that it's a timer it
has a couple of features and has

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:53.770
has a couple of features and has
 

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.840
has a couple of features and has
basically the I think it has a stopwatch

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:55.850
basically the I think it has a stopwatch
 

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.490
basically the I think it has a stopwatch
does it have a stop lunch I should

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:57.500
does it have a stop lunch I should
 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.220
does it have a stop lunch I should
remember but it basically has a

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.230
remember but it basically has a
 

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.610
remember but it basically has a
countdown timer it's it's just kind of

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:02.620
countdown timer it's it's just kind of
 

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.330
countdown timer it's it's just kind of
you know your standard run-of-the-mill

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.340
you know your standard run-of-the-mill
 

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.010
you know your standard run-of-the-mill
countdown timer but the best thing about

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.020
countdown timer but the best thing about
 

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.560
countdown timer but the best thing about
this is is the interactions and the kind

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:08.570
this is is the interactions and the kind
 

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.060
this is is the interactions and the kind
of the little ways in which they

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.070
of the little ways in which they
 

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.680
of the little ways in which they
sprinkle kind of Android goodness

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:11.690
sprinkle kind of Android goodness
 

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.660
sprinkle kind of Android goodness
so for example you know if you pull down

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:13.670
so for example you know if you pull down
 

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.520
so for example you know if you pull down
the shade here I'll Android design in

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:15.530
the shade here I'll Android design in
 

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.070
the shade here I'll Android design in
action is life that's good you'll notice

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.080
action is life that's good you'll notice
 

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.230
action is life that's good you'll notice
that the notification is very customized

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240
that the notification is very customized
 

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.750
that the notification is very customized
and they have actions built into the

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760
and they have actions built into the
 

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.850
and they have actions built into the
notifications so without even let's say

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:24.860
notifications so without even let's say
 

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.470
notifications so without even let's say
I'm just at the home screen here I can

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480
I'm just at the home screen here I can
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.050
I'm just at the home screen here I can
manage my timer right from here so I can

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.060
manage my timer right from here so I can
 

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.730
manage my timer right from here so I can
pause and resume it I can see how much

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:30.740
pause and resume it I can see how much
 

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.470
pause and resume it I can see how much
time is remaining and you know I can

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480
time is remaining and you know I can
 

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.810
time is remaining and you know I can
obviously end it if I needed to but also

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:34.820
obviously end it if I needed to but also
 

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.190
obviously end it if I needed to but also
one of my other favorite things about

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:36.200
one of my other favorite things about
 

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.210
one of my other favorite things about
this was that the the interaction for

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:40.220
this was that the the interaction for
 

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.100
this was that the the interaction for
creating a timer is very simple and

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.110
creating a timer is very simple and
 

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.020
creating a timer is very simple and
intuitive so you basically just kind of

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.030
intuitive so you basically just kind of
 

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.120
intuitive so you basically just kind of
drag this thing around and sorry for the

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.130
drag this thing around and sorry for the
 

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.130
drag this thing around and sorry for the
lag here I think our HDMI connection is

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.140
lag here I think our HDMI connection is
 

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.840
lag here I think our HDMI connection is
laggy but you basically just drag this

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:49.850
laggy but you basically just drag this
 

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.570
laggy but you basically just drag this
around it's very it's very tactile and

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:52.580
around it's very it's very tactile and
 

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.820
around it's very it's very tactile and
and I'm kind of visceral the the feeling

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:54.830
and I'm kind of visceral the the feeling
 

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.830
and I'm kind of visceral the the feeling
of kind of rotating a dial it almost

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:56.840
of kind of rotating a dial it almost
 

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.780
of kind of rotating a dial it almost
hints back to earlier the early days of

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:58.790
hints back to earlier the early days of
 

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.660
hints back to earlier the early days of
kind of a rotary telephone and most so

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:01.670
kind of a rotary telephone and most so
 

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.580
kind of a rotary telephone and most so
the interaction model here is is very

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:03.590
the interaction model here is is very
 

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.890
the interaction model here is is very
nice it's also very simple the last

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:05.900
nice it's also very simple the last
 

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.210
nice it's also very simple the last
thing I want to point out is that they

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:07.220
thing I want to point out is that they
 

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.040
thing I want to point out is that they
have a couple of themes and while you

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.050
have a couple of themes and while you
 

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.750
have a couple of themes and while you
know having multiple themes is not a

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760
know having multiple themes is not a
 

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.970
know having multiple themes is not a
necessity it's always kind of like a you

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:12.980
necessity it's always kind of like a you
 

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.990
necessity it's always kind of like a you
know nice extra touch and they also you

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000
know nice extra touch and they also you
 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.040
know nice extra touch and they also you
basically seen everything so if you

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.050
basically seen everything so if you
 

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.070
basically seen everything so if you
switch from the light blue to the light

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.080
switch from the light blue to the light
 

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.530
switch from the light blue to the light
orange theme basically everything

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:23.540
orange theme basically everything
 

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.520
orange theme basically everything
becomes orange the action bar tabs the

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.530
becomes orange the action bar tabs the
 

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.280
becomes orange the action bar tabs the
even the app icon becomes orange so you

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.290
even the app icon becomes orange so you
 

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.290
even the app icon becomes orange so you
can see here kind of their single accent

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:32.300
can see here kind of their single accent
 

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.330
can see here kind of their single accent
color changes to kind of fit what the

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:34.340
color changes to kind of fit what the
 

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.140
color changes to kind of fit what the
user prefers so overall very nice simple

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.150
user prefers so overall very nice simple

left a spinner next to that and then

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:25.430
left a spinner next to that and then
 

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.350

they've left the
 

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.509
they've left the
the area between that empty and then

00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519
the area between that empty and then
 

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:29.799

think it works really well for sort of

00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319
think it works really well for sort of
 

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:35.289
think it works really well for sort of
taking the focus off the UI elements and

00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:35.299
taking the focus off the UI elements and
 

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:36.819
taking the focus off the UI elements and
then bringing the focus to the actual

00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:36.829
then bringing the focus to the actual
 

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:39.699
then bringing the focus to the actual
content of the application so you can

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:39.709
content of the application so you can
 

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:41.919

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:01.910
and around subtle design touch as you
 

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.879
and around subtle design touch as you
can see here it sort of fades fades in

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:03.889
can see here it sort of fades fades in

as you swipe out it can read some
 

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:08.319
as you swipe out it can read some
information about the design and then

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:08.329
information about the design and then
 

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:09.699
information about the design and then
again see another really nice

full-screen image here and an
 

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:13.179
full-screen image here and an
interesting thing that we can't actually

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:13.189
interesting thing that we can't actually
 

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:14.439
interesting thing that we can't actually
show here is that if you go into

00:16:14.439 --> 00:16:14.449
show here is that if you go into
 

00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:15.850
show here is that if you go into
portrait mode if there's a slightly

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:15.860
portrait mode if there's a slightly
 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.509
portrait mode if there's a slightly
different representation and where you

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519
different representation and where you
 

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.619
different representation and where you
can view the images at the top of the

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:20.629
can view the images at the top of the
 

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:22.689
can view the images at the top of the
screen and then the content below that I

00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:22.699
screen and then the content below that I
 

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:24.009
screen and then the content below that I
can't show that here because we're on

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:24.019
can't show that here because we're on
 

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.689

around and then I'm not gonna talk too
 

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:32.470
around and then I'm not gonna talk too
much more about this because we're a

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480
much more about this because we're a
 

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.780

feature items they have this just sort
of nice clean grid view of items and

00:16:40.689 --> 00:16:40.699
of nice clean grid view of items and
 

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.220
of nice clean grid view of items and
again it's multi columns so it scales

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.230
again it's multi columns so it scales
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.229
again it's multi columns so it scales
very well to different screen sizes and

00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:44.239
very well to different screen sizes and
 

00:16:44.239 --> 00:16:45.639
very well to different screen sizes and
we can go back and browse all of the
