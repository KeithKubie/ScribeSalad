00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:12.009
Vaccines, in general, have

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.769
been a massive boon to humanity.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.359
They’ve rid the world of an affliction that
has plagued humanity for thousands of years

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.119
in smallpox (for reference killing over 300
million people in the 20th century alone before

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.939
it was eradicated), and have almost completely
wiped out polio, all while preventing millions

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.860
of deaths from countless other viruses every
single year.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
As for the flu vaccine, it’s recommended
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.691
(CDC), the National Institute of Health, and
almost every other major health organization

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.830
around the world.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.000
Despite this, outside of whether certain vaccines
can give babies autism (see our article: Do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.360
Vaccines Cause Autism?), few vaccines garner
as much controversy as the flu vaccine.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.590
So if vaccines are so great- and they unequivocally
are, assuming you’re not a “watch the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.320
world burn” type- and the flu vaccine is
so widely recommended by experts, why is there

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.550
such controversy surrounding it?

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.720
Today we’ll be doing a deep dive on this
topic, as well as answering the question of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:23.430
whether the flu vaccine can give you the flu.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
According the US census bureau, there are
approximately 320 million people in the United

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.590
States.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.760
The CDC states that about 20% of the population
will be affected by the flu each year, and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.701
in 2013 in the U.S. there were around 57,000
deaths caused by influenza/pneumonia, with

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:47.490
the CDC crediting 3,697 as dying from influenza
specifically.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.630
In fact, in that same year the CDC reported
that the flu was number eight on the top causes

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.299
of death behind (in order) heart disease,
cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases,

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.920
accidents, strokes, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.210
It is estimated that if every person in the
United States received a flu shot, it would

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.510
cost approximately $4.8 billion and would
save approximately 3,200 lives each year on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.640
top of what are already saved today at current
vaccination levels, all while preventing around

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.200
a whopping 100,000 hospitalizations.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.020
As with everything, there’s a trade-off,
however; this is, in part, where some of the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.910
controversy starts to creep in.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.620
In this case, if everyone were vaccinated,
around a total of 320-640 people each year

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.660
would hospitalized, suffer a life threatening
illness, be permanently disabled or die as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.040
a result of the vaccine.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.890
On top of that, around 3.2 million per year
of the total 320 million could potentially

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.220
have an immune reaction causing flu-like symptoms,
although more minor than the actual flu itself

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.370
and the hard number on this latter point is
somewhat up for debate.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.830
(It may actually be smaller, which we’ll
get into later.)

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.900
To better understand these numbers and the
controversy surrounding them, let’s look

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.630
at what the flu is, why the flu vaccine doesn’t
always seem to work, and the problems associated

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.440
with creating vaccines to fight this particular
deliverer-of-death.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.230
The influenza virus is a member of the virus
family Orthomyxoviridae and comes in four

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.130
broad flavors- Type A, B, C and D. The flu
vaccine is designed to protect you from A,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.340
B, and C. Type D will usually affect cattle
and hasn’t been shown to infect people.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.440
Type A and B are the two usually causing seasonal
epidemics, and they’re the two classes of

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.740
viruses the seasonal vaccine is designed to
protect you from.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.790
Type C will most likely cause mild respiratory
illnesses and aren’t thought to be a cause

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.790
of epidemics.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.050
Type A has two subtypes; they are differentiated
by the type of protein they have on the surface

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.000
of the virus, Hemagglutinin or Neuraminidase.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.970
Hemagglutinin also comes in 18 different varieties
and Neuraminidasse has 11; these are named

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.989
H1-18 and N1-11.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.640
Combined, these classes can make up strains.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.099
Influenza type A strains are H1N1 and H3N2.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:20.599
(In 2009, you might have been aware of the
specific H1N1 virus.

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.039
Prior to that year, H1N1 viruses circulating
around the populous caused their normal web-of-woe.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.029
Unfortunately, a new strain of H1N1 began
circulating causing worsened symptoms and

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.189
was the first known flu pandemic in about
four decades.)

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.949
Type B viruses are characterized by lineage,
depending on the type of antibody they produce-

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.780
Type B/Yamagata and type B/Victoria.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.831
The annual flu vaccine will attempt to give
you immunity from both H1N1 and H3N2 type

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:56.469
A viruses, and either 1 or 2 of the type B.
As previously alluded to, no current seasonal

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.120
vaccine attempts to prevent type C.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.560
This brings us to why flu vaccinations don’t
always work.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.580
Due to the extremely large number of specific
flu viruses, and the complexities in figuring

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.879
out which ones are circulating, it’s nearly
impossible to create a vaccine that will protect

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.490
everyone from every type of virus.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.710
Instead, scientists will create annual flu
vaccines depending on the most likely type

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.690
of flu that will be circulating that year.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.310
How do they figure out which flu virus is
more likely to be circulating?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.259
There are over 100 countries that have national
influenza centers conducting year-round surveillance

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.259
for flu.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.120
They send their results to five main World
Health Organization research centers in Atlanta,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.900
London, Melbourne, Tokyo, and Beijing.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.490
Two times per year (in February for the Northern
Hemisphere and September for the Southern)

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.199
representatives from each research center
meet up and review the results of studies

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.630
looking at surveillance issues, laboratory
results and clinical studies.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.259
They also asses the availability of vaccine
viruses.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.689
After analyzing all the data, they make recommendations
for the composition of the next flu vaccine.

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.919
Based on those recommendations, each individual
country decides on the specific composition

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.089
of the viruses included in their vaccines.

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.250
(In the United States, the FDA makes the final
decision on vaccines to be sold in the U.S.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.479
and the CDC collects data from five sites
across the country to assess how well the

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.479
vaccine is working.)

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:20.080
There are two main types of flu vaccines,
Trivalent and quadrivalent.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.930
The former is so-named “Tri” because it
protects you from three types of the flu-

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.680
type A H1N1 and H3N2, and one of the B viruses;
it could be either one.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.069
As for the latter quadrivalent, it simply
adds the second type of B antigen to the mix.

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:42.900
(For reference, of the estimated 157-168 million
doses of vaccine available for the 2016-2017

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.080
flu season in the United States, about 96
million were quadrivalent.)

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.409
The two types of vaccines are made in one
of three ways.

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.389
Most use egg based manufacturing processes-
they inject viruses into fertilized hen’s

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.669
eggs and allow them to incubate for several
days.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.309
The viruses are then removed, killed, and
the antigens purified.

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.020
That concoction is now a flu vaccine.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.440
More recently, the FDA has allowed these viruses
to be just severely weakened, instead of killed.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.139
This allows for the vaccine to be produced
as a nasal spray instead of injected.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:21.050
(However, for the 2016-2017 flu season the
CDC issued a recommendation that this latter

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.779
form of flu vaccination not be used owing
to data showing it to be significantly less

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:33.550
effective compared to other forms of flu vaccines
between 2013-2016, and non-effective altogether

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.240
during the 2015-2016 flu season.)

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.461
Cell based vaccines use pretty much the same
process as the egg based manufacturing, except

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.750
mammalian cells are called on to incubate
the virus instead of eggs.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.190
The third method uses recombinant technology.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.300
In a nutshell, they take the protein on the
surface of the virus and combine it with portions

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.159
of other viruses that grow well inside insect
cells.

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.539
Allowed to multiply inside the insect cells,
the proteins from the original virus are harvested

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.209
and purified for release as a vaccine.

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:11.229
No matter which method used, outside of potentially
the relatively rarely administered nasal spray

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:14.639
version, the vaccine will give you some level
of protection against the flu.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:21.650
With that background out of the way, we’ll
now address the question of the hour- Can

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.539
the flu vaccine give you the flu?

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:28.419
As you might have guessed already given our
description of how flu vaccines are made,

00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:35.600
the answer is unequivocally no- you’re not
going to get the flu from the flu vaccine.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.400
Beyond the process itself being perfected,
extensive testing is done on the vaccine batches

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.750
themselves to ensure no viable virus ever
runs the gauntlet and finds its way into the

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.130
solution injected into you.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:54.640
This fact is also backed up by countless studies
looking at those who receive flu vaccines.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:03.850
So why are so many convinced that the flu
vaccine can give you the flu?

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.830
As previously noted, the flu vaccine can,
and commonly does, give you symptoms caused

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.980
by an immune response.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.590
(An immune response is what you’re hoping
for in the first place.)

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.730
That stimulation can come with its own side
effects.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.460
For instance, people may experience soreness,
swelling around the injection site, muscle

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.850
and joint pain, hives, rash, headache, nausea,
general feelings of weakness, etc. from the

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.890
flu vaccine.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.610
If this sounds eerily like the symptoms the
flu gives you, you’re correct.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.560
Usually, however, even if such a reaction
does take place, it is generally much less

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.280
severe than the actual flu itself.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.140
For reference here, in 2015, 86-92% of people
who received the flu vaccine reported redness

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.010
around the injection site; 50-59% said they
had swelling; and 33-45% said itching was

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.010
also a problem.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:55.140
Beyond the injection site, 9-15 % say they
felt generally ill after getting the shot,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.220
while 10-13% said a headache also occurred.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.490
That said, particularly these latter numbers
need taken with a grain of salt.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.420
As the CDC points out, a portion of them appear
to fall in line with the chance of becoming

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.210
sick from every day things we come across
at any given point, like other viruses, bacteria,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.210
fungi, etc.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.396
So, for example, said individual may get infected
by one of the couple hundred or so viruses

00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:18.700
that cause the “common cold” around the
time they get the flu vaccine, and go on to

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.770
think that the vaccine gave them the flu or
flu-like symptoms.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.210
In fact, in one study with a sample size of
about two thousand people, half were given

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.870
a saline shot (salt-water) and half actual
flu vaccines, with the result being the two

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.070
groups reporting almost identical subsequent
symptoms, with the exception being that those

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.380
given the actual flu shots had more soreness
near the injection site- the important thing

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.110
for the discussion at hand being that those
who reported “flu-like” symptoms (and

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.750
all other excepting arm soreness) after getting
the shot did so just as frequently whether

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.890
they got the saline solution or flu vaccine.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.600
Needless to say, it’s difficult to determine
precisely how many people who report flu-like

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.810
symptoms after receiving the flu vaccine have
such symptoms because of the vaccine- correlation

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.710
does not equal causation, no matter how much
our brains seem pre-wired to think so.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.681
No matter what the precise numbers really
are- a very small percentage of people are

00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:12.770
generally thought to have a reaction to the
flu shot that more or less feels to them like

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.590
the flu, perhaps leading someone to think
they got the flu from the flu shot, even though

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.590
they have not.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.230
In another scenario, similar to when acquiring
a virus that gives you the “common cold”

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.510
around the time of receiving the flu shot,
someone might legitimately get the flu directly

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.620
before or after getting the flu shot.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.310
In this case, however, it wasn’t the shot
that gave them the flu; they either just acquired

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.640
the live, full strength virus before their
immune system had a chance to work its magic

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.160
on the vaccine (which takes about two weeks)
or they acquired a strain of the virus the

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.670
vaccine didn’t help with.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.780
These factors combined have led to the widespread
idea that the flu vaccine can cause a person

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:52.200
to get the flu, despite a significant amount
of scientifically vetted evidence to the contrary.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.330
Again, it’s always good to keep in mind
that correlation does not equal causation.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.390
And after forming such opinions, this is one
of many times when one might need to fight

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.500
a bit against the brain’s natural tendency
towards confirmation bias and just look at

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.680
what the significant amount of hard data says
instead.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.820
This may all have you wondering how the flu
vaccine protects you from the flu at all given

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.790
in the vast majority of cases you’re having
dead viruses injected.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.630
In a nutshell, vaccines work because they
trick your immune system into thinking there

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.100
is a live virus present in the body.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.140
As for the much more interesting nitty gritty
details, your adaptive immune system has two

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.250
types of cells, B and T cells, that seek out
and destroy these viruses.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:40.060
B cells produce unique protein molecules (antibodies)
that attach to receptor sites of antigens

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.910
(in this case the flu vaccine).

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.320
Once attached, they act like a red flag for
T cells to recognize.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.450
Once identified, your immune system will immediately
begin creating large numbers of identical

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.520
cells to circulate throughout your body.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.920
They mobilize like a defending army and attempt
to vanquish the enemy.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.680
Should your immune-infantry succeed, memory
B and T cells will hang around for a while

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.080
in case the same invader shows up later.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.150
It’s these memory B and T cells that the
vaccine is attempting to create within your

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.150
body.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.780
If you get vaccinated and your body creates
its memory B and T cells, when the actual

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:17.010
flu rears its ugly head, you have the adaptive
immunity to prevent the virus from being able

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.381
to replicate and spread throughout your body.

00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:22.320
Once you’re injected with a vaccine, as
previously mentioned, it’ll usually take

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.470
about two weeks for your immune system to
work its magic and create the antibodies necessary

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.040
to fight off a future flu attack.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.450
With the peak of flu season between December
and February (see Why Do People Seem to Get

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.860
Sick More in the Winter), you want to get
the vaccine in the early fall, giving your

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.200
immune system enough time to mobilize before
you’re potentially exposed.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.600
This brings us around to the question of how
effective flu vaccines actually are.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.650
This varies considerably from year to year
based on how well matched a given year’s

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:55.140
vaccine is for the strains of virus circulating,
but according the CDC, from 2004-2015, the

00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:02.730
flu vaccine was effective 61% of the time
against H1N1 and 33% effective against H3N2.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.750
Against type B, they were 54% effective.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.580
(It should also be noted that even if not
fully effective, the symptoms a vaccinated

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.810
person experiences may be somewhat less severe
than those who are not vaccinated.)

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.400
This said, as you now know, there are many
types of influenza viruses.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.220
The symptoms they cause are wide-ranging,
from mild to deadly.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.300
Some people seek treatment for their symptoms,
and many more do not.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.650
Many other types of illnesses can cause similar
symptoms, leading many to say they have the

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.810
flu when they, in fact, do not.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.420
Combined with the fact that to specifically
diagnose the flu you need to have your blood

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.020
drawn and a lab confirm it was the flu that
caused your symptoms, it can be extremely

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.850
difficult for researchers to nail down the
exact numbers of those affected, which is

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.900
why quoted numbers can, in some cases, vary
a bit from study to study.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.740
This caveat noted, as previously alluded to,
the general consensus is that the flu causes

00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:01.790
between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths and 200,000
hospitalizations per year in the United States

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.790
alone.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.080
The flu vaccine is currently the best weapon
doctors have of preventing its spread, and

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.660
its symptoms-of-suffering.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.640
The biggest concern for opponents of the flu
vaccine is whether it should be recommended

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640
for everyone.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.810
(Many companies, mostly in the health industry,
even require it as a condition of employment.)

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:23.570
Whatever side of the argument one is on, few
would dispute that the flu vaccine isn’t

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.200
as effective as we humans would like.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.850
Generally speaking, as previously mentioned,
getting a flu vaccine is close to a coin flip

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.090
in preventing you from getting the flu.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.890
And unfortunately, those who it’s most intended
to protect- those over 65 and children under

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.520
2- seem to get the least protection from it.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.670
In fact, surprisingly, one of the largest
studies performed on flu vaccine effectiveness

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.460
by age group in the United States, published
in the Journal of Infectious Disease in May

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:53.370
of 2015, Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in
the United States During 2012–2013: Variable

00:15:53.370 --> 00:16:00.529
Protection by Age and Virus Type, showed almost
no effectiveness for those over 65.

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:05.220
(However, there is some evidence that newer
high-dose flu vaccines may lead to a stronger

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.910
immune response in the elderly, potentially
changing the numbers a bit, with further research

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.110
needed.)

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.300
As for healthy adults and older children,
they see the most benefit from the vaccine.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.700
Ironically, they’re also the least likely
to have serious medical complications from

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.080
getting the flu to begin with.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.860
So why is it recommended that these individuals
get the flu vaccine at all then?

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.971
Because, even given all this, studies have
shown that for every 4000 people vaccinated

00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:33.110
against the flu, one person’s life will
be saved.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:38.060
The CDC also points out that herd immunity
helps prevent the flu’s widespread transmission.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.810
Essentially, if enough people get the vaccine,
there will be a large portion of the populous

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.730
that are immune to given strains; so when
the flu does start to spread, there will be

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.550
less of a chance of it affecting the population
at large.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.850
So those elderly who it would appear the vaccine
isn’t particularly effective for will at

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.660
least get some level of protection via being
less likely to encounter the flu if most everyone

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.970
around them is vaccinated against the projected
major strains of the virus in a given year.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.299
Given this, how are there still any real opponents
to flu vaccination?

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:10.549
Beyond those using faulty data and/or questionable
logic, or just being generally anti-vaccine

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:14.669
regardless of what any data says, there are
some who have more legitimate concerns.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:18.650
While you may not get the flu from the flu
vaccine, we said near the beginning of this

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:24.500
article that some people die from getting
the flu shot- a much worse prospect altogether.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.209
So what’s going on here?

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:30.740
Like any immune response, there are those
who can have an over-reaction to the flu vaccine.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:36.429
Although extremely rare, the CDC states serious
reactions- those defined as causing hospitalization,

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:40.950
life threatening illness, permanent disability
or death- occur in 1-2 people for every 1

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.980
million vaccinated.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.700
Yes, an almost literal case of “a one in
a million shot.”

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.700
In the words of Lloyd Christmas from Dumb
and Dumber, “So your telling me there’s

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.700
a chance?!?!”

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.730
Another condition, known as Guillain-Barré
syndrome occurs in about 1 person per million

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.730
vaccinated.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.340
This condition is where your immune system
attacks your nerves leaving you with symptoms

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.519
ranging from tingling and numbness and can
lead to overall paralysis.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:02.961
(This said, a 2009 study in China looking
at the administration of over 100 million

00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:08.369
doses of flu vaccine found only 0.1 cases
of Guillain-Barré per million, which was

00:18:08.369 --> 00:18:12.909
oddly lower, not higher, than what would be
expected of the general population who weren’t

00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:13.909
vaccinated.)

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:17.039
Nevertheless, this is still widely cited as
an exceptionally rare serious side effect

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:21.549
of widespread use of flu vaccines, even though
recent studies are beginning to cast some

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:22.630
doubt on this notion.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.159
If you’re starting to get a good picture
on why getting a flu shot is such a hot topic,

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:30.960
despite it being a net positive to society
as a whole, there’s actually more wood to

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.299
throw on the fire.

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:37.019
Some studies show that repeated vaccinations
will reduce vaccine effectiveness later on.

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:41.519
So- get vaccinated now when you’re healthy
and in your prime, potentially helping young

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:46.659
children and the elderly in the process, if
not yourself, and you could have less effectiveness

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:50.210
as you age and start to really need the help
from the vaccine.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.379
It should be noted though that there is more
research that needs done here, as there are

00:18:54.379 --> 00:18:58.860
also studies using valid methodology that
don’t seem to show these results.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.529
(Again, going back to how difficult it is
to nail down precise numbers here without

00:19:02.529 --> 00:19:07.360
very expensive studies with massive sample-sizes
or just a huge number of studies being done

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.399
looking at something.)

00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:12.559
So the question of repeated dosing is still
up in the air and in need of further research.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:16.770
Nevertheless, opponents of the flu vaccine
posit that since over half of the time the

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.559
effectiveness of the vaccine is less than
50% it may not be worth it to take even a

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:25.759
one in a million chance of being a person
who has a severe reaction.

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:29.690
On top of that, there are the potential minor
reactions so many can have from the vaccine

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.840
itself, when a given person may have never
become infected with the flu anyway, even

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.710
had they not been vaccinated- essentially
causing them pain and discomfort for no net

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.710
benefit to themselves.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.799
For these reasons, opponents of the flu vaccine
sometimes note that it is inappropriate for

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:49.600
any governmental organization to recommend
or require its citizens to get a flu vaccine.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.220
On the other side of the argument, proponents
of the flu vaccine point out that, aside from

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.690
washing your hands and covering your mouth
when you cough, vaccination is the best way

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.360
we have at preventing the massive number of
hospitalizations and deaths that occur each

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.720
year as a result of the flu- and that’s
with us already benefiting from a level of

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.350
herd immunity from current vaccination levels.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.049
In the extreme case of getting rid of flu
vaccinations altogether, as some anti-vaccers

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:18.820
propose, the problem would be much worse-
in the worst case scenario perhaps even someday

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:25.330
resembling such historic incidents as the
1918 flu pandemic when about 1 in 20 people

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:32.190
(yep) on planet Earth died as a result of
said flu outbreak (a strain of H1N1 influenza),

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.120
with about 1 in 4 of the human population
contracting the virus.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.049
(This pandemic was so severe that another
one that struck around the same time went

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:45.419
largely unnoticed by the wider world despite
killing a whopping 1 million people and affecting

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:49.610
countless others, including leaving many trapped
inside their own bodies, without the will

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.139
to speak or move.

00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:55.119
Just as quickly as the disease appeared, it
suddenly seemed to disappear, leaving the

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.860
medical world completely stumped.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.070
It was only about a decade ago that researchers
finally uncovered what seems to have caused

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.840
the problem- a disease that’s actually still
around today- a rare form of streptococcus-

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.650
and whose symptoms start with a simple sore
throat.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.970
For you hypochondriacs out there, try not
to dwell on that one the next time you get

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:13.970
strep-throat.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.889
For more on all this, see our article The
Mysterious Encephalitis Lethargica Epidemic.)

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:24.309
In the end, even given current flu vaccines’
less than ideal effectiveness rates, the reason

00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:29.242
so many health organizations recommend everyone
within certain age groups get the flu vaccine

00:21:29.242 --> 00:21:35.059
every year is that we as a society have the
ability to relatively cheaply save many thousands

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:39.999
of additional lives per year world wide on
top of what is already saved via widespread

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:41.110
flu vaccination.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.659
The main cost here is a significantly smaller
number potentially having serious reactions

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:52.889
and the rest merely suffering a mild inconvenience
or no issues at all as a result of the vaccine-

00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:57.289
thus, in the vast majority of cases a tiny
price to pay for saving so many people’s

00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:58.340
lives every year.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.909
Of course, opponents of flu vaccines argue
that those precious handful pay the ultimate

00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:07.619
price in saving the lives of a much greater
number each year- like the lotto, it probably

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:08.619
won’t be you that “wins,” but somebody
will.

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:09.650
Someday, the occasional heroes that are the
beaker-geeks of the world might be able to

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.650
create a universal flu vaccine to prevent
all types of influenza viruses from causing

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.650
their meshwork of mayhem- perhaps not long
after even ridding the world of this occasional

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.650
plague of humanity altogether, as humanity
has done with smallpox.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.650
Until that day, there will undoubtedly be
controversy surrounding the flu vaccine, particularly

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.650
when mandatory flu vaccination programs are
occasionally pushed.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.650
Before you decide to take the plunge on one
side or the other, make sure you talk to your

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:16.650
doctor and get the specifics of your situation-
some may have good reason not to get such

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.650
a vaccine, such as those already immunocompromised
from illness or disease.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.650
But for most everyone else, it might hurt
a little to receive a flu vaccine, but it

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:19.650
also should help- if not you, perhaps an individual
of the particularly youthful or elderly persuasion

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.650
you care about.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.650
It’s been theorized that the eradication
of smallpox and the rapid rise of HIV around

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.650
the same time was no coincidence.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:23.650
Both HIV and smallpox exploit the same receptor
(CCR5) and, interestingly enough, the vaccine

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.559
for smallpox has been shown to provide some
protection against HIV as well.

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:32.039
Thus, when the masses suddenly stopped being
commonly vaccinated for smallpox, it made

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:48.890
it easier 
for HIV to spread.
