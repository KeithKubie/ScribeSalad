00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.002
- Hi, I'm Salman Khan,
founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.260
- And I'm Caroline Hu Flexer,
founder of Duck Duck Moose.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.719
- And we have a very
exciting announcement today.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.425
As you probably know, Khan
Academy is a not-for-profit

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:13.606
with a mission of a free
world-class education

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:14.975
for anyone anywhere.

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:17.064
And we've always viewed
core to our mission

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:18.771
of how do we, how do we meet the needs

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.400
of our youngest learners,
of kids in preschool

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.235
or who might be in kindergarten.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.144
And whenever we thought
about this in the past,

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:26.983
we always looked to Duck Duck Moose

00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:29.382
as really the best company out there.

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.557
I'm a father of young children,

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:33.435
and they, to some degree,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.218
grew up on these apps.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.241
And so it was very exciting
when Caroline and her team

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:42.088
reached out to us and
propose that we join forces.

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:44.482
- We're thrilled to be
joining Khan Academy.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.402
Duck Duck Moose is an indie
developer, and originally,

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:49.520
we started designing
apps for our own children

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.666
and now we have 21 early-learning apps.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.128
And we've always been a
mission-driven company

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.238
concerned about kids and education,

00:00:58.238 --> 00:00:59.506
trying to make the biggest impact,

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:02.009
and I think this is why
this is so exciting for us.

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.005
Being part of a larger nonprofit

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.020
where we can really make an impact

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.872
on kids all around the world.

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:11.375
- And you already have an
incredible suite of 21 apps

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.305
which now are going to be

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.188
- Free!

00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:15.751
- [Khan] Free. And really free.

00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.710
Not download and then try, truly free

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.456
because we want young
children all over the world

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:25.293
to be able to have
access to this learning.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.138
And as a reminder to you,

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:28.642
the only way we're able to do this

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.587
is with philanthropic support.

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:33.025
So, if you're a big
supporter of this vision,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.577
please think about donating.

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:37.170
So, as you can imagine,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.234
we're all very excited
that now Duck Duck Moose,

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:40.189
the Duck Duck Moose team,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.664
is now part of the
not-for-profit Khan Academy.

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:45.003
And keep a lookout for what's to come

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.273
because these 21 apps
are just the beginning.

00:01:48.273 --> 00:01:50.156
We have some fun plans ahead of us.

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:51.239
- Absolutely.
