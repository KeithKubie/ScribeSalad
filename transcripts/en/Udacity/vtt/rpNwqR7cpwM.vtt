00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:05.235
The domain, in this case a, b, and c, contains all the values that we can input

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.540
into the function and get defined output values. Those defined output values are

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.069
the range. So, the range only contains elements that we get from taking elements

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:20.077
of the domain and mapping them over using the function. So, the next function

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:26.874
takes in the value a, it processes it, and spits out 1. So, a gets mapped over

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:32.357
to a value of 1 in the range. That's one of our numbers. B similarly gets

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:37.758
matched to 4, and c gets matched to 5. Since none of the elements in the domain

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:42.507
map to either 2 or 3, those two numbers aren't in our range. I just listed them

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:45.984
here, so that we had, a collection of numbers to go off of and have some

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:46.583
contrast.
