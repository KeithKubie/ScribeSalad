00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And this is the correct one, tails comes up with probability 1 - p,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the difference between 0, the outcome, and the actual mean is p,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we have to square it for the variance.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So I take this expression away.
