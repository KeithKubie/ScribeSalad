00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.725
There is something called
the CIE Lab space.

00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:08.050
Sometime called Lab space but L a b
actually, where L is luminance, and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.320
then, as you change the a and the b,
you end up with different colors.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm going to use the work color now,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.300
instead of the more technical words
later which, which we'll use.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.770
So here, you have a luminance of 25%,
so it's kind of darker.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.050
And you see the greenish, reddish and
blueish things as you move around.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.334
And then the middle is kind of gray,
right?

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:30.255
And as this, as luminance gets brighter,
the middle gets brighter, and

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.260
you get these lighter
variations in color.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.520
And so
that's called the Lab color space.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.870
And the idea is that
you've got luminance, and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.070
you've got sort of how
saturated the color is.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.020
And actually, what the,
what we call the color, but

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.890
what is ty,
typically referred to as the hue.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.800
And that sometimes defined
you can think of the color

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.740
as a three-dimensional volume
of one sort or another, and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.260
you'll see there's a whole bunch
of ways of representing it.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.180
But the idea is that one way of thinking
about it is that down here is dark,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.640
up at the top is brighter.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.780
And as you move around this circle, so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.860
it goes through 360 and around again,
is what's referred to as the hue, okay?

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.600
And as you move outside,
things become purer in color, all right?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.120
So two systems that people use a lot
to talk about these things are called

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.690
sometimes hue saturation and lightness,
or sometimes hue saturation and value.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.390
There are all different
kinds of color spaces.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.810
These two can be drawn as sort
of these thick cylinders.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.390
So down here again at the bottom,
things are dark.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.100
Up at the top, things are light.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.370
In hue saturation and lightness,
the whole top is white, which I think by

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.570
the way is an awful representation,
I'll tell you why in a second.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.440
Down the whole thing in
the bottom is all black.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.670
And as you go around,
you'd get different colors.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.450
That's what you can see around here,
different hues.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.180
And as you go from the middle to the
edge, you get more and more saturated.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.650
So in the middle, everything is gray.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.365
It goes from black to white through gray
