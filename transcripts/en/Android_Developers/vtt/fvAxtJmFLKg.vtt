ROMAN NURIK: Hello and welcome,
once again, to

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.690
Android Design in Action.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.474
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.675
NICK BUTCHER: And hi, my
name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.090
ROMAN NURIK: And today we have
a special episode where we're

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.380
going to talk about--

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.430
actually, we're going to dive
into one of the apps that was

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.140
previously covered in the
GDG App Clinic Oslo.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.880
In Norway, for those
of you that aren't

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.630
very good with geography.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.910
And then we're going to dive
into some details on design

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.320
consistency, specifically
talking about when you should

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.080
think about your brand versus
Holo and Android design

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.190
principles and when
those meet.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.890
So with that.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.140
Let's get started.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.740
So we're going to be talking
about one app today.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.740
I'm probably not going
to pronounce it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.850
right, but it's Finn.no.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.990
It's kind of like a market-type
app, almost like

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.750
an eBay, I'd say.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.440
And, again, everything was in
Norwegian, so I wasn't able to

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.610
fully grasp the full
extent of the app.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.140
But it is like a market-type
app that lets you look at

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.250
products, find products.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.550
It's got a very deep
hierarchy.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.260
It's got a very deep hierarchy,
so there are lots

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.950
of different parts of the app,
which we'll talk about.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.020
But yeah, let's just dive in.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.070
So here's one of the
first screens that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.200
you'll see in the app.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.510
You'll notice that it's kind
of like an intro screen.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.340
It's very nice that it kind of
introduces you to the main

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.480
character, the main, I guess,
spokesperson for this company,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.080
this kind of cute
cat character.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.300
And then you immediately jump
into content, which is nice.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.830
There's no heavy introduction
screen.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.590
There's no dashboard pad.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.100
You immediately get content.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.720
And this primary content area
is all about posts that this

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.030
company releases, I believe.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.460
And then for each post
there's listings

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.699
associated with those.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.310
So you'll see here that there's
this one post that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.090
talks about something that's
on the market right now.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.500
I believe it's a property
for sale, or for rent.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.810
And then there's another about
wedding dresses or

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.600
something like that.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.250
So there's a couple of other
details in the app which we'll

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.070
talk about throughout.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.420
But we also wanted to talk about
some of the things that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.460
we decided to change, some of
the things that we've decided

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.870
to tweak around with.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.680
So the first is, you'll
notice that there's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.400
this kind of top bar.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.750
It's not really an action bar.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020
It has the logo in the middle,
whereas the action bar usually

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.220
has the logo on the left.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.000
And it has affordances
for Search.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.350
Search as well as filter.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.890
And then Login, which
is in the right.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.040
There's also a couple other
things you'll see here.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.620
For each one of these posts,
you can actually click this

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.960
button here to take you to all
the listings related to that

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.270
post, versus if there's
only one item, you'll

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.430
just see one here.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.020
There's no arrow there.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.770
So we found that a little bit
confusing that there were two

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.810
different states, two different
places that this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.480
touch area could lead you to.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.065
Either just the single listing
or the full set of listings.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.260
OK, so let's see what
we did with this.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.190
Actually, before we
do that, Nick, do

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.510
you have any thoughts?

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.721
Anything to share?

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:37.620
NICK BUTCHER: No, overall it's a
quite clean and flat design,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.910
which is very modern
and nice looking.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.550
But there's just a few things
which kind of didn't quite sit

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.190
right for me and the
Android pattern.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.012
So let's see what we've
done with this screen.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:50.670
ROMAN NURIK: So the first thing
we did was we added a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.746
proper action bar.

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:54.160
Actually, I'll just
zoom in here.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.090
We added a proper action bar.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.740
We also added a navigation
drawer, which we'll talk about

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.380
in just a second.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.580
But we also tweaked a
lot of the metrics.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.110
And that's one of the things
that I definitely tend to harp

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.580
on when I look at
apps is metrics.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.190
Spacing, font sizes, margins,
paddings, things like that.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.760
You'll notice that in the
original, the text, I guess

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.300
the titles are kind of cramped
with the image to the left.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.709
And then the font sizes
vary throughout.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.360
So one of the things that we did
was we standardized some

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.800
of the font sizes as well
as some of the margins.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.500
We used a standard
16 dip base grid.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.460
We have 16 dip margins
throughout.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.750
We use 8 dip in some places.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.040
But you'll notice that's just a
little more properly spaced

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.260
out, in my opinion.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.160
We also obviously did some
tweaks here in terms of rather

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.420
than using these card-style
boxes to hold a single post

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.890
with its associated listings,
we kind of used this, almost

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.750
like a section header styling,
where you have a grey

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.990
background for the post itself,
the text of the post,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.510
or the comment, I guess.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.750
And then each of the items,
which is really the thing you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.730
want to pop the most, has a
slightly different styling, a

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.830
lighter background.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.010
We also, in the action bar, we
moved search into its proper

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.120
position at the top right.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.560
We left the overflow for things
like my profile, which

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.630
is something that was given a
lot of prominence here, but we

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.510
decided to relegate it to the
overflow, since that's kind of

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.500
a very common place to put it.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.011
And then we added the navigation
drawer, which we'll

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:30.960
show in a second.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.610
Before we move on to the next
screen, Nick, any comments?

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.880
NICK BUTCHER: I was going to
say, I'm a particularly big

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.830
fan of the typography.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.530
I find screens which have a
large range of different type

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.230
sizes on them, can
feel messy to me.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.340
It's almost like people trying
to hard the communicate the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.570
information hierarchy, and it
ends up just getting a little

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.510
bit confused.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.340
I think you've done a really
nice job here of cleaning up

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.510
the typographic palette here.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.290
So using typographic fewer type
sizes, but using font,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.070
weight, and color, instead, to
communicate what is important.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.560
And what is and less important
right now.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.430
So I think that's a
really nice job.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.050
Also we like the profile photos
with the dotted lines.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.030
I think that works really,
really well to communicate

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.498
that the entry, the white
background post is a child of

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.520
the announcement post.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.750
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and the
profile photos are very small

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.630
in the current version.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.230
It's definitely something that,
when possible, when you

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.060
have imagery, when you have high
resolution photos, things

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.380
like that, you should definitely
try to use them as

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.070
much as possible.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.220
Give them more space than
you normally may.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.590
So definitely consider using
larger images where possible.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.570
NICK BUTCHER: I think that's
one of my take aways from

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.190
Google I/O this year from
Alex Faaborg's talk

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.090
on cognitive science.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.365
That you have a special part of
your brain which is great

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:50.370
at parsing photos, pictures of
people, and recognizing them

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.850
almost instantaneously per page
rather than having to

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.350
scan through and read
names and so on.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.170
So maybe not with a cat photo,
but if this is going to be a

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.780
person, then making
the most of those

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.352
images is a good thing.

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:03.280
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.340
So let's move on to the next
screen which is the--

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.800
Actually, this is just
another example.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.630
As you scroll down, you would
obviously see more items.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.250
And you'd have the overflow,
which would contain my profile

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.670
settings, help, about,
the standard stuff

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.240
that you'd put there.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.320
NICK BUTCHER: It's worth
recapping here, as well, the

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.760
rules we tend to think about for
when things should be in

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.800
action, which is immediately
available on the action bar,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.000
or when things should
get demoted.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.160
Take something like my
profile is going

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.250
to be uncommon action.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.290
You're not going to be clicking
into that many times.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.160
So that probably should always
go into the action overflow,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.040
similar to how help and settings
and about would

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.620
always go in the action overflow
as uncommon actions.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.715
You wouldn't want to promote
this to an action item, even

00:07:44.715 --> 00:07:47.900
if there was space on a larger
device, because it's not a

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.530
common action.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.570
ROMAN NURIK: Another thing I
wanted to mention is that if

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.060
you want to encourage the user
to log in to create an account

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.400
for your app, using the overflow
for that is probably

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.840
not a good idea.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.900
You're probably not going to get
too much engagement there.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.590
But what you could
do is have like a

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.840
butter bar, or something.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.330
Like a dismissible butter bar
show up along the bottom of

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.320
the screen that says, hey, if
you log in, you get this and

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.710
this value.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.340
You just kind immediately
explain the benefits, rather

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.690
than showing an icon always
available on screen.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.780
Just make it contextual.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.500
If you wanted the user to login
or register, make sure

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.040
that they see a nice, big
prominent bar that they can

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.730
also dismiss if they don't
really want to login.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.230
So let's move on to the next.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.630
Actually, this is the
scroll down version.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.520
Notice that rather than having
this extra arrow here to show

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.480
all the listings, we just have
like an all listings item at

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.340
the very bottom.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.710
So you'd show maybe three or
four items as kind of a

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.690
summary of the post.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.000
And then at the bottom,
you'd touch all

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.610
listings to take you there.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.280
So let's look at the drawer.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.340
So you have right now, if you
touch that top left search

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.630
icon, you get this, I guess it's
kind of like a navigation

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.340
drawer to the left.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.620
It shows you the list of
categories, as well as a list

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.470
of recent searches along
with search itself.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.900
So Search is kind part
of this bar.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.370
And it makes sense in terms
of proximity, right?

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.770
The search bar is right next
to the recent searches.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.850
However, it's somewhat of an
uncommon place for Search.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.130
Users really expect search
to be in the action bar

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.360
immediately available.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.050
Not two touches away, but
immediately one touch away.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.590
And it's not really violating
any strong semantic rules for

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.740
the navigation drawer.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.350
There aren't any actions here,
except for search.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.380
But it is kind of pushing
the content over,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.690
pushing the top bar over.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.555
And so, in terms of the
interaction itself, it's not

00:09:38.555 --> 00:09:39.860
really violating the guidelines,
but it's not

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.550
adhering to the guidelines
that we have set out.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.860
So what we decided to do is see
what this would look like

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.780
with a proper new navigation
drawer.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.810
So you have Home at the
top, which is kind of

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.090
your stream, per se.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.930
And then each of the
other things are

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.820
still represented there.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.170
We also added a couple of things
like section headers to

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.400
make sure that it's clear
what you're looking at.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.680
And, yeah, you could
do the same things.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.850
You can dismiss recent
searches.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.260
You can switch between different
categories and

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.050
things like that.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.370
But the core point here is
that since the action bar

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.210
doesn't slide out of the way,
Search is still accessible.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.455
Search is still an action
that's there

00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:20.390
in the action bar.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.040
Because it's globally
relevant, it's not

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.960
contextually relevant to the
screen that the navigation

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.480
drawer is hiding.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.700
So it's totally fine to leave
that action there when the

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.290
navigation drawer is exposed.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.070
OK, let's see.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.530
So what else did we do here?

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.380
So once you jump into, once you
actually perform a search.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.850
Let's say you press one of these
categories, or you click

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.420
on a recent search, you get
taken to this screen.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.320
Which again, has those
persistent top left and top

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.940
right, I guess drawers
available.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.730
And it also lets you sort.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.510
So the issue here is that
there isn't a concept of

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.230
really hierarchy.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.710
And you're kind of just at
another flat part of the app.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.670
You're just at another part of
the app that happens to be

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.230
search results.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.030
There's no quick way besides
pressing the back

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.660
button to get home.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.850
So what we did here was
we actually mirrored

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.090
a lot of the things--

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.850
we copied a lot of things
from the original

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.030
or the current app.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.810
We still have, obviously the
images on the left and the

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.630
metadata on the right.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.830
And, obviously, we did some
typographic treatments there.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.260
But we kept the navigation
drawer.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.870
I'll actually talk about
that in a second.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.110
And then we moved the common
actions of things like

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.910
filtering and sorting, which
we'll talk about in a second,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.720
into the action bar in
their normal place.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.110
Now, in terms of the navigation
drawer, some folks

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.650
may think, oh why isn't there
an Up button here?

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.410
And the reason for, and this
is kind of contentious.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.600
You could probably go
either way on it.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.970
My thinking here was that since
these recent searches

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.750
are represented in the
navigation drawer--

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.740
so they're here, right, pizza
or wearing dresses.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.660
Since they're represented there,
those screens that you

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.090
get taken to when you press
those should appear in the

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.910
navigation drawer.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.650
Or should have the navigation
drawer affordance.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.310
And this is in accordance
with the guidelines

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.350
that we have set out.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.160
So if you touch something in the
navigation drawer and you

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.340
get taken to a new screen, that
screen should have access

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.870
to the same navigation drawer.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.970
So you could probably
go either way.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.610
And a lot of folks think that
on search screens you should

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.420
have an Up button.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.040
And I guess this is just
one way to do it.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.080
And then also you have access
to the refined search.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.990
So if you actually want to
filter further, you could

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.520
touch it up there.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.090
And then everything else
on this screen.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.920
Nick, before we move
on, any comments?

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.900
NICK BUTCHER: No, just a few
comments on the visual design.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.520
I think you've done a nice job
of tightening up the visual

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.280
design on this.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.070
I think, especially treatment of
the images, and having them

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.730
basically flush with the side
and the below items works

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.420
really, really well.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.390
So basically you're using as
much space as you can to show

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.560
rich imagery, which is much
quicker to scan than a textual

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:05.840
description.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.520
So I think that's really, really
nice how you've given

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.470
that room to show off.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.480
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.430
OK, so let's look at a
couple details here.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.390
The first is that, if you touch
the recent search, like

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.400
wedding dresses, that could
be populated in the top.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.990
So that could effectively
be an editable title.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.010
And if you move on here,
so you'll notice that

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.250
sort is a sub menu.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.750
So when you touch the Sort icon,
you get a list of sort

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.810
options like relevance, price,
or availability.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.330
These should actually have radio
buttons next to them.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.400
That's a design issue.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.790
Kind of like a bug there.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.490
These should have radio buttons
showing what the

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.800
current sort is as well.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.690
And then the most interesting
part of this,

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.130
I'd say, is the filtering.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.550
So actually I lied a bit.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.140
When you touch on, let me see
if I can go back here.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:02.480
When you touch here, you
actually don't get immediately

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.820
taken to the results screen.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.230
You get taken to a filter
interstitial first.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.530
So you actually get taken
to, wow, let me see if

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.980
I can get to it.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.860
You actually get taken
here first.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.180
So as soon as you touch a
category, you get taken to a

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.150
filter screen, which then you
can obviously modify.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.130
And then once you choose the
right filters, you can swipe

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.560
over to see the results.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.750
So instead of having another
left pane, what we

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.090
decided to do was--

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.610
filtering is really
like an action.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.810
It's the act of filtering your
current set of results.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.070
So what we decided to do is move
this over to the right as

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.650
a right drawer.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.240
As something that's on the
right-hand side like a filter.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.440
Or you could do something like
layer selection if you're

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.870
looking at a map, or something
like that.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.880
So we move the filtering
to the right.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.390
You'll notice that it's
not just a drawer.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.200
It's not just a drawer, it's
actually also available as an

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.420
action button.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.220
So if you touch the filter icon
there, it actually should

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.390
expand and collapse
the filter pane.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.040
This is very similar to how
Google+ or Google One Today do

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.540
notifications.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.640
So the idea here is that
instead of being taken

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.710
directly to the search results,
you could actually

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.680
take the user to the search
results screen, but

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.590
immediately expose the
right-hand filter drawer.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.740
And then once they make the
selections, you could just

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.632
swipe it out of the way.

00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:23.160
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.030
it's like the idea of changing
the content of the navigation

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.940
drawer, I'm not a huge fan of.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.210
It's such an important facility
to be able to

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.810
navigate around the
application.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.440
The idea of having these
different modes in which

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.010
you're in, that lack of
stability, almost.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.480
I'm not a huge fan of it.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.980
So I think it's much cleaner.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.800
And also the fact
that filtering

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.680
tends to be an action.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.940
It's not really navigation.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.560
It's kind of acting upon
the data you've

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.180
already navigated to.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.565
It definitely maps to an action,
and therefore, like

00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:54.773
the right-hand side of the
action in Androids models, so.

00:15:54.773 --> 00:15:55.720
I think this is much better.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.000
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.760
You'll notice here that there's
kind of an Up button

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.220
or a Back button inside of
the navigation drawer.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.250
Anytime you see that, definitely
try to avoid that.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.770
The only type of hierarchy you
should have within the drawer

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.850
is collapsible sections.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.480
So you can have some kind
of a collapsible

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.400
item within the drawer.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.960
But definitely if you have
different entire contexts

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.786
within the drawer, that's
something that you

00:16:17.786 --> 00:16:20.430
should try to avoid.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.370
I think there may have
been-- no, that's it.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:28.620
So that was the entire type of
redesign we did for this app.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.280
Now before we move on, I just
want to say, the app itself is

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.250
designed very well.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.670
It performs really quickly.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.700
The image loading
is very good.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.900
It's a very, very solid app.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.440
And this is also a beta, so
it's not quite out yet.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.230
It's a great app.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.300
You should definitely
check it out.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.490
But these are some of the ways
in which we improve the

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.610
navigation as well as separate
out the concept of navigation

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.380
from actions such as filter.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.603
With that should we move on to
design consistency, Nick?

00:16:55.603 --> 00:16:57.000
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, let's.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.895
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:16:57.895 --> 00:17:00.430
NICK BUTCHER: So this is a topic
that we've been chewing

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.460
on for a little while.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.910
And I think it's something that
lot of people struggle

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.750
with out there.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.230
And understanding how do you
design with Android, how do

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.950
you have that consistent with
the rest of your brand and

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.730
applications and so
on out there.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.530
So when we talk about
consistency, there's a few

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.000
dimensions we want to really
define and really dig into.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.319
The first one is that
cross platform.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.460
So obviously there's a bunch of
different OS platforms out

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.270
there which you, your
application and your service,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.270
whatever it might be, probably
wants to be present on.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.350
So there's got to be an element
of consistency so

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.390
users know how to use your
application across these.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.550
The next dimension
we think about is

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.960
your branding, really.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.960
So even if you're running on all
these different platforms,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.540
you want to be recognizable as
the same service, and how do

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.850
you achieve that?

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.440
And the next dimension that you
think about, so when we're

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.820
talking specifically about
Android, Android obviously has

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.726
its own look and feel, its own
interaction patterns and so

00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:00.880
forth, kind of wrapped up in the
Holo design language and

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.300
the Android design patterns.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.530
So how do you reconcile being
consistent with that?

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.320
So there's a lot of confusion
and choice out there.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.220
So to tackle those, we break
it down into three design

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.440
disciplines.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.350
We're going to talk individually
about your

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.810
information design, your
interaction design, and your

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.330
visual design.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.250
And how to be consistent
with those.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.920
So the first step, the
information design.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.190
Android or the Holographic, the
Holo design, which really

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.700
isn't going to dictate to you
or tell you anything here.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.970
There's nothing stopping
you from using the same

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.290
information architecture that
you used, say, if you already

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.130
have a web property or
a different platform.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.560
This is all down to
your application.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.930
I think this just comes down to
good design, where you want

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.290
to sit down and map out what the
base entities are in the

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.290
information architecture
of your application.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.220
But Android isn't going to
influence this at all.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.140
So this is all on you.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.540
On [INAUDIBLE] slider map
we've put together here.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.220
ROMAN NURIK: I guess the point
I wanted to make here is that

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.120
the information design, or
information architecture,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.860
especially for apps that have an
existing, potentially very

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.110
large user base or existing
property on the web or on

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.580
other mobile platforms.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.080
You don't want to compromise
your information architecture.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.800
You don't want to have to choose
a completely different

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.240
information architecture
just for Android.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.300
So when you look at Android,
don't think of it as designing

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.490
a completely separate app.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.210
It's really how do I map
my existing information

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.350
architecture, my existing
entities, the objects I deal

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.190
with, the sibling relationships
of things.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.430
How do you map those
onto Android?

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.020
So it's really, in this case,
with the information

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.500
architecture portion of the
design process, you really

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.930
have to think about,
how do I best

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.690
communicate my existing content?

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.340
My current content, and
manifest it in an

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.061
Android-friendly way.

00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:55.330
NICK BUTCHER: So if you take a
look at the example of Gmail,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.010
for example. a product which
has existed on the web and

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.480
elsewhere long before
Android came along.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.900
Android does not dictate
anything at all about this.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.200
Obviously using some Android
interaction patterns and

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.730
visual design here, but the
information architecture,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.230
there are basically messages,
conversations,

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.490
labels, and so forth.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.270
This is purely dictated by
the product, by Gmail.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.150
So Android has no
bearing here.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.080
ROMAN NURIK: It's very important
to make sure that

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.180
when a user comes from the web
to Gmail, not that they

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.230
immediately see the
same exact things.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.660
Like you don't want them to see
the exact same visuals.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.150
Maybe not even necessarily the
exact same ordering of

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.490
content, but you do generally
want them to immediately

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.030
understand where things are and
that all the things that

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.776
they expect to be
there are there.

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:45.390
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.190
So the next slice we're
looking at is

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.000
the interaction design.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.420
So here we'd say that it is
actually more important to get

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.655
a lot closer to Holo and to the
Android design patterns

00:20:57.655 --> 00:21:01.500
than to anything
really bespoke.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.700
The reason being that while
users might know your brand,

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.380
and so on, when you're in the
context of the mobile device--

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.200
When I'm on my Android phone and
I'm using multiple apps,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.180
it's very important that your
application works the same way

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.380
as the rest of those
applications that are going to

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.430
be used side by side.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.390
So this is where, I think,
interaction patterns such as

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.800
navigation are really,
really critical.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.200
That a user instantly knows how
to use your application.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.090
Some users will have multiple
devices, maybe different OSs.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.500
I might use the website for one
thing and the phone for

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.280
something else.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.600
But in our research and
experience, users tend to do a

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.240
context switch when they switch
between these devices.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.850
So I don't expect an application
on an Android

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.710
phone to function exactly
like the website.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.945
I expect it to function
like an Android app.

00:21:49.945 --> 00:21:51.950
And I kind of expect
that to happen.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.030
And one point we wanted to
make is that bespoke

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.660
interactions, which keep your
brand defined, that's

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.200
absolutely OK.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.320
But if you do have an
interaction which is at odds

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.000
with the Android design
patterns, it's working out

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.209
where it makes sense to back off
and where it makes sense

00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:09.061
to do something more bespoke.

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.590
ROMAN NURIK: As an example kind
of outside of the mobile

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:18.140
context, on the web you have the
full breadth of HTML and

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.820
CSS and styling and stuff
to communicate

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.070
your content, right?

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.030
But almost every website,
at the top

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.890
left, they have a logo.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.930
Their navigation is either
at the top or

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.080
along the left side.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.790
And that's really just something
that's in the

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.390
culture and in the core
of the web, right?

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.980
So people kind of expect that.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.950
So that's the something where
you want to take your

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.630
information architecture,
your content.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.370
You're going to bring it to the
web, but you want to make

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.380
that you use interactions
that are well

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.440
understood on the web.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.660
And it's the same thing
on Android.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.770
So you really want to make sure
that when you come to a

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.490
platform you bring your stuff.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.930
You bring your luggage
and stuff.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.560
But you put it into the right
parts of the house,

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.288
effectively.

00:23:01.288 --> 00:23:04.450
NICK BUTCHER: Nice
metaphor there.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.090
So a couple examples of this
we're going to take a look at.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.400
So we've gone for things which
is are kind of slightly beyond

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.730
the stock arrangement
of components.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.270
So here is an app example from
an app called Grand St. If you

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.980
haven't seen it or heard of it,
it's a recent addition to

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.120
our beautiful apps collection
on Google Play.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.410
It's a lovely app.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.470
So here they're doing
something quite

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.300
custom, in a way.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.190
They're trying to give as much
real estate and space to

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.740
imagery and description, in a
very, very beautiful way.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.960
So they're bringing very much
their own personality and

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.370
their own information
architecture here.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.180
But they're kind of blending
that with the Android design.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.480
So when it comes to things like
navigation and performing

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.850
important actions, here they get
much closer to the action

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.560
bar paradigm.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.430
So while it's not a stock
action bar, it's been

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.640
customized slightly, it's very,
very important that

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.160
users are kind of familiar with
that and can understand

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.840
that, oh right, this is how I
navigate hierarchically, or

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.030
this how I perform actions.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.040
Or this is where I'll look
for supplemental actions.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.848
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:24:06.848 --> 00:24:09.440
NICK BUTCHER: And the next
example is kind of like the

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.200
canonical example of that
marquee of bespoke interaction

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.600
is something like Flipboard.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.070
So Flipboard's whole value
proposition is wrapped up in

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.990
this magazine which you
can flip around.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.770
So that's also a very custom
interaction for navigation.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.330
Which is fine.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.130
But when it comes to other
things, like performing

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.420
actions or hierarchical
navigation, they do get much

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.140
closer to the Android design
pattern, so using the action

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.100
bar affordances.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.120
I'd love to see them get
slightly closer to a stock

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.690
action bar presentation.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.420
But largely they're following
the spirit of, oh, I know

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.640
where to look for navigation.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.510
Oh, I know where to look
for actions to perform.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.590
So here, these are good examples
of where they're

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.330
doing something custom and
trying to bring their own

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.460
personalities, but
marrying them

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.735
with the Android patterns.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.525
ROMAN NURIK: So visual design?

00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:02.433
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so the last
way I wanted to look at

00:25:02.433 --> 00:25:03.990
it is looking at the
visual design.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.880
So this is really a mixture of
both your own look and feel

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.290
along with the Android
look and feel.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:16.300
So the idea here is to blend
your brand, your own identity,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.670
with the Android
look and feel.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.440
So one example of this
might be things like

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.610
coloring, for example.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.825
While Holo visualize language
talks about stripping back to

00:25:25.825 --> 00:25:28.790
the minimum, making content
speak, it's not going to give

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.490
you any kind of advice about
what colors or what palette

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.550
you use in your application.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.770
This is where you have the
opportunity to bring your own

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.440
personality to an Android app
and really make it instantly

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.670
recognizable as your product.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.195
So here we have this little tip
that using a single accent

00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:47.950
color works really, really
well to bring that.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.510
So if you go on to the next
example, which we've picked,

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.530
which is Vine.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.580
Here they're doing that trick,
using that single, strong

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.270
accent color.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:01.370
There's really recognizable
minty green color.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.500
While this is a pretty stock
action bar, it's instantly

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.970
recognizable, instantly
branded.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.250
They've done a really nice job
of marrying Android visual

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.975
design with their own
branding, their

00:26:10.975 --> 00:26:12.225
own look and feel.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.860
ROMAN NURIK: I will say that we
do make some suggestions on

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.310
color on the design site,
but they're really just

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.010
suggestions.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:25.470
It's not like every app
must use these colors.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.760
But for smaller UI elements
where you need a special green

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.410
or red or something, you
could pick those.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.930
But for the core branding, we
won't tell you Android apps

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.680
must have these colors as their
core accent colors.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.730
It's really up to you.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.490
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.300
And the next example I wanted to
show you is from the Google

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.520
Play suite of applications.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.360
So these are some screen shots
taken from a recent show we

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.390
did on the Play, Play
Store redesign.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.280
And this is within one
application in the Play Store,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.650
but it shows a very
nice variation.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.140
How you can use things like
customizing the stock

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.255
components like the action
bar background.

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:06.090
The selected tab indicator.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.060
The bottom color.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.620
Just by using color here,
you instantly have

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.930
this branded feel.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.660
I know when I'm in a
music application.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.100
I know when I've switched to the
movies context or when I'm

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.600
in a book context.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.380
And this goes much deeper.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.600
Some of their text boxes are
a hint of the same colors.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.570
And some of the touch feedback
is colored the same way.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.890
So basically they used color
really, really well to get

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.100
this strong sense of identity.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.130
So it's using pretty stock
Android components, but

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.294
bringing their own brand, their
own identity to it.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.170
So yeah, just as a quick
summary, just to wrap that up.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.760
These are where we feel are
some areas where it's all

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.400
about your own information
architecture,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.210
your own object model.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.420
That Holo or Android design
isn't going to inform you.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.290
Interaction design, I would
say, is the other way.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.875
It's very important that a user
knows how to use your app

00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:03.880
as soon as they install it or
if they come to it with very

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.130
little context.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.120
But the visuals is very much
a marriage between your own

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.434
branding and the stock Android
look and feel.

00:28:11.434 --> 00:28:13.270
ROMAN NURIK: The last thing I
wanted to point out is just on

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.170
the interaction piece.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.080
Some of the examples that we
talked about, Flipboard and

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.770
Grand St., Some of the most
obvious interactions on

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.320
Android are swiping
and scrolling.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.740
And I'd say that both of those
apps, Flipboard does a little

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.380
bit more custom, but Grand
St. especially.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.730
It looks very, very custom, but
as soon as you open up the

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.670
app, you start swiping
around, and things

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.300
just work as expected.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.860
So rather than doing really
custom gestural stuff to do

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.480
basic things like navigate
through content, just rely on

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.740
existing features, existing
gestures, like scrolling,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.840
swiping horizontally,
things like that.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.173
And users will almost
instantly know

00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:50.940
how to use your app.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.250
On top of, obviously, using the
same navigational model.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.380
Things like the action bar,
upaffordance, spinners, tabs,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.620
things like that.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.320
NICK BUTCHER: Absolutely.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.860
So it's not like an all or
nothing discussion, right?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.620
You can't say, I have to be
consistent with my application

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.460
because I'm already on other
platforms and people won't

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.030
know how to use my app.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.310
There absolutely are elements
that you should be consistent

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.650
to, but there's some elements
which it's really important to

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.410
get closer to the Android
patterns.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.350
ROMAN NURIK: I think
that was it.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.810
So with that, thanks everyone
for joining.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.510
I don't know when we'll
have another episode.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.840
Oh actually, wait, there's
one thing that

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.940
we forgot to mention.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.030
So we don't have a design news
section today, but one bit of

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.840
design news that we did
recently announce, our

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.610
beautiful design collection
that Nick alluded to.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.700
It's a set of 11 apps that the
Google Play and actually the

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.190
Android Design team thought were
really, really awesome.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.540
So definitely check it
out if you haven't.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.080
I believe it's still available
on your phone if you just open

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.000
up the Play store, go to
apps and scroll down

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.640
to beautiful design.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.900
You should see it.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.870
But just in case we do
have links available.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.490
So what that, thanks
everybody.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.363
As always, I'm your
host Roman Nurik.

00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:59.370
NICK BUTCHER: And bye
from Nick Butcher.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.720
ROMAN NURIK: See you guys next
week, or the week after, or

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.910
something like that.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.160
NICK BUTCHER: Soon.
