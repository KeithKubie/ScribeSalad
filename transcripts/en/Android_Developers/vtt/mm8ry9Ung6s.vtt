RETO MEIER: Hello everyone.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.740
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to "This Week in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
Android Development,"
October 29, 2012.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.750
A lot of interesting things
happened in Android

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.590
development last week, and
we've got a lot more

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.370
planned this week.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.720
But you don't care about any
of that because today we

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.145
launched new hardware.

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:21.700
Not even the imminent threat
of Hurricane Sandy could

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.890
prevent the release of the best
kept secrets of the year.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.985
Today Andy Rubin peeled back the
veil of absolute secrecy

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:31.470
that has successfully shrouded
Android 4.2 and all the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.790
hardware it's launching with,
including the new 4.7 inch,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.480
320 ppi Nexus 4 smartphone
developed together with LG, or

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.820
the incredible 2560 by 1,600,
300 ppi display Nexus 10

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.430
tablet developed in partnership
with Samsung.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.930
And of course, the new mobile
data version of the Nexus 7.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.720
All of these shiny new pieces
of consumer electronics will

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.180
be available from the Google
Play store on November 13.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.810
Along with the shiny metal and
plastic, we also saw our first

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.430
Android 4.2, featuring
Photosphere, gesture typing,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.250
wireless display, and
multi-user support.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.730
"Android Developers Live" last
week saw the final episode of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.790
some of our oldest shows.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.370
Our weekly Android Developer
office hours from Mountain

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.430
View will be going on hiatus
while we retool the format, as

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.600
will Dan and the "Friday Games
Review." Look for its return

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.180
when Dan restocks on headware.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.980
Rest assured that "Android
Design in Action" will

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.950
continue each week.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.280
Last week Roman and the guys
looked at shopping list apps

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.200
Out of Milk and Grocery IQ.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.140
We'll also be continuing with
our revamped "App Clinic."

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.722
We're turning our attention to
more technical depth, with Ian

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:38.840
and I helping to explain not
just what apps should be doing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.480
better, but also showing the
code snippets necessary to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.890
make it happen.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.090
Our goal is to help create a
collection of awesome apps

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.110
that we're calling
pure Android.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.660
Check out the video for
more details on

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.350
what we've got planned.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.340
And if you want your app
reviewed on the app clinic, be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.150
sure to nominate it using this
Trello board and vote on the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.470
apps and app categories you'd
like us to review in future

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.360
weeks while you're there.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.700
This week, we'll be looking at
travel assistance apps just in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.920
time for the upcoming
holiday season.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.030
As always, you can find the
complete schedule for this

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.840
week's live shows at Google
Developers Live.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
That's developers.googl
e.com/live/android.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.240
Today's live wallpaper was
Paperland, brought to you by

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.790
Joko interactive, and
I knew were trouble

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.810
when you walked in.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.680
My name is Reto Meier,
thanks for watching.
