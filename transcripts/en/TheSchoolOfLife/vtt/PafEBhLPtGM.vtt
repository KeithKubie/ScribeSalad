00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960
How to Get Angry a Lot

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.680
Forget that you might ever had done anything wrong yourself.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.700
Take things personally:

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.680
that computer broke down to be mean.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.080
Constantly compare your existence

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160
with that of the happiest, most fortunate people you know.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.840
Expect that there cannot ever be traffic,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.180
and that household keys simply can't go missing.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.480
Build up isolated frustrations

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.840
into giant interconnected narratives of persecution.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.480
Become very sensitive to noise,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.580
then move to a city where a lot of people

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.500
are taking advantage of rising property prices to redo their homes.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.240
Start to notice fingerprints on walls,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.480
chipped plates, and towels on bathroom floors;

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.760
see these as personal insults.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.580
Be sure not to get enough sleep,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.980
but never attribute your moods to tiredness.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.480
Expect children to be grateful.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.120
Compare your relationship to the happiest couple that the media

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.840
is choosing to tell us about at the moment.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.340
Attribute most issues in your life

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960
to the mendacity and shortsightedness of your partner,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.640
and their family.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.020
Avoid perspective.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.540
Never look at NASA images of distant galaxies.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.260
Find a YouTube channel or news outlet

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.720
that you are almost certain to dislike.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.460
Watch some videos and read articles, and feel very irritated

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.620
by the presentation of views you strongly disagree with.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.840
Never watch others getting angry;

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.860
fail to see how absurd they can seem.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.860
Develop a faith that fury is in some ways quite impressive,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.220
macho, and makes stuff happen.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.940
Take yourself seriously,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.180
and yet, deep down, hate who you are.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.780
Think of laughter as a luxury you can't afford.
