00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.273
Voiceover:What I want to
do in this video is take

00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:05.944
this quantity represented
by these greenish

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:09.480
emerald-looking bars, where
each bar represents one,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.504
and try to represent them
using the digits that we know,

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:16.770
the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.696
And the way I'm going
to do it is I'm going

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:21.259
to group this into tens
so I'm going to see

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.848
how many tens I have and then essentially

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.793
how many ones that I have left over,

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:27.883
so let's try to group
this into groups of ten.

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:34.321
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.840
Let me actually, I
messed that up, let see,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.003
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.272
So that's one group of
ten right over there.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:49.960
Let me box that off so
that i know that is ten.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.912
So, that's one group
of ten, now let's see,

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.268
let's see if I can get a few
more groups of ten in there.

00:00:56.268 --> 00:01:03.502
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:08.319
That's my second group
of ten right over there.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.706
Second group of ten and now let's see,

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:14.213
it looks like I got several
more groups of ten here.

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:20.355
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:23.083
So that's a third group of ten,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.187
and it looks like I might
be able to get one more,

00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:30.121
so that's my third group
of ten and then we have,

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:36.210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.477
So that's my fourth group of ten.

00:01:39.477 --> 00:01:42.744
Fourth group of ten right over here.

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:46.756
So I was able to fit in
at least just this is 1,

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:50.216
This is a ten right over here,

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:52.548
This is another ten right over here.

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:56.576
That's the third ten, and
then that's the fourth ten.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:02:00.705
So we can say that's 10+10+10+10.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:06.667
Or all of this combined is equal to 4,

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:13.277
1, 2, 3, 4, tens but I'm
not done with the number,

00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:19.349
I still have 1, 2, I
have 2 ones left over.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.560
So this is a one, so that's
a one right over there.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.351
And then this is another
one, so that's another one.

00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.996
So I have 2 ones, so this right over here,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.367
That is 2 ones, remember for each of these

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:39.073
little green bars we
said represents a one.

00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:41.394
So this whole number is what?

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:46.914
What's going to be the 4 tens,
1 ten, 2 ten, 3 tens, 4 tens.

00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:50.854
Plus the 2 ones, so
let me write that down.

00:02:50.854 --> 00:03:00.261
So it is 4 tens plus 2
ones, but what is that?

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.008
Well if we use the number systems

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.204
that we're used to
representing, we would say,

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.244
"Well look, our number system gives us

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:08.660
a way of representing that."

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.693
Because the first place,
this is the ones' place

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.553
So let me gets some of this blue color,

00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:18.344
So this is the ones' place.

00:03:18.344 --> 00:03:21.132
There we use one of the digits,
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:22.988
To see how many ones we have.

00:03:22.988 --> 00:03:24.892
And we have 2 ones.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:27.690
And then the next place over to the left,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.529
that's where we say how many tens we have.

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.582
That's where we say how many tens.

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:37.453
And we know how many tens
we have, we have 4 tens.

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.240
So the way that we would represent this

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.835
in our number systems we would say

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:44.177
that this was 4 tens and 2 ones.

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:47.932
We call this right over
here, we call this 42.

00:03:47.932 --> 00:03:50.241
Another way that you can think about this,

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:56.004
is 4 tens, that's 10+10+10+10,

00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.580
that's going to be 40, but once again,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.382
we're using our number
system to represent this,

00:04:02.382 --> 00:04:07.681
and then we have 2 ones but
I like to write it this way,

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.787
just to remind ourselves that this 4 which

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:14.983
represents 4 tens also represents 40.

00:04:14.983 --> 23:59:59.999
Because 4 tens is 40.
