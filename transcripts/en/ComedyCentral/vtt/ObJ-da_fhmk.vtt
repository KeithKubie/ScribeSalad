00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.436
Benedict Cumberbatch
scene one take one.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.106
When did I know
I wanted to be an actor?

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.042
When did Shakespeare know
that he wanted to write.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.445
When did Starbucks
make his first Frappuccino?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:19.620
That one got me Dr. Strange

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.257
A true actor only wants to act.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.160
And the reality is I don't know
how to do anything else.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.264
You OK over there? 
It's very important to stay
hydrated

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.799
It's... the other side..
Where are the instructions?

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.104
Great acting requires training.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.073
You have to train hard
to act great.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.243
Are we going to do anything
besides
watch episodes of Sherlock?

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.012
Now you made me miss favorite
part so I have to rewind it

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.347
to the beginning. 
I need to learn from the master.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.984
It won't be easy.
Try the line

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.853
Where's my mother? 
Again.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.288
Where is my mother?

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:55.789
Where is your mother?
Where is my mother?!

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.424
WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER?!
WHERE IS MY MOTH–

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:58.859
AGAIN!

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:00.761
Where.. is my mother?

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.228
That's it.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.063
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.799
You have to feel... it
Good.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.936
If you want to succeed
you have to really want it.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:12.572
And for that to work.
Your art must be your passion.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.840
The doctor said it's for sure.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.108
The test came in positive?

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.276
BORING!

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.045
I mean how are you going to
make that go viral? 

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.479
Hmm? do a funny dance.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.416
♪ This could go viral, hmm♪

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.451
I just told him I have
three months to live.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.322
♪ 3 months to live, 3 months to
live, UMPH ♪

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:29.156
Just go the internet pregnant.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:33.927
Again! with entertainment.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.996
This course
will cover everything.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.899
You're a snake. You're a giraffe
reaching up through the canopy

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.635
of the jungle voice
physicality your a bird.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.705
The wings make you hover
over close your eyes

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.039
you don't oppose your trip.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.109
Everything is beautiful.
Hands... hats all the important
shit

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.748
Very good.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.351
That's the indie.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:01.321
I'm a big fat guy who has 
children on my knee, Ho Ho Ho!

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.956
Usually you see
from the top down.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.525
It's an external to
internal transformation.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.696
Acting is for me
about facing your fears

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.332
and confronting harsh truths.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.204
I don't like your face
That's really rude

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:19.172
Your voice makes me
want to vomit.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:23.577
You're an asshole.
Truth be too much truth. Never.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.879
Ever too much.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:27.748
It's about pushing yourself.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:32.319
No... no!
Okay try like this

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.287
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:39.326
HE WAS ONLY A BOY!! DAMN YOU!!!

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.994
That will get you
a Golden Globe.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.764
Nom.. easy. Do it for the right
reasons.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:46.767
The only reason to become
an actor is to become famous and
rich

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:50.537
and if you succeed you will
touch people metaphorically.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.838
You don't have to touch people

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.173
They might want you
to touch it.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.809
It can get complicated
just it's a metaphor.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.911
 My name is
Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.713
Welcome to an actor acts

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.025
Vocal warm ups.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.894
Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.232

so many levels.
