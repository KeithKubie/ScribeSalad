come back the next day that informal
 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.810 align:start position:0%
come back the next day that informal
feedback<00:06:43.020><c> is</c><00:06:43.410><c> really</c><00:06:43.770><c> what</c><00:06:43.980><c> sort</c><00:06:44.370><c> of</c><00:06:44.400><c> pushes</c>

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
feedback is really what sort of pushes
 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
feedback is really what sort of pushes
people<00:06:44.970><c> in</c><00:06:45.330><c> one</c><00:06:45.660><c> in</c><00:06:45.930><c> one</c><00:06:46.710><c> direction</c><00:06:47.040><c> or</c>

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 align:start position:0%
people in one in one direction or
 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.810 align:start position:0%
people in one in one direction or
another

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
another
 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
another
and<00:06:48.060><c> so</c><00:06:48.450><c> there</c><00:06:48.840><c> there</c><00:06:49.110><c> are</c><00:06:49.140><c> all</c><00:06:49.380><c> of</c><00:06:49.410><c> these</c>

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 align:start position:0%
and so there there are all of these
 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
and so there there are all of these
subtle<00:06:50.490><c> so</c><00:06:50.700><c> the</c><00:06:50.970><c> way</c><00:06:51.150><c> I</c><00:06:51.180><c> always</c><00:06:51.510><c> think</c><00:06:51.810><c> about</c>

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 align:start position:0%
