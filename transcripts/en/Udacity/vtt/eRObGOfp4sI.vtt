These last two practice problems bring together a lot of what we learned in unit

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.073
3. To start the first problem, we have to know the slope of the given line and

00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:15.004
then find the slope of a line that is parallel to that line. So let's find the

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:20.021
slope of the line 3x plus y equals 7. In order to find the equation of a line

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:26.266
that's parallel to this line. I first have to find the slope of this line. If I

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:33.091
simply subtract 3x from both sides I get that y equals negative 3x plus 7, which

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:40.497
means the slope of this given line is negative 3. I know that parallel line if I

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:46.651
want to find the slope of a line that's parallel to the given line. I know that

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:52.652
parallel lines have the same slope. So, what I write is m parallel equals the

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:58.839
original slope, which equals negative 3. This is just a shorthand notation to

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.917
indicate parallel. So, the slope of the parallel line is equal to the slope of

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:10.706
the original line which is equal to negative 3. To find the equation of the

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:16.668
line, I want to label my points x1 and y1. And I can use the formula m equals y

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:22.926
minus y1 over x minus x1. Since I know my slope is negative 3, I can write

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:29.753
negative 3 over 1. Any whole number can be written as a fraction with 1 as the

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:36.398
denominator. And that's going to equal y minus y1 is 4 over x minus x1 is 2.

00:01:36.398 --> 00:01:42.893
When I cross multiply, I have negative 3 times x minus 2 equals 1 times y minus

00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:49.682
4. Now, I need to distribute. So when I distribute, I have negative 3 times x,

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:56.527
negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6 equals y minus 4. Since I want the

00:01:56.527 --> 00:02:04.368
answer in slope intercept form. If I just add 4 to both sides, I get negative 3x

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:11.930
plus 10 equals y. And we know that's the same as y equals negative 3x plus 10.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.184
And, one quick check, we know that the slope of the parallel line is the same as

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:22.651
the slope of the original line. And, since we put the answer in slope intercept

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.982
form I can verify that it has the same slope. Now what about the perpendicular

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:33.919
line? Since we want to find the equation of the perpendicular line. To 3x plus y

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:40.281
equals 7. Once again, I start with the original slope which is negative 3, but I

00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:46.261
want the perpendicular slope. So the perpendicular slope is the negative

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:52.178
reciplical of the original slope, which is going to be negative 1 over the

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:58.932
original slope was negative 3. So a negative time a negative is a positive, so

00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:05.794
the slope of the perpendicular line is positive 1 3rd. Now that I know the

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:13.234
slope, I can use my equation m, y minus y1, over x minus x1, which gives us 1

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:21.040
3rd equals y minus y 1 is 4, over x minus x 1 is 2. When I cross multiply I have

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.549
1 times x minus 2 equals 3 times y minus 4. At this point I need to distribute

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.974
again. When I multiply x minus 2 times 1, I'm just left with x minus 2 and I

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:43.112
have 3 times y and 3 times negative 4 is negative 12. Since I want the equation

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:50.920
in slope intercept form I need y equals, so I'm going to add 12 to both sides

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.856
and I get x plus 10 equals 3y and when I divide everything through by 3, I get y

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:06.420
equals x over 3 or 1 3rd x plus 10 over 3. And that's the same as y equals 1 3rd

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.567
x plus 10 3rd. And again, I can verify my slope is supposed to be 1 3rd, because

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:19.623
it's the negative reciprocal of negative 3. And since we put it in slope

00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:25.288
intercept form, the slope is 1 3rd. If you got both these answers right, I would

00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:28.021
say you've learned a lot about lines.
