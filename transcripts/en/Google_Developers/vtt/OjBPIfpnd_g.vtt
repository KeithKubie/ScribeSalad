MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.875
My name is Martin
Omander, and I welcome you

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.580
to "Google Root Access,"
the show featuring

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.880
actionable startup advice.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.290
My guest today is
Philip Bergqvist

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.770
from the startup
Unified Intents.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.190
Philip, tell us a bit
about Unified Intents.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.550
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So we're
a Swedish startup company.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.300
We've developed an app called
Unified Remote, which today

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.540
is actually one of the top-rated
apps on the Android Play Store.

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.720
Essentially what it does
is it turns your smartphone

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.870
into a universal remote control
for your Mac, Windows or Linux

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.090
computer.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.550
And what makes it
super easy is that you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.290
get different remote
controls in one

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990
app for different applications.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.259
So if you want to control
Spotify, or VLC, or iTunes,

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.300
or even mouse or keyboard,
you can do all of this

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.830
from one app, rather
than having to use, say,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.480
50 different apps
for all of this.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.886
Most of our users will maybe
use their computer connected up

00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:58.260
to their TV in
their living room,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.125
and then be able to
sit back in their sofa

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.170
and control it using
their smartphone.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.320
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.770
So I went to the Play Store
and downloaded the app

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.740
and saw that it was free.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.420
Yet, you do have revenue.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.520
So tell me about how you
were thinking about revenue

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.260
and how you got to that point?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.230
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So basically,
when we first released the app,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.210
this was a couple years ago.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.740
And we didn't really
think hey, let's

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.116
make a startup out of this,
and let's earn lots of money.

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.573
MARTIN OMANDER:
That's the best way

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:32.280
to start a startup, by the way.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.190
PHILIP BERGQVIST: It was just
us, two guys, hobby project.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.530
And we just wanted to
solve our own use case.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.060
And so we started
off by releasing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.090
a free version of the app.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.000
And then just from the
traction and the response

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.570
that we got early
on, we said maybe

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.880
we can start monetizing as well.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.170
So then we decided to release
a paid version as well.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.290
And now we've just been
going on from there

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380
and adding new features
here and there.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.740
MARTIN OMANDER: So you
have two applications.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.940
One is free and one you pay for.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.329
And some features are
only in the paid version.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.120
What features are only
in the paid version?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.130
And could you tell
us a bit about what

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.190
thinking went into that?

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.774
Why did you put only
those in the paid version?

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:20.440
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So
one of the problems

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.450
that we notice right now is
that our free version is maybe

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.677
a bit too good.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.510
And that's because when
we first created it,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.350
we just added all the features
that we wanted and released it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.850
for free.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.210
Whereas now when we think
back, we notice that,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.825
maybe we put in too many
free things in that version.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.690
But now as time goes on, all
the new features that we add

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.760
go into the paid version.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.030
So when we start adding
voice control or widgets

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.350
or quick actions,
all these features

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470
go into the full
version instead.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.240
And the biggest
difference between the two

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.150
is the number of remote
controls that you can use.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.380
So in the free version,
you only get access

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.070
to 13 different remote controls,
whereas in the full version,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.860
you have access to 70 plus
programs that you can control.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.230
And all the new remote
controls that we add always

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.310
go into the full
version instead.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.760
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.800
So there are many ways to
charge premium customers,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.360
and many startups use the
freemium model like you do.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.350
You have picked the
approach of having

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.410
two applications, a
free and a paid one.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.500
Why did you choose
that approach?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.740
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So
actually when we started out,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.697
there wasn't in-app
purchases for Android.

00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:35.530
So this was really the
best approach for us.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.300
We released the free version
and then a separate app,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.770
which is the paid version.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.750
We have in-app
purchases on iPhone,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.390
and we've seen that's been
really successful so far.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.100
So that's definitely
something that we're

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.270
looking into adding for the
Android version as well.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.830
MARTIN OMANDER: So you
see that in-app purchases

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.820
are successful.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.992
You mean that there's a
greater conversion rate,

00:03:56.992 --> 00:03:58.450
or in what way are
they successful?

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.660
PHILIP BERGQVIST: Yeah.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.534
So we actually see a
greater conversion rate.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:02.540
I don't know if
that is specifically

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.230
due to in-app
purchases, or it may

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.045
be differences in the
different platforms.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.080
But at the end of
the day, it makes

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.050
it easier for our users to
take the step of upgrading.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.350
And obviously, that's what
we should be doing, make

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.240
it easier for our users to find
what features they can buy,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.194
and if they want
them, to easily do it.

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:24.110
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.970
Because if you have
to exit the app,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.900
go and find the app
again, download it, pay,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.040
you lose context that you want
to guide the user through.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.820
So how much do you
charge for the paid app?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.010
And why did you pick
that particular price?

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.150
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So
the paid app is $3.99.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.340
We just looked around at the
App Store or the Play Store,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.230
and had a look.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.360
The category that we want
to be in, that's Tools.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.610
We looked at maybe
similarly complex apps.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.930
And then we found $3.99,
that probably works.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.499
And we've gone with that, and
it's worked well for us so far.

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.040
MARTIN OMANDER: Have
you experimented

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.822
with higher or lower pricing?

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:15.780
PHILIP BERGQVIST: Yeah.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.010
So from time to time, we'll do
a campaign, maybe at a one year

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.180
or second year
anniversary of the app.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.510
We'll do a campaign where we
discount the app to just $1.00.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.940
And then, we see massive boosts
during a short period of time.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.400
I don't think that would be
very profitable in the long run.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.240
I think it's good that we
have our $4.00 price point.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.320
But it is interesting
to experiment and see

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.550
what happens when we
change the price, which

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.470
is super easy to do through
the developer console.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.460
MARTIN OMANDER: So you
see a massive boost

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.500
when you lower the
price to $0.99.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.760
Why don't you keep the price
down there all the time

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.310
and get the boost all the time?

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.340
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So what we
see is when we lower the price,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.590
there's a lot of
media recognition.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.270
So there are sites that
just scrape the Play Store

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.860
and look for apps that
change their prices.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.192
So when we lower the price,
there's a big buzz around it.

00:06:15.192 --> 00:06:17.150
But then eventually,
after a couple days maybe,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.890
it starts to die off a bit.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.520
And I think in the
long run, I don't

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.760
think we'd be as profitable
with a lower price.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.530
But it's super
difficult to know.

00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:30.630
MARTIN OMANDER: So by doing
that, lowering the price

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.380
repeatedly and then
taking it back up,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.587
you can get that media
hit several times.

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:36.170
PHILIP BERGQVIST:
We try not to put it

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.160
into too much of a system.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.650
We don't think it's a good way
of maybe marketing our app.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.760
But from time to time,
it's fun to give our fans

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.260
a bit of a treat
from time to time.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.176
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:06:52.176 --> 00:06:53.150
Very good.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.290
So many startups,
perhaps even most today,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.860
try to do the freemium model.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.470
What advice would
you give to them?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.011
What would you have
done differently,

00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.020
and what has been
successful for you?

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.220
PHILIP BERGQVIST: So I think
it's a very good technique when

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.290
starting out to have a
free version of an app.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.930
Obviously, it's maybe
easier to get new users,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.790
get traction early on with a
free app versus a paid app,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.380
where maybe you don't
have a lot of reviews.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.230
Maybe people don't really
know about you yet.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.840
So that's worked
really well for us.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.940
We built up a relatively big
user base on our free version

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.210
before we even
launched our paid app.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.900
It was about one year
difference there.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.220
But also as I
mentioned before, a bit

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.510
of a problem we're seeing now is
that our free version is maybe

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.450
a bit too good.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.800
So if you are a
startup and you're

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.200
thinking that you might want
to monetize in the future,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.930
maybe think a bit
about what features

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.520
do we want to have in
the free app right now?

00:07:58.494 --> 00:07:59.410
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:07:59.960
Well, great.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.560
Thank you very much for sharing
experiences with us, Philip.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.945
PHILIP BERGQVIST: Yeah.

00:08:02.945 --> 00:08:03.680
Thanks.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.096
MARTIN OMANDER: Hopefully, you
found something useful here

00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:07.830
that you can apply
in your startup.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.260
If you have comments, please
enter them in the YouTube

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.180
comments section.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.990
We read everything you write.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.590
And finally, if you're a
high-tech entrepreneur,

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.930
go to
developers.google.com/startups

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.740
to find out how
Google can help you.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.520
That's it.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.196
See you next time.

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:29.656
All right. [SPEAKING SWEDISH]
