00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.050
These days, Easter eggs are extremely common
in movies.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
They are intentional inside jokes, hidden
messages or references that are included for

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.240
fun or, sometimes, in the case of comic book
movies in particular, as a means of foreshadowing

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
things to come.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.240
Marvel Studios does Easter eggs better than
anyone.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.210
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is absolutely
teaming with them.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.859
Ever since the first Iron Man movie back in
2008, MCU movies have included subtle (and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.319
some not so subtle) Easter eggs that have
either already proven to have been foreshadowing

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.310
future events, or that will come into fruition
in future movies.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.200
Here are ten 10 exciting Easter eggs hidden
in Marvel movies (and please bear in mind

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.870
there are spoilers for Captain America: Civil
War in this video).

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.000
Captain America's Shield
Captain America's vibranium shield is the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.270
iconic trademark weapon of the superhero also
known as Steve Rogers.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.940
It has made regular appearances in the MCU
ever since Cap first appeared in Captain America:

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.080
The First Avenger - but a prototype version
of it appeared twice before that, foreshadowing

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.470
the coming of the super soldier to the franchise.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.380
In Iron Man, the prototype could be seen laying
around in Tony Stark's workshop and, later,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.689
in Iron Man 2, it was seen again, when it
was picked up by Phil Coulson and subsequently

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.350
used by Stark to prop up his homemade particle
accelerator.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.649
The Leader
Back when Edward Norton was still playing

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.950
Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk introduced
audiences to Samuel Sterns, played by Tim

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.970
Blake Nelson.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.590
In the movie, Sterns attempted to help cure
Banner of his Hulk problem, but ended up getting

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.299
some of Banner's blood inside an open wound
when Emil Blonsky attacked him.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.740
As a result, a visible mutation began to take
place on his head - this was clearly a hint

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.180
towards his future transformation into The
Leader.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.829
The Leader is one of the Hulk's most formidable
foes in the comic books and it would be great

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.960
to see the psionic villain in a future movie.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.079
He has actually appeared in some of the MCU's
spin-off comics, but is yet to emerge on film.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.060
Maybe that will happen in Phase Four of the
franchise?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.280
The S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999
Map
In Iron Man 2, the movie came to a climax

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.679
with Nick Fury giving Tony Stark a debriefing
in a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. facility - it was

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.799
the scene in which Fury suggested that Iron
Man was suitable for the Avenger Initiative,

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.479
but Tony Stark wasn't.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.819
In the room they were in, there were several
high-tech computer screens - one of which

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.139
had a map of the world on it.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.120
The map was interesting because it had a number
of locations across the globe highlighted.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.750
Eagle-eyed viewers deduced that two of these
locations were the fictional African nation

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.850
of Wakanda and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.840
Of course, since then, Wakanda has been confirmed
to exist and will be the setting for the Black

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.850
Panther movie, but we're yet to see Atlantis
in the MCU.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.680
Will we ever be introduced to the home of
Namor the Sub-Mariner?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.380
Only time will tell.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.970
Erik Selvig's Chalkboard
By the time the events of Thor: The Dark World

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.541
took place, Erik Selvig had been diagnosed
as crazy and placed in an institution, thanks

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.420
to his experiences under Loki's control in
The Avengers.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.810
While he was institutionalised, he was seen
doodling on a chalkboard.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.811
To most people, his diagram might have been
nonsense, but to fans of Marvel Comics, there

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.570
were clearly some very interesting inclusions
on it.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.090
It was a drawing of the World Tree that links
the Nine Realms together, and it had some

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.870
references to things like "The Fault" and
"The Crossroads".

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.340
In the comics, those are gateways to an infinite
number of alien dimensions and alternate realities.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.390
If they exist in the MCU - as this Easter
egg would suggest - all kinds of weird and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.700
wonderful beings could spill through them
in the future.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.450
Muspelheim and Surtur
In Thor: The Dark World, the cosmic event

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.760
known as the Convergence was taking place.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.510
It resulted in the alignment of the Nine Realms,
causing the dimensional boundaries between

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.090
them to become very thin.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.930
As the Nine Realms begin to converge in the
filmâ€™s final act, a number of portals leading

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.330
to them all are visible.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.060
One of the portals shows a flame-filled world
with what appears to be a fiery body moving

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.060
around inside it.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.959
The realm in question is Muspelheim - the
home of Surtur and his army of Fire Demons

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.010
- and the creature moving around inside it
may well have been Surtur himself.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.600
Given that he is expected to be one of the
main villains in the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.970
this was surely foreshadowing his future appearance
in the MCU.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.640
Adam Warlock's Cocoon
Adam Warlock is a powerful superhero with

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.220
strong links to the Guardians of the Galaxy
in the comic books - but did you know that

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.330
a recurring Easter egg has hinted towards
him appearing in the MCU?

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.790
In the mid-credits scene of Thor: The Dark
World, audiences were given their first look

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.240
at Benicio del Toro's character, The Collector.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.100
His museum was filled with rare artefacts
and living beings - and one of the items that

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.530
was visible in this scene was a large cocoon.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.230
It appeared again in Guardians of the Galaxy
and, on closer inspection, it is clearly the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.509
cocoon that Adam Warlock uses for self-preservation
and recuperation in the comic books.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.650
With that in mind, we can probably expect
to see him in future MCU movies, which is

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.160
a very intriguing and exciting thought.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.190
HYDRA's Targets
In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.250
was revealed that Arnim Zola had developed
an algorithm that predicted which individuals

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.430
in the MCU could potentially become a threat
to HYDRA.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.630
As a result, HYDRA plotted to use three Helicarriers
- in an initiative designated "Project: Insight"

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.520
- to sweep the globe, using satellite-guided
guns to eliminate those individuals.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.070
When Captain America and his allies discovered
that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Jasper Sitwell was actually

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.870
an undercover HYDRA agent, they forced him
to give them information about the whole thing

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.020
- including the names of some of the individuals
who would be targeted.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.639
They included the likes of Tony Stark and
Bruce Banner, but also a certain Stephen Strange.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.520
It was the first time the character had been
mentioned in the MCU and confirmation that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.880
Doctor Strange was on his way.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.150
Vision and the Scarlet Witch
In Avengers: Age of Ultron, there were some

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.310
very subtle hints of a potential romance between
the android Vision and the mysterious Scarlet

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.710
Witch, but these hints became far more obvious
in Captain America: Civil War.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.690
Vision felt very protective over the Maximoff
twin and felt compelled to cook for her and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.350
make her feel better when she was down - and
his feelings toward her even resulted in him

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.960
losing his concentration and accidentally
harming James Rhodes.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.910
This was all clearly referencing the fact
that the pair are romantically involved in

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.940
the comics and have even had a comic book
title named after them.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.710
Could we see a romance between the pair in
the future?

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.090
Could there even be a Vision and the Scarlet
Witch movie on the horizon?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.460
We'll have to wait to find out, but it would
undoubtedly be awesome.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.360
Spider-Man
In Ant-Man, Scott Lang's good friend Luis

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.830
- played by Michael PeÃ±a - loved to tell
a story.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.450
At the end of the movie, when he tells Scott
about the fact that Sam Wilson is looking

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.710
for him, he tells an elaborate version of
events that includes references to heroes

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.260
who jump, who swing and who can crawl on walls.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.190
All three of those could be interpreted as
being references to Spider-Man, but the wall-crawling

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.590
reference was definitely confirmation that
he exists in the MCU.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.700
It was the first time he had been mentioned
in the franchise, after Marvel Studios and

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.090
Sony Pictures agreed a deal to bring him into
it, which was a very exciting thing to hear.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.240
The Winter Soldier's Trigger Words
In Captain America: Civil War, it was revealed

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.240
that HYDRA's control over Bucky Barnes came
in the form of trigger words that turned him

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.139
into the brainwashed assassin known as the
Winter Soldier.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.320
Some of the words included the likes of "longing",
"freight car", "one", "nine", "seventeen"

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.840
and "benign", but the one that was seemingly
as Easter egg was "homecoming".

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.840
This was undoubtedly a fun nod to the exciting
news about title of the upcoming Spider-Man

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.120
solo movie in the MCU - it's called "Spider-Man:
Homecoming" and will be released in 2017,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.820
which is something we're definitely all looking
forward to.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.110

Easter eggs hidden in Marvel movies.
