00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.870
we have introduced the idea

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.310
of an aggregate production function.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.780
Which is a fancy way
or a mathematical model

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.030
that an economist might use to
tie the factors of production

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.310
in an economy to the actual
aggregate output of an economy.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.890
The aggregate output is Y.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.420
And then the factors of production,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.640
we've talked about this before,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.730
it's human capital, it's technology,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.240
and it is regular capital,
or non-human capital.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.900
And so A is really representing
the technology factor here.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.930
And this term is often known
as total factor productivity.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.270
K is referring to the non-human capital,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.490
and of course, capital starts with a C,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.030
but they use K for capital.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.510
And then L stands for the human capital.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.250
You could view it as standing for labor,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.870
but it's standing for a
little bit more than that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.560
and we'll talk about that in a second.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.150
And just to make this tangible,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.110
because it's written in
function notation here

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.100
which might seem a little
bit abstract to just saying

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.770
hey, some function of K and L,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.120
you could imagine an
aggregate production function

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.890
that looks like this, where our
aggregate output is equal to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.230
our total factor productivity,
which is once again,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.030
a measure of our technology,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.530
times our capital to some power

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.550
times our human capital
to some other power.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.770
And in an introductory economics course,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.210
you wouldn't actually have to
do this type of computation,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.240
taking things to fractional exponents,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.650
although we have many videos
on Khan Academy explaining

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.120
how to take fractional
exponents if you are curious.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.760
But this gives you a sense that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.190
look, if any one of these inputs goes up,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.130
well then you would expect
aggregate output to go up.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.235
And if, for whatever reason,
these were to go down,

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:39.080
any one of these to go down,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.690
that would have a negative
impact on aggregate output.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.450
But the focus of this video
is really thinking about

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.240
if you were an economist, how
would you actually come up

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.730
with the values for A, K, and L?

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.100
Pause this video and think about that.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.120
So let's start with L,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.930
which sometimes we
imagine represents labor,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.420
but you really should think
of it as human capital.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.000
How would you measure human capital?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.830
Well, the most obvious thing
is you could measure labor.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.900
And how would you measure labor?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.170
Well, you could go and see

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.690
well how many people
are in the labor force?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.380
So measure,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.400
measure the labor force.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.330
And you might say, well, isn't that all

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.400
that there is to human capital?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.480
But remember, not all labor is equivalent.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.820
If people are unhealthy,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.660
they're not going to be
able to be output as much.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.530
If people aren't trained,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.440
they're not going to be
able to output as much.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.460
So it's not just the quantity
of people in the labor force,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.600
it's also measures of education

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.480
that would factor into L.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.050
So the more educated a labor
force, the more trained,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.974
L would go up.

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:50.510
So higher people in
labor force, L goes up.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.890
More educated labor force, L goes up.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.810
And a healthier labor
force, L would go up.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.180
They are going to be able to do more.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.690
Now, what about K?

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.163
What about the capital stock of a country?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.030
Well, you might be tempted to say

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240
well, maybe I could count
the amount of capital

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.620
or something like that.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.020
But that wouldn't really make sense

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.010
because there could be
some types of capital

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.020
that might be some just tools,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.210
while you might have another
capital that's a big building

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.220
or a rail car or whatever else.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.090
And so the K is actually
measured by economists

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.580
as the value of the
capital stock in a country.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.040
Write it this way.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.500
So the value of capital,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.630
capital,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.700
in your country.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.340
Or in the economy that we care about.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.280
Now a really interesting
one is how do you measure A?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.290
There isn't an obvious index for

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.270
hey, I can just observe that and say

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.920
that has more technology
than that other thing.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.030
And the way that economists
often figure out an A

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.700
for an economy, is by backing into it.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.200
They can figure out an L,
and they can figure out a K.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.780
And they know what the output,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350
they know what the GDP of
that country is, the real GDP.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.790
And then if different countries

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.910
have the same K and the same L,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.190
but then their GDPs are different,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.380
than that means that
they have a different A.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.870
So the A you could almost
view as an adjustment

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.820
to fill in the gap to connect the dot

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.140
between the K, L, and the Y.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.490
But it would be a measure of how

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.660
technologically advanced something is.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.130
If my economy has an A of one,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.870
in order to make the numbers work,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.580
and your economy has an A of two,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.810
that means for some reason,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.500
you're getting twice the productivity

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.590
given the same capital
and human capital as I am,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.723
which implies that you
have twice the technology.
