00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.190
Determine whether the
system has no solutions

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.850
or infinite solutions.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.980
So let's think about how
we can go about doing this.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.790
So if at any point we might
not have to solve this entirely

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.920
if we somehow get something
that's nonsensical

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.700
which will tells us
there's no solutions.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.350
Or we might have to
go further and see

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.810
if it's one or
infinite solutions,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.935
although it looks like one
solution isn't an option

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:23.990
here, given how this
question is phrased.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.700
So the way that
you would proceed

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.790
to solve three equations
with three unknowns

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.990
is you would try to eliminate
variables one by one.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.364
And so first we could try to
eliminate the x variables.

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:36.030
And we could do that,
we can essentially

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.440
create two equations
with two unknowns.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.360
The two unknowns
will be y and z.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.890
If we can pair up
these equations

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.420
and eliminate x with
each of these pairings.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.210
So for example, we can
pair these first two.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.040
We can pair the last two.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.680
And that's all we would need
to have to eliminate the x's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.990
and still have two equations.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.630
And have all of the information
of these three equations.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.088
But then the third
pairing would be

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:02.930
the first and the
third equation,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.129
But we only have to do
two of these pairings.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.280
Now, just to show you what I
mean by these pairings, what

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.062
I want to do is take
these first two.

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:13.270
I'm going to pair this first
pairing right over here,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.910
and I'm going to use them
to eliminate the x terms.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.370
And over here I have
2x, over here I have 8x.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.760
If I could turn this
2x into a negative 8x

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.310
I could add both sides of
these equations to each other

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.510
and the x terms
would cancel out.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.020
And so the best way to turn
this 2x into a negative 8x

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
is to multiply this top
equation times negative 4.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.650
When I say multiply, I'm saying
multiply the whole equation,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.220
both sides of it, by negative 4.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
So 2x times negative
4 is negative 8x.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.060
Negative 4y times negative 4
is plus 16y, are positive 16y.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.120
z times negative 4 is negative
4z And that's equal to 3 times

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.460
negative 4 which is negative 12.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.950
And then I can rewrite this
equation right over here.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.100
It's 8x minus 2y plus
4z is equal to 7.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.630
And now I can add
these both equations.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.170
On the left hand side,
these guys cancel out,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.500
16y minus 2y-- and that
was the whole point

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.610
behind multiplying the top
equation by negative 4--

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.760
16y minus 2y is 14y.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670
Negative 4z plus 4z.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.010
These guys actually
cancel out as well.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.700
So actually with
that one pairing,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.574
by multiplying by negative
4 we were actually

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:32.090
able to cancel
out two variables.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.370
So you get 14y is
equal to negative 12

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.500
plus 7 is equal to negative 5.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.590
And you can actually
solve for y.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.970
And we don't know if this one
will actually have solutions.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.242
But if we assume it's
going to have a solution,

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:49.200
you could actually solve
for y right over here.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.860
You could divide
both sides by 14.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.130
But let's worry about
that a little bit later.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.442
Let's take the second
pairing right over here.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:56.650
So once again you have an 8x.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.630
We want to eliminate the x's.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.240
So this one you have an 8x,
here you have a negative 4x.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.325
If you multiply
this times 2, this

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.950
is going to become
a negative 8x and it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770
can cancel with this top one.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.174
So the top equation is 8x
minus 2y plus 4z is equal to 7.

00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:14.590
When I say "top equation" I'm
talking about this one right

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.530
over here, the top
one in this pairing.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.590
And this bottom
equation, I'm going

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.040
to multiply times negative 2.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.820
I'm going to multiply it
times negative 2-- sorry times

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.280
positive 2.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760
I'm going to multiply
it times positive 2.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.100
Negative 4x times
positive 2 is negative 8x.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.520
So I'm going to
multiply it by 2.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.030
So 2 times negative
4x is negative 8x.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.140
2 times y is plus 2y.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.850
2 times negative
2z is negative 4z.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.787
And then 2 times negative
14 is negative 28.

00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:53.370
And now we can add
the left hand sides

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.080
and add the right hand sides.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.180
These cancel out, those
cancel out, those cancel out.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.430
We actually end up with
nothing on the left hand side.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.480
You get 0 plus 0 plus 0.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630
And on the right hand side
you get 7 plus negative 28

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.550
is negative 21.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.110
Well, this is a
nonsensical answer.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.270
0 can never be equal
to negative 21.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.710
No matter what x,
y, or z you pick,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.800
0 cannot be equal
to negative 21.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.355
And that's because these
second two equations

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:22.730
right over here,
if you view them

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.070
as planes in three dimensions,
these right over here

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.050
do not intersect.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.740
If you visualize them
in three dimensions,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.130
they're actually
parallel planes.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.610
And since these last two
definitely do not intersect,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.360
we can say that this
system has no solutions.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.730
It doesn't matter if this
first equation intersects

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.150
one or both of these.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.320
The fact that these
two don't intersect

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.760
tells us that there's no unique
point x, y, z coordinate,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.170
a point in three dimensions that
satisfies all three of them.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.090
Because there's no
unique x, y, z that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.590
can satisfy these two, because
these are parallel planes.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.609
They do not intersect.
