possible it just takes a bit longer and
 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.390

some places compared to others you know

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
some places compared to others you know
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.880

it would take a very long time to go and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
it would take a very long time to go and
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.830

if it's collapse key is not among those
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.280
if it's collapse key is not among those
four ok so the collapse key concept come

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
four ok so the collapse key concept come
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.370
four ok so the collapse key concept come
from c2dm where every single message

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380
from c2dm where every single message
 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.690

needed to specify one collapse key the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700
needed to specify one collapse key the
 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.650
needed to specify one collapse key the
limit of four was to avoid people to to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
limit of four was to avoid people to to
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.500

use infinite collapse kids to flood the
 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.920
use infinite collapse kids to flood the
devices so we pick it up for in which

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930
devices so we pick it up for in which
 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.080
devices so we pick it up for in which
which means that you have four main

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
which means that you have four main
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.380
which means that you have four main
topics for which you can update your

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390
topics for which you can update your
 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.990
topics for which you can update your
device with messages with GCM we

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
device with messages with GCM we
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.990
device with messages with GCM we
introduced a non collapsible message so

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000
introduced a non collapsible message so
 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.400
introduced a non collapsible message so
you don't have to specify the collapse

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
you don't have to specify the collapse
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.449
you don't have to specify the collapse
key so if you need to send a big number

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459
key so if you need to send a big number
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.370
key so if you need to send a big number
of messages even if it devices offline

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380
of messages even if it devices offline
 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.920
of messages even if it devices offline
you can use that particular one it's

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930
you can use that particular one it's
 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.170
you can use that particular one it's
important to note that it shouldn't be

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
important to note that it shouldn't be
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.570
important to note that it shouldn't be
used for messages that you do want to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580
used for messages that you do want to
 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.700
used for messages that you do want to
collapse like saying the same news that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
collapse like saying the same news that
 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.310
collapse like saying the same news that
has a very same update because we will

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320
has a very same update because we will
 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.290
has a very same update because we will
deliver all those messages down so you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300
deliver all those messages down so you
 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.570
deliver all those messages down so you
can still use this for collapse keys now

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
can still use this for collapse keys now
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.909
can still use this for collapse keys now
we are thinking that this restriction

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919
we are thinking that this restriction
 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.980
we are thinking that this restriction
for GCM doesn't make much sense anymore

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990
for GCM doesn't make much sense anymore
 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.409
for GCM doesn't make much sense anymore
so we might consider to increase the

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419
so we might consider to increase the
 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.000
so we might consider to increase the
number of collapse keys but to answer

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010
number of collapse keys but to answer
 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.760
number of collapse keys but to answer
the question what happens is

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770
the question what happens is
 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.469
the question what happens is
that you should not use more than four

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479
that you should not use more than four
 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.839
that you should not use more than four
because the results is is not definite

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849
because the results is is not definite
 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.749
because the results is is not definite
so if you send messages with six

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759
so if you send messages with six
 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.159
so if you send messages with six
different collapse keys and devices

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169
different collapse keys and devices
 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.499
different collapse keys and devices
offline for of those messages will make

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509
offline for of those messages will make
 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.480
offline for of those messages will make
the device and they're not going to need

when we received your message so if the
 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.830
when we received your message so if the
device is offline we just store it and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
device is offline we just store it and
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.140

numbers I gave at the speak when I had a
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.149
numbers I gave at the speak when I had a
speech at I yo was that roughly we take

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159
speech at I yo was that roughly we take
 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.700
speech at I yo was that roughly we take
95 milliseconds to process a message and

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710
95 milliseconds to process a message and
 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.120
95 milliseconds to process a message and
this is the time to GCM takes from the

there's an unique circumstance I would
say in the best possible case it's

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810
say in the best possible case it's
 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.070
say in the best possible case it's
nearly immediate um the estimate or

nearly immediate um the estimate or
 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.790
nearly immediate um the estimate or

and we are in the work working for
 

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.890
and we are in the work working for
providing a version 2 in which you will

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900
providing a version 2 in which you will
 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.170
providing a version 2 in which you will
be able to query the life of a message

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:34.680
 
ok thank you

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:34.690
 
 

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.690
 
alright alright I guess we didn't have

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:40.700
alright alright I guess we didn't have
 

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.920
alright alright I guess we didn't have
to turn those off you we could just meet

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:41.930
to turn those off you we could just meet
 

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.020
to turn those off you we could just meet
at them too but yes should we do to

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.030
at them too but yes should we do to
 

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.330
at them too but yes should we do to
share Mike's now right so that's why I

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.340
share Mike's now right so that's why I

face next question from moderator is for

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.100
face next question from moderator is for
 

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.100
face next question from moderator is for
an app working with sensitive data what

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.110
an app working with sensitive data what
 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.440
an app working with sensitive data what
solution would you recommend if I need

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:56.450
solution would you recommend if I need
 

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.150
solution would you recommend if I need
to show a login screen every time the

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160
to show a login screen every time the
 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.910
to show a login screen every time the
app comes from the background related to

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920
app comes from the background related to
 

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.160

that is there an easy way to determine

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.170
that is there an easy way to determine
 

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.570
that is there an easy way to determine
if your app is currently in the

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:04.580
if your app is currently in the
 

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.250
if your app is currently in the
background all right I think that this

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:06.260
background all right I think that this
 

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.660
background all right I think that this
is actually a question this come up at

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670
is actually a question this come up at
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.280
is actually a question this come up at
least once before so there's probably

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.290
least once before so there's probably
 

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.050
least once before so there's probably
all right so first off at answer the

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.060
all right so first off at answer the
 

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.430
all right so first off at answer the
question of how do you determine if your

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440
question of how do you determine if your
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.800
question of how do you determine if your
app is in the background all Android

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:17.810
app is in the background all Android
 

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.680

what allows your app to know what its
 

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.450
what allows your app to know what its
current state is and that's pretty much

dialog too frequently so you know be a
 

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.270
dialog too frequently so you know be a
bit cautious about how you do use this

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:00.280
bit cautious about how you do use this
 

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.130
bit cautious about how you do use this
also it's worth noting as far as your

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:03.140
also it's worth noting as far as your
 

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.840
also it's worth noting as far as your
login screen don't go and lock that as a

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:04.850
login screen don't go and lock that as a
 

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.150
login screen don't go and lock that as a
separate activity there's some security

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160
separate activity there's some security
 

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.040
separate activity there's some security
implications there that you can get it

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.050
implications there that you can get it
 

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.390
implications there that you can get it
right if you're careful but it's very

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:10.400
right if you're careful but it's very
 

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.430
right if you're careful but it's very
difficult to get right so my

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440
difficult to get right so my
 

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.840
difficult to get right so my
recommendation there would be just to go

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:13.850
recommendation there would be just to go
 

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.700
recommendation there would be just to go
and swap out your layout for your login

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:15.710
and swap out your layout for your login
 

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.410
and swap out your layout for your login
form without spotting a whole new

form without spotting a whole new
 

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.290
form without spotting a whole new
activity but then that day I think that

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:20.300
activity but then that day I think that
 

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.310
activity but then that day I think that
should answer your question I was going

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320
should answer your question I was going
 

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.470
should answer your question I was going
to add something which is that I have

to add something which is that I have
used apps that have encrypted data in

used apps that have encrypted data in
them and they ask you for a login screen

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:34.520
them and they ask you for a login screen
 

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.090
them and they ask you for a login screen
every time you switch away from them and

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.100
every time you switch away from them and
 

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.890
every time you switch away from them and
switch back which is a little bit of an

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:38.900
switch back which is a little bit of an
 

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.480
switch back which is a little bit of an
annoyance oh it's very

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:40.490
annoyance oh it's very
 

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.639
annoyance oh it's very
oh yeah to call out one app in

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:42.649
oh yeah to call out one app in
 

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:45.250
oh yeah to call out one app in

me absolutely nuts because i log in to

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:49.490
me absolutely nuts because i log in to
 

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.190
me absolutely nuts because i log in to
get my password i switch to the browser

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200
get my password i switch to the browser
 

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.860
get my password i switch to the browser
I enter my password I go back to one

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:53.870
I enter my password I go back to one
 

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.630
I enter my password I go back to one
password and it's locked again and it

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640
password and it's locked again and it
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.540
password and it's locked again and it
hasn't even been you know 30 seconds you

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:58.550
hasn't even been you know 30 seconds you
 

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.920
hasn't even been you know 30 seconds you
know that the phone already has a lock

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930
know that the phone already has a lock
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.639
know that the phone already has a lock
screen so I I'd say at the very least

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:03.649
screen so I I'd say at the very least
 

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:05.290
screen so I I'd say at the very least
make this optional because it's going to

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.300
make this optional because it's going to
 

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.180
make this optional because it's going to
drive a lot of your users nuts to the

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.190
drive a lot of your users nuts to the
 

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.710
drive a lot of your users nuts to the
point where they might switch to other

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720
point where they might switch to other
 

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.690
point where they might switch to other
apps definitely you know definitely

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.700
apps definitely you know definitely
 

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.070
apps definitely you know definitely
don't make it mandatory you know I know

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.080
don't make it mandatory you know I know
 

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.900
don't make it mandatory you know I know
and you know consider that if the user

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:13.910
and you know consider that if the user
 

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.040
and you know consider that if the user
really does want to keep their phone

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.050
really does want to keep their phone
 

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.389
really does want to keep their phone
secure they've probably already set a

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399
secure they've probably already set a
 

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.070
secure they've probably already set a
passcode for the screen as well right

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.080
passcode for the screen as well right
 

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.040
passcode for the screen as well right
and in fairness to one pass I'm aware of

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.050
and in fairness to one pass I'm aware of
 

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.000
and in fairness to one pass I'm aware of
another password app that I use which is

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.010
another password app that I use which is
 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.370
another password app that I use which is
works exactly the same way and I think

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.380
works exactly the same way and I think
 

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.920
works exactly the same way and I think
it was designed with the idea that I

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:29.930
it was designed with the idea that I
 

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.350
it was designed with the idea that I
might leave the phone around without

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
might leave the phone around without
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.290
might leave the phone around without
locking it but I think it's better to

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.300
locking it but I think it's better to
 

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.380
locking it but I think it's better to
just trust the user that the user will

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:38.390
just trust the user that the user will
 

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.840
just trust the user that the user will
know when he or she wants to lock the

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:40.850
know when he or she wants to lock the
 

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.470
know when he or she wants to lock the
phone itself and not and you know having

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480
phone itself and not and you know having
 

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.569
phone itself and not and you know having
to enter the password every time you go

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579
to enter the password every time you go
 

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.880
to enter the password every time you go
in to get at this different password is

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:48.890
in to get at this different password is
 

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.860
in to get at this different password is
a user annoyance so that would be my

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:50.870
a user annoyance so that would be my
 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.980
a user annoyance so that would be my
comment yeah phones are much more

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:53.990
comment yeah phones are much more
 

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.460
comment yeah phones are much more
personal devices than computers so yeah

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.470
personal devices than computers so yeah
 

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.269
personal devices than computers so yeah
keep in mind again a lot of the security

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279
keep in mind again a lot of the security
 

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.790
keep in mind again a lot of the security
considerations you've made you had to

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800
considerations you've made you had to
 

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.110
considerations you've made you had to
make on a computer that makes sense in

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120
make on a computer that makes sense in
 

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.370
make on a computer that makes sense in
the context or phone because it is

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:06.380
the context or phone because it is
 

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.960
the context or phone because it is
something a user typically carries in

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:07.970
something a user typically carries in
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.030

errors I know what they mean but we're

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:18.449
errors I know what they mean but we're
 

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:21.350
errors I know what they mean but we're
like I see index op is kind of like a

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360
like I see index op is kind of like a
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.629
like I see index op is kind of like a
Java lying verify error but with much

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639
Java lying verify error but with much
 

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:28.699
Java lying verify error but with much
less details yeah I'd say I mean our

00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:28.709
less details yeah I'd say I mean our
 

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:31.030
less details yeah I'd say I mean our
documentation there is somewhat sparse

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040
documentation there is somewhat sparse
 

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.230
documentation there is somewhat sparse
partly because you know most of the time

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240
partly because you know most of the time
 

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.460

directly is you know anything that what

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319
directly is you know anything that what
 

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:39.319
directly is you know anything that what
causes errors is normally caught it an

causes errors is normally caught it an
 

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:41.960

custom build you know the chances of
 

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:47.980
custom build you know the chances of
running into those are a bit greater so

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:47.990
running into those are a bit greater so
 

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.480
running into those are a bit greater so
unfortunately you know like I said not

into strings what we are thinking about
 

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.669

is maybe force the JSON to have only

00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679
is maybe force the JSON to have only
 

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:35.860
is maybe force the JSON to have only
parameters with things okay thank you

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:35.870

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.270
in that context is a good skill more
broadly speaking you're going to want to

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:04.280
broadly speaking you're going to want to
 

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.010
broadly speaking you're going to want to
know how to do things with web services

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.020
know how to do things with web services
 

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.290
know how to do things with web services
so understanding concepts like rest o

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:08.300
so understanding concepts like rest o
 

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.470
so understanding concepts like rest o
auth things like that very useful to

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480
auth things like that very useful to
 

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.220
auth things like that very useful to
know really this is it's a very broad

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.230
know really this is it's a very broad
 

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.560
know really this is it's a very broad
question here i could just go down the

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:17.570
question here i could just go down the
 

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.530
question here i could just go down the
list all day but yeah I'd say you've

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:20.540
list all day but yeah I'd say you've
 

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.030
list all day but yeah I'd say you've
already got a pretty strong foundation

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.040
already got a pretty strong foundation
 

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.710
already got a pretty strong foundation
there it really depends on what it is

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720
there it really depends on what it is
 

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.049
there it really depends on what it is
you want to build right you know you

00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:26.059
you want to build right you know you
 

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.640
you want to build right you know you
meet you i mentioned open jail maybe

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:27.650
meet you i mentioned open jail maybe
 

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.049
meet you i mentioned open jail maybe
that me has no bearing on your app i

00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:29.059
that me has no bearing on your app i
 

00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:30.370
that me has no bearing on your app i
don't know i don't know if you want to

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:30.380
don't know i don't know if you want to
 

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.250
don't know i don't know if you want to
do but i'd say you already have a pretty

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:33.260
do but i'd say you already have a pretty
 

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.600
do but i'd say you already have a pretty
strong technical foundation with what

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:34.610
strong technical foundation with what
 

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.930
strong technical foundation with what
you've listed i would certainly agree

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:37.940
you've listed i would certainly agree
 

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.169
you've listed i would certainly agree
with that i would also say that there's

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:41.179
with that i would also say that there's
 

00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:43.720
with that i would also say that there's
really no end to the answer because you

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:43.730
really no end to the answer because you
 

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.370
really no end to the answer because you
can't ever tell what you're going to

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:45.380
can't ever tell what you're going to
 

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.290
can't ever tell what you're going to
need to know a lot of it to my mind

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:47.300
need to know a lot of it to my mind
 

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.820
need to know a lot of it to my mind
depends on what you're trying to

doing something in particular than i
 

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.000
doing something in particular than i
would look at what that company is doing

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.010
would look at what that company is doing
 

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.549
would look at what that company is doing
what type of application space it's in

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559
what type of application space it's in
 

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:03.010
what type of application space it's in
if it's very data-oriented you probably

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.020
if it's very data-oriented you probably
 

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.220
if it's very data-oriented you probably
want to look at something like SQL or on

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:06.230
want to look at something like SQL or on
 

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.790

this space on the other hand if you want

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860
this space on the other hand if you want
 

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.910
this space on the other hand if you want
to be a contractor and independent

developer one of the things you're

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020
developer one of the things you're
 

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.690
developer one of the things you're
probably going to have to do is decide

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700
probably going to have to do is decide
 

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.660
probably going to have to do is decide
on what's most in demand and then focus

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:26.670
on what's most in demand and then focus
 

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.900
on what's most in demand and then focus
on those areas and you may have to sort

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:29.910
on those areas and you may have to sort
 

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.270
on those areas and you may have to sort
of pick up technical skills along the

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:32.280
of pick up technical skills along the
 

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.730
of pick up technical skills along the
way as you're doing a contract um

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740
way as you're doing a contract um
 

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.240
way as you're doing a contract um
there's you know it's there's no way to

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.250
there's you know it's there's no way to
 

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.700
there's you know it's there's no way to
say that you're ever finished with

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:40.710
say that you're ever finished with
 

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.130
say that you're ever finished with
learning stuff that's certainly true I

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:45.140
 
 

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.140
 
think that's a pretty good answer yeah I

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.150
think that's a pretty good answer yeah I
 

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.000
think that's a pretty good answer yeah I
mean Trevor covered a lot of the things

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.010
mean Trevor covered a lot of the things
 

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.590
mean Trevor covered a lot of the things
that I would have covered especially

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600
that I would have covered especially
 

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.360
that I would have covered especially
OpenGL I think that's a really good

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:53.370
OpenGL I think that's a really good
 

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.830
OpenGL I think that's a really good
answer so let's move on is there a rough

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840
answer so let's move on is there a rough
 

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.260
answer so let's move on is there a rough
estimate for when c2dm will be turned

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:00.270
estimate for when c2dm will be turned
 

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.090
estimate for when c2dm will be turned
off and I think we've got the expert

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100
off and I think we've got the expert
 

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.740
off and I think we've got the expert
here that may be able give us an answer

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:03.750
here that may be able give us an answer
 

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.100
here that may be able give us an answer
so c2dm is a deprecated which means we

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:07.110
so c2dm is a deprecated which means we
 

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.410
so c2dm is a deprecated which means we
don't accept any more signups nor record

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:09.420
don't accept any more signups nor record
 

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.370
don't accept any more signups nor record
a request we do not want to break your

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380
a request we do not want to break your
 

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.850
a request we do not want to break your
application so we will give if we will

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860
application so we will give if we will
 

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.560
application so we will give if we will
ever turn them the service is down we

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:18.570
ever turn them the service is down we
 

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.770
ever turn them the service is down we
will give heads up way ahead of time

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:21.780
will give heads up way ahead of time
 

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.750
will give heads up way ahead of time
like at least a year before we decide to

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760
like at least a year before we decide to
 

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.510
like at least a year before we decide to
do so they said I would urge you to

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520
do so they said I would urge you to
 

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.690
do so they said I would urge you to
migrate to the new system before you run

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700
migrate to the new system before you run
 

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.700
migrate to the new system before you run
into quality issues or if you need to

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:31.710
into quality issues or if you need to
 

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.920
into quality issues or if you need to
use in your api's or the client login

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:33.930
use in your api's or the client login
 

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.280
use in your api's or the client login
which is being deprecated you will

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.290
which is being deprecated you will
 

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.790
which is being deprecated you will
actually be deprecated yeah I mean just

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:40.800
actually be deprecated yeah I mean just
 

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.930
actually be deprecated yeah I mean just
to follow up on that you know whenever

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940
to follow up on that you know whenever
 

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.870
to follow up on that you know whenever
we deprecate an API it is a good idea to

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880
we deprecate an API it is a good idea to
 

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.730
we deprecate an API it is a good idea to
go and take a look for alternatives in

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740
go and take a look for alternatives in
 

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.690
go and take a look for alternatives in
the alternative in this case would be

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700
the alternative in this case would be
 

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.700
the alternative in this case would be
GCM and to move there as quickly as you

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:49.710
GCM and to move there as quickly as you
 

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.100
GCM and to move there as quickly as you
can again we don't break your app it's

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.110
can again we don't break your app it's
 

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.590
can again we don't break your app it's
not going to disappear anytime in the

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600
not going to disappear anytime in the
 

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.110
not going to disappear anytime in the
near future you do have time to do a

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120
near future you do have time to do a
 

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.010
near future you do have time to do a
nice orderly migration but please don't

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020
nice orderly migration but please don't
 

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.470
nice orderly migration but please don't
wait to migrate until we actually say

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480
wait to migrate until we actually say
 

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.150
wait to migrate until we actually say
that the servers are going away because

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.160
that the servers are going away because
 

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.160
that the servers are going away because
by then you'll be in a rush start your

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.170
by then you'll be in a rush start your
 

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.840
by then you'll be in a rush start your
migration to GCM now and then you'll be

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:08.850
migration to GCM now and then you'll be
 

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.040
migration to GCM now and then you'll be
in good shape for when they do

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.050
in good shape for when they do
 

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.600
in good shape for when they do
eventually get turned off in the future

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:13.610
eventually get turned off in the future
 

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.240
eventually get turned off in the future
great thank you

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.250
great thank you

books and videos and everything is going
 

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.920
books and videos and everything is going
to depend a lot on where you're coming

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:31.930
to depend a lot on where you're coming
 

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.350
to depend a lot on where you're coming
from if you've done programming and

programming then you may want to look at

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:55.510
programming then you may want to look at
 

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.970
programming then you may want to look at
something that's a little bit more

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:56.980
something that's a little bit more
 

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.910

just starting out I happen to have a
 

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.710
just starting out I happen to have a
book called Java in a nutshell which is

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720
book called Java in a nutshell which is
 

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.750
book called Java in a nutshell which is
an o'reilly book and the reason i have

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760
an o'reilly book and the reason i have
 

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.550
an o'reilly book and the reason i have
it is that it does cover it is a good

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560
it is that it does cover it is a good
 

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.530
it is that it does cover it is a good
introduction in the sense that it takes

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:16.540
introduction in the sense that it takes
 

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.720
introduction in the sense that it takes
you from very simple to very complex but

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:18.730
you from very simple to very complex but
 

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.150
you from very simple to very complex but
it's also a really great reference so

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:21.160
it's also a really great reference so
 

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.870
it's also a really great reference so
since i can't claim to be a java expert

detail without having to switch to a

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:03.470
detail without having to switch to a
 

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.140
detail without having to switch to a
separate activity to look at it and

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:05.150
separate activity to look at it and
 

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.569
separate activity to look at it and
that's very powerful it makes things

00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:07.579
that's very powerful it makes things
 

00:43:07.579 --> 00:43:10.779
that's very powerful it makes things
look it's easy to use but it means that

00:43:10.779 --> 00:43:10.789
look it's easy to use but it means that
 

00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:18.010
look it's easy to use but it means that
there's less work for the user um I have

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:18.020
there's less work for the user um I have
 

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.599
there's less work for the user um I have
to give credit to Daniel Sandler for

00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:19.609
to give credit to Daniel Sandler for
 

00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:34.430
to give credit to Daniel Sandler for
that yes go ahead

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440
 
 

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:45.839
 
no this right right so um the question

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:45.849
no this right right so um the question
 

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:49.230
no this right right so um the question
was can you use a Content observer

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240
was can you use a Content observer
 

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.900
was can you use a Content observer
instead of content provider to monitor a

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:51.910
instead of content provider to monitor a
 

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:55.050
instead of content provider to monitor a
database and if not can you suggest

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:55.060
database and if not can you suggest
 

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.030
database and if not can you suggest
another way of monitoring the database

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040
another way of monitoring the database
 

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.220
another way of monitoring the database
and this sounds like a familiar question

00:43:59.220 --> 00:43:59.230
and this sounds like a familiar question
 

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.560
and this sounds like a familiar question
I think we've discussed this before um

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:01.570
I think we've discussed this before um
 

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.650
I think we've discussed this before um
if not officially in developer office

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:04.660
if not officially in developer office
 

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.160
if not officially in developer office
hours amongst ourselves um I'm not sure

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.170
hours amongst ourselves um I'm not sure
 

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:13.700
hours amongst ourselves um I'm not sure
what the answer is anybody got an idea I

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:13.710
 
 

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.230
 
am as far as the sort of content

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240
am as far as the sort of content
 

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.660
am as far as the sort of content
observer versus content provider 140 I

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:18.670
observer versus content provider 140 I
 

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.620
observer versus content provider 140 I
don't know the answer off the top of my

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:19.630
don't know the answer off the top of my
 

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.900
don't know the answer off the top of my
head either it's I'm drawing a blank but

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:21.910
head either it's I'm drawing a blank but
 

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.670
head either it's I'm drawing a blank but
yeah I mean there's certainly more than

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680
yeah I mean there's certainly more than
 

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.380
yeah I mean there's certainly more than
one way to go and read data out of a

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:25.390
one way to go and read data out of a
 

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.450
one way to go and read data out of a
database know at the end it's all going

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:27.460
database know at the end it's all going
 

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.609
database know at the end it's all going
to boil down to a SQL statement

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:29.619
to boil down to a SQL statement
 

00:44:29.619 --> 00:44:32.190
to boil down to a SQL statement
somewhere it's just what design pattern

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200
somewhere it's just what design pattern
 

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.170
somewhere it's just what design pattern
do you use to go and retrieve that data

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.180
do you use to go and retrieve that data
 

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.820
do you use to go and retrieve that data
and make it accessible to everything

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:35.830
and make it accessible to everything
 

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:39.780
and make it accessible to everything
else rado you you are you literally

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:39.790
else rado you you are you literally
 

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.730
else rado you you are you literally
wrote the book on this so what's your

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:41.740
wrote the book on this so what's your
 

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:54.960
wrote the book on this so what's your
thoughts if you want to content observer

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:54.970
thoughts if you want to content observer
 

00:44:54.970 --> 00:45:06.420
thoughts if you want to content observer
it monitors of cursor right as far as I

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:06.430
it monitors of cursor right as far as I
 

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.829
it monitors of cursor right as far as I
know you should be able to it yeah I

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839
know you should be able to it yeah I
 

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.960
know you should be able to it yeah I
think a cursor is a cursor yeah cursor

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:09.970
think a cursor is a cursor yeah cursor
 

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.720
think a cursor is a cursor yeah cursor
is a cursor and content observer there's

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:12.730
is a cursor and content observer there's
 

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.910
is a cursor and content observer there's
an observer on cursors that I think is

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920
an observer on cursors that I think is
 

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:21.960
an observer on cursors that I think is
independent of content providers right

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:21.970
independent of content providers right
 

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:25.410
independent of content providers right
on the easy answer is look in cursor and

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:25.420
on the easy answer is look in cursor and
 

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:30.810
on the easy answer is look in cursor and
if cursor has a a a set content observer

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:30.820
if cursor has a a a set content observer
 

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.480
if cursor has a a a set content observer
method on it then you can do it because

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:33.490
method on it then you can do it because
 

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.720
method on it then you can do it because
that's how you would do it is set a

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:35.730
that's how you would do it is set a
 

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.310
that's how you would do it is set a
Content observer for a cursor that comes

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:38.320
Content observer for a cursor that comes
 

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.470
Content observer for a cursor that comes
from a database I mean a content

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480
from a database I mean a content
 

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.589
from a database I mean a content
provider all that it really does for SQL

00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599
provider all that it really does for SQL
 

00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:46.170
provider all that it really does for SQL
databases is encapsulate an SQL

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:46.180
databases is encapsulate an SQL
 

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.770
databases is encapsulate an SQL
database and the SQLite database returns

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:49.780
database and the SQLite database returns
 

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.930
database and the SQLite database returns
a cursor and the content provider

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:51.940
a cursor and the content provider
 

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.980
a cursor and the content provider
returns that cursor to the calling

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:54.990
returns that cursor to the calling
 

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.500
returns that cursor to the calling
component so really that's all the

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:58.510
component so really that's all the
 

00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:59.880
component so really that's all the
difference that there is there's nothing

00:45:59.880 --> 00:45:59.890
difference that there is there's nothing
 

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.280
difference that there is there's nothing
magic about a content provider that

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.290
magic about a content provider that
 

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:07.280
magic about a content provider that
automatically does an observation

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.290
 
 

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.050
 
anybody else okay yep so yeah this is

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:10.060
anybody else okay yep so yeah this is
 

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.040
anybody else okay yep so yeah this is
actually probably good tend to mention

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.050
actually probably good tend to mention
 

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.350
actually probably good tend to mention

good point great

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:50.470
 
 

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:54.060
 
two separate bills EG ESPN trunk could

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.070
two separate bills EG ESPN trunk could
 

00:46:54.070 --> 00:47:02.210
two separate bills EG ESPN trunk could
be running on a variety

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220
 
 

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.800
 
okay so the question is is it a good

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:04.810
okay so the question is is it a good
 

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:08.130
okay so the question is is it a good
idea to run separate versions of ADT on

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:08.140
idea to run separate versions of ADT on
 

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.600
idea to run separate versions of ADT on
separate builds and the answer is uh my

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:12.610
separate builds and the answer is uh my
 

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:14.790
separate builds and the answer is uh my
answer would be on you certainly can't

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800
answer would be on you certainly can't
 

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.710
answer would be on you certainly can't
do it in the same version of the clips

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720
do it in the same version of the clips
 

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.840
do it in the same version of the clips
because those are plugins nique I don't

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:18.850
because those are plugins nique I don't
 

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.970
because those are plugins nique I don't
think you can have more than one ATP

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:20.980
think you can have more than one ATP
 

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.860
think you can have more than one ATP
plug-in in the same version of the clips

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:22.870
plug-in in the same version of the clips
 

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.540
plug-in in the same version of the clips
you certainly would run into problems

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:24.550
you certainly would run into problems
 

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.220
you certainly would run into problems
but if you want to have more than one

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.230
but if you want to have more than one
 

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.800
but if you want to have more than one
instance of eclipse on your system then

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:28.810
instance of eclipse on your system then
 

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.360
instance of eclipse on your system then
you should be able to do it yeah well

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:30.370
you should be able to do it yeah well
 

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.160
you should be able to do it yeah well
there is one problem I can see with all

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.170
there is one problem I can see with all
 

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.560
there is one problem I can see with all
this and I mean so the goal here is not

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:34.570
this and I mean so the goal here is not
 

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.360
this and I mean so the goal here is not
only have different versions of ATT but

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:36.370
only have different versions of ATT but
 

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.650
only have different versions of ATT but
also different versions of the android

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:37.660
also different versions of the android
 

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.740
also different versions of the android
framework running to correct um so in

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:40.750
framework running to correct um so in
 

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.510
framework running to correct um so in
that case uh you know there are

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520
that case uh you know there are
 

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.060
that case uh you know there are
different versions of a DB server and

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.070
different versions of a DB server and
 

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.040
different versions of a DB server and
the different versions of the framework

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.050
the different versions of the framework
 

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.390
the different versions of the framework
are going to try and launch different

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400
are going to try and launch different
 

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.940
are going to try and launch different
versions of a DB server and that's going

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:50.950
versions of a DB server and that's going
 

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.030
versions of a DB server and that's going
to cause conflicts so I think even if

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040
to cause conflicts so I think even if
 

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.410
to cause conflicts so I think even if
you're running your different versions

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:55.420
you're running your different versions
 

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.750
you're running your different versions
of the SDKs have different versions of

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760
of the SDKs have different versions of
 

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.310
of the SDKs have different versions of
ADT inside of different versions of

00:47:59.310 --> 00:47:59.320
ADT inside of different versions of
 

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.800
ADT inside of different versions of
eclipse at the end of the day you can

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:01.810
eclipse at the end of the day you can
 

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.450
eclipse at the end of the day you can
only have one version of a DB server

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:03.460
only have one version of a DB server
 

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.530
only have one version of a DB server
running and that's where you're going to

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:04.540
running and that's where you're going to
 

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.710
running and that's where you're going to
run into problems yeah that is a good

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720
run into problems yeah that is a good
 

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.960
run into problems yeah that is a good
point um you'd probably have to do a lot

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:09.970
point um you'd probably have to do a lot
 

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.790
point um you'd probably have to do a lot
of fiddling around with path variables

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800
of fiddling around with path variables
 

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.610
of fiddling around with path variables
and environment variables in order to

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:14.620
and environment variables in order to
 

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.140
and environment variables in order to
get it to work correctly it's probably

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.150
get it to work correctly it's probably
 

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.030
get it to work correctly it's probably
not worth doing I would think that

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040
not worth doing I would think that
 

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.760
not worth doing I would think that
probably what you want to do if you're

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:20.770
probably what you want to do if you're
 

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.320
probably what you want to do if you're
just trying to aim at different

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:22.330
just trying to aim at different
 

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.860
just trying to aim at different
platforms is set up for the highest

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:25.870
platforms is set up for the highest
 

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.780
platforms is set up for the highest
level platform and then you can always

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:27.790
level platform and then you can always
 

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:33.930
level platform and then you can always
aim to a lower API if you want to check

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:33.940
aim to a lower API if you want to check
 

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.780
aim to a lower API if you want to check
for API compatibility yeah I me now all

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:36.790
for API compatibility yeah I me now all
 

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.940
for API compatibility yeah I me now all
at one additional data point here you

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:38.950
at one additional data point here you
 

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.440
at one additional data point here you
know here in the Android team we work

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:40.450
know here in the Android team we work
 

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.730
know here in the Android team we work
with a lot of different versions of the

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:41.740
with a lot of different versions of the
 

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.010
with a lot of different versions of the
android framework and I have never

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:44.020
android framework and I have never
 

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.790
android framework and I have never
installed more than one copy of ADT so I

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800
installed more than one copy of ADT so I
 

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.530
installed more than one copy of ADT so I
think that's not the right approach here

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:49.540
think that's not the right approach here
 

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.360
think that's not the right approach here
I think the right of approach have one

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:51.370
I think the right of approach have one
 

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.180
I think the right of approach have one
version SDK tools one version of ADT and

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:54.190
version SDK tools one version of ADT and
 

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.860
version SDK tools one version of ADT and
you know like Joe said just go ahead and

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:55.870
you know like Joe said just go ahead and
 

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.930
you know like Joe said just go ahead and
you switch what your build targets are

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:57.940
you switch what your build targets are
 

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:59.940
you switch what your build targets are
and that's something that's a perfectly

00:48:59.940 --> 00:48:59.950
and that's something that's a perfectly
 

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:06.500
and that's something that's a perfectly
supported workflow great thank you um

is an API for that we're the wrong ones
ask because we don't we don't run or we

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:19.230
ask because we don't we don't run or we
 

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.740
ask because we don't we don't run or we
we don't write a latitude or google maps

we don't write a latitude or google maps
I believe Maps API has their own office

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:24.630
I believe Maps API has their own office
 

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.420
I believe Maps API has their own office
hours I that would be the right place to

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:26.430
hours I that would be the right place to
 

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:30.080
hours I that would be the right place to
ask yeah I'm familiar with the current

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:30.090
ask yeah I'm familiar with the current

v1 version of on the Maps API for

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:33.570
v1 version of on the Maps API for
 

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.690
v1 version of on the Maps API for
Android and I don't think that it has

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700
Android and I don't think that it has
 

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.670
Android and I don't think that it has
anything like this in it now it doesn't

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680
anything like this in it now it doesn't
 

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.430
anything like this in it now it doesn't
arm but there's there's also i think

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440
arm but there's there's also i think
 

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.849
arm but there's there's also i think
this is not a feature of that component

00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859
this is not a feature of that component
 

00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:46.220
this is not a feature of that component
i think this is more a feature of the

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:46.230
i think this is more a feature of the
 

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.310
i think this is more a feature of the
maps app and the latitude API that the

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:49.320
maps app and the latitude API that the
 

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.010
maps app and the latitude API that the
latitude app and i don't think that they

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020
latitude app and i don't think that they
 

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:58.730
latitude app and i don't think that they
have api is available so go ahead is

00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740
have api is available so go ahead is
 

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.940
have api is available so go ahead is
there there is a latitude API but I

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:01.950
there there is a latitude API but I
 

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.620
there there is a latitude API but I
think it's more for just reporting what

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:03.630
think it's more for just reporting what
 

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.720
think it's more for just reporting what
your location is I don't think at least

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:05.730
your location is I don't think at least
 

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.040
your location is I don't think at least
last time I looked at it which

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.050
last time I looked at it which
 

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.990
last time I looked at it which
admittedly was quite a while ago they

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000
admittedly was quite a while ago they
 

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.250
admittedly was quite a while ago they
didn't have anything to go and get your

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260
didn't have anything to go and get your
 

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.020
didn't have anything to go and get your
auto detected home and work locations

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:12.030
auto detected home and work locations
 

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.750
auto detected home and work locations
okay well I stand corrected which is

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760
okay well I stand corrected which is
 

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.470
okay well I stand corrected which is
pretty much par for the course today um

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480
pretty much par for the course today um
 

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.090
pretty much par for the course today um
well no no the answer is there's no api

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:20.100
well no no the answer is there's no api
 

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.980
well no no the answer is there's no api
for this right the answer for this

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:21.990
for this right the answer for this
 

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:24.050
for this right the answer for this
particular question is there is no api

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.060
particular question is there is no api
 

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.340
particular question is there is no api

we're missing I feel like there's more

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760
we're missing I feel like there's more
 

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.920
we're missing I feel like there's more
to this question that we haven't

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:37.930
to this question that we haven't
 

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:39.600

I'm using the following function to get
all view IDs versus calling fine view

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:48.310
all view IDs versus calling fine view
 

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.120
all view IDs versus calling fine view
I'd view by ID multiple times which does

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.130
I'd view by ID multiple times which does
 

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:55.110
I'd view by ID multiple times which does
a very similar traversal um any has it

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:55.120
a very similar traversal um any has it
 

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.090
a very similar traversal um any has it
in a link I'm guessing this is faster if

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:57.100
in a link I'm guessing this is faster if
 

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.240
in a link I'm guessing this is faster if
you have a high ID versus non-id view

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:00.250
you have a high ID versus non-id view
 

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.690
you have a high ID versus non-id view
group unfortunately we don't i don't

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:03.700

have off hand the link available let me

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:06.070
have off hand the link available let me
 

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:12.770
have off hand the link available let me
go look in the link and see if it's um

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780

map okay he's literally just iterating

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:26.470
map okay he's literally just iterating

data structure that is there um I can't

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:39.580
data structure that is there um I can't
 

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:44.220

tell off hand but um I I think what he's

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:44.230
tell off hand but um I I think what he's

just oh here here go he's like he's

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:45.580
just oh here here go he's like he's

actually area if resource ID is not

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:48.250
actually area if resource ID is not
 

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.360
actually area if resource ID is not
equal to vo no ID and then he said all

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:51.370
equal to vo no ID and then he said all
 

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.890

right oh I see ya mm-hmm I mean honestly

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:55.900

I think you're overthinking things a bit

00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:58.410
I think you're overthinking things a bit
 

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.950
I think you're overthinking things a bit
fine view I by ID is normally the right

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960
fine view I by ID is normally the right
 

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.890
fine view I by ID is normally the right
way to do this and unless you're seeing

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900
way to do this and unless you're seeing
 

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.660
way to do this and unless you're seeing
no actual concrete performance problems

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:06.670
no actual concrete performance problems

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160
which you can use by you know you can
 

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.590

find that out by using a profiling tools

find that out by using a profiling tools
 

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.620
find that out by using a profiling tools
you know things like traceview you know

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:13.630
you know things like traceview you know
 

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:16.290
you know things like traceview you know
unless you're actually seeing a negative

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:16.300
unless you're actually seeing a negative

unless you're actually seeing a negative
performance it there i'd say this is

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680
performance it there i'd say this is
 

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.690
performance it there i'd say this is
probably a case of premature

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:18.700
probably a case of premature
 

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.310
probably a case of premature
optimization the seems like going a bit

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:20.320
optimization the seems like going a bit
 

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.810

overboard to me I've never seen anyone

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:21.820
overboard to me I've never seen anyone

all your your child feels like that

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:28.600
all your your child feels like that
 

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.970
all your your child feels like that
seemed a little off but that's being

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:32.980
seemed a little off but that's being
 

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.130

said you know I'm not going to discount

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.140
said you know I'm not going to discount
 

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.950

the possibility that it might be more

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960
the possibility that it might be more
 

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.839
the possibility that it might be more
you might be faster in certain

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:40.849
you might be faster in certain
 

00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:43.270
you might be faster in certain
situations but really just depend on how

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280
situations but really just depend on how
 

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.400
situations but really just depend on how
you're using it but again unless you're

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:45.410
you're using it but again unless you're
 

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.810
you're using it but again unless you're
seeing a performance impact it seems

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:46.820
seeing a performance impact it seems
 

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.910
seeing a performance impact it seems
like code you might not even need to

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920
like code you might not even need to
 

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.070
like code you might not even need to
worry about I would say if you are

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:51.080
worry about I would say if you are
 

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.690
worry about I would say if you are
seeing a performance impact and that's

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:52.700
seeing a performance impact and that's
 

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.030
seeing a performance impact and that's
actually making it faster the only way I

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040
actually making it faster the only way I
 

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.609
actually making it faster the only way I
could see that being true is if your

00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:57.619
could see that being true is if your
 

00:53:57.619 --> 00:54:00.700
could see that being true is if your
view hierarchy is so complicated and

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:00.710
view hierarchy is so complicated and
 

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.820
view hierarchy is so complicated and
nested that you have much bigger fish to

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:03.830
nested that you have much bigger fish to
 

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.040
nested that you have much bigger fish to
fry yeah if you if you have hundreds and

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.050
fry yeah if you if you have hundreds and
 

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.579
fry yeah if you if you have hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of of your views

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:09.589
hundreds and hundreds of of your views
 

00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:11.020
hundreds and hundreds of of your views
that you're trying to call fine view by

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:11.030
that you're trying to call fine view by
 

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.710
that you're trying to call fine view by
ID on I'm really terrified to think what

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720
ID on I'm really terrified to think what
 

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.000

your view hierarchy actually looks like

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.010
your view hierarchy actually looks like
 

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.310
your view hierarchy actually looks like
that's if it's you're going to be your

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:18.320
that's if it's you're going to be your

that's if it's you're going to be your

to spend more time rendering then you're
 

00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:23.620
to spend more time rendering then you're
going to find spent searching right okay

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:23.630
going to find spent searching right okay
 

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:25.870
going to find spent searching right okay
um let's move on here how does the

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880
um let's move on here how does the
 

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.030
um let's move on here how does the
tablet layout of Google Play manage to

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040
tablet layout of Google Play manage to
 

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.980
tablet layout of Google Play manage to
display two pages at once when you

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:29.990
display two pages at once when you
 

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.740
display two pages at once when you
scroll over to the categories section of

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:32.750
scroll over to the categories section of
 

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:41.410
scroll over to the categories section of
the viewpager hmm yeah I'm not sure what

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:41.420
the viewpager hmm yeah I'm not sure what
 

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:45.420
the viewpager hmm yeah I'm not sure what
you mean by display two pages at once I

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:45.430
you mean by display two pages at once I
 

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:47.800
you mean by display two pages at once I
suspect they've just gone and created a

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:47.810
suspect they've just gone and created a
 

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.660
suspect they've just gone and created a
view that displays both sets of

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:49.670
view that displays both sets of
 

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:51.940
view that displays both sets of
information at once you know could be

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:51.950
information at once you know could be
 

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.589
information at once you know could be
done using fragments that's you know the

00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599
done using fragments that's you know the
 

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:54.670
done using fragments that's you know the
sort of thing that they're designed to

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680
sort of thing that they're designed to
 

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.440
sort of thing that they're designed to
be very good at and you can certainly

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:56.450
be very good at and you can certainly
 

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.620
be very good at and you can certainly
stick fragments inside of a view pager

00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:58.630
stick fragments inside of a view pager
 

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:01.510
stick fragments inside of a view pager
so I think that's the answer the magic

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520
so I think that's the answer the magic
 

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.310
so I think that's the answer the magic
of fragments okay thank you next

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:06.320
of fragments okay thank you next
 

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.990
of fragments okay thank you next

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:31.300
 
yeah is our hardest fixed by any chance

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:31.310
yeah is our hardest fixed by any chance
 

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.850
yeah is our hardest fixed by any chance
know all right yeah we do see a time

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:34.860
know all right yeah we do see a time
 

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.890
know all right yeah we do see a time
