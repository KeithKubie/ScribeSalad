address but it's a list that I think we
can begin to formulate by going back and

creation and publication of scholarship
 

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.890
creation and publication of scholarship
but a critical element that we may not

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:53.900
but a critical element that we may not
 

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.960
but a critical element that we may not
say a whole lot about today is peer

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:55.970
say a whole lot about today is peer
 

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.110

review and peer review is shifting as

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120
review and peer review is shifting as
 

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.500
review and peer review is shifting as
well and the public is being is stepping

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:02.510
well and the public is being is stepping
 

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.250
well and the public is being is stepping
in in many cases as the reviewer as the

this multi-directional
realm of scholarly communication and

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120
realm of scholarly communication and
 

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.360
realm of scholarly communication and
another new player of course is Google

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.370
another new player of course is Google
 

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.000
another new player of course is Google
and more Google and Google doing more

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.010
and more Google and Google doing more
 

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.460

things Google as publisher Google as

disseminator and if it isn't Google it's

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
disseminator and if it isn't Google it's
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.780
disseminator and if it isn't Google it's
somebody else and so we're seeing these

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:28.790
somebody else and so we're seeing these
 

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.269
somebody else and so we're seeing these
new players and changing players and

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279
new players and changing players and
 

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.120
new players and changing players and
then we're also seeing changing law back

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.130
then we're also seeing changing law back
 

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.310
then we're also seeing changing law back
to the theme of copyright which we'll

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320
to the theme of copyright which we'll
 

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.440
to the theme of copyright which we'll
get to in just a moment we're seeing

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.450
get to in just a moment we're seeing
 

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.990
get to in just a moment we're seeing
that there's change in copyright law and

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000
that there's change in copyright law and
 

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.510
that there's change in copyright law and
a lot of that change especially through

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:43.520
a lot of that change especially through
 

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.030
a lot of that change especially through
the last 10 or so years has been in the

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040
the last 10 or so years has been in the
 

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.430
the last 10 or so years has been in the
direction of ramping up copyright

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
direction of ramping up copyright
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.800
direction of ramping up copyright
protection stronger protection for a

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:50.810
protection stronger protection for a
 

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.320
protection stronger protection for a
longer period of years more different

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.330
longer period of years more different
 

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.630
longer period of years more different
types of protection and so the question

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640
types of protection and so the question
 

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.960
types of protection and so the question
of who owns and who then possesses the

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.970
of who owns and who then possesses the
 

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.840
of who owns and who then possesses the
copyright becomes an even more powerful

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:01.850
copyright becomes an even more powerful
 

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.110
copyright becomes an even more powerful
more influential more controlling kind

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120
more influential more controlling kind
 

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.170
more influential more controlling kind
of conclusion and so I'll be talking a

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:08.180
of conclusion and so I'll be talking a
 

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.750
of conclusion and so I'll be talking a
lot in the next few minutes about the

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760
lot in the next few minutes about the
 

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.890
lot in the next few minutes about the
importance of contracts but let's put

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:14.900
importance of contracts but let's put
 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.490
importance of contracts but let's put
those contracts into the context of the

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.500
those contracts into the context of the
 

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.060
those contracts into the context of the
legal framework of copyright here are

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.070
legal framework of copyright here are
 

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.610
legal framework of copyright here are
just a few things that you need to know

just a few things that you need to know
 

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.890
just a few things that you need to know
about copyright to make sense of the

about copyright to make sense of the
rest of the subject first copyright law

pause again and think about that

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.070
pause again and think about that
 

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.930
pause again and think about that
question of ownership of the copyright

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:57.940
question of ownership of the copyright
 

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.180
question of ownership of the copyright
ownership of the scholarship we're

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.190
ownership of the scholarship we're
 

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.610

talking about rights legal rights

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:03.620
talking about rights legal rights
 

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.220
talking about rights legal rights
broadening legal rights that somebody

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:06.230
broadening legal rights that somebody
 

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.790
broadening legal rights that somebody
now will possess for many many many

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800
now will possess for many many many
 

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.850
now will possess for many many many
decades to come so there's our

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:12.860
decades to come so there's our
 

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.670
decades to come so there's our
foundation now let's go to the issue of

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680
foundation now let's go to the issue of
 

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.180
foundation now let's go to the issue of
ownership in particular and examine it

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:19.190
ownership in particular and examine it
 

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.210
ownership in particular and examine it
in this context who owns the copyright

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.220
in this context who owns the copyright
 

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.220
in this context who owns the copyright
if we asked that question

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.230
if we asked that question
 

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.830
if we asked that question
we kind of get an answer and we're gonna

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:26.840
we kind of get an answer and we're gonna
 

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.740
we kind of get an answer and we're gonna
get a reasonably clear answer in most

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:29.750
get a reasonably clear answer in most
 

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.740
get a reasonably clear answer in most
cases but let's struggle a little bit we

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:32.750
cases but let's struggle a little bit we
 

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.740
cases but let's struggle a little bit we
have our basic rule that if we default

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:35.750
have our basic rule that if we default
 

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.740
have our basic rule that if we default
to the law who owns the copyright in

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:38.750
to the law who owns the copyright in
 

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.140
to the law who owns the copyright in

then we start to have joint copyright

00:12:59.740 --> 00:12:59.750
then we start to have joint copyright
 

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.050
then we start to have joint copyright
ownership and we can have multiple

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.060
ownership and we can have multiple
 

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.980
ownership and we can have multiple
authors sharing in the copyright I hope

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:05.990
authors sharing in the copyright I hope
 

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.380

you're starting to see the possibilities

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:08.390
you're starting to see the possibilities
 

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.440
you're starting to see the possibilities
of confusion we'll come back to that too

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.450
of confusion we'll come back to that too
 

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.890
of confusion we'll come back to that too
now sometimes I call the the second half

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:14.900
now sometimes I call the the second half
 

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.320
now sometimes I call the the second half
of the slide appear exceptions to that

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:17.330
of the slide appear exceptions to that
 

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.540

rule that's not really quite right let's

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.550
rule that's not really quite right let's
 

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.460
rule that's not really quite right let's
think about them as alternatives so

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:21.470
think about them as alternatives so
 

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.410
think about them as alternatives so
basic rule I'm the one who wrote the

copyright well here's some alternatives

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560
copyright well here's some alternatives
 

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.830
copyright well here's some alternatives
to how that could come out first is the

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:29.840
to how that could come out first is the
 

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.850
to how that could come out first is the
concept of work made for hire if I

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:33.860
concept of work made for hire if I
 

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.150
concept of work made for hire if I
created that work particularly in the

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160
created that work particularly in the
 

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.020
created that work particularly in the
context of being an employee acting

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.030
context of being an employee acting
 

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.110
context of being an employee acting
within the scope of my employment my

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120
within the scope of my employment my
 

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.960
within the scope of my employment my
duties at the University for example

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:45.970
duties at the University for example
 

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.240
duties at the University for example
then that could qualify as a work made

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.250
then that could qualify as a work made
 

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.050
then that could qualify as a work made
for hire in which case my employer owns

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.060
for hire in which case my employer owns
 

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.440
for hire in which case my employer owns
the copyright to that particular work so

list is transfers very important for our

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:03.980
list is transfers very important for our
 

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.640
list is transfers very important for our
topic today that week that we might

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:06.650
topic today that week that we might
 

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.920
topic today that week that we might
conclude I own the copyright or you own

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:08.930
conclude I own the copyright or you own
 

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.170
conclude I own the copyright or you own
the copyright but we might not want that

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.180
the copyright but we might not want that

result for whatever reason the law

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.430
result for whatever reason the law
 

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.000
result for whatever reason the law
allows us to shift that copyright and

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.010
allows us to shift that copyright and
 

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.820
allows us to shift that copyright and
move it to somebody else but that we

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:18.830
move it to somebody else but that we
 

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.560
move it to somebody else but that we
need to take care of through an

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:20.570
need to take care of through an
 

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.260
need to take care of through an
agreement and then very important on the

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:23.270
agreement and then very important on the
 

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.930
agreement and then very important on the
list is divisibility the notion that the

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:25.940
list is divisibility the notion that the
 

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.260
list is divisibility the notion that the
copyright is not one cohesive Hall it

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:29.270
copyright is not one cohesive Hall it
 

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.480
copyright is not one cohesive Hall it
could be treated in that manner but it

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.490
could be treated in that manner but it
 

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.570
could be treated in that manner but it
doesn't have to be and so the law gives

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:34.580
doesn't have to be and so the law gives
 

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.200
doesn't have to be and so the law gives
us an opportunity to be able to take the

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.210
us an opportunity to be able to take the
 

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.470
us an opportunity to be able to take the
thing called the copyright and unbundle

it to break it up into its pieces and
 

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.810
it to break it up into its pieces and
maybe I only want some pieces and you

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:46.820
maybe I only want some pieces and you
 

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.790
maybe I only want some pieces and you
want other pieces and somebody else

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800
want other pieces and somebody else
 

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.970
want other pieces and somebody else
wants yet another set of pieces we can

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:51.980
wants yet another set of pieces we can
 

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.150
wants yet another set of pieces we can
do that we can do that but now step back

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160
do that we can do that but now step back
 

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.640
do that we can do that but now step back
from the slide a little bit let's let's

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:57.650
from the slide a little bit let's let's
 

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.430
from the slide a little bit let's let's
emphasize a few larger points we've got

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440
emphasize a few larger points we've got
 

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.850
emphasize a few larger points we've got
some defaults in the law the way the law

will say it's mine or it's yours
 

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.160
will say it's mine or it's yours
but in that deep

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.170
but in that deep
 

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.340
but in that deep
fault all that the law will do is grant

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.350

all rights to that one party so first if
 

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.650
all rights to that one party so first if
we want a different result not you

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:19.660
we want a different result not you
 

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.259
we want a different result not you
owning it but me owning it then we need

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:22.269
owning it but me owning it then we need
 

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:23.850
owning it but me owning it then we need
to make sure that we attend to that

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:23.860
to make sure that we attend to that
 

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.460
to make sure that we attend to that
through a proper transfer or if we want

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.470
through a proper transfer or if we want
 

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.740
through a proper transfer or if we want
a sharing of the copyright and

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:28.750
a sharing of the copyright and
 

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.129
a sharing of the copyright and
unbundling we have to attend to that in

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:32.139
unbundling we have to attend to that in
 

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.889
unbundling we have to attend to that in
a proper writing in a proper instrument

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:34.899
a proper writing in a proper instrument
 

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:38.370
a proper writing in a proper instrument
and again in both cases this is where

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:38.380
and again in both cases this is where
 

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.220
and again in both cases this is where
the contract comes in let's talk about

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.230
the contract comes in let's talk about
 

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.040
the contract comes in let's talk about
it the benefits of having a publication

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.050
it the benefits of having a publication
 

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.460
it the benefits of having a publication
agreement it can provide for

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:46.470
agreement it can provide for
 

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.550
agreement it can provide for
fundamentally on our topic for today a

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560
fundamentally on our topic for today a
 

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.310
fundamentally on our topic for today a
clarification of rights and a sharing of

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.320
clarification of rights and a sharing of
 

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.720
clarification of rights and a sharing of
rights it can do those two things in a

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:57.730
rights it can do those two things in a
 

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.800
rights it can do those two things in a
way that the law cannot adequately

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:00.810
way that the law cannot adequately
 

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.550
way that the law cannot adequately
accomplish defaulting to the law is

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560
accomplish defaulting to the law is
 

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.550
accomplish defaulting to the law is
likely to cause more confusion and more

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560
likely to cause more confusion and more
 

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.370
likely to cause more confusion and more
questions so in almost all cases an

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:11.380
questions so in almost all cases an
 

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.170
questions so in almost all cases an
agreement is going to be an improvement

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.180
agreement is going to be an improvement
 

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.720
agreement is going to be an improvement
because the agreement can get us away

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:15.730
because the agreement can get us away
 

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.850
because the agreement can get us away
from thinking about that dinosaur the

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:17.860
from thinking about that dinosaur the
 

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.280
from thinking about that dinosaur the
monolith of the copyright and breaking

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.290
monolith of the copyright and breaking
 

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.769
monolith of the copyright and breaking
it up and sharing it the contract can

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:22.779
it up and sharing it the contract can
 

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:25.410
it up and sharing it the contract can
help us get away from the confusion is

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:25.420
help us get away from the confusion is
 

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.110
help us get away from the confusion is
it mine or is it yours work-for-hire is

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120
it mine or is it yours work-for-hire is
 

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.449
it mine or is it yours work-for-hire is
it mine or is it yours as my employer

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:30.459
it mine or is it yours as my employer
 

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:32.759
it mine or is it yours as my employer
and it can get us away from that and

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:32.769
and it can get us away from that and
 

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:35.819
and it can get us away from that and
resolve the confusion that comes from

00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:35.829
resolve the confusion that comes from
 

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.829
resolve the confusion that comes from
those questions so an agreement

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839
those questions so an agreement
 

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:40.800
those questions so an agreement
immediately on this point has some

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:40.810
immediately on this point has some
 

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.280
immediately on this point has some
critical importance so what should a

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.290
critical importance so what should a
 

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.040
critical importance so what should a
good publication agreement have here are

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.050
good publication agreement have here are
 

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.889
good publication agreement have here are
a few elements of a good agreement it

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:49.899
a few elements of a good agreement it
 

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.319
a few elements of a good agreement it
should have and in a some kind of

00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:52.329
should have and in a some kind of
 

00:16:52.329 --> 00:16:54.780
should have and in a some kind of
confirmation if it's my agreement with

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:54.790
confirmation if it's my agreement with

again there are always exceptions as
 

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:20.480
again there are always exceptions as
there are in the policy here and

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.490
there are in the policy here and

there are in the policy here and
elsewhere so we have some little bit of

00:22:23.749 --> 00:22:23.759
elsewhere so we have some little bit of
 

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.450
elsewhere so we have some little bit of
uncertainty there until we resolve it

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460
uncertainty there until we resolve it
 

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.350
uncertainty there until we resolve it
and so options see the better answer the

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360
and so options see the better answer the
 

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.080
and so options see the better answer the
contract the contract is a chance to

the answer that actually serves us
better and then option D what's my final

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:41.850
better and then option D what's my final

with some minor delay eventually the
 

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.559
with some minor delay eventually the
material goes up on the open web so

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:01.569
material goes up on the open web so
 

00:36:01.569 --> 00:36:03.839

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:37.630
regard too so I think you know my my
 

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.600
regard too so I think you know my my
takeaway from this would be to tip for

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:39.610
takeaway from this would be to tip for
 

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:42.420
takeaway from this would be to tip for
us to be conscious producers of the

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:42.430
us to be conscious producers of the
 

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.740
us to be conscious producers of the
articles that we're putting out there

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:43.750
articles that we're putting out there

and to think about ways the actions you

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:46.630
and to think about ways the actions you
 

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.060
and to think about ways the actions you
can take from the inception of that

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.070
can take from the inception of that
 

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.220
can take from the inception of that
article to ensure that your scholarship

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:50.230
article to ensure that your scholarship
 

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.250
article to ensure that your scholarship
can be accessed and then used in all of

the ways you might envision for not only
yourself but for future generations of

yourself but for future generations of
scholars I'll close with by just putting

01:05:59.490 --> 01:05:59.500
scholars I'll close with by just putting
 

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.360

not mutually exclusive you can still get

not mutually exclusive you can still get
an income stream even though you're

01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:58.560
an income stream even though you're
 

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.910
an income stream even though you're
putting stuff out in a repository for

example I was just looking at the books

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:03.570
example I was just looking at the books
 

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:07.990
example I was just looking at the books
of a small law journal in law school and

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000
of a small law journal in law school and
 

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.760
of a small law journal in law school and
even though they basically published by

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:10.770
even though they basically published by

website they also allow aggregators to
 

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.410
website they also allow aggregators to
take their material and serve it up

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420
take their material and serve it up
 

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.290
take their material and serve it up
through their aggregator services and

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:20.300
through their aggregator services and
 

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.460
through their aggregator services and
they get a quarter of their income

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:22.470
they get a quarter of their income
 

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.830
they get a quarter of their income
through royalties from that process and

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:24.840
through royalties from that process and
 

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.670
through royalties from that process and
so the notion that one kills the other

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680
so the notion that one kills the other
 

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.580
so the notion that one kills the other
is a totally false overstated notion I

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:31.590
is a totally false overstated notion I
 

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.840
is a totally false overstated notion I
think so questions for the panelists

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:34.850
think so questions for the panelists
 

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:43.899
think so questions for the panelists
what is the to stop inflation

01:07:43.899 --> 01:07:43.909
 
 

01:07:43.909 --> 01:07:47.419
 
anybody good well yeah I mean you do

01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:47.429
anybody good well yeah I mean you do
 

01:07:47.429 --> 01:07:48.979
anybody good well yeah I mean you do
realize that's a totally different

01:07:48.979 --> 01:07:48.989
realize that's a totally different
 

01:07:48.989 --> 01:07:50.599
realize that's a totally different
question from everything we've been

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:50.609
question from everything we've been
 

01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:53.209
question from everything we've been
talking about realize that it's relevant

01:07:53.209 --> 01:07:53.219
talking about realize that it's relevant
 

01:07:53.219 --> 01:07:55.159
talking about realize that it's relevant
yeah tell me tell me tell me what you're

01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:55.169
yeah tell me tell me tell me what you're
 

01:07:55.169 --> 01:07:57.349
yeah tell me tell me tell me what you're
thinking others please help me out here

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359
thinking others please help me out here
 

01:07:57.359 --> 01:08:04.349
thinking others please help me out here
tell me what you're thinking of

01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359
 
 

01:08:04.359 --> 01:08:06.870
 
I have nothing what is that can you give

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880
I have nothing what is that can you give
 

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.920
I have nothing what is that can you give
us an example of what it concerns you

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:09.930
us an example of what it concerns you
 

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.099
us an example of what it concerns you
yeah yeah go ahead suppose a certain

01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:14.109
yeah yeah go ahead suppose a certain
 

01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:17.189
yeah yeah go ahead suppose a certain
scholar writes an article or a book but

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199
scholar writes an article or a book but
 

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:22.390
scholar writes an article or a book but
the work is published

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400
 
 

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.030
 
perhaps after leaving the university and

01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040
perhaps after leaving the university and
 

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.130
perhaps after leaving the university and
then somebody else takes on us the same

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:30.140
then somebody else takes on us the same
 

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.050
then somebody else takes on us the same
position that the scholar had perhaps

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.060
position that the scholar had perhaps
 

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.649
position that the scholar had perhaps
uses her name or

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:37.659
uses her name or
 

01:08:37.659 --> 01:08:47.160
uses her name or
but anyway or in fact I mean that's

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:47.170
but anyway or in fact I mean that's
 

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:50.609
but anyway or in fact I mean that's
that's just a risk that exists in the

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:50.619
that's just a risk that exists in the
 

01:08:50.619 --> 01:08:52.829
that's just a risk that exists in the
scholarly environment and nothing

01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839
scholarly environment and nothing
 

01:08:52.839 --> 01:08:56.669
scholarly environment and nothing
so that risk doesn't change whether the

01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679
so that risk doesn't change whether the
 

01:08:56.679 --> 01:08:59.640
so that risk doesn't change whether the
access is open or not again I would

01:08:59.640 --> 01:08:59.650
access is open or not again I would
 

01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:01.649
access is open or not again I would
argue if we had machine access to the

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:01.659
argue if we had machine access to the
 

01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:03.990
argue if we had machine access to the
literature we could actually use the

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000
literature we could actually use the
 

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.849
literature we could actually use the
machines to help detect that kind of

01:09:05.849 --> 01:09:05.859
machines to help detect that kind of
 

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:08.069
machines to help detect that kind of
plagiarism better which is what the

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:08.079
plagiarism better which is what the
 

01:09:08.079 --> 01:09:10.140
plagiarism better which is what the
Turnitin service tries to do with

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:10.150
Turnitin service tries to do with
 

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:12.569
Turnitin service tries to do with
student plagiarism so again that would

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:12.579
student plagiarism so again that would
 

01:09:12.579 --> 01:09:14.819
student plagiarism so again that would
for me be an argument for web you know

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:14.829
for me be an argument for web you know
 

01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:16.829
for me be an argument for web you know
if we had a web 2.0 environment

01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839
if we had a web 2.0 environment
 

01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:19.559
if we had a web 2.0 environment
information environment we'd have tools

01:09:19.559 --> 01:09:19.569
information environment we'd have tools
 

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.209
information environment we'd have tools
to help deal with that problem better

01:09:21.209 --> 01:09:21.219
to help deal with that problem better
 

01:09:21.219 --> 01:09:23.129
to help deal with that problem better
but I don't think I don't think open

01:09:23.129 --> 01:09:23.139
but I don't think I don't think open
 

01:09:23.139 --> 01:09:24.809
but I don't think I don't think open
access I do think it's sort of

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:24.819
access I do think it's sort of
 

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.849
access I do think it's sort of
orthogonal to what we're talking about

01:09:26.849 --> 01:09:26.859
orthogonal to what we're talking about
 

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:29.879
orthogonal to what we're talking about
here and and and I'll just have it add a

here and and and I'll just have it add a
 

01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:31.829

know if they couldn't pick it up on the
camera the the question was about

01:09:36.209 --> 01:09:36.219
camera the the question was about
 

01:09:36.219 --> 01:09:38.180
camera the the question was about
plagiarism and identity theft

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:38.190
plagiarism and identity theft
 

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:41.089
plagiarism and identity theft
extraordinarily important issues

and I would say this and I have said

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120
and I would say this and I have said
 

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.290
and I would say this and I have said
this to individuals to universities if

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:07.300
this to individuals to universities if
 

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.060
this to individuals to universities if
you've got something that you really

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:09.070
you've got something that you really
 

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.970
you've got something that you really
need to nail down and you see dispute on

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:11.980
need to nail down and you see dispute on
 

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.570
need to nail down and you see dispute on
the horizon there's enough at stake you

01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:15.580
the horizon there's enough at stake you
 

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.800
the horizon there's enough at stake you
better get the parties at the table

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:16.810
better get the parties at the table
 

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:18.540
better get the parties at the table
write it down and get them to sign it

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:18.550
write it down and get them to sign it
 

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.060
write it down and get them to sign it
yeah that is that realistic in the

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:21.070
yeah that is that realistic in the
 

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.510
yeah that is that realistic in the
routine environment no but and and our

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520
routine environment no but and and our
 

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.610
routine environment no but and and our
people likely to dispute that in the

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:26.620
people likely to dispute that in the
 

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.400
people likely to dispute that in the
routine case no but if you've got the

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:29.410
routine case no but if you've got the
 

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:32.100
routine case no but if you've got the
not routine situation you better get the

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:32.110
not routine situation you better get the
 

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:33.690
not routine situation you better get the
parties to the table and write it up and

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:33.700
parties to the table and write it up and
 

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.840
parties to the table and write it up and
sign it yeah it's a from the lawyers

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:36.850
sign it yeah it's a from the lawyers
 

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:38.280
sign it yeah it's a from the lawyers
perspective this is an interesting

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:38.290
perspective this is an interesting
 

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.950
perspective this is an interesting
situation because the entire discussion

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960
situation because the entire discussion
 

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.650
situation because the entire discussion
is built on a very rickety foundation

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:43.660
is built on a very rickety foundation
 

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.600
is built on a very rickety foundation
and it's basically because there was a

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:45.610
and it's basically because there was a
 

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:48.510
and it's basically because there was a
change in copyright law prior to 1976

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520
change in copyright law prior to 1976
 

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.000
change in copyright law prior to 1976
the work-for-hire doctrines had a

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:51.010
the work-for-hire doctrines had a
 

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:54.000
the work-for-hire doctrines had a
teacher exception where the because the

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:54.010
teacher exception where the because the
 

01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:55.680
teacher exception where the because the
work-for-hire lease be attached yeah

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:55.690
work-for-hire lease be attached yeah
 

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:57.720
work-for-hire lease be attached yeah
well they're the courts had created the

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:57.730
well they're the courts had created the
 

01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:59.190
well they're the courts had created the
doctrine and so they could create their

01:13:59.190 --> 01:13:59.200
doctrine and so they could create their
 

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.600
doctrine and so they could create their
own exceptions so there was a lot of

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:00.610
own exceptions so there was a lot of
 

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:03.270
own exceptions so there was a lot of
fluidity in it and then in 1976 Congress

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280
fluidity in it and then in 1976 Congress
 

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.310
fluidity in it and then in 1976 Congress
says we're gonna write it down and they

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320
says we're gonna write it down and they
 

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.530
says we're gonna write it down and they
wrote it down just saying if you're an

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:07.540
wrote it down just saying if you're an
 

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.750
wrote it down just saying if you're an
employee it's in the scope of employment

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760
employee it's in the scope of employment
 

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.810
employee it's in the scope of employment
the your employer is the author so as

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:12.820
the your employer is the author so as
 

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.340
the your employer is the author so as
long as we would agree that a scholar

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:14.350
long as we would agree that a scholar
 

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.670
long as we would agree that a scholar
writing an article is in the scope of

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:16.680
writing an article is in the scope of
 

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.640
writing an article is in the scope of
employment then the flat text of the law

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:20.650
employment then the flat text of the law
 

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:24.360
employment then the flat text of the law
says the university owns it but lawyers

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:24.370
says the university owns it but lawyers
 

01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.510
says the university owns it but lawyers
we have interpretive methodologies and

we have interpretive methodologies and

we have interpretive methodologies and
we can write so it's not at all clear

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040
we can write so it's not at all clear
 

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.310
we can write so it's not at all clear
that that's actually what the law is and

the incentive to bring this to court and
seek a final resolution but there is a

01:19:15.469 --> 01:19:15.479
patents so patents are often singled out

in these agreements and left with you
 

01:19:18.059 --> 01:19:19.729
in these agreements and left with you
and then if you're part of the

01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739
and then if you're part of the
 

01:19:19.739 --> 01:19:22.399
and then if you're part of the
university you're duty-bound to report

01:19:22.399 --> 01:19:22.409
university you're duty-bound to report
 

01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:24.319
university you're duty-bound to report
that to the University that's your

01:19:24.319 --> 01:19:24.329
that to the University that's your
 

01:19:24.329 --> 01:19:27.259
that to the University that's your
typical way that those pieces would flow

01:19:27.259 --> 01:19:27.269
typical way that those pieces would flow
 

01:19:27.269 --> 01:19:35.939
typical way that those pieces would flow
I hope that's helpful

01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:35.949
 
 

01:19:35.949 --> 01:19:49.229
 
Yeah right

01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239
 
 

01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:52.060

everyone heard so the thing is they're

01:19:59.589 --> 01:19:59.599
everyone heard so the thing is they're
 

01:19:59.599 --> 01:20:01.600
everyone heard so the thing is they're
too copyrighted works here that are then

too copyrighted works here that are then

mixed there's the copyright in the soft

mixed there's the copyright in the soft

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:05.030
so problem is the software is both
 

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:07.060

potentially patentable and a copyrighted

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:07.070
potentially patentable and a copyrighted
 

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:08.500
potentially patentable and a copyrighted
work let's just talk about it as a

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:08.510
work let's just talk about it as a
 

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:10.750
work let's just talk about it as a
copyrighted work of authorship and then

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760
copyrighted work of authorship and then
 

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.339
copyrighted work of authorship and then
there's the copyright in the in the

01:20:12.339 --> 01:20:12.349
there's the copyright in the in the
 

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:14.620
there's the copyright in the in the
article but the article reports a little

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:14.630
article but the article reports a little
 

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:17.199
article but the article reports a little
bit of this as well right so this is an

01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:17.209
bit of this as well right so this is an
 

01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:18.759
bit of this as well right so this is an
open source that means it's under a

but if you make a derivative work from
 

01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:33.729
but if you make a derivative work from
it you have to license your derivative

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:33.739
it you have to license your derivative
 

01:20:33.739 --> 01:20:36.009
it you have to license your derivative
work under the same license you took my

01:20:36.009 --> 01:20:36.019
work under the same license you took my
 

01:20:36.019 --> 01:20:38.259
work under the same license you took my
pieces of code from so it's an open

01:20:38.259 --> 01:20:38.269
pieces of code from so it's an open
 

01:20:38.269 --> 01:20:41.109

now if I put that into this copyright at
 

01:20:43.579 --> 01:20:45.459
now if I put that into this copyright at
work and I tell the publisher I'm giving

01:20:45.459 --> 01:20:45.469

that's got these few pieces that are

01:20:49.569 --> 01:20:49.579
that's got these few pieces that are

definitely depends on what the

many lines of code I mean because

01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:04.729
many lines of code I mean because
 

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:07.600
many lines of code I mean because
they're exceptions it's so that if it's

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:07.610
they're exceptions it's so that if it's
 

01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:09.549
they're exceptions it's so that if it's
only a few lines of code and it's the

only a few lines of code and it's the
 

01:21:09.559 --> 01:21:12.310
only a few lines of code and it's the
algorithm you know it's not clear that

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320
algorithm you know it's not clear that
 

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.679
algorithm you know it's not clear that
this that that that's even enough

01:21:14.679 --> 01:21:14.689
this that that that's even enough

copyrightable expression to trigger the
problem you've posed but it is it is the

I've written this work I own a copyright
in my expression but the total amount of

places so art history has this problem

01:21:31.299 --> 01:21:31.309
places so art history has this problem
 

01:21:31.309 --> 01:21:33.790
places so art history has this problem
all the time right of what do we do and

01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800
all the time right of what do we do and
 

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.709
all the time right of what do we do and
and usually the publishers in those

01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719
and usually the publishers in those
 

01:21:35.719 --> 01:21:38.410
and usually the publishers in those
disciplines have in their agreements

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:38.420
disciplines have in their agreements
 

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.569
disciplines have in their agreements
some clearance you know you you

01:21:40.569 --> 01:21:40.579
some clearance you know you you
 

01:21:40.579 --> 01:21:42.520
some clearance you know you you
represent that I cleared the rights and

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:42.530
represent that I cleared the rights and

represent that I cleared the rights and
in this case you're the both copyright

01:21:44.169 --> 01:21:44.179
in this case you're the both copyright
 

01:21:44.179 --> 01:21:46.299
in this case you're the both copyright
owners so you say yeah I got the rights

01:21:46.299 --> 01:21:46.309
owners so you say yeah I got the rights
 

01:21:46.309 --> 01:21:50.810

that's exactly right and and if you're

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:53.160
that's exactly right and and if you're
 

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.490
that's exactly right and and if you're
talking about including those lines than

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500
talking about including those lines than
 

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.200
talking about including those lines than
in your article I mean remember I

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:57.210
in your article I mean remember I
 

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.660
in your article I mean remember I
mentioned third party material at some

01:21:59.660 --> 01:21:59.670
mentioned third party material at some
 

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.970
mentioned third party material at some
point in the presentation yours is like

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980
point in the presentation yours is like
 

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.190
point in the presentation yours is like
that in some ways it's a little

01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:04.200
that in some ways it's a little
 

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.470
that in some ways it's a little
different from a quotation from another

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040
open source which is even better you
 

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.380
open source which is even better you
know because then you may not have to

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:15.390
know because then you may not have to
 

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.300

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:13.850
schools but they started with a big
 

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:16.060
schools but they started with a big
mainstay school of faculty of Arts and

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:16.070
mainstay school of faculty of Arts and
 

01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:17.020
mainstay school of faculty of Arts and
Sciences

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:17.030

and and while we have that kind of

01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520
and and while we have that kind of
 

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.049
and and while we have that kind of
school we don't have the Senate the

01:45:23.049 --> 01:45:23.059
school we don't have the Senate the
 

01:45:23.059 --> 01:45:25.950

and so even there there's unevenness

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:31.250
and so even there there's unevenness
 

01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:33.339
and so even there there's unevenness
across the institution so that's been

01:45:33.339 --> 01:45:33.349
across the institution so that's been
 

01:45:33.349 --> 01:45:35.200
