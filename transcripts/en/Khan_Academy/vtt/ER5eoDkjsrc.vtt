00:00:01.083 --> 00:00:03.521
- [Narrator] Consider the left
and right Riemann sums that

00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.572
would approximate the area
under y is equal to g of x

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:10.679
between x equals two and x equals eight.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.515
We want to approximate this
light blue area right here.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:18.723
Are the approximations over
estimations or underestimations?

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:20.321
So, let's just think about each of them.

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.741
Let's consider the left
and right Riemann sums.

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.954
First the left.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.945
I'm just gonna write left for
short but I'm talking about

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:27.611
the left Riemann sum.

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.322
They don't tell us how many
subdivisions to make for

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.305
our approximation so
that's up to us to decide.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.364
Let's say we went with three subdivisions.

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:37.927
Let's say we want to make them equal.

00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:39.964
They don't have to be,
but let's say we do.

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:41.764
The first one would go from two to four,

00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:43.586
the next one would go from four to six,

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.834
and the next one would
go from six to eight.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.320
If we do a left Riemann sum,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.437
you use the left side of
each of these subdivisions

00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:51.935
in order to find the height.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.319
You evaluate the function at
the left end of each of those

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.482
subdivisions for the height of
our approximating rectangles.

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:02.649
We would use g of two to
set the height of our first

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:08.688
approximating rectangle, just like that.

00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:13.233
Then we would use g of four
for the next rectangle.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.227
We would be right over there.

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:19.728
Then you would use g of six
to represent the height of

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:24.128
our third and our final
rectangle, right over there.

00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:27.681
Now, when it's drawn out like
this, it's pretty clear that

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.848
our left Riemann sum is going
to be an overestimation.

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:35.341
Why do we know that?

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.311
Because these rectangles, the
area that they're trying to

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.517
approximate is contained
in the rectangles.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.869
And these rectangles have
this surplus area so they're

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.758
always going to be larger than the areas

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:47.831
that they're trying to approximate.

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:48.783
And in general,

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:51.442
if you have a function that's
decreasing over the interval

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:53.229
that we care about right over here,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.731
strictly decreasing the entire time.

00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:59.103
If you use the left edge of
each subdivision to approximate,

00:01:59.103 --> 00:02:01.251
you're going to have an overestimate.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.483
Because the left edge,

00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:03.905
the value of the function there,

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:06.044
is going to be higher than
the value of the function at

00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.235
any of the point in the subdivision.

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.644
That's why for decreasing function,

00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:14.144
the left Riemann sum is going
to be an overestimation.

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:17.887
Now let's think about the
right Riemann sum and you might

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.985
already guess that's
going to be the opposite

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:21.587
but let's visualize that.

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:24.303
Let's just go with the
same three subdivisions.

00:02:24.303 --> 00:02:27.094
But now let's use the
right side of each of these

00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:30.114
subdivisions to define the height.

00:02:30.114 --> 00:02:32.515
For this first rectangle the
height is going to be defined

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:33.598
by g of four.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.678
That's right over there.

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:39.506
And then for the second one
it's going to be g of six.

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:40.863
That is right over there.

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.765
For the third one it's
going to be g of eight.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:47.286
Let me shade these in to make
it clear which rectangles

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:48.255
we're talking about.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:51.957
This would be the right Riemann
sum to approximate the area.

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:53.107
It's very clear here

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:56.904
that this is going to be an underestimate.

00:02:56.904 --> 00:03:01.071
Underestimate because we see
in each of these intervals,

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:06.407
the right Riemann sum or the
rectangle that we're using

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:09.557
for the right Riemann sum
is a subset of the area

00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:11.005
that its trying to estimate.

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.311
We're not able to, it doesn't
capture this extra area

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:15.259
right over there.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:16.189
And once again,

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.519
that is because this is a
strictly decreasing function.

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.287
So if you use the right end
point of any one of these or

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.859
the right side of any of
these subdivisions in order to

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.208
define the height,

00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:29.667
that right value of g is going
to be the lowest value of g

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.508
in that subdivision so it's
going to be a lower height than

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:36.418
what you could say is even the
average height of the value

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:38.607
of the function over that interval.

00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:41.423
So you're going to have an
underestimate in this situation.

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:43.657
Now, if your function
was strictly increasing,

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:47.157
then these two things would be
swapped around and of course,

00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:48.824
there are many functions
that are neither strictly

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:50.322
increasing or decreasing

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:52.754
and then it would depend on the function.

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:53.587
Sometimes even,

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.939
it would depend on the type
of subdivisions you choose to

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.508
decide whether you have an
overestimate or an underestimate.
