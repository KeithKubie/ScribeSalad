00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:08.398
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.662
NASSIM TALEB: Hi,
thank you very much.

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:13.830
Sir, you forgot your phone.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.450
I was very privileged
to present at Google

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.460
when "Antifragile" came out
in California six years ago.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.430
And one observation
I would make is

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.160
that the average
age in this room

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.935
is six years older than
it was six years ago.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.490
So I'm going to talk about
my book, "Skin in the Game."

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.860
And a book is not an idea.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.600
And the first thing
before we start,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.380
I'm going to
discuss how I write,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.040
how the whole body
of work is organized,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.340
and what is the
"Incerto" and why it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.210
organized in a fractal way.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.070
My idea, that if a book can
be summarized, two things.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.349
One, it will not survive.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.910
And the second thing
is, not worth reading.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.040
You read a summary.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.720
So a book cannot be about an
idea no more than a painting is

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.280
about something other
than being a painting.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630
So a book has to be
self-standing item that you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.620
cannot reduce.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.440
And that may communicate
some message or not,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.690
that's not the relevant point.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.050
It [? cannot ?] be organized
in a way that you read it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.860
in fractal way.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.520
So the way it's written, you
have sentences, paragraphs,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.970
sections, chapters, and volumes.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.010
And everything has to be
integrated as a whole.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.100
So that's the idea
of the "Incerto,"

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.420
five volumes on uncertainty.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.080
And the idea is, for
the author to write

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.700
on his or her own terms.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.780
That's my idea how an
author should write.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.650
And I do it myself
with passion, all

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.460
right, I write on my own terms.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.930
The first volume was
"Fooled by Randomness."

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.336
And "Fooled by Randomness"
is an interesting book,

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.669
but nobody wanted to publish it.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.980
Nobody could figure
out what it was about.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.089
It had probability,
it had finance.

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.630
And people tell me,
what does finance

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.190
have to do with probability?

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.850
It had fictional
characters, Nero Tulip,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.930
and then there's me.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.263
And they say, what does a
fictional character or a fable

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:26.350
have to do with the book?

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.620
They couldn't figure
out what it was about.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.536
I tell them, oh, the
book is about philosophy.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.920
Ah, OK, why is there any
finance in a philosophy book?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.926
Or why is there a non-fiction
fictional characters

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:36.800
in a philosophy book?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.883
So I wrote on my own term.

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:40.360
I told them to get lost and I
keep writing on my own term.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.210
And in the end,
the book survived.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.395
So what is my modus operandi
while writing the "Incerto?"

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:52.180
Now, there is a
restaurant called--

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.970
used to be a restaurant called
Lindy that closed on the day

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.310
this was published.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.740
It went bankrupt on the
day this was published.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.710
It delivered very,
very I would say--

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.715
I don't if inedible conveys
the right impression.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:08.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.224
Absolutely horrible.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.890
It was known for its
cheesecake, but you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.130
know what happens when you
get famous for cheesecake,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.920
you sort of cut corners and it
becomes inedible after a while.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.710
But tourists kept flocking
in for a while until they,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.320
you know.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.060
So the thing went bust
right after my book.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.254
And the problem
that Lindy-- there

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:32.920
is something named
after that restaurant

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
called the Lindy effect.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.070
Now what is the Lindy effect?

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.740
It was discovered
in that restaurant

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.410
by actors, that plays--

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.940
because the
restaurant specialized

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.920
in giving cheap coffee
or undrinkable coffee

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.270
to unemployed actors.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.840
So when you're
unemployed actor--

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.880
actors by the way, are usually
unemployed, particularly

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.910
on Broadway.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.510
So they would sit down and
talk about plays, all right?

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.340
So they discovered
that a play that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.280
had been around for 200
days had an extra 200

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.290
days of life expectancy.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.840
And 1,000 days, 1,000 more days.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.880
It was discovered and became
known as the Lindy effect.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.930
And about every
single generation

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.269
of mathematicians had tried
to model it, and each--

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.740
the models always work, but
complete different models,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.690
all right?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.110
And the last
iteration is the one

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.930
I've been working,
on Lindy effect.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.150
How do I use the Lindy effect?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.380
Well, very simple.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.440
When I write, when I started
"Fooled by Randomness,"

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.030
if you want a book to
survive, how do you write?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.084
Can someone tell me?

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:41.500
How do you make
your book survive?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.474
What's the trick?

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:44.390
If you want people to
read your book 10 years,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.770
or 20 years from now?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.824
If you will have any
chance of that happening?

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:50.369
AUDIENCE: Make somebody hate it.

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:51.910
NASSIM TALEB: That
works, but there's

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.810
got to be something else.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.440
What else?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.300
AUDIENCE: Write another one.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.133
NASSIM TALEB: Sorry?

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:56.854
AUDIENCE: Write another one.

00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:58.020
NASSIM TALEB: That may work.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.990
Showed that you-- like the
"Incerto" is not body parts,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.020
but it's one whole.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.520
Yes?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.410
AUDIENCE: Use all the ideas.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.210
NASSIM TALEB: Very good.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.200
Use all ideas.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.422
By the Lindy effect,
an old technology

00:05:09.422 --> 00:05:11.505
has a huge survival advantage
over new technology.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.430
I'm not saying that the future
will not be technological,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.890
but I'm saying that
what will be displaced

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.070
is the newer technology,
not the old technology.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.870
So the way-- if you
want to write something

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.580
that can be read 20 years from
now, or hope to be read 20--

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.260
make sure it could be read
by someone 20 years ago.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.060
So protect yourself
backwards in time.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.860
It's much easier
than go forward.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.560
Had someone read the
book in 1960, 1980, would

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.560
he or she have--

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.890
would it have been interested in
the message, in the treatment?

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.835
Yes, no?

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:55.340
If yes, that's
exactly how you do it.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.110
So it's basically backwards.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.644
People who think
that they have to be

00:05:59.644 --> 00:06:01.310
technological for
their work to survive,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.590
it's the exact opposite by the
Lindy effect, simple logic.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.960
And effectively, if you
want to predict the future,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.970
you can't predict
what new will happen.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.477
Nobody predicted Google.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.560
Your grandparents didn't
think that you guys would

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.940
be wearing gym clothes with
dog friendly things delivering

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.210
sushi for free, OK?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.140
And cappuccino, actually
a very good cappuccino.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.880
I mean, I remember when I first
came to New York how it tasted.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.620
So your grandparents
didn't predict that.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.950
You cannot predict-- but
you can predict something,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.060
which is that what is recent
will be replaced by something

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.550
more recent.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.380
So it's easier to predict
that what is fragile can break

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.960
and what is-- by
the Lindy effect.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.575
So it has some--
for some domains.

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:54.410
It doesn't work for all domains.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.390
So now that I--

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.180
OK, spoke about literature.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.360
Is good, good enough?

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.967
So now we can move to
skin: "Skin in the Game."

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:05.300
Now "Skin in the Game," I
have absolutely no idea what's

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.070
"Skin in the Game" is about.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.070
Because every time
I try to explain it,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.310
I come up with a
different story.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.790
So it's me that has a lot
of layers, multi-layer.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.420
The only problem is, it
doesn't have Fat Tony--

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.230
my character in previous books--

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.170
because I killed him at
the end of "Antifragile"

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.850
and I couldn't really--

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.350
I didn't know how
to get him back.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.110
I had to--

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.640
I looked at how Sherlock
Holmes came back,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.910
and it was anachronistic.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.670
So I didn't know how to do it.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.590
So sorry.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.770
So for this episode
of the "Incerto,"

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.210
Fat Tony will be absent.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.390
However, his [INAUDIBLE]
will permeate the book.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.600
So someone asked me, what
is "Skin in the Game" about?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.080
I say, it's about how
Fat Tony learns things,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.920
how he would view the world as
compared to some bureaucrat.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.710
Simple, OK?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.310
So that's one approach.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.870
Now a little bit of
background about how I got--

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.870
this is by the way,
the German edition.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.391
And they couldn't
translate it to German,

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:09.140
so they had to translate,
skin in the game

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.790
by skin in the game.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.980
So that's German for
skin in the game.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:19.410
So my national origin is this.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.190
I was a trader.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.380
So I didn't become someone
mathematically oriented

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.280
early on in life.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.320
First I had to become a trader.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.410
Now, you learn when you're
a trader, first of all,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.900
you learn that the
mathematicians and people who

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.600
model are full of s*--

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.640
I never spell it
out in my books.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.257
So let's use baloney
as a good proxy.

00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:45.590
Whenever I say baloney, you
know what I mean, all right?

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.590
So that theoretician and
academics are full of baloney

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.570
because we have a
view of the formulas

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.590
we use that is
organic, bottom up.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.240
And this led to
"Antifragile," where

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.080
I was explaining that architects
always do a better job when

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.180
they don't use
Euclidean geometry,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.970
when they use the rules
required by architect, not

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.950
mathematical top down
rules, bottom up.

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:18.080
But I discovered probability
in a specific way, bottom up,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.410
was different.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.650
And then I started getting
into the field coming

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.170
from the back door.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.910
And after you stop training,
I couldn't find anything

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.630
interesting to lose my life.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.240
So I decided to do
that stuff here.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.220
That's my retirement from
trading, and of course,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.040
with a mission.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.536
So I came from
practice to theory,

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:43.910
and usually people
go from theory

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.285
to practice, particularly in
something very technological

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.570
or something very scientific.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:54.940
But this parallels what I
showed in "Antifragile," that--

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.500
and that we had so much
evidence from history--

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.140
that people have the
illusion that technology

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.200
comes from science when
in fact, science come

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.050
from technology more often.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.640
Except for well
advertised things,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.385
most sciences came
from technology.

00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:15.260
In other words, they
started doing something,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.090
didn't know exactly
why it worked,

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.200
and then someone
claimed credit later on.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.320
What I call lecturing
birds how to fly.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.660
So starting working with
probabilistic models,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.060
and I realized that
people who traded

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.270
have a different view of the
world than those who came

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.100
from theory, which is obvious.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.210
As Yogi Bear, I
would say, in theory

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.210
there is no difference
from theory and practice.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.084
In practice there is,
so a different mindset.

00:10:40.084 --> 00:10:43.360
But there's something
else I figured out.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.100
That those who
became practitioners

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.150
after knowing theory
always blew up.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.980
So in other words,
practice didn't help you

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.051
if you came from theory.

00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:54.800
There's something in
the mindset of people

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.660
who studied economics
or something that

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.990
made them blow up, with the
exception of mathematicians,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.640
because they're
sort of theory free.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.835
Mathematics is just some
kind of list of things

00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.460
that you believe to
be true, basically.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.550
And among these things,
there is something

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.622
I call the ludic falalcy.

00:11:11.622 --> 00:11:13.330
Now why am I talking
about ludic fallacy?

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.610
Because when I googled--

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:20.696
you guys just like, invented
the word, I'm using google.

00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.370
When I search for
it on the web--

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.030
--I discovered this very
ugly painting by a fellow

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.220
called Isaac McCaslin,
exhibited at the Saatchi gallery

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.350
called the "Ludic Fallacy."

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.960
I don't see the
connection with my work

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.740
and my word, the ludic fallacy.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.620
But let me explain
the ludic fallacy.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.940
And I hope it's not
as ugly as this.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.260
Ludic Fallacy is that the
probability or the risk

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.400
and uncertainty that we
encounter in real life

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.650
has very little to
do with things you

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.440
encounter in casinos and games.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.130
And ludic is coming
from games in Latin.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.830
That's why I called
it ludic fallacy.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.360
So this is sort of like,
preparing the background

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.320
for "Skin in the Game."

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.030
And incidentally, the main
idea of the "Incerto--"

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.890
the "Incerto" if one
asked to describe it,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.320
I say it's a series of fables--

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.130
what do I call it?

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.190
An investigation of opacity,
luck, uncertainty, probability,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.410
lalala in a form
of personal essays

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.110
with autobiographical
sections, stories, parable,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.510
philosophical, historical,
and scientific discussion.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.510
So basically, it's a mishmash
of things that turn out

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.242
to be reasonable for some.

00:12:43.242 --> 00:12:47.700
Or at least they pay the price,
whether they read it or not,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.755
it's not--

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.180
I get the same.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.710
The money doesn't change.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.550
But there is one point about
the "Incerto," pervading

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.450
the "Incerto," and I realized
too late to put it in the book,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.750
that there's a lot of
uncertainty in the world.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.780
There's a lot more uncertainty
than you think there is.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:10.630
But the way to deal with
such uncertainty is unique.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.020
So in other words,
there is a lot

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.050
of certainty about how
to act under conditions

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.430
of uncertainty.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.100
A very simple example.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.670
If you receive from Ar Raqqa--

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.810
which is in Syria--

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.320
and ISIS, an ISIS thing, a
package, and written on it,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.360
originates in Ar Raqqa.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.202
This is a package.

00:13:31.202 --> 00:13:32.160
What do you do with it?

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.411
Do you open it?

00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:33.910
No.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.800
So you have a lot of certainty
what to do with that package.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.340
So the more uncertainty
there is, the more certainty

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.870
there is in what to do.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.790
If you really don't know
if the plane is robust,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.730
you don't get on it.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.160
So the more uncertainty
about the plane,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.090
the more certainty
about not getting on it.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.690
And this is sort of what
permeates the "Incerto,"

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.359
but I couldn't put
it in concise terms,

00:13:58.359 --> 00:13:59.400
because it takes a while.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.130
It takes me 25 years to bring
an idea to its summary, you see?

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.700
So maybe if you invite me
to give another talk here,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.710
in five years I'll be
explaining "Skin in the Game."

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.200
So now, simple application of
"Skin in the Game" to make you

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.525
really realize what's going on
with our knowledge of the world

00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:21.650
without "Skin in the Game."

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.870
Haven't explained yet
"Skin in the Game."

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.710
This is commonly
known as a restaurant.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.740
A friend of mine,
who like me was

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.660
a trader-- he was a
former partner at Goldman

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.200
Sachs, an oil trader, so
he talks like oil traders--

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.050
had gotten a very
bad idea to invest

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.100
in a restaurant business.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.350
And if I have one piece of
advice, in case I die here,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.270
just don't invest in
the restaurant business.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.640
Don't open a restaurant
unless you really

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.142
want to lose your money
slowly, or sometimes quickly

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:52.850
in New York City.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.760
So he discovered the following,
that the restaurant business

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.360
has a lot of prizes.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.300
The best sushi in
lower Manhattan,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.110
the best sushi with music,
best sushi without-- whatever.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.200
So we have all these
categories, OK?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.650
And then there is a best
restaurant in that category.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.850
The best rare steak, the best
T-bone west of the Hudson,

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.590
you have all these categories.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.540
And they're prizes, actually.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.960
Now who decides on these prizes?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.170
Journalists and other
restaurant owners.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.560
There is a gala dinner where
they give these prizes.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.910
And guess what?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:41.520
Most restaurants who got prizes
were closed, were shut down,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.370
were shut down out of business.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.510
So it tells you the
following, any business

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.460
where you're judged
by your peers

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.680
and not by some
contact with reality

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.450
is going to rot eventually.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.180
That's why companies go
bust, this is what happens.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.110
Now this person, I think
is a plumber, right?

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.302
Are plumbers judged
by other plumbers?

00:16:06.302 --> 00:16:07.260
Or are they judged by--

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:12.830
OK, they're judged by
other plumbers, no?

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.071
No, they're judged by you.

00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:14.820
You're the client.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.750
OK, very good.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.030
So if you-- they may love you,
other plumbers, but that's it.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.320
So any business where
you have contact

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.560
with reality in the form
of your client judging you,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.110
has fewer what I call
expert problem, which

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.060
I outlined in "The Black Swan."

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.225
And expert being-- I used to
call an expert an empty suit

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.770
until I discovered
that a lot of them

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.780
actually don't
wear suits anymore.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.610
Times have changed,
so I have to rename it

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.490
to something else
that's not Lindy.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.530
So there are classes
of people, there's

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.960
a tableau in "The Black Swan."

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.330
So who's an expert?

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.360
Weather forecasters,
they're experts.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.200
Climate, we don't know.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.040
All right?

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.460
Accountants, they're experts.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.369
If they can add
and subtract, you

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.430
can have the evidence
that they're pretty much--

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.420
and follow the rules of
various accounting rules,

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.970
so they're experts.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.349
How about financial economists?

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:22.650
Not experts, OK?

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.050
So you have-- and very simple.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.262
No contact with reality,
no feedback from reality.

00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:28.470
So that's "Skin in the Game."

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.170
That's the epistemology
of "Skin in the Game."

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.300
And you can apply it
to a lot of things.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.880
People in policy making,
they're not experts.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.920
Anything macro, it's much easier
to macro BS than micro BS.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.910
And that's the
motto of the book.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.370
So in macro BS, you
don't see the feedback.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.380
You know a dentist
will be an expert,

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.655
but an epidemiologist
will not be an expert

00:17:49.655 --> 00:17:50.910
because there is no feedback.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.570
That's "Skin in the Game."

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.030
And this is very simple
Darwinian survival.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.630
Simple.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.990
I mean it's not too complicated
that it's Darwinian survival.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.040
Because it's very simple.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.830
You have a selection
process, you survive.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.610
Like in nature,
you have fitness.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.700
So we have all of
these people who

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.540
reject the idea of intelligent
design, which they interpret

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.350
say, in a naive way, first
order way, not as a metaphor.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.080
But they want to
be-- like academics,

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.540
they want no contact
with reality.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.649
They want just rationalism
to make things work.

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:29.690
It doesn't work that way.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.280
I mean, you cannot believe in
God when it comes to academia

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.750
but disbelieve in God outside.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.660
You have to be consistent.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.150
And this of course, you
remember this cartoon

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.990
which violates my idea
of the pseudo expert.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.450
Because they say,
"These smug pilots

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.600
have lost touch regular
passengers like us.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.580
Who think I should
fly the plane?"

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.080
So the point is, what
we're observing is not

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.070
a riot against experts.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.320
It's a riot against a
certain class of experts.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.360
I call those IYI,
Intellectual Yet Idiot,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.340
because of lack of
contact with reality.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.180
Anything, like academia doesn't
have contact with reality,

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.950
collapses.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.940
Academics-- are you
judged by peers, Pasquale?

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.600
Who judges you?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.349
You're not going to--
are we in the same--

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:19.900
we're not in the
same department.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.750
Who judges you, your
peers, other academics?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.430
Well, there's an expert problem.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.120
So if you're not
judged by PNL, we say,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.960
or reality, or
something like that.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.160
So the pilot definitely
has to be an expert.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.650
And there's a very
simple reason.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.270
What happened to pilots
who were pseudo experts?

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.190
AUDIENCE: We die.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.273
NASSIM TALEB: There we go.

00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:42.680
There we go.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.620
They died and their
passengers died.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.870
So basically, we
have Darwinian--

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.626
it's called Darwinian, the
school athlete, survival

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:51.250
of the fittest.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:56.800
Or survival of the non-experts.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.810
And then of course, you end
up having fields such as--

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.560
this is the mind
of an economist.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.670
That's a clarity of mind on
a good day of an economist.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.170
Why?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.950
Because there's no
contact with reality.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.750
You don't have to be consistent.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.505
So you can have the
Nobel Prize given--

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.720
the pseudo Nobel in economics--

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.050
given to two people
saying opposite things.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.750
You can't say-- I mean, you
can't do that in physics.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.840
We say, you throw the ball it
goes up, and then it goes down.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.180
Let's be hedged, let's
give the Nobel to both.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.380
Because the problem is, you
end up with a mind like this

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.520
if you're judged by your
peers, not by experts.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.740
So now the concept of symmetry.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.680
So let me do the following.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.270
Before I get into Hammurabi,
let me describe Wall Street.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.010
Hopefully this will
have a pointer.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.070
No, no pointer.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.640
OK.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.840
So there's something
I call the Bob Rubin

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.550
trade, the absence of symmetry.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.520
And again, "Skin in the Game"
is about certain classes

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.030
of symmetry.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.034
And we're going to see
where the name comes from

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.450
and the link to
the pseudo expert.

00:21:13.684 --> 00:21:17.980
The fellow was chairman--

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.490
now to be called chairperson--

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.060
of Citibank or Citicorp.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.594
Spent 10 years there and
he received $120 million

00:21:26.594 --> 00:21:27.260
in compensation.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.310
And when the crisis
happened 10 years ago--

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.420
I don't know if you were--

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.460
many of you were born.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.110
Many of you at least were
conscious of what was going on.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.440
So 10 years ago,
there was a crisis.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.800
And then he said,
"Some very unfortunate,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.030
highly unexpected event, often
called "Black Swan," for which

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.990
we apologize profusely but we
are excused as nobody could

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.120
predict these things happened."

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.920
Very nice.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.570
He acknowledged that it
was a black swan, named

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.280
after a very, very stubborn
author, but sometimes pleasant

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.680
if you have coffee with him.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.930
But stubborn definitely
intellectually.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.630
All right, so what's
the problem there?

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.650
Let's think about it.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.320
You make the upside
when you're right.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.344
And when you're wrong,
who pays for the losses?

00:22:29.344 --> 00:22:30.220
Sorry?

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.020
AUDIENCE: We did.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.110
NASSIM TALEB: You did.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.420
The Spanish grammar
instructors--

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.020
a recurring person
in the book who

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.190
pays for losses made by others--

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:47.810
yoga instructors,
Google sushi chefs,

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.210
and so on, they paid the
price directly or indirectly.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.130
So what we have
here is a violation

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.000
of a law that effectively
is the first law

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.570
extant, Hammurabi's rule.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:08.004
And it says the following,
if the architect

00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.420
builds a building
and the building

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.200
collapses and kills the
owner of the building, what

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.070
should happen to the architect?

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.670
He should be put to death.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.630
I mean, it was Babylon 3,800
years ago, so they were not--

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.790
didn't have a very
sophisticated legal code.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:32.120
And then of course, if
it kills the first born,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.070
the first born son of the
architect is put to death.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.020
So they're really, they're
looking for symmetry.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.910
Now what was the idea
of Hammurabi's code?

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:46.370
It was not eye for eye, eye for
eye limiting damages and making

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.080
things balanced, no.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.170
It was that you cannot walk
away from risks you've created

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.870
for others.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.580
You should own your risks.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.200
That's the idea of
Hammurabi's code.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.360
You cannot have civilized
society unless those who create

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.000
risks aren't also
aware of the risk.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.980
So when you get on a
highway, on the Hudson,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.710
you can get drunk,
whatever is something

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.680
that people do when they
want to have fun or want

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.859
to become reckless drivers,
and become a reckless driver.

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:21.900
The best way if you want
to kill a lot of people,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.983
is you go against traffic.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.190
150 miles an hour
against traffic.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.774
Why is it that we don't see, we
don't hear about these people?

00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.440
AUDIENCE: Highly
symmetrical punishment.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.760
NASSIM TALEB: It's a highly
symmetrical punishment,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.380
they're already dead.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.120
Visibly, if you have these
traits, you're more exposed--

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.440
you're exposed or even more
exposed than regular people.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.550
So at all times
in history, we've

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.340
had that symmetry prevailing.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.340
We can look at it
operational symmetry.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.740
But let's first look at it
from a moral standpoint.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.080
You've heard of the
golden rule, do unto

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.680
others what you want
them to do to you.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.370
Which I, in fact, I
find a little intrusive.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.910
Because say I like raw Lebanese
meat, Lebanese could be--

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.960
I'm not going to
force you to eat it.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.280
So there's actually--
say I'm a bureaucrat

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.830
and like this kind of
stuff, I'm don't force you.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.320
There is a much more
robust silver rule,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.120
don't do to others what you
don't want them to do to you.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.140
And effectively, you
can't have civilization

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.060
without the silver rule.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.280
And also, and
unfortunately, people

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.720
don't understand, it extends
to international affairs,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.110
the silver rule.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.740
How?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.750
Treat other
countries the way you

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:55.000
would like other countries to
treat you if you were weaker.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.490
And there is a fractal
aspect of the silver rule.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.890
Countries should treat other
countries the same, and so on.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.100
So that kind of symmetry.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.780
That's a moral symmetry.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.770
And of course, it kept going.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.662
That rule kept going
and evolving, sometimes

00:26:09.662 --> 00:26:10.620
in the wrong direction.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.635
Kantian.

00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:13.890
I talk a lot about
Kantian Universalism,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.260
it's not practical.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.730
Because the universal kills
the particular and it's

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.690
not fractal.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.330
It becomes anonymous.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.600
You have to layer it.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.350
And if we have time,
we can say why.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.680
So this is-- the golden rule
came across ethical systems,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.840
religion.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:38.140
And the last iteration
is with Kant.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.050
But basically the most
robust is the silver rule.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.940
You want as a
business and anything,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.390
to treat others as a way--

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.910
you don't want to
harm them, you want

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.680
to treat them-- not
treat them the way

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.540
you wouldn't like
them to treat you.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.770
It's called the
negative golden rule.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.130
And of course, it
has a lot of-- we

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.910
can talk in the small and large.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.810
This is called hidden
symmetries in daily life.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.940
And something quite obvious,
as obvious as the cook

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.560
should eat his or her cooking.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.390
It needs to apply everywhere.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:18.710
And these rules did
prevail until recently.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.760
And we're going to see where
they stopped prevailing.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.210
But they prevailed
for a long time,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.040
until say, maybe a
generation and a half ago,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.000
two generations ago.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.510
And it was quite sophisticated,
how merchants should treat

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.510
other merchants,
how you should have

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:42.170
stiffer ethical rules, more
equity within a group, in group

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.530
then outgroup, but still
have the same outgroup.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.200
And actually, it's much more
workable within communities,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.990
outside communities.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.840
Now one thing about "Skin in
the Game," "Skin in the Game"

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.610
is interested in two
aspects of social thought

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.980
that are not discussed.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.270
The first one is dynamics,
and things happen over time,

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.440
how systems--

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.470
what rules should be
applied over time.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.870
And we'll take a snapshot
and we'll see how,

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.730
why, and the mistake.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:17.018
And the second one is scaling,
that things change in scale.

00:28:17.018 --> 00:28:22.700
A small hamlet will not become--

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.550
you cannot turn the dynamics of
a hamlet into a small village.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:34.730
And a small village cannot
turn into a very small town.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.110
You have some kind of
a scale transformation

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.030
that happen when
groups become larger.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.740
And that's mathematical
and at many levels.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.800
For example, I can predict
how each and every one of you

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.410
behave, assuming
I could do that.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.860
But as a group, I can predict
the behavior as a group,

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.600
because a group is
a different animal.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.130
Likewise, we know that if people
have all these ethical traits

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.450
individually, when you put
them together in groups of 250,

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.170
they will be very ethical
in preserving the commons.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.740
Like fishermen not
overfishing, because

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.670
harming future generation.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:20.280
But when the group becomes
200,000, it doesn't work.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.670
So that's one aspect
of scalability

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.270
that has a political
implication and [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:32.402
It is very, very compatible to
be a communist in your village,

00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:36.730
and libertarian at
the federal level,

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.120
and Democrats for the
county, while being

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.300
a Republican for the state.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.070
It's perfectly compatible.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.410
You cannot have a political
opinion without attaching

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.940
a scale to it.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.820
So communism can
work in Singapore--

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.780
because it's small--
much better than China.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.590
Look at the success.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.170
Or that form of socialism.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.090
Or you can-- you cannot--

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.680
you should separate the
political label from the scale.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.520
And likewise in
commerce, if you don't

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.620
have ingroups and outgroups
of different layers,

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.700
things don't work.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.736
Because you don't have
individual and then

00:30:15.736 --> 00:30:17.360
the rest of the world,
you have layers.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.810
You have the visual,
the family or whatever,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.330
the finances of her
family, the tribe,

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.250
whatever he or she
defines as tribe,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.590
and then you go up the layers.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.790
And that works a lot better.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.340
Because the tribes
deal with one another,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.380
the dynamics of tribes
dealing with one another

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.035
need to mirror
the same symmetry.

00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:38.600
And it looks like the
ancients were conscious of it.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.361
They understood scaling.

00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:42.360
They understood that you
can love your town when

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.390
it's a small town, but
it's not the same love

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.850
when it's a large town.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.870
The ancients knew that.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.895
So this is the idea of
scaling, particularly

00:30:50.895 --> 00:30:52.520
with skin in the game changes.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.245
Now, risk as virtue.

00:31:00.412 --> 00:31:02.370
I don't know how many
Roman emperors we've had,

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.700
close to 300.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.857
How many died of natural death?

00:31:08.857 --> 00:31:10.690
Assuming those really
died of natural death.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.880
I mean, we don't have
modern autopsies.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.560
How many?

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.800
1/2, 3/4, 100%?

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.230
NASSIM TALEB: No more
than a third, all right?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.850
And we're not sure
about that third.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.440
And of course, had
they lived longer,

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.100
had they not died of
pneumonia or something,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.490
they would have been
killed by someone.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:38.040
And then, this is a picture of
Valerian, the Roman emperor who

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.300
was captured by the Persians
and used as a footstool.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.120
So these are the risks you
get for being a Roman emperor.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.340
It's risky to be
a Roman emperor.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.710
Julian, who's my hero in a book.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:57.420
Julian the emperor was
known as the apostate.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:04.820
He died at the Persian border
with a spear in the chest.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.700
He didn't even have an armor.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:14.200
Now this contrasts heavily
with warmongers today,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.610
war mongers who are sitting
in an air conditioned

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.972
office in Washington.

00:32:18.972 --> 00:32:22.370
Can we name names
on Google thing?

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.870
They can sue me directly, OK?

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.700
In the book, I name names.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.030
Like Thomas Friedman
and all these neocons,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.500
they can cause wars in
Iraq, devastation's,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.570
hundreds of thousands of
people killed, maybe more,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.330
financial trauma.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.400
What price did they pay?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.820
Zero.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.320
So let's merge ethics
and epistemology.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.540
If they had to pay
for their mistakes

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.060
like the driver who
disappears, the system

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.080
don't learn because
people learn.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:03.030
Systems don't learn-- system
learn via the survival

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:08.010
mechanism by eliminating those
who don't have that trait.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.220
Actually in biology, systems
learn at a cellular level.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.950
It's not like, your
knowledge that changes.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.670
So of course you're going to
have a lot of warmongers today.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.770
This is a danger for humanity.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.840
Now that-- and they're going
to use any excuse to become

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.710
warmongers and then even
will get leftist ideas,

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.330
because our merchants know how
to play the system and can--

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.890
or humanitarian war.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.380
Humanitarian war, like in
Libya, change of regime.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.810
Oh yeah, but look,
we have democracy.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.850
You kill everyone
and say, well look,

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.650
their cholesterol
level improved.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.330
So if you use those metrics.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.670
So the point is, that
this is very recent.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.010
Hannibal, first in battle.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.320
Napoleon had to be more
exposed than other soldiers.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.510
And the English feudal
system, the lord, you're

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.970
a lord because you're
a lord, because you

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.900
take risks for others.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.630
You trade risk
for social status.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:14.806
Very few societies had
people of rank make decisions

00:34:14.806 --> 00:34:17.969
without being,
themselves, exposed

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:20.040
to the harm from the decisions.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.530
At all levels, economic,
financial, everything,

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.300
physical.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.210
Now comes the notion
of risk as virtual.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.110
We're not stupid.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.659
We have some organic
understanding of these things.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:38.650
And the peacock, the
[INAUDIBLE] peacock story

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.809
is that the peacock, why does
the peacock has a big tail?

00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:43.050
They're useless.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.940
It's precisely
because it's useless.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.630
And the peacock can
maintain such a tail,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:55.940
it shows some kind of
biological fitness,

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.100
to be able to carry such a tail.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.740
Now the peacock, the
[INAUDIBLE] peacock

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:07.930
is a nice framework, what
we call a [INAUDIBLE] trait,

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:13.240
a superfluous trait, but that
gives you definitely some kind

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.230
of fitness.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.720
People who have scars, people
who have scars command respect.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.870
People who take risks
command respect.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.840
People don't realize it,
but that's what's happening.

00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:34.000
It's a very bad idea
for political parties

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.100
to propose candidates who
are lifetime bureaucrats.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.985
You see?

00:35:38.985 --> 00:35:39.860
And people detect it.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.800
Like in Switzerland,
they try to pass a law

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.660
to limit the income
for chief executives.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.571
But nobody thought of limiting
the income of entrepreneurs.

00:35:53.571 --> 00:35:54.070
Why?

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.690
An entrepreneur takes risks.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.190
Chief executive is
someone who works

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.880
for the system and making 75
times what an employee makes.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.280
The law didn't pass, but
that's the idea behind it.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.076
And this explains Christology.

00:36:13.076 --> 00:36:14.370
Think about it.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.250
Why is it that we have the
Trinity, which absolutely

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:23.030
makes no sense to anyone
outside the Christian religion?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.078
Why is it that we had to keep
going back to the Trinity?

00:36:27.078 --> 00:36:31.660
Fights, arguments, debates
in Greek that nobody

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.790
can understand because
translated into Latin

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.450
be the same word?

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:40.810
They kept going back that
the Christ cannot be God.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.010
Think about it.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.540
If this person had a parachute,
if an acrobat walked in

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.130
with a parachute,
would you pay for that?

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.270
It'd be like a video game.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.300
So the whole thing is,
you signal by risk taking.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.040
And the idea of Christology
is, to really put

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.260
"Skin in the Game" in a deity.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.230
So he's not God, because
he had to suffer.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.510
If he didn't suffer, it
would be like a tomato

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.690
for an actor in a movie.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.700
It's not tomato sauce,
that doesn't work that way.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.920
So that's the idea
of signaling via risk

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:25.560
taking, that you are in fact
exhibiting virtue via risk.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.830
And again, now comes virtue.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.990
Every time I get into a
hotel room, I get into--

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.150
I don't know if you've
seen me angry on Twitter,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.990
I'm like that in
person when I'm angry.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.020
What sets me off is going in,
save our planet, the Earth

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.320
What is-- is this virtuous?

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:54.130
I think it would make much more
sense if they told us, listen,

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.720
it's good for us if you save--

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.810
if you saved on towels, it's
good for us, bottom line.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.360
So it's like, don't
invoke the planet as a--

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:02.860
you see.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.380
So this is cheap--
cheap virtue signaling

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.380
for the self-serving way
is what we're getting into.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.329
True virtue is risk
taking, Socrates.

00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:15.120
That's what we try to
impart to the Christ.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.140
He really suffers, he can't be
God, had to be human to suffer.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.200
Socrates, standing
up for your ideas.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.730
Journalism, when you
have an oppressive regime

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:33.180
like in Argentina
or in Latin America,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.100
during these dark periods,
that is risk taking.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.560
And effectively,
the only way I can

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:49.290
claim that a public intellectual
is not a BS vendor is he

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.536
or she takes risk
with every statement.

00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:56.480
So people ask me, why am I
insulting people directly

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.720
in my books?

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.750
Risk taking.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.210
I want them to sue me.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.110
That's simple.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.080
It's not like I have nothing.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.760
I've never met Thomas Friedman.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.640
Actually, I did once--

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.270
I had already insulted him--

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.200
in Davos, and it was an
eye contact that was--

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.960
but never met many
of the people I--

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.410
Rob Rubin, had never met him.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:19.940
But I want to take risks.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.070
This is the idea.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.340
I'm signaling.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.510
Why do I curse on Twitter?

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.490
Not in my books, because I don't
like the aesthetics of a curse.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.200
Because risk taking.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.910
You see?

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.960
So that's simple.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.900
Now let's continue.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.990
People ask me, what
should I be doing?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.930
I'm 20 and I'll go somewhere.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.602
Start a business,
take risks now.

00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:49.560
Because everybody wants
to work for [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.480
and improve the world.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.340
And you end up like
the UN, offices,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.250
manufacturing problems.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.360
So you hire more staff,
or fly business class

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.210
and have an apartment in
Geneva, that kind of stuff.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.020
Start a business.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:06.050
Because we're tired of people
who want to work for NGOs.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:10.540
Start a business,
create jobs for others,

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.940
and do not rent seek.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.982
Do not be in rent seeking.

00:40:13.982 --> 00:40:16.770
Have some skin in the game.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:21.420
Just like your
grandparents probably--

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.670
one of your grandfathers was at
age 18 disembarking enormity.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.720
They took a lot of risks,
these kids, 18-year-old.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.480
Take some risk,
start a business.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.010
Now finally, when it
comes to inequality,

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.700
there's something about
inequality that's measured.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.240
And I said, we have to
use dynamics not statics.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.390
People tolerate inequality
if the person at the top

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.960
got there via risk
taking not rent seeking,

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:56.665
and more significantly, if he
or she has a chance to collapse.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.530
Bad news for Google--

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.990
I mean, Google is definitely
[INAUDIBLE] good news

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.050
for humanity and
bad news for Google.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.780
When I was an MBA student--

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.660
I'm very, very old as you
can see, I had hair then--

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:19.180
the company spent about 50,
60 years in the S&amp;P 500.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.160
So it was stable at the top.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.870
How stable is it today?

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.170
AUDIENCE: Less than 30?

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:31.170
NASSIM TALEB: Less than?

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.962
AUDIENCE: 30 years.

00:41:31.962 --> 00:41:33.003
NASSIM TALEB: Keep going.

00:41:33.003 --> 00:41:33.750
Less than 30?

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.164
Keep going.

00:41:35.164 --> 00:41:36.040
AUDIENCE: 10 years?

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.490
NASSIM TALEB: Sorry?

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.510
AUDIENCE: 10 years?

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.468
NASSIM TALEB: 10 years.

00:41:38.468 --> 00:41:39.430
AUDIENCE: Is this all?

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.660
NASSIM TALEB: 10 to 12 years.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.190
I think maybe even dropping.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.377
AUDIENCE: It is
dropping, but I do

00:41:45.377 --> 00:41:46.669
think [INAUDIBLE] a little bit.

00:41:46.669 --> 00:41:49.127
NASSIM TALEB: You can measure,
but there's a standard error

00:41:49.127 --> 00:41:50.060
in measurement.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.120
We have a big
statistical expert here,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.930
my co-author who will tell you--

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.040
but we know that it's
definitely much lower.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.620
And you can't take fluctuation.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.940
But that basically tells
you that the way from dorms

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:06.020
to Google can only be short.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.982
These guys were in dorms, no?

00:42:07.982 --> 00:42:13.840
To Google can only be short if
the road from Google to dorms

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.720
is equally so.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.474
You need short
route from the top.

00:42:18.474 --> 00:42:20.640
And in fact, if you have a
short route from the top,

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.840
it doesn't take long.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.750
Sears, OK?

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.210
And so I don't mind
inequality, this measure.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.997
And actually, even
in inequality, people

00:42:28.997 --> 00:42:31.080
say, oh look at Europe,
they have less inequality.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.656
Fuck.

00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:33.030
What do you mean
less inequality?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.020
Sorry, I cursed in the clip.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:40.890
So they have in
Europe, if you take--

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.220
OK, let's take a new s.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:48.500
1982 versus 2012, Forbes 500
billionaires, or rich people,

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.980
the richest, 10% of the
families across the list.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.373
In Europe, someone
did Florence 1580.

00:42:57.373 --> 00:43:01.440
That's the same
families as today.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.400
And in France-- have two
more minutes for lecture--

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.940
and in France, if you study
say the equivalent of Harvard

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.190
or something like
that, then you're done.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.200
You're going to run
a big corporations.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.760
And they have a low
bankruptcy rate.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.850
So you need a high
bankruptcy rate in a system.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.810
Don't shoot for equality shoot
for a high bankruptcy rate.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.970
So people have
also, the illusion

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.490
that you want opportunity means
people to be able to go up.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.602
No, you want people to
come down from the top.

00:43:31.602 --> 00:43:33.560
This is what you've got
to focus on in society.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.520
This is an approach,
a dynamic approach.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.960
We spoke about scaling,
this is dynamic approach

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.440
to social problems.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.480
Now epistemology, experience.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.550
To explain-- I'm
going to explain

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.900
a couple of weird things.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.320
We have a minute.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.300
There is a story in
both "Antifragile"

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.960
and "Skin in the Game" of
a fellow who lost a million

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.640
dollars trading green lumber.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.870
He knew everything about lumber,
green lumber, everything,

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.620
the economics, the mathematics,
the statistics, collected data,

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.450
everything, and lost
a million dollars.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.810
And wrote an account, "What
I Learned Losing a Million

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.470
Dollars."

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:17.070
And he reports that there's
a fellow, a pit trader.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.570
I don't know if you
met pit traders,

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:22.880
but they look like pit traders
and they act like pit traders.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.180
And the fellow is making tons
of money with green lumber

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.200
and had been doing
so consistently.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.854
Now the narrator discovers that
the fellow made a lot of money

00:44:34.854 --> 00:44:35.520
on green lumber.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.480
Didn't know, he thought it
was lumber painted green.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.530
He didn't know it was
freshly cut lumber.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.790
So is it that that person--

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.460
this is very high
econ argument--

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.740
knew nothing about the green?

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.790
No.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.740
He knew a lot of stuff,
but not necessarily

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.620
what you think from the
outside is valuable.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.350
So with that one, you
have skin in the game,

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.550
you tend to know a lot of stuff
about business, about things,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.090
that you wouldn't guess you
need to know from the outside.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.980
And this is very
hard to explain.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.780
This is why machine
learning is successful,

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.390
because machine
learning has no ideas.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.000
It learns from the inside,
not from the outside.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.660
And then finally--
we have one minute--

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.670
when you have in
a business where

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.890
there is skin in the
game, say surgery,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:27.800
you go to a hospital to
install the-- you want a brain

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.700
surgeon to install the next
Google product which helps you

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.512
solve differential equation.

00:45:33.512 --> 00:45:35.220
You install it, you
put it in your brain.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.610
It's a very delicate
operation, many people

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:41.190
have died during it.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.235
So it's a very
dangerous operation.

00:45:43.235 --> 00:45:45.012
There's a choice
between two doctors.

00:45:45.012 --> 00:45:46.970
One doctor who looks like
the Hollywood version

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:52.370
of a doctor, of a surgeon,
well mannered, well educated.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.160
And then the other person
looks like a butcher.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.380
And these two have
the same track record,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.750
have the same rank
at the hospital.

00:46:03.047 --> 00:46:04.510
Which doctor would you pick?

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.700
AUDIENCE: Butcher.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.375
NASSIM TALEB: Sorry?

00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:08.680
AUDIENCE: Butcher.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.430
NASSIM TALEB: The one-- because
this person had to overcome--

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.202
because not judged at
all by anything external.

00:46:14.202 --> 00:46:15.660
[INAUDIBLE] and
also peer reviewed,

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.190
judged entirely by the track
record, by the performance.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:23.814
You have to overcome all this
perception bias to get there.

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.230
So this is the
point, a field that

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:29.670
has skin in the game,
beware of the cosmetic.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.700
Likewise, you want
to fund people?

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.850
If they know how to
write business plans, no.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.560
If they make money at something
and you don't understand how,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.730
hire them.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.650
It's a green lumber problem.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:44.040
So I'm going to stop
here, because we

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.370
can keep going forever
and for the Q&amp;A. So

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.110
thank you for listening to me.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.357
And I'm honored to be, again,
here at Google six years later.

00:46:52.357 --> 00:46:54.440
And hopefully in six years
you'll still be around.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:54.940
All right?

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.861
Thanks,

00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.807
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.400
AUDIENCE: Do you want
countries to force

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.420
mandatory participation in
armies like conscription

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.220
so will be less wars?

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.030
NASSIM TALEB: OK.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.620
Exactly the other
thing, is people

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.230
thought that it's
a pacifist approach

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.586
to not have mandatory service.

00:47:22.586 --> 00:47:24.210
It's the worst possible
thing you could

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.310
do if you want to avoid war.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.950
Because you want people who
vote in Congress for wars

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:33.750
to have children, or
grandchildren, or themselves

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.075
as part of the--

00:47:35.075 --> 00:47:36.810
be the danger of themselves.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.976
Definitely, it would make
people a lot more peaceful.

00:47:39.976 --> 00:47:42.074
A lot more peace seeking.

00:47:42.074 --> 00:47:43.740
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any practical tips

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.420
for the individual
investor for creating

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.300
a sort of barbell
strategy in a portfolio?

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.442
I know and like buying T-bills
and tips are maybe a good idea

00:47:52.442 --> 00:47:54.400
for the conservative
side, and maybe bankrupt--

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.483
NASSIM TALEB: OK, I have--

00:47:55.483 --> 00:47:57.570
OK, so the whole thing
is, there's a slide here,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.780
I'll talk about path dependence.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.311
To make sure that survival
comes first and everything else

00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:03.810
later.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.336
Take all the risks
you want but make

00:48:05.336 --> 00:48:06.460
sure you're there tomorrow.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.340
It's a different
class of risk taking

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.700
than the one that takes
risks for small return

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.282
but can blow you up completely.

00:48:14.282 --> 00:48:14.990
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.700
So last chapter of the book,
The Logic of Risk Taking,

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.540
it's actually should
be a book on its own.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.456
But because there's
the "Incerto,"

00:48:22.456 --> 00:48:24.330
I kept it in there,
because of fractal nature

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.292
of the "Incerto."

00:48:25.292 --> 00:48:27.750
If you don't want to read the
book, you don't like reading,

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.913
just read that chapter, the
last chapter of the book.

00:48:29.913 --> 00:48:30.746
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:30.746 --> 00:48:31.500
NASSIM TALEB: Yes

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.666
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:35.950
And thanks, because of you,
I started doing deadlifting.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.033
NASSIM TALEB: Oh, OK, yes.

00:48:37.033 --> 00:48:38.040
AUDIENCE: So I have been great.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.340
NASSIM TALEB: For the
skin in the game, yeah.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.220
So skin in the game, let
me tell you something

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:41.970
about deadlifting.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.990
I have this motto,
"Skin in the Game,"

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.940
that you should
never tell people

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.450
what they should be doing.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.620
You should tell them
what you're doing.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.755
And I had a back injury when
I was writing "Antifragile,"

00:48:54.755 --> 00:48:56.270
about seven years ago.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.820
And I cured it by deadlifing.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.890
And then I started
discovering the value

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.524
of intense heavy
weight on humans,

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:05.940
like the bone and
stuff like that.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.820
And the reason I talk
about my own deadlifting

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.680
is only to say that I
have skin in the game.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.890
I'm telling you I have the
injuries of a deadlifter,

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:13.556
I'm telling you.

00:49:13.556 --> 00:49:16.440
So I bear the risk of my advice.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.260
Great, thanks.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:17.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:18.720
So I had a question actually.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.511
NASSIM TALEB: Yeah?

00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:21.780
AUDIENCE: What happened--
you said a generation or two

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.250
generations, since last
couple of generations,

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.460
we've seen this prevalence
of BS vendors perhaps?

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.960
NASSIM TALEB: Yeah,
BS vendors, yes.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.390
AUDIENCE: What exactly happened?

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:30.030
Like, what--

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.766
NASSIM TALEB: Well, I mean, this
may be a transitory phenomenon.

00:49:32.766 --> 00:49:34.140
It's very strange,
because people

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.930
don't realize that I'm
writing "Skin in the Game"

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.290
now is an outcry
against BS intellectuals

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.480
who actually are
pseudo left, typically.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.260
When they're on
the left, they're

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.801
pseudo left, because
they really have

00:49:44.801 --> 00:49:46.590
all the traits of non-left.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.450
They want identity
politics, it's

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:52.350
actually a form of racial
segregation in a way.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.225
The way they define
themselves as,

00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:55.840
it's a white
supremacist type thing.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.986
Well, whatever, that everything
they do is backwards.

00:49:58.986 --> 00:50:00.780
But then there is a real left.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:06.950
So there is a book that came
to that effect in France

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:09.690
in the 1900s, early 1900s.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.240
And it's called "The
Betrayal of the Clerks"

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.901
by Julien Benda who really
said the same thing.

00:50:15.901 --> 00:50:17.400
And I realized that
for a long time,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.050
people kept citing
Benda about what

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.000
they call faux
un-sincere intellectual,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.140
faux intellectual.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.620
And insincere intellectual for
me, I say, I name Susan Sontag.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.430
Susan Sontag as an
insincere intellectual had--

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:35.670
one day I was-- the
first time I was ever

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.320
interviewed in my life.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.730
"Fooled by
Randomness" was out, I

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:42.276
was in a radio station at the
BBC in the office in New York.

00:50:42.276 --> 00:50:44.900
And she had developed interest,
this book writes on randomness.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.510
Oh, very interesting.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.210
Oh, you're in the markets?

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.545
I hate the markets as explosive
whatever-- this is going on,

00:50:52.545 --> 00:50:54.006
and on, and on, and on, and on.

00:50:54.006 --> 00:50:56.130
So I tried to explain to
her it's not rent seeking,

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:59.640
but she treated
me like I was crap

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.720
and she left as I
was mid-sentence,

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.180
as I was mid-sentence
just to humiliate me.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.180
So I said, OK, so she
probably lives upstate New

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.940
York, Woodstock, and the
farms are all vegetables

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.770
and she wants to live
outside the market system.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.530
And then her obituary came.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:20.850
She lived in a $17 million
mansion around here,

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.810
in Chelsea.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:26.940
So you realize, that's the
absence of skin in the game.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.017
It's fine to be against
the market system,

00:51:29.017 --> 00:51:30.600
but please live in
a commune somewhere

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.260
on a kibbutz in upstate New
York eating radishes and stuff.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.840
And that's fine, I
have respect for that.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.140
But I don't have respect
for the caviar type.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.840
And then you extend
the caviar intellectual

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.627
to many, many, many things.

00:51:47.627 --> 00:51:48.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.668
NASSIM TALEB: You're welcome.

00:51:49.668 --> 00:51:51.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.280
I really like this idea
of skin in the game.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.070
I think we should
all adhere to that.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:57.990
And so as an
example of that, you

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:02.040
mentioned the save the planet,
save the Earth with the towels

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.570
thing?

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.361
NASSIM TALEB: Yeah.

00:52:03.361 --> 00:52:06.780
AUDIENCE: So indeed, that could
have been put there for one

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.190
of two reasons as I see it.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.860
It could be that they had
nefarious reasons for doing

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.500
so, they actually knew that
it didn't work like that,

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.360
but they put it there
anyway because it

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.651
might help their bottom
line, appeal to hotel guests

00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:19.150
and so on.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.340
But it could of course also
be because out of ignorance,

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:21.839
right?

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.280
It could be that
they didn't know.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.680
Many people don't know
the details of this.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.220
And as another example
of that, the peacock.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.140
And I say this as an
evolutionary biologist.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.462
The peacock's tail
is not useless.

00:52:35.462 --> 00:52:37.170
I just want to say
this once and for all,

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.660
because people always bring
up this damned example.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.330
The peacock's tail
is not useless.

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:44.880
If you see a peacock in a zoo
and a little child runs over,

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.844
a dog runs over, they
might lift their tail--

00:52:47.844 --> 00:52:50.010
it's not a tail-- but they
might lift those feathers

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:52.740
and that scares off everyone
from dogs to children.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.630
That's the purpose of that, OK?

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:55.880
Just wanted to point that out.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.963
NASSIM TALEB: OK, so yeah.

00:52:56.963 --> 00:52:59.129
But let's say the
peacock tail is useless,

00:52:59.129 --> 00:53:01.170
but there exists something
called the [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.000
signaling, which is this thing.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.280
AUDIENCE: There is
lots of signaling

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.480
that is caused as signaling.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.100
NASSIM TALEB: Exactly, yeah.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.730
AUDIENCE: And sexual
selection, indeed.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.104
Also in this case
of the peacock,

00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:12.040
does have a large effect.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.680
But it is not a useless thing.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.930
It is not something
that only inhibits it,

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.620
it actually scares
away predators.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.230
NASSIM TALEB: OK, all right.

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.550
NASSIM TALEB: Thanks.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.170
Yes?

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:20.765
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:24.810
I am curious about how
you synthesize ideas.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:27.340
Like, are there any personal
habits that you could share?

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.860
I don't know, like
how do you decide

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.799
say, what to read to
broaden your horizons,

00:53:30.799 --> 00:53:32.840
especially when there is
so much noise out there?

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.280
NASSIM TALEB: Basically,
there is a simple rule.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.270
There is a simple rule.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.950
If something bores
you, close a book.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:39.450
That's it.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:40.870
Go to something else.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.540
It's not that-- if you have to
also say if you want to read

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.580
a lot of stuff--

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.880
it's not that you need to stop
reading because you're bored.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.572
You're bored that
specific author.

00:53:49.572 --> 00:53:51.280
And then little by
little, you figure out

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.830
how people get bored with--

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.570
most books are boring and
most books don't survive.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.890
And you can tell that books
that are boring don't survive.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.840
I mean, people may buy
them for a while just

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.300
to show off with them.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.380
So if something
bores you, skip it.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.630
Don't do anything boring.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.790
And after a while, you
develop a technique

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.450
to read a lot of stuff.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:13.199
AUDIENCE: If I I can
ask a quick followup?

00:54:13.199 --> 00:54:15.573
NASSIM TALEB: Sorry, because
there are more people, yeah.

00:54:15.573 --> 00:54:16.510
But go ahead.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.990
AUDIENCE: If you have a group
of experts or pseudo experts

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.489
that has no skin
in the game, do you

00:54:20.489 --> 00:54:22.200
have a rule of thumb
on how long they

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.719
can last before it collapses?

00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:24.760
NASSIM TALEB: Definitely.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.010
This is an excellent question.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.620
Because no system--
as I was saying,

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.710
those people for example trying
in universities now to create

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:33.620
all these--

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.350
recreate classifications
that didn't exist before,

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:39.360
can it survive?

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.320
No, because you cannot--

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.690
sometimes you read something
that's completely BS,

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.510
that it takes a lot more energy
to displace BS than truth.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.180
It's the opposite.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.820
Truth is a basin of attraction,
it has been over history.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.930
So eventually things
will revert to the truth.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:00.269
There is also a mechanism,
I call the minority rule,

00:55:00.269 --> 00:55:01.810
that make things
revert to the truth.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:08.810
But in history, unless the truth
is not helpful for survival,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:15.070
you see, unless it's
really not helpful,

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:18.300
it's guaranteed to
prevail eventually.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.582
Yes?

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.790
AUDIENCE: This is sort of
a follow up on the question

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.665
which was just asked.

00:55:22.665 --> 00:55:26.381
But you're not a fan of academia
because of all the programs

00:55:26.381 --> 00:55:26.880
it has.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.250
But if you applied the Lindy
effect, look at Harvard right,

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.260
it is 300 years old.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.884
NASSIM TALEB: Yeah,
but Harvard today--

00:55:32.884 --> 00:55:35.000
so I'm shortening
to explain this.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.320
Harvard today as Lindy
has survived so long?

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.220
Several things.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.370
Number one, Harvard
today is not the way

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.180
Harvard was in the past.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.276
And the purpose of going
to Harvard in the past

00:55:45.276 --> 00:55:47.400
was not the same purpose
of going to Harvard today.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.060
People have the illusion
that universities started

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.390
as a place for people to
go read interesting books

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.500
and then go home.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:01.350
That was university, the
free peoples liberal arts,

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.160
free peoples art.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.150
So it was organized not
as a professional thing,

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.070
like medical school,
like a county school,

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.797
like vocational
school, but it was

00:56:09.797 --> 00:56:11.880
organized as a place for
people to seek knowledge.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:19.390
There was maybe some of
the ideology, but not much.

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.090
But look at universities today.

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.150
Universities today, I
mean Google no longer

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.570
hires from universities, right?

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.660
And in the past, most people
didn't go to university.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.060
People went and studied
a craft or a trade,

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:37.240
typically via this Lindy-- via
the apprenticeship mechanism.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.910
And this is the
apprenticeship mechanism.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:42.800
And still in Germany
today, half the people

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.540
go through some kind
of apprenticeship.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.890
So we have enough money
to maintain prestige goods

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:50.960
like Harvard and [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:57.970
But it's not-- society doesn't
need these universities.

00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.670
And they themselves are pricing
themselves out of the market

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:05.256
because they're turning to
selling ideology rather than

00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:06.380
selling [INAUDIBLE] theory.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.490
For example, to
give you an idea,

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:12.200
I've run into professors
of French literature

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.261
who spoke broken French.

00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:16.760
Because they speak-- and then
they have prestigious position

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.930
because they write on
some post-colonial aspect

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:22.950
of the identity
of this, of this,

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.190
and the French [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:27.920
And that's how they
judge one another.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.240
Two more minutes, OK.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.200
Two more questions.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.400
So this is why we've got to
mutate to the apprenticeship

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.006
model, back.

00:57:36.006 --> 00:57:36.860
Yes, go ahead.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.660
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.670
I heard you criticize the
Iraq war as well as the Libya

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:44.870
intervention.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.530
So I'm curious to find out
from you when intervention

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:53.236
is justified and your position
on the non-interference

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.020
like in Rwanda.

00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:54.290
NASSIM TALEB: OK.

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:55.710
If you own it-- very simple.

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:59.600
To shorten, it is justified
if those who advocate for it

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.080
are willing to pay the
price if they're wrong.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:09.680
If you want you settle in Iraq
in case something goes wrong?

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.580
Be my guest.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.250
Go ahead and we're going
to listen to your opinion.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.740
But you've got a price to
pay if things go wrong.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.390
You want to settle in Libya?

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:18.100
Go ahead.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.680
Today Libya has a slave market.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.040
Don't tell me that your
thing was harmless.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.120
It's called iatrogenics.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.190
People should always
pay for the iatrogenics.

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.320
AUDIENCE: What's
the price though?

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.810
NASSIM TALEB: Some
kind of price.

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:34.405
For now it's zero price.

00:58:34.405 --> 00:58:35.720
Yes?

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.070
Last question I guess, because--

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:38.980
yes, go ahead?

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:39.800
NASSIM TALEB: Yeah.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.020
AUDIENCE: If you read things
like the Federalist Papers

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.978
that framers go out of
their way to talk about.

00:58:43.978 --> 00:58:46.550
Sort of decentralizing power
and how important that is,

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:50.040
and that's a big reason
why the US is still around.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.490
Do we need something
similar for corporations

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.050
as well, because they have a
tendency to really centralize

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:55.550
their power?

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.520
Or do we just need to leave it
to markets to kill companies

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:57.780
that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.480
NASSIM TALEB: Corporations, no.

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.870
It's best for corporations
to die and be replaced.

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.920
I mean, you're not going to
die if your corporation dies.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.497
Or it mutates into a
different group, or spin-off,

00:59:08.497 --> 00:59:09.330
and stuff like that.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:16.010
But visibly, if you want
to come back to this world,

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.975
come back as a decentralized
system of cockroaches

00:59:18.975 --> 00:59:20.330
rather than elephants.

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:24.170
Your survival as a species it's
going to be longer, you see?

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.350
So the corporations,
basically the minute

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.890
a company joins the
S&amp;P 500, it looks

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:37.900
like it started committing
the suicide process.

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.420
And of course, companies
that don't join the S&amp;P 500

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.560
have a huge survival advantage.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.010
What shows from the data, family
businesses, stuff like that.

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:49.760
So it looks like when
you join the market,

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.760
become large enough
to have investors,

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.980
your policy is
going to be driven

00:59:54.980 --> 01:00:03.950
by the 28-year-old journalist
major who joined at the Wall

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.836
Street Journal who is
going to comment on you

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.695
and call up Steve Jobs and
bully him, for example.

01:00:09.695 --> 01:00:11.629
This has happened, OK?

01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.670
So this what's going to
happen, all the analysts,

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.780
the MBA from Wharton--

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.740
some of my classmates became
analysts at Goldman Sachs

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.300
and then call up the
chairperson of a company

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.290
and bully him or her.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.640
So this is the--

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.050
so the stock market
accelerates the process.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:29.589
And then we have
no evidence, we've

01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:31.880
seen no evidence of economies
of scale for being large.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.520
As a matter of fact, there
are economies of scale that

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.984
are discussed in "Antifragile."

01:00:35.984 --> 01:00:37.150
Thanks for inviting me back.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:40.200
[APPLAUSE]
