and I actually ran the Computer Services

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
and I actually ran the Computer Services
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679

and so I went and visited it and what

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
and so I went and visited it and what
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.200
and so I went and visited it and what
happened for me is I talked to three

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.359
different entrepreneurial groups
back-to-back and each one of them told

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
back-to-back and each one of them told
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.520

me that they had saved ninety-eight
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.700
me that they had saved ninety-eight
percent or so it's like 97 98 99 percent

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
percent or so it's like 97 98 99 percent

of their development costs by working
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.920
of their development costs by working
out of that tech shop and so what they

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
out of that tech shop and so what they
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.719
out of that tech shop and so what they
had they gone out and had bids one was

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
had they gone out and had bids one was
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279
had they gone out and had bids one was
like three hundred thousand dollars to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
like three hundred thousand dollars to
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.859
like three hundred thousand dollars to
get one prod

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869

one was like $2,500 in and they you know
 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.270
one was like $2,500 in and they you know
they pointed us like you know you know

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
they pointed us like you know you know
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.100

was an infrared pet warming device like

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
was an infrared pet warming device like
 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.039
was an infrared pet warming device like
a great big huge plastic with with the

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049
a great big huge plastic with with the
 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.000
a great big huge plastic with with the
wires in it and the idea is that the dog

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
wires in it and the idea is that the dog
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460
wires in it and the idea is that the dog
or the cat comes out of surgery it needs

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
or the cat comes out of surgery it needs
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.069
or the cat comes out of surgery it needs
to be warmed the current technology is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079
to be warmed the current technology is
 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.729
to be warmed the current technology is
wet blankets in the microwave that's not

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
wet blankets in the microwave that's not
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.589
wet blankets in the microwave that's not
really a technology in my mind but

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599
really a technology in my mind but
 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.059
really a technology in my mind but
that's what they were using to keep the

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069
that's what they were using to keep the
 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.160
that's what they were using to keep the
dogs or the cat's warm sometimes they

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
dogs or the cat's warm sometimes they
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.380
dogs or the cat's warm sometimes they
would get burned sometimes somebody

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390
would get burned sometimes somebody
 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.270
would get burned sometimes somebody
would get distracted and then the you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
would get distracted and then the you
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.440
would get distracted and then the you
know the wicking would actually make the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450
know the wicking would actually make the
 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.809
know the wicking would actually make the
the dog or the cat get cold rather than

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819
the dog or the cat get cold rather than
 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.729
the dog or the cat get cold rather than
trying to warm them up again and so is a

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739
trying to warm them up again and so is a
 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.470
trying to warm them up again and so is a
simple idea was we'll just use infrared

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480
simple idea was we'll just use infrared
 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.330
simple idea was we'll just use infrared
you know you set one dial based on the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
you know you set one dial based on the
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.369
you know you set one dial based on the
size of the the animal another dial bait

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379
size of the the animal another dial bait
 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.720
size of the the animal another dial bait
based on the thickness of the coat and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730
based on the thickness of the coat and
 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.610
based on the thickness of the coat and
another timer so it just goes off after

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
another timer so it just goes off after
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949
another timer so it just goes off after
about 10 or 15 minutes simple really

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959
about 10 or 15 minutes simple really
 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.309
about 10 or 15 minutes simple really
good idea and Annie said Polly yeah I

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319
good idea and Annie said Polly yeah I
 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.400
good idea and Annie said Polly yeah I
was a great idea but my original bid was

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
was a great idea but my original bid was
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.789
was a great idea but my original bid was
for $250,000 and then he looks at me

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799
for $250,000 and then he looks at me
 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.009
for $250,000 and then he looks at me
says you know mark I I'm a roadie for

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019
says you know mark I I'm a roadie for
 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.150
