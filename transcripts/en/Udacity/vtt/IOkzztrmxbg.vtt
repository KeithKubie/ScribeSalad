00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What I'd like to do now is add this to our file that we've been editing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So we already have an input tag here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
let's add that name parameter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's go to our browser now, we'll reload,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you can see our input box hasn't changed.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We added a name attribute in our HTML,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but the appearance of the input box doesn't change--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the name attribute doesn't affect it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What I'd like you to do is enter some text in this box,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and press enter, and we'll see what happens.
