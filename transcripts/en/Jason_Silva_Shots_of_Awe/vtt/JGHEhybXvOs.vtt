00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.437
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.175
The philosopher Timothy Leary
had some wildly utopian ideas

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.300
about what could be made
possible with the computer

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.900
revolution and the internet and
the communications revolution

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.660
that transpired thereafter.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.310
And he used to say
that we can actually

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.460
use these tools to
upgrade our consciousness,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.900
to electrify our thoughts
so that our memes could

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.760
travel at the speed of
light and spray eyeballs

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.820
through the screen and
lead to altered states

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.062
of consciousness, spaces
of ecstatic illumination

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:37.520
so that we could
use our technology

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.410
to upgrade the mind of mankind.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.470
And who knows if
that might happen?

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.220
We're moving now towards what
people refer to as a sharing

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.600
economy, where people can
tweet and share and upload

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.870
and repurpose and
reconstitute and recombine

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.370
ideas in ways that they
never could before.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.780
Of course, it calls into
question things like copyright,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.629
things like how to
tag original work.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.045
What makes something
original when

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.540
it can be so easily
transformed and reconceived.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.010
Does that make it something new?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.180
Is everything a remix
of what came before,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.830
as Kirby Ferguson says?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.530
Or are we just
moving into a space

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640
where people can borrow,
steal, and repurpose

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.920
without giving due credit?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.960
I mean, technology's always
been a double-edged sword.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.885
It extends, but
it also amputates,

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:18.880
as Marshall McLuhan used to say.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.180
It also opens up new
possibility spaces

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.770
for human expression, for human
dialogue, for human engagement.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.680
This communication
revolution has always

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.370
been about extending our
capacity in both directions.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.260
And it's up to us
to see how we use

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.040
these new tools to transform who
we are into what we might be.
