00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
There's an assumption at large that sexiness is at heart about nakedness and explicitness

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.380
and that logically therefore, the sexiest scenarios must also be the ones involving

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.900
the greatest amounts of nudity

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.300
but the truth about excitement is rather different. At the core of sexiness is an idea:

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.700
The idea of being allowed into someone's life

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.440
when the memory of having been excluded from it, is at its most vivid

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.260
sexiness stems from a contrast between prohibition and acceptance, it's a species of relief

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.700
and thanks at being given permission to touch and go anywhere

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.860
oddly, this gratitude is likely to be most prevalent, not when one's being granted full license by someone

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.680
but when one is on the borderline. When one's only just been lent a pass

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.240
and when the memory of the taboo nature of touching others is still intense

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.700
the reminder of the danger of rejection brings the wonder of being included into sharp ecstatic relief

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.880
this explains why the decision to keep one's clothes on a bit longer than strictly necessary

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.900
to deliberately keep clothes on during sex can prove such a turn-on

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.700
to heighten excitement we may design a scenario in which we are allowed only to press against one another

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.820
never moving beyond guilty caresses and small thrusts

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.800
like we might have been forced to do in early adolescence or in a nunnery in the 1300s

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.840
such games mean we can keep revisiting the incredible idea of permission, the outer garments evoke the barriers

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.760
one's finally been able to cross with impunity. We are, via the game, trying to get over a trauma around exclusion

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520
once we're used to being undressed around someone, the wonder they've allowed us into their lives

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.080
is liable to get lost and taken for granted

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.120
the game of keeping one's clothes on, tries to keep the interest of nakedness alive by drawing attention to its privilige and intimacy

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.120
the game symbolizes a poignant celebration of the beauty of being, at last, granted permission
