00:00:03.087 --> 00:00:05.300
JENNY: Hi everyone.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.370
Jenny Murphy here.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.460
Welcome to another episode
of the Google+

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.990
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.610
Today we're going to have an
open questions and answer

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.390
session, so now is your chance
to ask us anything and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.990
everything about developing
on the Google+ Platform.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.255
So about the REST APIs,
Hangout APIs, even our

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:29.505
dinosaur as well.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.220
So before we get going, I'm
going to introduce the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.120
people around me.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.170
So starting with the people who
are joining me in person

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.155
at the Googleplex, we have--

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:43.690
CHIRAG: Chirag Shah, Developer
Programs Engineer on the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.910
Google+ platform.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.410
And--

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.290
SILVANO: And I am Silvano
Luciani, Developer Programs

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.180
Engineer [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.110
of the Google+ Platform.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.300
JENNY: Yes, you flew in all
the way from London for us

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.480
today, right?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.960
SILVANO: And I'm still
jet-lagged.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.070
JENNY: Oh, and you're
still jet-lagged?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.320
Well, thanks for getting up.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.420
And joining us via the magic of
Hangouts, in no particular

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.340
order, specifically the order
from left to right in my

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.650
little filmstrip at the
bottom of the Hangout.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.800
Starting with you, Allen.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
ALLEN: Hi there, I'm
Allen Firstenberg.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.108
I'm a Outside Developer that
does Hangout apps primarily.

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.980
JENNY: And, how about Chad?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.190
CHAD: I'm Chad LaFarge.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.330
I'm in Columbia, Missouri.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.670
I developed Pro Studio.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.960
We might touch on
that later on.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.986
But I'm relatively new to
Hangout extension development.

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:38.080
JENNY: Great.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.330
And Charles?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.825
CHARLES: I'm Charles Jaimet, I'm
a developer in Canada, and

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:46.410
one of the co-developers of
Tabletop Forge, which is a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.490
Hangout app for playing games.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.422
JENNY: Great.

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:50.390
And Fraser?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.420
FRASER: Hi, my name's
Fraser Cain.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.210
I'm the publisher of Universe
Today, and we've been doing a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.440
virtual star party on Google+
where we connect telescopes

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.320
into Hangouts.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.265
JENNY: Gerwin?

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:06.440
GERWIN: Yeah, I am Gerwin
from Austria.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.220
I'm most probably well-known
for the Comment Tracker

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.916
extension, and I recently did
Hangout Band Hangout app,

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.536
which is fun, I think.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.160
JENNY: Very cool.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.840
And last but not least, Jason.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800
JASON: Hi everybody, I'm Jason
Salas, and I am from Guam,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.710
where it is about 4:50 in
the morning right now.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.010
So I got up, and I'm very, very
happy to be with you fine

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.640
folks and everybody out there
streaming on the net.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.320
I am a software developer and a
sportscaster, and a marketer

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.100
for a large TV station
out here.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.860
And I do a lot of R&amp;D,
specifically

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.050
with the Hangout API.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.930
And I'm really excited to be
here and just talk about some

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.834
of the neat stuff that's going
on in our community.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:49.650
JENNY: Great.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.330
Thanks for the intros,
everyone.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.320
So while we wait for the
questions to queue up, there

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.620
is some news that is pretty
exciting that we've been

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.540
following for a while.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.095
The Tabletop Forge has launched
a Kickstarter and is

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.680
achieving great success
so far.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.070
And I think someone here knows
something about that.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.650
CHARLES: Well what do you
want to know about?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.860
We put the Kickstarter up on
Saturday morning, and Joshuha

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.420
Owen and I, who put it up, along
with two others, Joseph

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.822
Schnurr and Andrew Chason,
who did our design.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.450
It was our first Kickstarter,
so we were all very nervous

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.500
the night before.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
And we hit our goal
in one day.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.760
So we put up what we thought was
a fairly modest, hittable

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.260
goal at $5,000, which seems to
be the sort of standard amount

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.700
and enough to get us going.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.870
And we hit that.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800
By Sunday morning, we had to
put up a stretch goal.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.360
And then we had to put up a
second stretch goal, and we're

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.030
now $430, 20, $413-- my
math is bad today--

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.110
away from hitting that
goal, so we got

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.063
another one lined up.

00:03:58.063 --> 00:04:00.120
JENNY: Oh, you have another
stretch goal lined

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.140
up after that one?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.140
CHARLES: Yeah, Jonathan Roberts,
who does a lot of RPG

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.880
maps, is going to give
us a license to a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.210
bunch of his maps.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.860
So basically the Kickstarter,
the app, is a way to play

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.350
role-playing games online
in a Google Hangout.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.110
So role-playing games like
Dungeons and Dragons is

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.300
probably the most well-known,
but then there are hundreds of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.850
others that allow you to create
a fantasy or sci-fi or

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.460
historic setting, and for a
number of people who play

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970
characters inside that setting
and then to explore the world.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.840
And so it's a strategy,
tactical game.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.600
It's also a collective
storytelling game, depends

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.180
entirely on how you play it
and which ruleset you use.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.090
But normally it's played at a
table, and then you've got on

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.220
the tabletop in front of you,
sometimes a map, sometimes

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.300
some pictures, some visual
aids to play the game.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.950
Sometimes people use little
miniatures to represent

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.990
themselves going
through rooms.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.330
You roll dice, and we reproduced
that experience in

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.110
the Hangouts.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.820
So it's just pretty cool.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.830
Makes the game actually work so
you can see what somebody

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.680
else has rolled, as opposed to
somebody rolling their die

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.940
off-camera and saying
oh, I got a 12.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.780
So that's been our experience,
and the Kickstarter's mostly

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.650
about trying to get--

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.320
right now it looks like
something designed by

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.790
programmers, which it is.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.170
And what we want it to look like
is something designed by

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.350
designers with beautiful
artists' work in there.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.640
Because that's what really makes
things pop, people are

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.440
very visual.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.010
So we're getting indie
designers and indie

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.120
cartographers and game
developers to license their

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.030
works to us so that we can
incorporate them into the app.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.204
That's basically
the gist of it.

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:56.485
JENNY: Very cool.

00:05:56.485 --> 00:05:58.710
Yeah, I've always loved this
application because it's a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.800
great example of something
really cool that you can do

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.441
with Hangout apps that are hard
to do on other platforms.

00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:08.820
Hangout apps are a lot like
having a kitchen table in

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.180
front of you.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.260
And applications that leverage
that kind of metaphor seem to

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.400
work really well.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.920
And the best ones are where you
can start to do things in

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.950
the Hangout that are hard
to do in reality.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.750
For example, in tabletop gaming,
it's hard to roll a

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.600
one or seven-sided die.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.590
But having Hangout apps you
can do it, and it actually

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.836
seems to make the games
flow really well.

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:33.240
And people have called it
a great example of both

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.170
leveraging Hangout
apps in that way.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.710
CHARLES: Thanks.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.510
You know, it's funny, Fraser's
always in these hangouts when

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.320
I'm in them.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.810
Fraser's the reason that I got
into building in Hangout apps

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.405
in the first place.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.530
He and I were playing a game
called Ars Magica in his

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.520
living room, which I think you
can actually see behind him.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.070
We used to go in there once a
week on Tuesdays and play this

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.650
game, Ars Magica.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.760
And then slowly people drifted
away from the game.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.080
They had obligations, some guy
got a girlfriend, the nerve,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.120
and then moved to
another city.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.700
And it just kind
of fell apart.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.440
And we decided we'd take a look
at doing it in Hangouts,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.470
and that's where I got
programming, and that's where

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.620
I met Josh.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.390
And I don't even have
a physical game

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.445
anymore that I go to.

00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:21.420
I keep nagging Fraser to start
up an Ars Magica game again,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.600
but all my gaming now is online
through Hangouts and it

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.640
works really, really well.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.820
And I've met some really cool
people, too, in the process,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.275
which has been the added
benefit that I

00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:32.190
didn't really expect.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.880
I just thought I'll get
my game going, I'll

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.770
find a couple people.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.270
But really, I've played with
some of the people whose

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.000
rulebooks I've read.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.110
You get connected to these
really amazing people, and

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.710
then they play and you go oh,
wow, I didn't even know you

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.430
could play that way.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.780
It's kind of like playing chess
in your basement for

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.515
your entire life, and then all
of a sudden you get online,

00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:55.328
and you can play with
Garry Kasparov.

00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:58.710
FRASER: Yeah, geography just
doesn't matter anymore.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:04.745
Like Charles says, we live in
a small town, it's brutal to

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:06.770
try and get an actual gaming
group together, especially for

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.790
something that's really obscure,
like Ars Magica, that

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.100
we like to play.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.460
But boy, there's a thread on
Google+ right now that has 30

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.370
people who love the game
and really want

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.390
to play it in Hangout.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.220
So we could easily put together
a group from all

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.590
those people.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.560
And instead of having to drag
people kicking and screaming

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.270
into a game system they don't
understand, you've got people

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.620
who are totally into
playing the game.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.570
So it's just great.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.998
Geography just doesn't
matter anymore.

00:08:36.998 --> 00:08:38.500
JENNY: That's really cool.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.712
I can't wait to see what other
cool, cute things along this

00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:43.486
line people come up with
in the future.

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:46.660
SILVANO: Yeah, I think also a
great achievement of such an

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.940
application is that it's easy
for players to join because of

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.400
the game engine is simplified.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.710
But you keep the role-playing
aspect because you are

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.560
role-playing your character in
the Hangout, and you can be a

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.405
wizard, the fighter, the
whatever it is and actually

00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:06.620
role-play, which is great.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.030
JENNY: Yeah, that
is very cool.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.615
CHARLES: Have you guys
tried it out yet?

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:15.870
JENNY: I have tried it out
very little beyond our

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.330
experiences in these Hangouts,
unfortunately.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.030
It's a little bit of a
busy time here for

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.920
those of us at Google.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.280
We have a conference or
something coming up I hear.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.980
CHARLES: So I hear.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.670
JENNY: Yeah, but once that's
done, it's definitely my top

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.620
Hangout apps that I want to
start playing with more.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.560
Cool, okey-doke.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.510
So, thanks for filling
us in on what's new

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.260
with Tabletop Forge.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.530
Before we go to questions
outside of the Hangout, how

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.680
about inside the Hangout?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.200
Because questions are best
asked in person.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.350
So, do any of you have questions
for us about your

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.680
recent developments on
the Google+ platform?

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.960
FRASER: Yeah, I got a question,
which is that I love

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.510
the Pro Studio app for the
Hangout, and I love the

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.420
Comment Tracker app, and I
love the Lower Third one.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.720
And yet I can't run all three
at the same time, so you've

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.140
made me choose.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.170
And I've had to--

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.950
and are you ready?

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.590
My choice is the Comment
Tracker,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.040
which is just amazing.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.900
It completely changed my
life, I got to say.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.270
Because when we run these
Hangouts, we'll have hundreds

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.220
of people watching.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.320
The comments are showing up
over on Google+, they're

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.920
showing up on Twitter, they're
showing up on YouTube, all at

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.660
the same time.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.490
And I was having to sort
of switch windows.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.270
And every time I would switch a
window, the memory footprint

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.550
would change, and then
my stream would gimp.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.370
So anyway, the Comment Tracker
is fantastic, and I've been

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.960
pitching lots of features
at Gerwin.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.495
But I love the Pro Studio
features as well, but I can't

00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:01.240
run them both at
the same time.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.020
So, will it ever be possible
to run multiple

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.880
apps at the same time?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.510
JENNY: Well, already today, you
can, as I'm sure you know,

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.230
but maybe not everybody knows,
you can run an extension and

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.910
an application at the same.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.110
An extension being one of those
that sits in the side

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.345
and the application being
one that runs in

00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:25.980
the rest of the Hangout.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.330
And that gives you a little bit
of flexibility, but we're

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.090
definitely [? looking at ?] ways
that we can expand that.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.610
The obvious challenges are that
when two Hangout apps use

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.620
the same features, they can
stomp on each other and cause

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.930
all sorts of headaches for the
developers trying to make

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.840
their apps compatible with other
simultaneously running

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.090
applications.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.220
And there are some other
challenges we're facing, but

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.760
that's definitely something
we're looking into,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.214
and Google is, too.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.495
FRASER: Either that, or just get
inspired by these features

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:04.850
and build them right into
Hangouts itself.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.060
Because a lot of them are
pretty fundamental.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.060
JENNY: That would definitely
work, too.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.635
Many of them, rolled into the
main products, that would free

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:17.166
up that extension or application
slot for one of

00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:18.215
the other ones.

00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.120
FRASER: Yeah, and I would
say all three pieces of

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.630
functionality are pretty core
for what you need to do.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.670
So please.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.530
JENNY: Great feedback.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.840
CHAD: And that kind of brings us
to the moderation controls

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.050
that people have been
talking about,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.370
asking about for awhile.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.490
Part of the reason why Pro
Studio was developed was to

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.970
try and provide some of those
moderation controls.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.080
Is Google looking at
incorporating greater control

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.660
for the host or the creator
of the Hangout?

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:54.330
JENNY: We're always looking
at adding more features.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.020
It all depends on-- there's a
lot of stuff we want to add to

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.085
Hangouts, and we're adding new
capabilities every day.

00:13:00.085 --> 00:13:03.540
In terms of what specifically
we're adding and when we're

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.840
adding them, I'm afraid this is
something we don't really

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.460
talk about.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.310
Because things can change at any
time, and we don't want to

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.700
promise something and
not deliver it.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.420
But moderation features are
definitely something that's on

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.520
our radar, and we've heard
a lot about that.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.450
Not yet, hang in there.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.710
CHIRAG: We've been listening
to the community, and we're

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.662
aware of a lot of
these features.

00:13:29.662 --> 00:13:31.207
But we can't talk about
future releases.

00:13:31.207 --> 00:13:34.680
JENNY: Yes, we cannot
see into the future.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.870
Our vision into the
future is just as

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.722
limited as everyone else's.

00:13:39.722 --> 00:13:41.700
SILVANO: But it will
be awesome.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.210
JENNY: But it will be
awesome, that's the

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.235
one thing we promise.

00:13:44.235 --> 00:13:46.500
It will be awesome
when it's around.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.066
Whatever it is, it
will be awesome.

00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:52.170
CHARLES: We had troubles over
the weekend with a Hangout On

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.370
Air where we were trying
to run the app.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.180
And people weren't able
to see the app.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.900
People weren't able to see the
app with the main screen.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.470
What they were seeing was the
full video of the individual

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.137
people talking, but they
couldn't actually see the

00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:11.424
board or the tokens moving.

00:14:11.424 --> 00:14:14.090
JENNY: Oh, so they had the
application installed and

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.080
running, and it was
not rendering?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.410
CHARLES: I had it installed
and running.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.130
Everybody else in the
game did as well.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.890
And then we ran an On
Air version of it.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:28.090
And what the people watching saw
was just the main video.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:35.740
So what I had to do was one of
the guys screen shared his

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.425
video window with me, and then
I stuck my video on that so

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:42.370
that everybody could see that.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.805
But it meant that I couldn't
use the app.

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:45.200
I couldn't roll the
dice for myself.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.450
I couldn't do anything.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.090
The ideal work-around would have
been to get somebody else

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.580
who wasn't playing the game to
just log in just so that they

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:02.060
could run the On Air and lock
their screen on my window.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.640
But everybody would only have
seen my window then.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.440
CHAD: You want to be able to
have the broadcast user kind

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.140
of run the app or
render the app.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.750
And Allen, we were talking this
past Friday night about

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.090
being able to do that.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.410
CHARLES: Yeah, so somebody
basically has to be the

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.570
broadcast user, and then they
can't actually be involved in

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.934
the game in any way.

00:15:22.934 --> 00:15:26.460
ALLEN: Yeah, part of the problem
is that there's a

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.250
separate hidden user in
a Hangout On Air.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.540
And it's basically recording
and doing what's doing the

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.460
streaming of the video stream.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.120
But it's only looking
at the video stream.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.400
So for example, when your app
is running, you're not

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.390
actually modifying the
video stream itself.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.020
You're just modifying the rest
of the screen that's available

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.220
for your app to run.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.950
Kind of a work-around that you
could do is that you could

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:58.040
have that portion being dumped
on top of your video stream.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.300
And that would replace your
face with what your

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.820
application is showing.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.160
Or use the work-around that you
have, with another person

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.440
logging in and sharing it.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.710
Or eventually, convince the
Google development team to

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.120
allow the streaming user to
also be running apps.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.090
But there are problems with
the streaming user running

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.995
apps as well.

00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:27.512
CHARLES: So I'm going
for option C there.

00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:29.930
FRASER: Right, but I guess as
you develop your app, you'd

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.100
want some way that you can
control portions that get put

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.040
out into the video, that you can
almost, as you said, you

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.560
can control the video stream
that's being displayed to the

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.140
public and be able to inject
relevant stuff into that

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.270
stream at the right time.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.070
So in the example of the
Tabletop Forge, if a person

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.810
rolls some dice, then
everybody's going to want to

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.450
see the results of
that die roll.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.550
But it's going to probably look
different than the map or

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.445
whatever that the person
is seeing.

00:16:58.445 --> 00:17:00.465
And so you're going to have
something custom that's going

00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:03.360
to need to be displayed just
for the Hangouts On Air

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.780
CHARLES: Well except that with
the API, you can pretty much

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.680
create that.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.630
That's what our app shows is
what we want everybody to see.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:17.260
So we take the main video, and
we embed it inside the app.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.220
And it's a movable window,
and you've got another

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.130
window for your dice.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.770
And then behind everything
you've got the map.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:28.079
I just want that whole area
that's my app area, I want

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.650
that to be the On Air
video stream.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.486
So pretty please.

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:37.370
JENNY: So that's a pretty good
summary of a bad situation.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:41.300
So right now, the way to share
a Hangout app On Air is to

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.900
screen share someone running
the application, which then

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.010
has all those problems
you mentioned.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.570
You're only seeing one user's
view, and then also the user

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.020
cannot use the app the
same way as they

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.440
would be able to otherwise.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.780
And there are some interesting
challenges we want to make

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.640
sure we get right.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.370
For example, if you were
broadcasting a game of poker,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.510
each one of the players is going
to only be able to see

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.230
their cards and not the cards
of the other people involved

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.580
in the poker game.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.630
And we have the open question of
what is the headless unique

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.800
Hangout user stream look like.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.820
Is it everyone's cards?

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.130
Is it no one's cards?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.240
Is it something that's up to
the application developer?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.870
And would the application
developer have to

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.470
support this feature?

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.580
And those are things that we
still have open questions that

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.280
we're working through, but this
is definitely something

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.065
we're aware of.

00:18:32.065 --> 00:18:39.010
CHARLES: That seems sort of
privacy, a public space is

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.040
probably going to come up with
us, too, but we've had people

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.180
ask us if they can have separate
desktops that are

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.900
just their own, or tabletops
that are just their own, so

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.420
that you would have a shared
space that every

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.215
player could see.

00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:53.890
But then some games involve
cards as well, and you'd want

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.780
to be able to hide
your own cards.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.710
But if you could just flag divs
or elements in the video

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.690
that were private and public,
that would solve

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.750
our problems at least.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.910
I imagine whatever worked for
poker would work for us.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.570
JENNY: That's an interesting
solution.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.790
Because right now, the way you
would handle different players

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.830
with different cards is your
instance of the Hangout app

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.480
has to be aware of which cards
are yours and display those

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.260
and hide everyone else's.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.280
But since it's all in the web
browser, there's always that

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.200
potential of somebody peeking
through with the

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.710
[? x-factor ?] or something
like that.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.060
Because a shared state,
it'll share it

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.330
across all of the users.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.420
CHARLES: We're going to take
it one step further and let

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.430
the GM probably look at
everybody's tabletops.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.900
Because some games, especially
for new users, you're going to

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.510
want the GM to be able to look
at the person's cards and give

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.190
some suggestions and say
oh, you want to use

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.570
this and this together.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.650
So the ability to share your
tabletop as well as keep it

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.620
private, or just have one person
who's the superuser.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.440
FRASER: It's almost like you
want to have somebody thinking

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.610
like a director, right?

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.155
Because you've already got
these constraints.

00:20:04.155 --> 00:20:06.760
You've got the constraints
of the window.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.450
You've got the constraints of
the app environment that's

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.720
inside the window, and then
that's what's being broadcast.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.735
And so a director or a
cinematographer, or director

00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:17.920
of photography, would say oh,
well here's how we would

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.950
display these dice
being rolled.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.340
And it might look completely
different than what the people

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.050
within the app are going to
see, but something that's

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.540
better displayed
for the public.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.600
You might want to see a really
nice 3-D rendered seven-sided

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600
die rolling down the table,
which would look completely

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.910
different than what the users
inside the app would see.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.800
They'd probably have something
a little more utilitarian.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.995
But if you're going to have--

00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:43.200
ALLEN: This is broadcast
quality.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.100
You want it to look like
broadcast quality.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.660
FRASER: Yeah, and so the app
developer is going to need

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:52.230
some way to be able to code in
the broadcast quality into the

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.100
app itself.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.860
Poker I think is a fantastic
example.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.590
It deals with every problem
all at the same time, the

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.170
privacy, the public issue, the
custom views for every person.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.770
And then what does
the public see?

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.180
I don't know, how do they do
it on a live game of poker,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.030
when you watch it on TV?

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.990
CHAD: I wonder if you could do
like the interface elements,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.990
or the private things, like your
cards, and you just do an

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.160
animated overlay.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.270
Keep refreshing the overlay
for the public board that

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.815
everyone should be
able to see.

00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:30.170
Did that make sense?

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.360
An overlay will broadcast, and
your interface would be

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.720
personal to everyone who's
using the app.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.820
ALLEN: Yeah, the problem with
that, though, is that your

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.660
overlay now becomes overwriting
the thumbnail at

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.840
the bottom.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.730
That was my first or
second suggestion.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.660
So I think it's workable as
a work-around, but I think

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.980
long-term, we would want a way
to run these apps under the

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.800
video user and control that app
from somewhere, somehow.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.430
JENNY: Very cool.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.100
Yeah, so this would definitely
have a lot of really cool

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.766
potential for broadcasting
applications.

00:22:07.766 --> 00:22:11.120
CHARLES: Especially
for Kickstarters.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.923
We ran one game, and it got some
attention, but because we

00:22:14.923 --> 00:22:16.650
had such technical issues,
because it was the first On

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.660
Air one that I'd done.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.950
I hit Fraser up for some advice,
but still, it was a

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.810
bit of a fiasco for the
first 15 minutes.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.860
It would be really nice to be
able to showcase what it is

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.420
that you're trying to raise
money for in a nice easy way.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.320
So for anybody who's trying to
do it, you get one person

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.975
who's not involved to
do the On Air part.

00:22:36.975 --> 00:22:37.550
FRASER: Yeah.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.940
I mean we've found with the
number of Hangouts--

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.900
I mean, I've probably done about
50 Hangouts On-Air now.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.720
And I mean, maybe it looks
really natural, but there's a

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.370
ton of prep work that we go
through with every person to

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.570
make sure their audio, their
video, their method of getting

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.380
their telescope into the Hangout
is working properly

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.700
and looking the way that
we want it to look.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.920
It's actually a lot of work to
get that all done right.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.290
So yeah, I can see trying to
show a role-playing game live

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.008
would have been tough.

00:23:08.008 --> 00:23:10.080
CHARLES: It was pretty
funny, actually.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.670
Because you don't want to be
watching your YouTube stream

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.510
at the same time that you're
broadcasting that.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.430
So it took a while for us
to realize that we were

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.382
broadcasting nonsense.

00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:26.320
FRASER: And if anyone wants, if
you go to my profile page,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.950
I've got a great big laundry
list of all of my tips and

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.130
tricks for Hangouts On Air.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.630
I've got all of the lessons that
I've learned so far, so

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.001
it's just on my Google+ profile,
there's a link to it.

00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:38.905
JENNY: Great, well, we'll
put that in the

00:23:38.905 --> 00:23:40.430
share notes for sure.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.970
CHIRAG: There's one question
from Tom Birmingham on the

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.335
questions list.

00:23:45.335 --> 00:23:49.070
Do you have any suggestions on
how to port my Android app to

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.870
run in the Hangout?

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.050
And that's a really
good question.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.230
So if you have a native Android
application, it's

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.580
probably written in Java.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.590
You first need to rewrite that
to use HTML, CSS and

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.830
JavaScript.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.450
So your list views and all of
your views will need to be

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.030
represented as proper
HTML DOM elements.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.540
And now if your Android
application understands the

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.100
multiplayer components, you can
start to use shared state

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.910
offered by Hangouts.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.210
So you first need to do some
groundwork, and porting it

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.030
over to run on the
web browser.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.360
And once you've done that, most
of the hard work is done.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.660
And then you can go on to using
the Hangout APIs that

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.560
shared states [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.980
JASON: Well, there's an
interesting idea.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.270
That's very clever, because
that also introduces the

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.970
possibility of, say, like if
somebody develops an app, like

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.120
a game or something like that.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.410
And say--

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.020
sorry to bring up the licensing
thing-- but like if

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.340
somebody's playing Monopoly,
you could have some players

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.580
playing on an Android device
and then some players also

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.580
playing in a Hangout.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.470
And you could actually
bridge the two

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.590
platforms at the same time.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.720
Not necessarily like one or
the other, but you could

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.580
possibly bring in Hangout people
playing with people

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.130
that are truly on
mobile devices.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.440
JENNY: That would
be really cool.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.090
It would require some of your
own systems to give you some

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.480
of that synchronization.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.260
Because the shared state
for that [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.145
Hangout is only available in
the Hangout itself, the

00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:15.960
Hangout that's running.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.910
If you want to start to involve
other devices and

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.410
other sources, like a web
front end or a mobile

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.240
application, and have them
playing the same real-time

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.750
game, that is definitely
possible.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.970
But it will then be the
responsibility of the

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.770
developer to figure out a way
to synchronize those states

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.760
between multiple platforms.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.330
And that might be kind of
challenging, depending on

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.050
what's happening in the game.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.390
And it will be really cool
to see if someone did

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.926
take a spin at that.

00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:47.650
CHAD: Anything really
time-sensitive is going to be

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:48.530
more difficult.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.570
But yeah, having a central
server be the proxy to

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.420
communicate between the
different platforms, as long

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.290
as a couple hundred milliseconds
isn't going to

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.104
make a difference,
it'd be cool.

00:26:01.104 --> 00:26:05.030
JENNY: Yeah, the unfortunate
part is it requires them to

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.260
reimplement a lot of the
features that make Hangout

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.490
apps really cool.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.560
And we'll probably have to come
up with interesting ways

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.695
to bridge that, like have one
designated user in a Hangout

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:16.420
be the one that synchronizes
with the server.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.615
I'm sure that when someone
attempts this, they'll come up

00:26:19.615 --> 00:26:21.740
with lots of really interesting
best practices and

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.990
recommendations.

00:26:26.676 --> 00:26:31.310
CHIRAG: Let us know if you
get around to doing that.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.760
JENNY: Yeah, if you start
to port your internet.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.765
Another implementation starting
from the internet

00:26:36.765 --> 00:26:40.680
that might be probably just as
much work, couldn't you run it

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.570
as an applet?

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.020
Because then at least
it's Java.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.480
But then you're going to have
to reimplement all the

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.800
interface features in an applet,
and then you'd have an

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.950
applet, which is not
very 21st century.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.350
And then you'll have to write
all the bridging code, so

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.626
don't do that.

00:26:55.626 --> 00:27:01.920
JASON: Hello, 1998.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.110
Well, I have a question if I
may, unless you guys are going

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.950
to [INAUDIBLE] something.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.850
Well, just a real quick update
on my Hangout app in

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.610
development.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.330
Mine is actually stymied
because--

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.660
I don't know, some of you guys
know that I was actually

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.460
working on an app to allow paid
Netflix subscribers to

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.190
actually be able to watch movies
and enjoy them within

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.130
the same Hangout app and
everything like that.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.260
I'm kind of running into a
little bit of road blocks with

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.270
Netflix themselves, so if
anybody is watching this from

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.760
Netflix, please answer
my emails.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.020
I just want to know if it is
possible, and the whole

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.230
bridging solution.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.600
We're trying to use the
Silverlight player over the

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.500
Hangout paradigm and
doing some of the

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.710
authentication stuff.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.470
I don't want wax political,
but that's

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.300
where I'm at with that.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.830
But I would really love
to pull that off.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.950
Even if Netflix is working on
that right now, I would just

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:47.410
love to know.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.470
If they are, I will
happily stand by.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.110
Because there are a lot of
people that would certainly

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.660
like to take advantage of that,
of paying members being

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.680
able to watch the same
movie securely,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.340
privately and legally.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.100
But the larger point I wanted
to bring up, and I know I've

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.190
posted about this, and
Jenny and I have

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.290
talked about this privately.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.880
But I think the facility that
you guys at Google have

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.740
provided us with before Hangouts
start is really cool.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.930
You get that standby screen, or
I think the default screen

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:19.130
is the "We'll be starting in a
few minutes" in many different

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.940
languages and everything,
which is really slick.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.220
But I had my idea, and I was
wondering, obviously this is

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.850
beyond us as developers, but
would you be able to provide

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.330
the ability for us to run
pre-Hangout apps?

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.070
Basically using the phrase
out-of-band for lack of a

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.580
better term.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.270
But seeing as how many Hangouts
On Air don't always

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.330
start on time--

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.300
people wait for other
contributors to jump in, or

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.035
the producer, they run
behind schedule.

00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:47.250
But coming from the TV industry,
I've always thought

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.630
it was cool where we put up that
screen, it's like sorry,

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.180
we'll be back in a minute,
technical difficulties.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.760
But we can extend that because
we're on the internet.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.700
And say if I'm running a show
and I'm running a few minutes

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.530
late, I would actually be able
to hook into some sort of data

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.480
source to say here's a bunch
of stock quotes, here's the

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.510
ballgame score, here's what's
coming up on your TV cable

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.290
system, or here's my
Google+ stream and

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:10.900
everything like that.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.370
So we'd be able to run some
sort of data-centric,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.910
interactive application
and everything

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.990
before the Hangout starts.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.900
And then when we actually truly
broadcast and go live,

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.175
then the regular stream
kicks in.

00:29:22.175 --> 00:29:25.180
FRASER: We had a similar problem
with that as well when

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.990
we were doing the Venus
transit coverage.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.200
So we were broadcasting
the entire

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.170
transit of Venus on Google+.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:32.920
It was great.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.380
It was 6 and 1/2 hours of
broadcast, which we ran into

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.280
your four-hour limit, which is
an interesting discovery.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.860
But it was really hard to
promote it in advance because

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.980
the actual location of the
stream didn't exist until we

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.760
began the stream.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.990
So there was no easy way to tell
people, by the way, we're

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:58.370
going to be doing this event at
this location in five days,

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.060
and that was the amount of
lead time we had to do.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.920
So really, we had to tell people
that we're going to be

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.620
doing, something but to then
come and dig around on Google+

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.770
until they find it.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.250
Now, we were able to create a
redirection from a couple of

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.820
websites to create a more
permanent URL, but the reality

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.900
was there was just no way.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.640
And so I think it would be a
very similar way that if you

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.820
could somehow reserve a
location, a permanent

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.280
location, a permalink to your
event that before that event

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.190
begins, before you click
broadcast, then there's a

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.990
notification that it is coming
in the future and even perhaps

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.440
when it's going to
be happening.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.460
And then when you start to
broadcast, the two are

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.800
connected together, and then
your broadcast takes over at

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.830
that location.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.660
And I think that would also
probably solve part of the

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.580
problems that Jason's saying,
where if you could somehow be

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.700
even more clever and put more
information in advance, or run

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.210
video or whatever ahead of time,
you'd be able to see

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.720
what's going to be coming
at that location.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.225
CHARLES: Yeah, so I think those
two issues, I think

00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:00.700
they're both really valid.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.040
If you wanted to run something
before your video started and

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.790
not just a blank screen, you
could screen share a

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.880
PowerPoint presentation or a
website that cycles through

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.970
slides sort of like the movie
theaters do with the question

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.870
and answer.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.000
You know, this actor appeared
in seven shows before he

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.020
appeared on Lost
kind of thing.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.660
The other one, what Fraser was
talking about, about being

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.800
able to reserve a location.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.570
I think it ties into a bigger
issue that I was thinking

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.130
about the other day.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.750
Which is, stuff slides through
my stream so fast.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.290
And I go back looking for it,
and I often can't find it.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.890
So I'll have a conversation
with somebody--

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.170
I noticed it during the run
up to the Kickstarter.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.610
I'd have a conversation with
somebody, and we'd work out

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.000
the details, and then a week and
a half later, I'd go oh,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.840
where's that?

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.620
And I wouldn't be able
to find it again.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.960
And it was there.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.933
Eventually I found it.

00:31:56.933 --> 00:32:02.870
But It would be really nice to
be able to bookmark or to have

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.606
an internal way of bookmarking
threads in Google+.

00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:10.550
So that I can have, not just
circles, but I can have a list

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.280
of threads that I'm trying
to keep an eye on.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.653
Then that would solve Fraser's
problem, I think, that you'd

00:32:14.653 --> 00:32:18.840
be able to put up a note and
say, coming up soon, in five

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.400
days, we're going to do
the Venus transit.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.020
And then people would be
able to bookmark that.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.790
And then when it comes out
again, they'd be able to keep

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.400
an eye on it.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.420
I don't know if that would
totally solve Fraser's

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.732
problem, but that would solve
some other issues.

00:32:31.732 --> 00:32:33.470
FRASER: We just need
to be able to--

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.090
if we're going to have an event
that's going to happen,

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.010
and we're going to
be broadcasting.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.500
The next big chance is the
Curiosity Rover's going to be

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.110
landing on Mars in
August or July.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.770
Anyway, we're going
to be doing live

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.800
coverage of that landing.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.740
But the problem is we have to
do our publicity, get our

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.460
press release out, tell
everybody two weeks in

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.010
advance, a week in advance, so
that everyone can write their

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.770
articles, and they can
have a place to go.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:03.210
And it would be great if that
place was on YouTube or on

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.980
Google+ that just says yep, they
type in the URL, boom,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.730
they go there and
it's happening.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.780
If they show up an hour early,
then they just see a screen

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.920
that says it's not here yet.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.700
And if they show up an hour
later, then it's in progress.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.840
CHAD: And you've configured your
channel to broadcast when

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.420
someone goes to your channel's
homepage if there's a live

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.880
event, that it automatically
streams.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.440
Mike Downes has done a lot of
experimentation for the

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.200
documentation of that.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.680
You could also set up
a landing page for

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.430
people to go to.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.800
And as you're beginning that
Hangout and you're about to

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.060
broadcast it, embed that video
on that landing page, or like

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.800
an event page.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.680
JENNY: That's another
great idea.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.920
So these are all things
we're aware of.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.700
And you've already mentioned
some work-arounds for some of

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.180
these cases, and there's
actually one that you guys

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.710
didn't mention a work-arou
d to, which is basically

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:04.600
bookmarking posts on important
discussions and stuff using

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.570
Google+ itself.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:09.070
And there is a work-around for
this that I use pretty often.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.360
I've create a circle, mine is
called Empty, it has no one in

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.989
it, but you could call
it Favorite Threads.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.150
And what I do is when there's
a thread I know I need to go

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.920
back to, I will reshare that
post to that circle.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.480
And then I go look at that
circle, and I can see all of

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.364
those very important posts.

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.186
CHARLES: Right, OK.

00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:31.040
JENNY: And it's a little bit of
a wonky work-around but it

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.636
actually works pretty well.

00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:33.974
CHARLES: Interesting.

00:34:33.974 --> 00:34:35.998
CHIRAG: When I think about it,
that's really awesome.

00:34:35.998 --> 00:34:37.929
JENNY: Yeah, it was an idea
that someone actually

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.429
mentioned during one
of these Hangouts.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.070
I forgot who, though.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.540
So I'm not taking
credit for that.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.610
I didn't come up that.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.801
That's an answer from
the community.

00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:49.620
JASON: So would it be possible,
if you guys were to

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.650
be able to provide the
infrastructure, where we could

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.880
actually run apps or extensions
prior to a Hangout

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.584
going live?

00:34:55.584 --> 00:34:58.530
JENNY: So pre-roll applications
are kind of an

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.730
interesting case, because
there's no one who will really

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.960
interact with it.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.495
So it's not going to be able to
take advantage of all the

00:35:07.495 --> 00:35:11.160
cool features that make
Hangout apps special.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.270
It's just going to be a regular
HTML5 application.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.600
But that's still pretty cool,
and you can actually do that

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.300
today using a little bit of a
work-around that was actually

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.560
mentioned is just doing
screen sharing.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.460
So you take your application
that uses or pulls in data,

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.460
pulls in stock quotes or
relevant information or trivia

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.780
about the people who are about
to be on the Hangout.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.000
And then you run that web
application in a regular

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.610
browser and screen share it,
and you'll actually get

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:41.190
probably about 90%
of the way there.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.960
But that all being said,
pre-roll applications would be

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.060
something that would overlap a
lot with the kind of Hangout

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.070
view of an application itself.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:57.865
So it is something we're aware
of, and it would be cool, but

00:35:57.865 --> 00:35:59.870
I don't have much else
to say about it.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.010
JASON: No, that's cool.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.170
I mean, I was thinking that
would be kind of like a

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.740
logical thing to do just
for people out there.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.470
And I mean, I know that's a fair
amount of work just for

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.260
something that niche
and that specific.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.600
But maybe subcategorize and
say you can have a Hangout

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.670
app, or you can have a Hangout
extension, or you can have a

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:22.340
Hangout pre-roll service and
everything like that, just so

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.130
you can even further sandbox
it, just so it's fairly

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.770
limited and everything.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.560
And if you're still running the
screenshare, then you hear

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.082
everybody else's audio feed
running underneath it, and if

00:36:31.082 --> 00:36:32.910
you're the host you have to mute
everybody and everything.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.010
But I totally get it.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.440
I mean, functionally that
would totally work.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.910
JENNY: Yep, we're definitely
aware of the larger problem of

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.700
being able to have Hangouts,
specifically Hangouts On Air,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.800
that make it easy for people
to find the Hangouts On Air

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.710
that they're interested in, and
being able to get to them

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.180
when it's relevant.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.030
And the work-around of having a
pre-roll, which we've used,

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.976
and the Android Developer
Relations Team also has put a

00:36:57.976 --> 00:37:00.320
lot of work into their
pre-rolls, is one of the ways

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.010
that we've kind of added a 5-
or 10-minute buffer where

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.350
people have an opportunity to
reshare and queue up for the

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.220
broadcast before it begins.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.580
But the larger problem of
being able to find the

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.890
Hangouts On Air that are
interesting to you is

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.010
something we're definitely
interested in.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.565
JASON: Oh, cool, thank you.

00:37:17.565 --> 00:37:19.410
JENNY: You're welcome,
thank you.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.995
So we're actually getting pretty
close to out of time.

00:37:21.995 --> 00:37:26.720
Do we have any questions from
the rest of the world we want

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.690
to tackle before we
start to wrap up?

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.255
CHIRAG: I think we've covered
most of the questions.

00:37:32.255 --> 00:37:35.120
JENNY: Cool, that's great.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.170
CHARLES: Jenny, I'm
totally stealing

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.225
your idea about resharing.

00:37:37.225 --> 00:37:37.970
It's brilliant.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.080
JENNY: Well, great.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.190
Well, we stole it from the
Android Developer Relations

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.770
Team, so feel free to pass that

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.130
information along to everyone.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.576
It works really well.

00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:49.080
FRASER: Yeah, we've been using
that pre-roll technique, the

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.395
one that you did on this
Hangout, and it's fantastic.

00:37:51.395 --> 00:37:55.720
It, again, sort of minimizes the
freakout in the first five

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.800
minutes when you're trying to
get all your preparation done

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.372
when you need to be public,
so that's fantastic.

00:38:01.372 --> 00:38:04.250
JENNY: You also get a really
great audio track of the

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.000
people in the Hangout during
the pre-roll slide.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.655
That's always a really
fun bonus feature.

00:38:08.655 --> 00:38:11.530
A few of you join and there's
some audio there, whether it

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.445
be music or just people chatting
about the weather.

00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:18.420
CHAD: I have a couple
of really short

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.220
questions, if I may.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.090
JENNY: Of course.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.550
CHAD: Are we making any progress
on having like a host

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:30.350
ID for an On Air in the API,
and trash collection, like

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.255
clearing image resources?

00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:35.440
JENNY: So two questions
in there.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.020
The first one is having a
specific Hangout user that is

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.935
the host of the Hangout, and
having that exposed via the

00:38:40.935 --> 00:38:41.830
Hangout's API.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.100
CHAD: Exactly.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.740
JENNY: That would
be really cool.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.560
The only place there's kind of
a concept of the host right

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.640
now is when a Hangout goes On
Air, because there's the

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.550
person broadcasting it.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.200
In other Hangout situations,
the Hangout itself kind of

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.570
lives beyond the individuals
in it, and they can kind of

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.170
keep moving on.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.500
So for that reason, the concept
of a host ID is

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.940
something that's a bigger
challenge where we're still

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.250
kind of working on figuring
that out.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:10.490
CHAD: I like the creator
ID, in the context

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:11.750
of a regular Hangout.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.640
JENNY: That would definitely
be a good place to start.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.278
We don't have that yet.

00:39:17.278 --> 00:39:18.528
CHAD: I'm aware.

00:39:20.976 --> 00:39:24.250
JENNY: And moderation controls
in general, and especially

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.370
exposing stuff like that to the
API are something that's

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:30.680
on our radar, but nothing
to report right now.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.920
And what was your
second question?

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.740
CHAD: Garbage collection.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.730
If we have too many image
resources, that just stacks up

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.880
in the memory and ultimately
can crash.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.320
So I'm wondering if we have
anything on the way to clear

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.525
those resources?

00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:46.310
JENNY: So clearing the attached
image and audio

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:50.850
resources, it's gotten
a little bit better.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.410
You may have noticed, especially
since it's gotten

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.460
much better than a
few months ago.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.060
And we're working to keep
continually improving that.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.320
But you're right, you
can still load up a

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.590
lot of image resources.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.760
I think in the last bench
test they did it was--

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.180
for me it was a couple
thousand jpegs before

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:07.990
it wiped that out.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.987
But there's a lot of cool cases
where you'll want to

00:40:09.987 --> 00:40:12.840
load tons of image resources
over the life of the Hangout.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.575
For example, if you want a
little video feed in the

00:40:14.575 --> 00:40:17.720
corner or something.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.812
We're working on it.

00:40:18.812 --> 00:40:20.670
CHAD: OK.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.910
JASON: One more quick one,
unless we're running out of

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.950
time, Jenny.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.240
JENNY: Go ahead.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.030
JASON: The facial tracking
feature is absolutely

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.270
phenomenal.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.560
Especially some people in this
room are doing some brilliant

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.220
work with it.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.390
But I ran into a situation last
night where I was writing

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.790
an HTML5 game, and then I had
built it out to say support

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.150
keyboard, support possibly
gamepad, support mouse

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.130
features and everything
like that.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.120
But I was like you know, this
would be really cool, and I

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.570
want to extend it for Hangouts,
if I would be able

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.710
to have it support,
not necessarily my

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.770
face, but my hands.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.870
So would it be possible to
extend the API to, in addition

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.890
to doing facial tracking, at
least the inside of my palms,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.190
if not every one of my fingers
either independently or

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.894
collectively.

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:06.900
JENNY: That's a really
great question.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.050
I have a little experience
with it.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.365
Do you guys have?

00:41:09.365 --> 00:41:14.390
SILVANO: You can find there's a
lot of, well not a lot, but

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:18.415
several open source Javascript
libraries that provide

00:41:18.415 --> 00:41:21.410
tracking for hands
and everything.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.630
I don't know how it will work,
so if you want to experiment

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.610
with it and let us know how it
works, we will be very happy.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.953
Because the problem can be
you have the face, and

00:41:29.953 --> 00:41:30.540
you have the hands.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.610
And all the examples that I've
seen, usually they just show

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.454
the hands, and then they show
the point, but you can see

00:41:36.454 --> 00:41:37.316
only the hands in the video.

00:41:37.316 --> 00:41:40.960
And what I'm wondering is,
you are in a Hangout.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.585
The scene is not that big, and
that's a lot of elements.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:48.360
I'm not really sure how it will
work in the end, but it

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.637
will be cool.

00:41:49.637 --> 00:41:53.360
ALLEN: That actually brings up
a question that we had on the

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.430
mailing list.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.960
The biggest problem with doing
that, though, is that we have

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:02.170
no way to get the video image
that's currently being

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.390
displayed right now.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.680
Is that correct, or is there a
way that I'm not aware of that

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.440
we can get a frame of what's
currently going on on the

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.606
video in order to do that
kind of analysis?

00:42:13.606 --> 00:42:15.550
JENNY: You cannot [INAUDIBLE]
anything, that's correct.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:20.090
You can't get the video stream
or the frames yet.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.153
That's definitely something that
we know would unlock a

00:42:22.153 --> 00:42:24.740
lot of potential for
features like this.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.156
But it is not available yet.

00:42:27.156 --> 00:42:28.900
Hang tight.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.770
Specifically in regard to hand
tracking, I've done a little

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.600
bit of playing with these things
in the past, and I've

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.290
noticed that the hand tracking
algorithms are significantly

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.500
more computationally extensive
than facial

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.750
tracking, for some reason.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.870
GERWIN: But you can just
draw a face on your

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.556
hands, and then it works.

00:42:45.556 --> 00:42:48.070
CHAD: Or it's symbol
recognition, like on some

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.120
augmented reality setups, where
you can print a symbol

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.190
on a card and move the card
around the screen.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.830
It replaces the symbol on the
card by just the pattern

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.145
recognition.

00:42:55.145 --> 00:42:57.020
And that would be easier
than hand.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.120
JASON: Well, also I'm thinking
because if you're monitoring,

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.710
and you're tracking your hands
also, and the system is

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.950
already monitoring the position
of your eyebrows,

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.140
each eye, and your lips and
everything, and then you've

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.320
got your hands moving around,
and your fingers in whatever

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.000
type of configuration.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.190
Those are floating, and those
are actually going on top of

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.550
your face, so those might also
conflict with your facial

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.950
tracking anyway,
I would think.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.690
But, yeah, I would also assume
that that would really slow

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.541
down your machine.

00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:26.725
JENNY: It is a complicated
problem to solve.

00:43:26.725 --> 00:43:27.975
Cool, okey-doke.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.980
Well, unless there are any
other questions, we're

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.880
probably going to wrap
it up for the day.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.255
Anything else from
the streams?

00:43:36.255 --> 00:43:37.966
CHIRAG: I think that's
about it.

00:43:37.966 --> 00:43:40.050
JENNY: Great, okey-doke.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.420
Well, thanks so much for
joining us, everyone.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.110
It's another great session
of the Office Hours.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.990
Thanks for coming, especially
those of you who either fought

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:53.500
jet lag or rolled out of bed
really early in the morning to

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.440
come and join us on here.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.310
We'll be seeing you later,
broadcasting from a different

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:03.480
location, currently undisclosed
but you'll find

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.746
out soon enough.

00:44:04.746 --> 00:44:05.905
OK, bye everyone!

00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:06.680
ALLEN: Bye.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.420
CHARLES: Thanks.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.670
CHAD: Thank you.
