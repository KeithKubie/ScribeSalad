00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.080
You have eight coins in a bag.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.490
Three of them are
unfair in that they

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.180
have a 60% chance of coming
up heads when flipped.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.430
The rest are fair coins.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.270
So if three are unfair,
the rest are fair coins.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.390
When this problem says
that they are fair coins,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.020
it means that they have a
50/50 chance of coming up

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.090
either heads or tails.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.370
You randomly choose
one coin from the bag

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.270
and flip it two times.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.980
What is the percent probability
of getting two heads?

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.860
So this is an
interesting question,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.360
but if we break it
down, essentially

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.790
with a decision tree,
it'll help break it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.330
down a little bit better.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.170
So let's say that we have a
bag, three of them are unfair.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.730
So we could even
visualize a bag.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.727
You don't have to do
this all the time.

00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:49.060
I'll do the fair coins in white.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.020
One, two, three, four,
five fair coins, and we

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.240
have three unfair coins.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.190
One, two, three.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.530
And this whole thing is
my bag, right over here.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680
That is my bag of coins.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.349
When I take my
hand in, if I were

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.250
to take any of
these white coins,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.600
there's a 50% chance that
it gets heads on any flip.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.480
The odds of getting two heads
in a row would be 50% times 50%

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.082
for these white coins.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:18.040
But I don't know I'm
going to get a white coin.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.920
If I get one of
these orange coins,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.280
I have a 60% chance
of coming up heads.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.087
If I have picked one
of these orange coins,

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.670
the probability of
getting heads twice

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450
is going to be 60% times 60%.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.060
So how do I factor
in this idea that I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.380
don't know if I've
picked a white fair coin

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.130
or an orange unfair coin.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.831
We'll assume that
the coins actually

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:42.830
aren't white and orange.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.110
They all look like
regular coins.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.890
So what I'll do is I'll draw a
little bit of a decision tree

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.090
here.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.730
I guess maybe I could call
it a probability tree.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.550
So there's some probability
that I pick a fair coin.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.870
 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.090
And there's some probability
that I pick an unfair coin.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.139
And so what is the probability
that I pick a fair coin?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.110
Well, one, two, three, four,
five out of the total eight

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.040
coins are fair, so there
is a 5/8 probability.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.960
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.190
I'll write it here on
the branch, actually.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.020
So there's a 5/8 chance
that I pick a fair coin,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.410
and then there is a 3-- one,
two, three, out of 8 chance

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.089
that I pick an unfair coin.

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.630
So if I were to just
tell you, what's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.950
the probability of
picking a fair coin?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.760
You'd say oh, 5/8.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.180
What's the probability
of an unfair coin?

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.730
3/8.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.021
And you could convert that
to a decimal or a percentage

00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:40.400
or whatever you'd like.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.930
Now, given that I have
picked a fair coin,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.870
what is the probability
that I will get heads twice?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.740
So let me write it this way.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.500
Now this is just
notation right here.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.090
So the probability of--
I'll call it heads heads--

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.430
so I get two heads
in a row, given

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.485
that I have a fair coin-- it
looks like very fancy notation,

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.460
but it's just like look,
if you knew for a fact

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.173
that coin you had is
absolutely fair-- that it

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:17.310
has a 50% chance of
coming up heads-- what

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.886
is the probability of
getting two heads in a row?

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:21.510
Then we can just say,
well, that's just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:32.890
going to be 50%, so 50% times
50%, which is equal to 25%.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.213
Which is equal to 25%.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:40.810
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.280
What is the probability
that you picked a fair coin

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.460
and you got two heads in a row?

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.560
So given that you
have a fair coin,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.410
it's a 25% chance that you
have two heads in a row.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.810
But the probability of
picking a fair coin and then

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.920
given the fair coin
getting two heads in a row,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.430
will be the 5/8 times the 25%.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.250
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.384
So this whole branch--
I should maybe

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:05.800
draw it this way--
the probability

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.050
of this whole series
of events happening.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.910
So starting with you
picking the fair coin

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.110
and then getting
two heads in a row

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.200
will be-- I'll
write it this way--

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.792
it will be 5/8 times this right
over here, times the 0.25.

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.000
I want to make it very clear.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.750
The 0.25 is the
probability of getting

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.930
two heads in a
row given that you

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.154
knew that you got a fair coin.

00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:34.820
But the probability
of this whole series

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.278
of events happening,
you would have

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:39.090
to multiply this times the
probability that you actually

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.850
got a fair coin.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.580
So another way of
thinking about it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.280
is this is the probability
that you got a fair coin

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.730
and that you have
two heads in a row.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.020
Now let's do the same
thing for the unfair coin.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.400
So the probability-- I'll do
that in the same green color--

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.780
the probability that
I get heads heads

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.160
given that my coin is unfair.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.690
So if you were to somehow
know that your coin is unfair,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.910
what is the probability of
getting two heads in a row?

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.600
Well in this unfair
coin, it has a 60% chance

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.390
of coming up heads.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:32.650
So it will be equal to 0.6
times 0.6, which is 0.36.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.010
If you have an unfair coin--
if you know for a fact

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.980
that you have an unfair
coin, if that is a given--

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.355
you have a 36% chance of
getting two heads in a row.

00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:43.980
Now if you want to
know the probability

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.980
of this whole series of
events-- the probability

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.190
that you picked an
unfair coin and you

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:57.010
get two heads in a row, so
the probability of unfair

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.990
and two heads in a row given
that you had that unfair coin--

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.490
you would multiply this
3/8 times the 0.36.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:17.510
So this will be equal
to 3/8 times 0.36.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.430
And so let's get a calculator
out and calculate these.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:36.540
So if I take 5 divided by 8
times 0.25, I get 0.15625.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.690
So this is equal to 0.15625.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.200
And then if I do the
other part, so if I have 3

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:53.360
divided by 8 times 0.36,
that gives me 0.135.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.159
So this is 0.135.

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:58.700
So if someone were
to ask you, what's

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.590
the probability of
picking the fair coin

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.740
and then getting two heads
in a row with that fair coin,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.832
you would get this number.

00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:08.040
If someone were to say,
what's the probability of you

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.020
picked the unfair
coin and then get

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.110
two heads in a row
with that unfair coin,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.570
you would get this number.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.150
Now, if someone were
to say, either way,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.700
what's the probability of
getting two heads in a row?

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.600
Because that's what
they're asking us here.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.010
What is the probability
of getting two heads?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.380
So we could get it through this
method-- by chance, picking

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.660
the fair coin-- or through this
method-- by chance, picking

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.036
the unfair coin.

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:33.410
So since we can
do it either way,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.080
we can sum up the probabilities.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.270
Either of these events
meet our constraints.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.930
So we can just add
these two things up.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.240
So let's do that.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:56.210
So we can add 0.135 plus
0.15625 gives us 0.29125.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:08.170
So point 0.29125, that's when
we add 0.15625 plus 0.135

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.120
will equal this.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.080
And if we want to write
it as a percentage,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.030
you essentially just
multiply this times 100

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.200
and add the
percentage sign there.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.260
So this is equal to 29.125%.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.030
Or if we were to round to
the nearest hundredths,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.570
then this would be
the exact number,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.410
or we could say it's
approximately 29.13%,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.620
depending on how much
we need to round it.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.450
So we have a little less than
a 1/3 chance of this happening.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.990
And the reason why-- if
everything in the bag

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.740
was a fair coin, there'd be a
25% chance of this happening

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.320
because you just say, OK any
of these, they're all the same.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.720
Flip it twice, 25% chance.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.320
Our chance is a
little bit higher

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.420
because there's some
probability-- there's a 3/8

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.120
chance-- that we pick a coin
that has a higher than even

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.338
chance of coming up heads.

00:09:00.338 --> 00:09:00.838
