00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.329
my body burns 15 hours per pound per day
and so if I'm a hundred and fifty pounds

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:06.339
and so if I'm a hundred and fifty pounds
 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.679

that's 225 powers you know if it's 170

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:10.689
that's 225 powers you know if it's 170
 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:14.219
that's 225 powers you know if it's 170
then of course it's a 85 on top of the

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229
then of course it's a 85 on top of the
 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.149
then of course it's a 85 on top of the
170 and and so it's easy to know with 15

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159
170 and and so it's easy to know with 15
 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.429
