00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.430
In the last video we learned a
little bit about what the

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.030
expected value of random
variable is, and we saw that it

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.660
was really just the population
mean-- the same thing.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.600
But with a random variable,
since the population is

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.880
infinite, you can't take
up all of the terms and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.140
then average them out.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.620
What you have to do is say OK,
each of these terms occur with

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.280
some frequency or with some
probability, and you kind of

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.100
just take a probability
weighted sum.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.180
Which we saw in the last video
was the exact same thing as

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.420
adding everything together and
dividing by the number of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.460
numbers, except that that
method worked with an infinite

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.850
number of an infinite
population what the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.510
random variable is.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
Because you can just keep on
performing the experiment that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.980
generates the random variable.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.400
And then, we actually
calculated the expected value

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.580
for the particular binomial
distributions that we studied,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.040
especially the one with the
flipping of the coin.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.840
In this video we'll find a
general formula for the mean,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.200
or actually, for the expected
value of a binomial

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.830
distribution.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.750
So if we say that the random
variable, x, is equal to the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.795
number of-- we could
call it successes.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:30.430
The number of successes with
probability p after n trials.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.770
So I'm being a little
bit generally here.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.060
I mean I could have said the
number of successful heads,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.940
which have a probability
of 0.5 after 10 flips.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.420
That's the same thing is this,
I'm just being a little

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.990
bit more general here.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.300
And now, we'll actually
figure out what the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.500
expected value of this is.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.850
And we saw if you actually
figured out the probability

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.970
distribution for this random
variable you get that nice

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.070
binomial distribution that
looks a little bit

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.840
like a bell curve.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.360
And we'll study more
about bell curves later.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.580
And before I actually
show it to you I'll

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.980
give you the answer.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.470
Because the answer, to
some degree, is actually

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.850
pretty intuitive.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.730
The expected value of this
random variable is n times

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.810
p, or sometimes people
will write p times n.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.920
Let me make that a little
bit more tangible for you.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.600
So if I said that x is-- let me
do it in a different color.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.510
Let's see, x is equal to the
number of baskets I make.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.430
Where I'm talking about
basketball, not basket weaving.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:43.350
Number of baskets I make after
10 shots where I have the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.270
probability of me making any 1
shot is-- I don't know-- 40%.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.010
We know that the expected
number of baskets I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.550
make after 10 shots.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.120
So we know that the expected
number of baskets I make after

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.770
10 shots, where each of my
shots is 40%-- all I have to do

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.410
is multiply the probability
times the number of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.720
baskets I'm taking.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.390
So I multiply probability times
the number of baskets or the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.740
number of shots I'm taking,
which should be equal to 4.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.940
So I know I said-- and you
really shouldn't necessarily

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.310
strictly view expected value as
the number of shots you should

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.630
expect to make because
sometimes probability

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.770
distributions can
be kind of weird.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.490
But in the binomial
distribution you can kind

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.290
of view it that way.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.200
That this is the number of
shots you would expect to make.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.090
Or you can kind of view it
as the most likely outcome.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.340
That if you have a 40% shot
percentage, and you takes 10

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.320
shots, the most likely outcome
is that you'll make 4 shots.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.080
You still might make 6 shots or
3 shots, but this is going to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.650
be the most likely outcome.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.790
and in my head, the way I think
about, the way it makes

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.260
intuitive sense is that every
time you shoot you have a 40%

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.280
chance of making the shot.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.120
So you could say that you
always make 40% of a shot.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.390
And if you take 10 shots you're
going to make 4 whole shots.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.420
So that's one way to think
about it and why this might

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.190
make a little intuitive sense.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.170
But now, let's prove it to
ourselves that this is really

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.110
true for any a random variable
that's described by a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.170
binomial distribution.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.270
So in a binomial distribution
what is the probability-- so if

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.110
I say, what is the probability
that X is equal to k?

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.770
And I know it just gets a
little complicated sometimes.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.010
But I'm just saying, what's
the probability say in

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.440
this basketball analogy.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.600
Would be you know, what's the
probability that I make--

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.850
k could be 3 shots or
something like that.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.880
So that's what we're
talking about.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.350
And that we learned was, if
we're taking n shots we're

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.720
going to choose k of them.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.740
And we did that several times
in the last couple of videos.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.940
And then we multiply that times
the probability of any one of

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.610
those particular occurrences.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.100
So if I'm making k shots, it'll
be the probability of me making

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.610
any one shot, Which is
p to the kth power.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.950
p times itself k times.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.360
That's the probability
of me making k shots.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.800
And then the rest of the
shots I have to miss.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.360
So the probability of
a miss is 1 minus p.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.180
And then how many shots?

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.450
If I've made k shots, the rest
of the shots I have to miss.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.780
So I'm going to miss
n minus k shots.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.240
So in any binomial distribution
this is a probability

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.160
that you get k successes.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.380
Now we know that the expected
value, the way you calculate an

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.020
expected value of a random
variable is you just take the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.710
probability weighted sum.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.160
I don't want to confuse you
too much and if you main take

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.960
away from this video is just
this, that's good enough.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.990
You should feel good.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.890
Now it'll get a little
technical, but it'll hopefully

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.630
make you a little bit more
comfortable with sigma and

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.680
sum notation as well.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.570
It'll make you a little
bit more comfortable with

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.250
binomial coefficients
and things like that.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.140
But just going back, the
expected value is a a

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.130
probability weighted
sum of each of these.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.700
So what you want to do is you
want to take the probability

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.300
that X is equal to k, times
k, and then add that up for

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.580
each of the possible k's.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.860
So how would I write that?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.600
So the expected value of X, the
expected value of our random

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.560
variable that's being described
as binomial distribution--

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.340
it's equal to the sum.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.750
And we're going to sum all of
the values that k can take on.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.480
So k can start at 0-- in the
basketball version, I make no

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.160
shots-- all the way to n,
which means I make n shots.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.350
And for each of them you want
to multiply k, so the outcome,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.390
so I made k shots, times the
probability that

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.030
I make k shots.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.700
Well, what was the probability
that I make k shots?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.460
That was this right here.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.730
So it'd be k times n choose
k times p to the k times 1

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.730
minus p to the n minus k.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.370
And now we're just going
to do some algebra, some

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.750
sigma algebra I guess
you could call it.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.380
So the first simplification
we can make is we're summing

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.710
from k equals 0 to n.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.240
So the first term here is going
to have a k equals 0 here.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.230
This is going to be 0
in the first term.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.350
So this first term is 0, then
this whole thing is going to be

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.170
0, and the k equals 0 term
won't contribute to the sum

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.910
because this whole
thing will be 0.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.800
Let me that write because I
think it's-- so this sum could

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.450
be written as 0 times n choose
0 times p to the 0 times 1

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.580
minus p to the n minus 0.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.600
Plus 1 times n choose 1 times
p to the 1 times 1 minus

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.710
p to the n minus 1.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.150
And then you keep adding,
all the way until you

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.810
get to k is equal to n.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.430
So it'd be n times n choose
n times p to the n, times

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.250
1 minus p, n minus n.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.650
This is just another way of
writing this sum up here.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.690
And what I just said is the
first term, which is this term,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.920
is going to be equal to 0
because k is equal to 0.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.090
0 times any thing is 0.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.540
So we can ignore that term and
we can rewrite this sum as

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.230
essentially this
sum right here.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.660
And so if we were to do that
we're essentially just

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.820
rewrite this thing up here.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.730
So the expected value
of our random variable

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.890
is equal to the sum.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.540
And we don't have to go
from k equal 0, we could

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.450
start at k equal 1 now.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:20.130
From k equals 1 to n of the
same thing. k times n choose

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:28.230
k times p to the k, times
1 minus p, n minus k.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.490
Let's see what we
can do from here.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.600
All we did so far is we got rid
of that first term because

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.410
that's kind of the trick we'll
use to simplify this eventually

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.150
to the result that
we want to have.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.420
So let's write out the binomial
coefficient and see if we

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.780
can do something there.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.480
Oh, look at this.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.330
My iPod wants to sync.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.120
Let me get rid of that.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.030
All right, so then,
where was I?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.250
OK, so then this is equal to--
I'm just going to write out

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.520
the binomial coefficient.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.960
k equals 1 to n.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.750
k times-- this right here is
n factorial over k factorial

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.610
over n minus k factorial.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.970
Times p to the k times 1
minus p to the n minus k.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.370
And here we can make a little
bit of a simplification

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:21.100
because what's k
divided by k factorial?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.870
Maybe I could rewrite it a
different way. k factorial is k

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.530
times k minus 1 times k minus
2, and so forth, all the

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.010
way until you get to 1.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.180
This is k factorial.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:40.270
So k factorial could be written
as k times k minus 1 factorial.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.300
It's k times, and then the
number 1 smaller then k times

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.330
all the numbers below it.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.000
So let me rewrite.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.640
So this could be rewritten as
k times k minus 1 factorial.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880
And the whole reason why I
did that is so I can cancel

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.100
this k out with that k.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.540
So if I cancel that out I
think this warrants rewriting

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.490
the whole thing again.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.900
So now, I guess you could argue
simplified it to, it equals the

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:15.250
sum from k is equal to 1 to n
of n factorial over k

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.920
minus 1 factorial.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:25.400
Times n minus k factorial times
p to the k times 1 minus

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.560
p to the n minus k.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.350
And let's do another
simplification.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.270
Now, what I want to do and
we kind of know where

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.140
we're heading, right?

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.540
This should simplify
to n times p.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.320
So let's see if we can factor
out an n times p and then let's

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.930
see if we can turn everything
else into a 1, and then

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.230
we would be done.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.640
So we could rewrite n factorial
using the same trick up here.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.210
n factorial can be rewritten as
n times n minus 1 factorial

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.710
by the same logic.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.450
And then p to they k could
be rewritten as p times

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.610
p to the k minus 1.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.680
And then we can factor out this
n and this p and we'll get it's

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.190
equal to np times the sum from
k is equal to 1 to

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.470
n of-- let's see.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.360
We factored that n and p out.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:23.910
n minus 1 factorial over k
minus one factorial times

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.210
n minus k factorial.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.140
Times p to the k minus 1.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.160
That's not in the denominator.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:40.150
This is just a regular-- times
1 minus p to the n minus k.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.900
And we're close.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.500
Remember, we want the result
that the expected value of our

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.930
variable, and that's what
we were doing before.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.550
That this should
be equal to this.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.090
So we'll be done if we can
just show that this whole

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.295
thing here equals 1.

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:57.970
And to do that I'll make a
simplifying substitution.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.380
Let me make the substitution--
I don't know-- let's say that

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.990
a is equal to k minus 1.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.710
And that b is equal
to n minus 1.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.270
And then what would
n minus k equal to?

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.580
Let's see.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.920
If a is equal to k minus 1
then a plus 1 is equal to k.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.890
And then here, b plus 1 is
equal to n, so then n minus

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:28.320
k would be equal to this,
a plus 1 minus this.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.850
Minus b minus 1, these
would cancel out.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.720
Which would equal a minus b.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.340
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:44.020
So this whole sum will then
turn into np times the sum

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.510
from-- OK, when k is equal to
1, that's the same thing--

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.760
when k is equal to 1,
what is a equal to?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.350
a is equal to 0.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:13:02.230
From a equal to 0 to-- now
when k is equal to n,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.890
what will a be equal to?

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.350
If this is equal to n,
if k is n, then a is

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.830
equal to n minus 1.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.110
So we have a equal to a
to a equals n minus 1.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.760
But n minus 1 is the
same thing as b.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.870
So we could rewrite
the sum there.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.120
That's always a
little confusing.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.140
You might want to pause and
think about that a little bit.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.210
But I realize I'm already
over time, so I'll just

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.970
keep moving forward.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.280
And then we had b is
equal to n minus 1.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.280
So that'll be b factorial
over k minus 1 , we made

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.910
the definition that
that's equal to a.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.060
So that's a factorial.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:47.030
And then over here, n
minus k should be a--

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.560
oh, you know what?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.750
I reversed this. n minus
ok should be b minus a.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.280
n minus k-- right.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.490
n is b plus 1, so it's b
plus 1 minus a plus 1.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.550
Minus a, minus 1.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.760
So the 1's cancel out
and you get b minus a.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.730
So the n minus k will become
b minus a factorial.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.580
And then p to the k minus 1--
k minus 1 is p to the a.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.230
And then times 1 minus
p to the n minus k.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.815
We already showed that
n minus k is the same

00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:23.510
things as b minus a.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.080
And then here, and we're
pretty much done now-- this

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.760
right here, what is this?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.500
This is the probability
of-- well, let me rewrite

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.320
it a simpler way.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:42.510
This is equal to np times the
sum from a is equal to 0 to b.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.080
What is this?

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.816
This is b choose a.

00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:48.120
I have b things and I want to
choose a things from them, how

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.580
many different ways can I--
times p to the a times 1

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.220
minus p to the b minus a.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.380
What is this thing here?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.520
This is you're taking every
term of the binomial

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.110
distribution.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.280
So you're saying, what
is the probability

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.840
when a is equal to 0?

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.990
This is the probability for
each of the a's, right?

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.750
And you're summing up over all
of the a's you can achieve.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.360
So if I were to draw a quick
dirty distribution like this,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.700
if a is equal to 0 you have
a certain probability.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.280
Then a certain probability for
a equals 1. and then another

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.490
probability, and
it goes higher.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.820
Then it's like a bell curve,
something like that.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.550
This term right here
is each of these.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.610
Each of these boxes you
could say represents

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.740
one of these terms.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.460
When a equals 0 it's this term.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.240
When a equals 1 it's this term.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.580
When a equals 2 it's this
term, all the way to b terms.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.320
But we're summing them
up, so we're summing all

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.860
of the probabilities.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.670
We're summing over all
of the values that our

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.240
random variable can take.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.600
So if we solved all the
probabilities that a random

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.040
variable can take, or we're
summing over all of the values,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.170
this is going to sum up to 1.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.420
This is like saying that this
is the probability of heads

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.810
plus the probability of tails.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.630
Or you could say in the
flipping of a coin analogy,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.210
this is the probability that I
have one heads plus the

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.210
probability I have 2 heads,
plus the probability I have 3

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.465
heads, plus the probability I
have 4 heads, all the way to

00:16:15.465 --> 00:16:16.660
the probability I have b heads.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.690
So it's pretty much every
circumstance that can occur.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.640
So this is the sum over
the entire probability

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.840
distribution, and so that
is going to be equal to 1.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.680
And so, we're left with
the expected value of our

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.500
random variable, X, is
equal to n times p.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.390
Where n is the number of trials
and p is the probability

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.830
of success on each trial.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.745
And this is true only for
binomial distributions.

00:16:43.745 --> 00:16:45.700
It isn't true for any
random variable, X.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.540
Only true for random variable,
X, whose probability

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.230
distribution is the
binomial distribution.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.770
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.910
I'll see you in the next video.
