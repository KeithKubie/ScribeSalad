00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.960
- Pediatric Epilepsy Center of Excellence.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.040
And quite appropriately, he
is going to seize the day

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.190
with this talk.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.373
So Dr. Sullivan. (laughs)

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.940
(applause)

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.840
- So as much as I love
that preliminary title,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.780
there was a slight tweak.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.453
The content is exactly the same.

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:31.580
So thank you for inviting me back.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.450
I think this is the third,
or maybe fourth time

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.789
that I've spoken, sort of
an every other year basis.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.810
And often in my field, there
is in the pediatric epilepsy

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.800
space, there's often not
a whole lot of change.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.700
And so I always rack my
brain, like what am I gonna

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.600
talk about that is going
to engage the audience?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.020
So I'm happy to say that this
is an extremely exciting time

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.770
for pediatric epilepsy.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.490
I know this is not just
a pediatric conference,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.870
but we all know that
children do become adults.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.250
And so everything that you
will see in my presentation

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.390
applies to adults.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.722
And I think it's an exciting
time because we are finally

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:11.260
getting some attention from industry

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.380
to start looking at a
lot of the unmet needs

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.210
that our patients have

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.380
with ongoing seizures.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.030
It's often been very challenging
as a pediatric provider

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.450
when new drugs come to the
market, to really understand

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.490
what role could they play in
some of our pediatric patients.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.820
And especially these patients
that I'm gonna talk about

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.670
today, that have some of
these, in the big picture,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.800
rare syndromes, but rare in the sense that

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.030
I guarantee everyone in
the room has had one or two

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.260
of these patients sort
of cross their path.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.039
So with that...

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.439
So these are my disclosures.

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.130
Some of these are relevant,
because I am under contracted

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.900
research for some of
the data that I'm gonna

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.773
present to you today.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.250
So my objectives are first,
to recognize some of the key

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.580
clinical features of epilepsy syndromes,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.780
to then describe how those
syndromes can evolve over time.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.030
I often say that this is
one of the most fascinating

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.580
things about my job, is I
get to follow a moving target

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.900
that is a developing child's brain.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.240
So just because we actually
have one seizure type

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.990
that may present in infancy,
as we continue to follow

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.940
that child over time, things
can change and evolve,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.230
and therefore our treatments
need to change and evolve.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.810
And then, the real, the meat of this talk

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.830
is really gonna be to appraise
the data behind the novel

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.060
antiepileptic drug therapies in some

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.510
of these specific syndromes.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.630
And just to sort of jump
ahead, one of the things

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.010
we're gonna be talking
about is Cannabidiol.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.490
And so you would probably
have to be living under a rock

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.320
if you had not seen in the popular media

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.960
of cannabis based therapies,
and we finally do have

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.290
some data to support its use.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.810
So first, what is an epilepsy syndrome?

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.810
So this is kinda the Holy Grail

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.010
for a pediatric epileptologist.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.300
There's no term that makes
me want to have a seizure

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.920
more than the term seizure disorder.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.770
You know, cardiologists, no
one tells a person who has

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.960
an arrhythmia that you have
a cardiac rhythm disorder,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.900
or someone with diabetes that
you have a glucose disorder.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.880
So we want to use the term epilepsy.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.490
Epilepsy still has a lot of stigma,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.270
the term still has a lot of
stigma associated with it.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.030
But in my opinion, the only
way that we're gonna get

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.240
around that stigma is
to start using the word

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.200
in its appropriate context.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.320
But an epilepsy syndrome
even goes beyond that.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.430
It actually gets to these
different bullet points.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.920
So the age of onset, the
different types of seizures

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.270
that that patient may be
having, the EEG patterns,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.180
and then what we call
the interictal condition.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.240
So what are these patients
looking like in between

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.480
their seizures, right?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.210
We focus a lot on, what
does a seizure look like,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.440
how long does it last,
how do they act afterward.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.150
But equally important is
how are these patients

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.130
doing in between?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.850
Are they completely normal with
no intellectual disability?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.920
Are they somewhere on the
intellectual disability

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.520
spectrum and where?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.040
And why, why would some
of these patients who have

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.040
a normal brain MRI and a
normal EEG have moderate

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.650
to severe intellectual disability?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.090
So that is a very important
piece of the puzzle.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.160
And then really, the
explosion that is continuing

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.160
to change our field in 2019 is
the genetic characterization.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.900
So we are now fairly...

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.510
It's fairly easy now to
get an epilepsy gene panel

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.480
on most of my patients.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.720
And it really is, by looking
at all of these different

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.940
salient clinical
features, that we are able

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.273
to discover new epilepsy genes.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.963
So why?

00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:43.090
Is this just something
that I can come up here

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.010
and have a couple slides,
to be able to speak about,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.330
and make myself sound smart?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.401
No, absolutely not.

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:52.050
If someone calls me on the
phone from the Emergency Room

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.437
and says, "Joe, I have
one of your patients here

00:04:54.437 --> 00:04:56.330
"with Dravet Syndrome",
which is one of the syndromes

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.960
we're gonna talk about,
that already paints a clear

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.070
picture in my mind of probably
how that child presented,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.280
what medicines they're on, what
medicines they may have been

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.190
on before, and what I need to
actually be thinking about.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.780
So not only does it lead to
a more accurate diagnosis,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.240
rather than my cringed
seizure disorder term,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.143
but it really does lead
to improved management.

00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:18.750
It leads to targeted workup.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.510
And often times, I think
we can actually limit

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.343
our workup, right?

00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:27.050
We no longer need to
embark on what I would call

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.170
the shotgun approach of
working up these patients

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.560
for rare inherited metabolic disorders,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.550
when I was in training, not so long ago.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.900
And we actually can start
to suspect these specific

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.530
diagnoses on clinical grounds.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.250
It also helps with
counseling and prognosis,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.810
and certainly helps
with genetic counseling

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.220
in terms of risk to
future siblings or risk

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.260
for that specific patient's children.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.970
So we're just gonna go through
really a couple of cases,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.980
just to keep you engaged.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.470
I guess just the pleasure of speaking

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.470
directly after lunch.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.060
And these will, maybe
these different cases

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.920
will start out being familiar,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.760
and get a little bit less
familiar as we go on.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.540
So case one is an eight
month old male infant

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.430
with normal birth history who
presents to the pediatrician's

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.300
office, where mom's saying
he's starting to have

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.930
those startling, like he was a baby.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.620
The episodes occur most
often upon awakening,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.750
and they don't occur in isolation,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.520
and they last 15 minutes.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.010
So the first thing that
we hear from parents,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.360
what do you mean it's lasting 15 minutes?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.750
So you have to actually ask.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.620
Is the entire event lasting 15
minutes, or is it an on off,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.070
is it a cluster of these events?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.540
And so as it turns out,
when you ask that question,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.660
it's a cluster, so these
startle spells are happening.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.650
The individual spells themselves
only last a few seconds,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.240
but they're clustering
over a 15 minute period.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.430
The exam is completely
normal, and unfortunately,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.420
no episodes are witnessed.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.540
So the pediatrician very
rightfully had a concern

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.790
for about what this diagnosis
was, and sent them in

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.500
for video EEG monitoring, and
I'll play this video here.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.610
So you'll see a baby
with pretty normal tone,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.160
nice flexor, the arms and legs here.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.220
And then we see this
little startle slash crunch

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.410
slash spasm, right?

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.140
And you'll see, this kind of
occurs almost like a metronome,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.113
we can kinda count a few seconds here,

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:27.240
and then there's this,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.930
this sort of adduction of the arms,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.863
and flexion at the hips.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.760
Completely in between these episodes is

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.550
actually completely normal.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.020
If you could see his face,
he's actually, eyes are open,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.620
he's very awake and interactive.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.700
Eventually, the parent
comes over to the side

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.290
and pushes the button
to let us know that this

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.410
is the clinical event of interest.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.520
You'll also notice that
it's fairly symmetric,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.520
so this is where we, in the
EEG lab, start to geek out

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.593
a little bit, and say,

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:03.250
"Oh, did that left arm
move before the right arm?"

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.310
We do these types of things.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.490
But these are pretty symmetric.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.430
And the reason why we
geek out about that is,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.640
is if we have asymmetric
spasms, we start to wonder,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.140
is there something, you
know, on the opposite side

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.910
of the brain in terms of
malformation of cortical

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.420
development, or potentially a brain injury

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.970
that could be driving this process.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.260
So this is this child,
actually this child's EEG.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.650
I always say to my
trainees, this is maybe one

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.300
of the only EEG patterns that would be

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.720
on your pediatric boards.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.230
So this is hypsarrhythmia.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.578
And the important thing to note here...

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:36.960
Is there a pointer, is this it?

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.910
Oh yeah, great, wow, that's a big pointer.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.340
So hypsarrhythmia, basically,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.420
the blue is on the left side,
and the red is on the right.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.120
Hopefully you can appreciate
that I could turn this

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.100
upside down and it wouldn't
look any different.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.770
That's not how a baby's EEG
is supposed to look like.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.280
And the other take home point here is that

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.590
hypsarrhythmia is an EEG
pattern in between seizures.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.030
So this is the pattern
that these poor children

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.040
are living with 24 hours a day.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.830
The seizure is this, it's
this one second period.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.950
And so you can imagine, so
why would these one second

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.921
seizures lead to the
intellectual disability that

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.870
the majority of these patients
ultimately go on to have?

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.960
It actually doesn't, it's
not this one second seizure.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.380
It's the other 23 hours
and 55 minutes a day,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.700
that they're EEG is looking
like this firestorm of activity.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.380
So, this specific condition,
while we want to treat

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.060
the patient, about 95% of the
time in pediatric epilepsy,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.500
this is a case where not
only do we want to treat

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.490
the patient, ie the
seizures, we also want to try

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.490
to normalize this EEG as
quickly as we possibly can.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.050
So I gave it away, this
is Infantile Spasms,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.940
also known as West Syndrome.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.250
And I'm just gonna sort of go
through this schematic here.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.291
This is all in the syllabus,
I'm not gonna go through

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:55.710
every single line, but
I wanted you to have

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.430
all this data to refer to.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.760
The hallmark are these extensor spasms.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.130
The EEG pattern is
classical hypsarrhythmia.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.680
One important point is, let's
say that we did that EEG

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.223
and the EEG was normal.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.740
The question then is,
did you capture sleep?

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.810
You actually, early on in the
diagnosis of Infantile Spasms,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.210
if you just do a waking
EEG, the EEG can be normal.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.170
You have to be sure
that you capture sleep.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.840
And so you haven't
captured sleep, that's one

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.090
of the reasons why we often
just admit these babies,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.200
so that we can actually
get a prolonged recording

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.220
and record sleep.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.160
The etiology has really
not changed over the years.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.250
The top two are either
malformations of cortical

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.010
development, or neonatal encephalopathy,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.680
usually due to some prenatal
or perinatal insult.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.210
But the list of genetic
disorders that are potentially

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.150
causal for Infantile
Spasms continues to grow.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.850
What I'm gonna talk
about next is really how

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.290
our treatment has evolved.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.500
The mainstay of treatment
is still steroids,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.993
either ACTH, which is the injectable,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.390
is an injectable medication,
or high does prednisolone,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.417
and then vigabatrin.

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.925
And what I'm gonna show you
is some data that is really

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.410
making us realize that
this is one of the few,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.630
what we call, pediatric
epilepsy emergencies.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.530
It's akin to a child coming
in with a new diagnosis

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.100
of leukemia, and we want
to throw the kitchen sink

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.060
at them, literally, almost
like an induction therapy,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.990
to try and not only
control their seizures,

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.690
but to try and normalize that EEG.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.170
You can see here that the spasms actually,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.870
even left untreated, will often go away,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.713
but then it's kinda like the
damage has already been done.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.170
So this is one sort of alarming
study that just tells us

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.090
that even in 2000, this was
18, in 2019 we can do better.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.970
So they surveyed 100 patients
with infantile spasms,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.450
and then they looked at
the time to the visit

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.560
with the first, what we
call, effective provider,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.780
which would really be a child neurologist.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.870
The median time was 25
days about, so already

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.230
three weeks have passed,
and only a quarter of them

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.730
were evaluated within the first week.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.100
And this really is our goal.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.950
We know that earlier is better.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.440
And the common theme
here was that the moms

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.347
usually would say, "Something's not right,

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:24.710
"something's wrong", right?

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.670
And if there's one thing that
I remember from pediatric

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.600
residency, always trust the mom, right?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.123
If something's wrong,
you better be worried.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.730
And then the respondents
stated that pediatricians

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.740
and neurologists were
basically just unfamiliar

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.480
with infantile spasms, so
hopefully as you go home today,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.010
you will no longer be unfamiliar.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.270
And then, where this
is important, I think,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.460
is this is a paper that just
came out about a year ago,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.450
in Lancet Neurology, really
looking at that sort of

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.900
induction sort of approach.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.280
We're not only using...

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.830
Up til five years ago, we
would start out one treatment,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.270
steroids, that didn't work,
we'd move on to the second

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.070
treatment knowing that there's
a high rate of relapse.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.360
This group actually looked
at, what if we just threw

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.410
both the hormonal
treatment, which we classify

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.440
as the steroidal
treatment, plus vigabatrin.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.110
And it turns out, this
is pretty much almost

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.698
the highest spasm free rate
that has ever been reported

00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:27.000
in the literature, compared
to hormone therapy alone.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.370
And the reason why this is
important, because if you can

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.220
get these patients, more
patients spasm free and get them

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.100
spasm free sooner, we
know that that leads to...

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.200
Well, like all things in
neurology, it's dependent

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.220
on the underlying cause.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.025
If you have someone with
really severe brain injury,

00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:45.410
that's gonna be ultimately what predicts

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.550
how they do developmentally.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.850
But in those kids that
maybe have Infantile Spasms

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.570
of unknown cause, the earlier
that we can get them under

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.570
control, translates into better
outcomes in terms of IQs.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.140
And you can ask questions,
we'll have a sit down here,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.300
about each of these sort of scenarios.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.470
So case number two, moving
up a little bit older

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.320
into the age spectrum.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.500
So a 10 month old female
with normal birth presents

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.920
to your office after
coming to the ER for their,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.610
after their second febrile seizure.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.610
The first seizure was
at six months, two days

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.640
after their vaccines,
and lasted 15 minutes.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.420
So already, a few red flags there.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.570
Six months is a little young,
15 minutes is a little long.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.450
And then the seizure last
night was 10 minutes,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.130
and only appeared to be
on one side of the body,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.970
and she was diagnosed
with acute otitis media.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.930
So someone may look at
this and be like, you know,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.900
10 month old normal baby, two
or three febrile seizures.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.470
Febrile seizures are common.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.540
Reassurance, don't
worry about it, go home.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.773
Hopefully at the end of
this talk, you will realize

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:49.140
that that would be an error.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.670
So development is normal,
starting to cruise,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.380
having mommy and daddy.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.070
No family history, and
neurologic exam is normal.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.290
So this is Dravet Syndrome,
so this is something

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.910
that I have, has become one of my clinical

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.960
and research interests over
the last six or seven years.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.002
I'm gonna go into some
of the clinical trials

00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:10.960
that basically have led to the approval

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.120
of novel medications.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.780
And I would argue that had
these drugs not been studied

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.240
in this specific syndrome,
we may not actually

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.163
have them available to us today.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.043
So the core phenotype for these children

00:15:24.043 --> 00:15:26.030
and what makes it, I think, so challenging

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.360
to make the diagnosis,
you really have to have it

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.400
sort of on your radar
screen, is that it usually

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.820
occurs in normal kids between
five and eight months.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.310
Their initial seizures
often are prolonged,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.227
but don't always have to be.

00:15:39.227 --> 00:15:41.530
And the normal development,
right, that's the one thing

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.620
that often makes us just feel reassured,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.375
that it just can't be one of these

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:48.380
genetic catastrophic epilepsies.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.920
But then it's the evolution, right?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.000
The seizure epilepsy
syndromes tell a story.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.530
The subsequent months, you
start to see more febrile

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.440
seizures and afebrile seizures.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.920
And then there has been an
association with the seizures

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.160
occurring in the setting of vaccine.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.040
The patient still should be vaccinated.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.215
The vaccines do not cause the syndrome.

00:16:07.215 --> 00:16:08.920
And people have actually looked at this,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.900
and there is no different
between those patients

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.950
that are vaccinated,
unvaccinated, or whether or not

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.400
their seizures occurred
proximate or not proximate.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.420
And then again, these patients,
they evolve over time.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.800
And so, there's a bit of a
sort of menu approach here,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.920
that was published about 10 years ago,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.800
that if you basically...

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.980
This was before you even see the patient.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.880
You can get all of this over
the phone from the parent.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.550
So if their fist seizure
occurred less than seven months,

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.430
if they've had five seizures
before their first birthday,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.320
that's five points, and
if any one of the seizures

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.950
was prolonged, that's seven points.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.430
All you need is six points
to strongly strongly suggest

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.940
that one should order targeted
gene testing and suspect

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.310
the clinical diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.852
I would actually argue,
if you are unable to get

00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:58.670
genetic testing, do not
be afraid to still give

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.990
a person this diagnosis.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.260
This is still a clinical
diagnosis, because about 20%

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.660
of patients who present
in the exact same way

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.290
will still not have a
mutation in the SCN1A gene,

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.050
but that does not mean they
do not have Dravet Syndrome.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.528
So I think this is a very
helpful sort of ratings scheme

00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:23.173
to sort of help us determine
when we should suspect it.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.230
So the reason why I feel
I wanted to talk to this,

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.620
like Dravet Syndrome, yes it's rare.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.880
It occurs in about one in 15,000 patients.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.330
That's rare, but not that rare.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Is that this syndrome, in a
study of pharmaceutical grade

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.260
purified Cannabidiol, published
in the New England Journal

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.940
just two years ago, as
the pivotal study that led

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.820
to Cannabidiol's approval
as an entiepileptic drug

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.170
just this past October.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.954
And so in this study, they
actually enrolled patients

00:17:53.954 --> 00:17:56.590
who had Dravet Syndrome, you can see this

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.690
is a severe epilepsy
population at baseline.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.750
They are having about 12
convulsive seizures per month.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.540
And the two groups were
equally represented here.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.200
And then if you look in those
that received Cannabidiol,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.810
it went down by about half,

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.680
compared to no change in placebo.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.710
And then when you take into
account all the statistics

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.460
and what not, the overall
median reduction was about 39%

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.700
compared to 13% placebo, which
is statistically significant.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.240
But I would actually argue, it is also

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.310
clinically significant, right?

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.650
You have someone who is going
from 14 seizures a month

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:28.713
down to six.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.070
And so, I had lived the sort
of era of before there was

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.340
a pharmaceutical grade
of Cannabidiol happening.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.310
I had so many families
coming in, what about CBD,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.930
what about CBD, what about CBD.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.850
And we just really didn't know, you know?

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.820
I think all of us felt that it worked,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.810
but it was really anxiety
provoking for the caregiver,

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.097
as well as the physician to say,

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.727
"Yeah, you can go to the
store, or you can go to Amazon,

00:18:52.727 --> 00:18:53.967
"and drop this in your basket,

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.127
"and it might be CBD, it might not.

00:18:56.127 --> 00:18:58.700
"Just try a little bit
and if it works, great."

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.190
So this is a sort of, a very well known

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.410
adult epileptologist
that wrote an editorial

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.017
to this manuscript, saying,

00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:10.477
"Cannabinoids for epilepsy,
real data at last."

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.899
so this kinda shows a
little bit more specifically

00:19:14.899 --> 00:19:18.080
how these patients,
all these patients did.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.350
So the green line is actually a placebo.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.320
The blue line is the treatment group.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.270
And you can see the number
of patients that had

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.400
a 50% reduction in seizures.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.390
So the drug differentiated
itself from placebo,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.080
at all sort of treatment time points.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.150
And then you can see, some
of these didn't actually

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.740
reach statistical significance.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.390
But again, parents and families don't care

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.970
about statistical significance.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.360
If their kid is the one
that gets the 75% reduction

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.053
in seizures, they don't care
if it's a P value of 0.1.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.223
But this was enough to get it approved.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.380
And so we're excited to
actually, to have that

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.290
as a treatment option.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.110
So next is this drug
that you will very likely

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.210
be hearing about this fall.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.410
It was just submitted to the
FDA as a new drug application,

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.500
again, for the treatment
of Dravet Syndrome.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.680
I wish I had time to go
into the whole story,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.760
but essentially, the reason
why this drug fenfluramine,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.160
which was one of the active
compounds in the Fen-Phen

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.090
diet back in the 90s,
was even being considered

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.980
for Dravet Syndrome was
really by complete accident.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.560
It was just that a group
in Belgium had started

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.930
a few kids back in the
early 90s on fenfluramine

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.200
for behavior issues,
who also had epilepsy,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.900
and their epilepsy improved.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.150
And then they went back
and looked at those kids,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.227
and lo and behold, many of
them had Dravet Syndrome.

00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:40.040
And so this launched a
whole renewed interest,

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.510
of could this actually be a drug that has

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.090
more widespread
antiepileptogenic potential.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.550
And so very similar study design was done,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.610
and the demographics were very similar

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.480
to the New England Journal
paper that I just showed you.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.530
Average monthly seizures
were somewhere between

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.353
25 and 40 convulsive seizures per month,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.500
and this is the data.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.230
So this is the percent
reduction in seizures,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.540
compared to placebo.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.100
So placebo's already included into this.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.037
So 64% reduction in the high dose group,

00:21:16.037 --> 00:21:18.860
and a 33% reduction in the low dose group.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.870
So keep in mind, these
are patients that have

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.070
a very very high seizure
burden, and really

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.720
have already exhausted most, if not all,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.524
of the conventionally
available antiepileptic drugs.

00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:34.710
And in the median number of
drugs that these patients

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.160
were actually on, you had
to be on a stable drug

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.470
regimen to enter the study,
was somewhere between

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.523
two and three drugs.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.730
Furthermore, this is what I...

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.450
Because I was one of the
investigators on the study,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.270
this is the slide that I love to show.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.440
Because, you know, 50%
reduction, yes, that's great.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.990
But there's a lot of drugs
that result in a 50% reduction

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.510
in seizures, especially in
our refractory patients.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.130
But how can we do better than that, right?

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.220
Can we really push the envelope a bit?

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.490
And so for the first time,
now we actually have 45%

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.600
of these patients having a greater than

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.450
75% reduction in seizures.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.350
So now we're getting
into treatment effects,

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.520
which I think are life
changing for these patients

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.330
and their families.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.900
And then lastly, what
about seizure free, right?

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.493
Have we given up on seizure freedom?

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:30.020
Just a few years ago, my opening, sort of,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.090
when I made the diagnosis
of Dravet Syndrome,

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.760
I would tell families,
that you really need

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.810
to reset your expectations,
that seizure freedom

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.900
is just not really an achievable goal.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.360
I still think that
that's probably the case

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.140
for most patients, but in this study,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.980
we looked at how many
patients actually were either

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.040
seizure free or near seizure free.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.740
The unfortunate thing is
in a study, once you have

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.860
a single seizure, you
can never then again be

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.530
seizure free from that intervention.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.520
So we said, what about in this 14 weeks?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.030
If someone was having 25 seizures a month,

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.520
and then they had one
seizure in three months,

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.970
that's almost as good as seizure free.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.307
And in this high dose group,
it was 25% of patients,

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:15.320
and in the low dose,
13%, and none in placebo.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.520
So again, these are
the data that are being

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.520
submitted to the FDA, and it
was just submitted in February.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.883
And we hope that this drug
will get approval this fall.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.010
Okay, case number three,
this is the last case.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.720
So, a little bit older kid,
and you'll see a little bit

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.553
of a theme here.

00:23:33.553 --> 00:23:36.860
So a history of Infantile
Spasms who responded

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.880
favorably to treatment.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.090
Someone gave them the combination therapy

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.000
of steroids and vigabatrin.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.020
But then the mom started noted
that when we was standing,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.740
he would have an abrupt fall.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.440
And she would also notice
that when he was sleeping,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.460
it would appear as if
he was trying to sit up

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.970
or stretch and his whole
body would stiffen.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.010
The history was significant
for developmental delay.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.150
He did not start walking until 20 months.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.560
And the sort of salient features
of his current development,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.800
well he had no expressive
speech, but was able to follow

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.010
some simple commands, such
as pointing to body parts.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.730
So here's a video of one of his seizures.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.250
You can notice the helmet, so
already there's a little bit

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.500
of a red flag that
something's going on here.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.010
Okay, so it's pretty quick.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.120
I'm gonna go back, sorry, go back.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.740
So you can see, luckily,
mom was standing there

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.940
and holds him, okay?

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.790
And so again, as the epilepsy
specialist that likes

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.191
to geek out and play these
videos in slow motion,

00:24:32.191 --> 00:24:33.550
what do you see?

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.910
You see a head drop, right?

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.540
So if he was standing in
the middle of the floor,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.920
he would have fallen.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.160
But also, hopefully what you can see...

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.623
We'll play that again.

00:24:43.623 --> 00:24:44.830
Is arms.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.210
Arms go up, right?

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.840
So this is not a pure
atonic seizure, right?

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.090
Is there a little stiffening component?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.270
Is it actually a myoclonic component?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:58.270
And so, for the purposes of
studies and study design,

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.120
we basically as a pediatric
epilepsy community,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.660
decided to just lump all these together

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.250
and to drop a tax, right?

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.140
Because it's a seizure type
that would result in a fall,

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.840
and these are the
seizures that are the most

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.630
disabling for these patients.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.240
So then, different child, but
again, back to the other type.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.560
So a little, what we see there is...

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.490
Stiffening that kinda
clusters a bit, right?

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.820
And so one other sort of pet peeve of mine

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.080
as an epileptologist,
second to seizure disorder,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.920
is that every single
seizure that someone sees

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.890
is a generalized tonic clonic seizure.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.271
It's almost like it's one
word, generalized tonic clonic.

00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:38.280
(laughter from audience)

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.080
In fact, the minority
of seizures that occur

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.530
are actually generalized tonic clonics.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.710
So you have to think about what that is.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.540
Generalized, so both sides.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.510
Tonic, stiffening, clonic, jerking, right?

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.470
In this seizure, right, we see tonic.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.233
We see the stiffening,
and I can play it again.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.820
We don't necessarily see the clonic.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.063
Now, this could be
confusing, because, you know,

00:26:00.063 --> 00:26:04.120
is that he's stiff, and
then there's a little jerk,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.060
and then he's stiff again.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.600
But once you've seen a
tonic clonic seizure,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.020
you will know that this is not that, okay?

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.770
So this is pretty much a
cluster of tonic seizures

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.023
that occur during sleep.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.933
And so what is this syndrome?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.380
I must have left out my answer there.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.730
This is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, okay?

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.620
So Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,
again, it occurs...

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.610
It's these epilepsy syndromes
that are evolving over time.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.620
So they occur a little bit later,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.300
with a peak around age three to five.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.010
The hallmark are these
tonic axial seizures

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.793
and atonic seizures,
which I just showed you.

00:26:37.793 --> 00:26:40.950
Many other seizure types can occur.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.060
The EEG often has characteristic findings

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.940
of what we call slow spike and
wave, or these fast activity.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.650
The etiology is often
very similar to Infantile

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.640
Spasms and West Syndrome,
and in fact, a very high

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.360
percentage of patients
who have West Syndrome

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.670
will evolve into Lennox-Gastaut.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.790
The treatments are sort of
the broad spectrum medications

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.190
that hopefully you all have heard about.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.090
But now, one that's entering
on to the scene is Cannabidiol,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.480
because I showed you
the study of Cannabidiol

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.290
with Dravet Syndrome.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:19.290
The same company did a
similar study in a group

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.870
of patients with Lennox-Gustaut Syndrome,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.150
and here are those, here's those data.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.560
So again, we're looking
at the drop seizures,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.440
so it doesn't matter if
you stiffen then drop,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.980
or if you just drop, or
if arms go up and drop.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.280
If you drop, you drop.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.413
And there's a very detailed
definition in these protocols

00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:41.560
that you can imagine, like,
well, what if the head

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.740
just nods a little bit,
and so you can imagine

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.480
the challenge in trying
to design these studies.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.260
And it's all based on parental
or caregiver observation

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.400
that is determining the primary endpoint.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.330
But what you can see here
is that these patients

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.410
also had a very high percentage...

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.826
I didn't include it in here, but,

00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:04.940
it's about 80 seizures per
month, these patients are having.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.490
And so you can see that in
the placebo, there still

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.440
is a placebo responder
rate that's quite high.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.360
So what is the placebo responder rate?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.240
I wish I knew.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.930
My theory is that this is
just the background noise

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.200
of what happens in a
unpredictable disorder,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.060
that is epilepsy.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.400
And if you can imagine,
if someone's head drops,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.380
and the parent had their
head turned, they may not

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.760
be able to count every
single seizure reliably.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.114
But we do have to
demonstrate that these drugs

00:28:32.114 --> 00:28:35.680
can be superior to placebo.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.564
But you can see that there
was, again, a 40% reduction

00:28:38.564 --> 00:28:43.220
in the higher dose group of
20 milligrams per kilogram,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.900
although not dramatically different.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.360
So the package insert
is basically saying that

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.950
you should try to get to this dose,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.100
and then if it's tolerated
and you still have more,

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.520
if you still want a chance
at additional efficacy,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.040
you can increase the dose.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.080
Again, looking at all seizures,
acknowledging that some

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.640
of these seizures are even
more challenging to account,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.440
there did seem to be a change.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.850
And herein lies the problem.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.910
So non-drop seizures, so
these are the seizures where

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.933
the kid stares off into space,
maybe drools a little bit.

00:29:19.933 --> 00:29:21.594
Is that a seizure?

00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:23.973
Maybe, maybe not.

00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:27.590
And you can see, the placebo
responder rate here is 35%.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:31.130
And I think this just gets
into why those seizure types

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.420
really can not be counted
in some of the primary

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.170
outcome measures for these studies.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.463
And then again, this
looks at the 50% reduction

00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:44.463
and the 75% reduction, so 25%
of patients in the higher dose

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.100
group of Cannabidiol had a
75% reduction in seizures.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.550
This also was not
statistically significant.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.330
It's in the manuscript,
so I put it up here.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.310
But again, if you look at it,
it's dramatically different

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.080
than what was achieved in placebo.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.030
So I think it's something
that is at least reasonable

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.803
to hope for in this highly
refractory patient population.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.888
So to conclude, hopefully I've shown you,

00:30:09.888 --> 00:30:12.350
at least in these three
epilepsy syndromes,

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.980
that they can evolve over
time, and it's our job

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.220
to educate families,
caregivers, other health care

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.090
providers, of what to expect.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.730
So if I have a patient
with Infantile Spasms

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.330
who responds to therapy, I will tell them

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.490
that, you're not out of the woods yet.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.350
Be on the lookout for some
of these other things.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.730
What I think has really
been exciting is that these

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.670
specific epilepsy syndrome
diagnoses have allowed,

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.770
not only allowed, but
they've engaged more interest

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.120
from the pharma community to get into this

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.830
niche epilepsy space.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.670
And it has allowed them to
design these clinical trials

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.020
with that specific population in mind.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.370
And that, this I guess is
my hanging up my shingle.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.390
If you have a patient who
is not responding to drugs,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:05.360
and they have not seen
an actual epileptologist,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.450
in my opinion, they really need
to be referred for at least

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.810
a one time evaluation, to
see if we can have somewhat

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.980
of a tailored treatment approach.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.343
Thank you.

00:31:14.343 --> 00:31:16.676
(applause)
