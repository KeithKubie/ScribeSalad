00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.330
- In San Francisco,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.725
as we move towards project based learning

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.140
on some of our subjects,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.690
science lending itself most readily to it.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.710
We embedded the Five E
architecture to the curriculum,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.790
which gave it a much more bite-size feel.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.170
We knew that what we
needed was a through line

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890
through the curriculum that the students

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.050
would start to recognize
and start to build upon.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.070
- We really think that the
Five E instruction model

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.130
matches the needs of our students,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.870
that it really elevates
the importance of learning

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.860
for some of our English language learners.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.150
It makes things more digestible

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.630
for students across the board.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.991
All of the learning that's happening,

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.580
is happening in subunits that go

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.362
from the engaged through the evaluate.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.270
- So, the first E is the engage.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.510
Students are given a certain phenomenon

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.840
that they might not know about.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.530
They get to be immersed in that thing.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.363
You're gonna get a set of cards

00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:02.050
that has a whole bunch
of information on it.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.380
And you have to sort through

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.650
whether that's climate or weather.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.170
But you gotta do it as a group.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.380
After that is the explore.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.960
Students get to experiment.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.303
They get to use and
utilize different tools

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:14.580
to try to investigate the thing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.450
that they were checking out in the engage.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.880
Would anyone like to read the explore?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.960
- In the previous lesson,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.983
you thought about your
personal carbon footprint.

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:25.160
Today, you will analyze data
about the carbon footprint

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.993
of the school that students--

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:27.270
- That gives the students a lot of like

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510
hands on activities and experiences

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.030
with a particular phenomenon.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.901
After that is the explain.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.130
With the explain, students really focus on

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.400
a lot of the literacy
pieces of the science.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.689
This one's gonna require
you to do a little bit of,

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.420
of processing of the information

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.253
that you've already gathered.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.200
They get to exchange information.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.460
They get to extract
information from each other.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.890
After that, you have the elaborate,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.070
which they then take what
they learned from the engage,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.100
the explore, and then explain,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800
and they elaborate on that.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.210
And after that, is the evaluate.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.770
That lets us as the teachers
know where they're at.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.860
Whether they're understanding it.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.693
Whether they're not.

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:01.638
What about you guys?

00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:03.203
Do you guys see that as well?

00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:06.680
- When we embedded the five
E's in this curriculum,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.730
what we found is as a
byproduct is that the teachers,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.850
as they provide us feedback,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.070
they are very specific
about did it actually

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.260
engage the students in
the way that we wanted to.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.360
Did the students explore the topic

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.760
in the way that they wanted to?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.430
Did the evaluation of work
actually show that the students

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.920
were accessing grade level work?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.570
- With the Five E instructional model,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.070
we're seeing more students
getting their hands wet.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.100
We're seeing more
students contribute ideas.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.770
We're seeing more students participate

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.439
in many different ways.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.189
(children chattering loudly)
