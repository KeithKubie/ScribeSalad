do we do about the problem of Technology

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
do we do about the problem of Technology

answer there is just to look at history

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
answer there is just to look at history
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220
answer there is just to look at history
which is that this has always happened

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
which is that this has always happened
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590

so obviously it's a problem but it's a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
so obviously it's a problem but it's a
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200
so obviously it's a problem but it's a
problem that is solved itself over time

because people find different things to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
because people find different things to
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519
because people find different things to
do and certainly you go back to before

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
do and certainly you go back to before

actually overall led to much higher

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
actually overall led to much higher
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149

and we don't blend the north at problem

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440
and we don't blend the north at problem
 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.260
and we don't blend the north at problem
it will be solved but it's definitely a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
it will be solved but it's definitely a
 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.720
it will be solved but it's definitely a
challenge
