00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:05.463
In 2018, U.S. Border Patrol arrested overs

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:10.719
58,000 unaccompanied migrant children at the southern border. 

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:16.307
And more than a quarter million children have been apprehended since 2014.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.813
The majority of these kids are between 15 and 17 years old

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:26.151
and are escaping gang violence, poverty and abuse.  

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:39.414
As they flee to the U.S., migrant children are especially vulnerable to

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:44.377
exploitation, human trafficking, kidnapping and sexual abuse.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:24.375
For 16-year-old Omar, that opportunity was in the form of a migrant caravan.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:31.299
He grabbed a few personal belongings and embarked on a 2,000-mile journey to the U.S.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.385
While on the road, he met Rafael

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:36.513
and Fanny.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:43.478
He traveled with the brother and sister for nearly two months, from Honduras to Tijuana. 

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.481
But now that they're at the border,

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.485
they need to decide whether to stick together or part ways.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.642
But Omar isn't so sure about the migrant shelters.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.647
He fears that they'll end up sending him home to Honduras.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.560
While Omar figures out a way to cross into the U.S.,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.105
he has to ask for change on the streets to survive.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:16.029
At the shelter in Tijuana where Rafael plans to drop off his sister,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.617
a group of kids gets ready to meet with lawyers and then head to the border.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.205
The lawyers will try to get the kids safely to the U.S.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.209
We've blurred their faces to protect their identities.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:30.520
Unaccompanied minors represented by an attorney are 5 times more likely to stay in the U.S.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:43.616
At the root of the Central American exodus is decades of civil war in the Northern Triangle:

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.703
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:50.206
And the U.S. was quite involved in the unrest.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:55.712
In the 80s and 90s, the United States backed military regimes

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.507
and had a continuous military presence in Honduras to prevent

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.926
communism from spreading in the region.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:07.765
Roughly 80% of unaccompanied migrant children come from the countries

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:13.271
that are still grappling with the aftermath of war, where violence is rampant.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.567
Back at the shelter, the mood is somber.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:24.157
Even with the help of human rights lawyers, the group was not allowed to reach U.S. soil.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.026
Many kids are not only escaping from violence on the streets.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:03.654
They are also fleeing from violence at home.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:54.163
But even if these kids make it to the U.S., they'll be arrested and held in Border Patrol facilities. 

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.209
They are then transferred to shelters across the U.S.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.963
until they can be placed with family members or foster families. 

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:09.220
It can then take months, or even years, for the government to decide on their asylum applications.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.015
In most cases, the requests are denied.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:20.648
For Fanny, the best shot at getting asylum in the U.S. might be going through the shelter.
