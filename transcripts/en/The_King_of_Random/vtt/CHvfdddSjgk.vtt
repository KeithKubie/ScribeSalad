00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.180
Guys, welcome back. I'm Nate, with the King of Random. Today, we're going to see if we can take some of the clay

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.020
we made in a previous video and fire it to make it permanent.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.420
Making clay from river dirt is awesome, but if you can't get it to stick around, it's not as useful. we want an easy way

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.289
to fire the clay into something that won't dissolve in water. The purpose of today's video is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.549
to see if we can fire this clay that we've made in a regular barbecue. The materials we're going

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.730
to need are a regular charcoal grill, a bunch of charcoal, and some clay.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.830
After we form our clay and let it dry, we're going to get the charcoal started. As the charcoal heats up, we'll move the clay

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.410
closer and closer to the flames until it's directly over the fire.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.049
After that, we'll actually take our clay and put it in the coals and cover it so that it's completely covered by the hot charcoal.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.389
We'll try using a shop vac as a bellows to get the charcoal even hotter to help fire the clay, then once it's all cooled down,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.919
we'll take it out and see if it's been fired. The first thing we need is to prepare our clay. Let's try and make

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640
a small coil pot. This is quite a bit more clay than I need, so I'm going to tear it in half.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.289
My clay is just a little bit too dry, so I'm gonna drip in a few drops of water and knead it in so I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.890
have a better consistency.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.289
The clay should be wet enough that when you squeeze it, it doesn't immediately start cracking everywhere.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.779
One of the most common issues with ceramics is having air bubbles in your clay. As the air heats up, it tries to expand and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.839
it has nowhere to go, so it will actually just break the clay apart to escape.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.489
So, let's make sure our clay has no air bubbles in it. To do that, we do what's called "wedging the clay".

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.539
Now we've removed the air bubbles from our clay, let's roll it out into a long coil.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540
Everybody likes making clay snakes.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.800
If you're having a hard time getting nice long rolls out of your clay, it might be a little bit too dry. You should add more water,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.000
mix it up evenly, and then wedge the air out again. But you don't always have to have pieces of clay this long.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.509
I'm gonna end up breaking it up into smaller pieces to make my coil pot anyway.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.850
You'll want to make sure that your base is fairly thin. It should be about the same thickness that you make your walls. If they're

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.940
different thicknesses, they'll dry at different speeds and that can lead to cracking.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.339
Now that we have our base form, let's start building up the walls. I'm first gonna use a little bit of water around the edge

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
to help the clay stick to itself.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.589
Now we've got the walls built up, let's use just a little bit of water to smooth everything down and join the edges together nicely.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.169
Now that we've got our clay pot formed, we need to let it dry. It's best

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.600
to let it dry slowly to prevent cracking. You should keep your clay in a dry room temperature environment for two or three days,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.759
maybe as much as a week if you've got thicker bits of clay. Now, I actually went ahead and made three different clay pieces.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.869
Firing in the barbecue is a little bit of an experiment, and I wanted to try a few variations.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.290
This pot is exactly like the one we just made - it's just clay with nothing else added to it. This pot has a little bit

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.849
of charcoal ash added to it, and this piece has what's called grog in it. Grog is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.030
Previously fired clay that you've crushed up into powder and you mix it in with the clay. Both the charcoal ash and the grog are

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.669
things that I've read can help prevent cracking during the firing process, so we'll see which of these three plots turns out the best.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.420
You can see that unfortunately,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.780
all three of these pots do have a slight crack running in the bottom. That's because I didn't do a great job of following

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.300
my own advice -

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.899
- to make sure that the bottom is the same thickness as the walls. However, this is a test on firing clay in the barbecue and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900
it shouldn't affect the outcome.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.739
Okay, you can see I've got the charcoal lit, and then I piled all of them in one corner of the barbecue. That's because

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.920
I need some space on the side of the barbecue to set the clay

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.670
for it to heat up slowly. I don't want to throw it right on top of the fire,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.540
because that will heat it so fast that it's guaranteed to crack. Now we've got

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.239
our three clay pots in the grill and heating up, I'm also going

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.740
to be adding this fourth piece, which is something we're gonna try casting metal in if firing it works.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.180
Our clay is getting nice and warm. We do want to rotate it regularly so that it heats up evenly.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.610
If your clay is too hot to touch, use some tongs.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.520
Our charcoal is nice and hot, we're gonna level it out, add some more on top, and try using our vacuum as a bellows to

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.450
keep the new charcoal up quickly.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.249
On our vacuum, our hoses usually attach to this end which sucks in, but we've switched it to attach

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.670
to the out end. This way, the vacuum blows a constant source of air.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.960
If I take this away, it's actually gonna burst into flames even more.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.650
Let's also close our grill a little bit to trap some of the heat, so our clay starts warming up even more.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.170
All right, it's time to do another round of adding more charcoal and using the vacuum as a bellows to heat it back up again.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.609
By now our clay has gotten pretty hot, and I'm going to start putting it on top of the grate,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.980
moving it closer and closer to over the coals.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.069
You can see them taking a lot of steps to heat the clay up very slowly. In automated gas and electric kilns, this is a

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.969
process that can take many hours.

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.999
I've closed the lid of the grill a little bit more, so it's acting like something of an oven. It's gonna start cooking that clay

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.119
and getting it right up to the temperature, so we can soon put it right in the charcoal

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.430
All right, things are going good. Now what we're gonna do is put one last layer of charcoal on. Then, we're gonna actually put the ceramic

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.169
pieces upside down right over the flames, and they're gonna start getting really nice and hot.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.360
Flattening down the coals just a little bit.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.000
Now, I'm going to be flipping these over so that they will heat a little bit more evenly. It's not just the bottoms exposed to the heat.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.860
A little bit more with the vacuum, then I'm gonna close the lid back up.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:11.109
Alright, a new layer of charcoal is nice and hot, and we've put the clay upside down right above the heat, so now it's gonna

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.590
start really getting hot,

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.859
in preparation for going into the coals. We're gonna give it about 15 minutes before we start moving them down into the fire.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.940
At this point, our clay has been sitting directly over the heat for a few minutes and should be pretty good and hot. We're gonna

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.600
take the grill off of the top, put the clay directly down into the charcoal, and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.430
pile up some of the charcoal around it. We'll add a little bit more charcoal on top, hit it with the bellows to heat it

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.430
back up, and then we're just gonna let it sit.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.800
That is burning my hand, just reaching over to put the clay in.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.980
Super warm.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.150
I can hear

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.919
clicking noises from the clay, so I'm hoping it's not just about to shatter into a lot of pieces, but it's possible. We'll see.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.679
Now, I'm gonna pile a bunch more charcoal on top, and once that started to heat up, I'm gonna hit it with the bellows to

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.680
really get it nice and hot.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.200
I've got a whole bunch more charcoal piled on top, and the advantage to this is that our clay will now be exposed to the high heat

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.820
for a much longer time. As the first charcoal that I put on there is burning out and

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.149
disappearing, the newer charcoal is gonna be getting hot and keeping all of the fire going for a longer time. You can see that over

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.190
the process of this, I have used almost this entire

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.869
bag of charcoal. There's still a little bit down in there, but for the most part, it's been the whole bag.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.779
You don't want to get too close, but you can actually

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.740
see that the clay is now glowing orange in there. That is a really good sign.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:47.300
All right, we have used the vacuum bellows, gotten the charcoal and the clay nice and hot. I'm really optimistic about how it's going,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.300
so now I'm gonna take out the block of wood, leave the barbecue closed, and let it just burn out and cool down entirely until tomorrow morning.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.000
Then, we'll take the clay out and see how it's doing.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.550
Okay guys, update. The clay has now been in the barbecue overnight and should have cooled down to the point where it's safe to take

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.729
out with just my bare hands. Let's open it up and see if the clay is fired.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:17.849
Just seeing if there's any heat that I have to be worried about. I'm not feeling anything, so i'm probably good.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.639
Got some problems with this one, that one's starting to fall apart.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.080
Okay guys, our pieces are out of the barbecue and there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the clay did fire.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.239
These are now permanent and they won't dissolve in water.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.169
The bad news is that all of them started cracking a little bit, no matter what variation of clay, ash, or grog I use.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.720
Let's get a close-up look at how each of these turned out.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.809
This was the regular pot that had no added ash or grog to it, and as you can see,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.810
it has separated pretty extremely.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:04.169
You can kind of see the letter "A". This is the pot that had charcoal ash mixed in with the clay. I think this one

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.090
has actually held together the best with only one main crack, but there are a lot of little cracks as well,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.970
so it's probably not very far from falling apart further.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.439
Here is the pot that was made using grog. This one

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.839
separated into several little pieces. This right here is probably the largest

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.390
unbroken piece of clay we have.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.540
So, I don't know, maybe that does mean that grog is the best.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.270
Interestingly, this piece that I made is actually the only one hasn't fallen apart, and it's also the only one that I didn't make using

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.550
a coil pot technique, which I think means that it's my coil pot technique that needs work. It's been a long

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.330
time since I've taken a ceramics class.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.100
There are a few different ways to test if your clay has fired. The easiest is to just try

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.889
scratching it with your thumb nail or a soft tool. If I dragged a screwdriver across the surface of the clay when it was unfired,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.730
it would leave a big mark across it.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.240
But now that it's fired, it doesn't even leave a mark.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.379
I think the most important test about whether your clay is fired, is how it reacts to water.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.980
With unfired clay, water will cause the clay to quickly dissolve.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.440
With fired clay, some water will get absorbed, but it's not gonna do anything to the clay itself.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:16.730
Okay guys, quick recap of what we've done for this experiment. We took clay that we made from the river and we fired it in

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.189
a grill, but we mixed up three different mixtures of it  - one that was plain clay, one that had charcoal ash in it, and one

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.060
that had grog in it - to see what would happen and if there's any difference in how they fired.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.840
Unfortunately, my ceramic

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.280
sculpting techniques are apparently a little bit flawed, because all of the coil pots I made had started to crack before they were fired, and

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:41.119
in the firing process, they broke apart a lot more. But the non-coil pot piece that I made actually stayed together pretty well.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.500
All in all, I would call this experiment about a 75% victory.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.769
We did get the clay to fire in the grill, and that was the main goal. Thank you for joining us for this video,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.960
and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.769
I bet I end up melting this nozzle a little bit today.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.540
Oh, and I'm lighting the barbecue panes on fire.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.749
What's up guys, Grant here. I'm just working behind the scenes on some important stuff. Keep supporting Nate, he's the man, and he's bringing back

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.750
all the DIY that you've been asking for.
