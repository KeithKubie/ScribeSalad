00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is about designing a roller coaster.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, when we're designing a roller coaster, well, if it's going to be any fun, we should probably put

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a loop into it somewhere, and if it's going to be safe, we have to make sure that our cart

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is going fast enough at the top of the loop, so that we don't fall out.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It turns out that for a 10 m radius loop, the minimum velocity we need

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
as we go across the top of the loop is about 10 m/sec.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So given the setup of this roller coaster, I want to know what's the minimum height

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that we need to make the initial drop such that the cart assuming there's no friction on the track

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
will have enough speed to make it through this loop safely. Enter your answer here in meters.
