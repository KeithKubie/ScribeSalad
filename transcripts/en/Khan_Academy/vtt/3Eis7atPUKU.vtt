00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:01.324
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:04.586
So today we're gonna talk
about third and final function

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:05.582
of the colon.

00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:08.597
So this final function of the
colon is that it can be used

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:09.970
as a separator.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.787
So it might sound like we're talking about

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:13.027
the comma again, right?

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:15.253
The comma separates
elements of a sentence.

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.447
But the colon does it in
kind of a different way.

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:19.052
So, let's look at some examples.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.910
So one common use of
the colon as a separator

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.312
is in titles.

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:25.473
So you can have two separate
parts of the title, or like

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:28.680
a title and a subtitle
for a book or a movie

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.889
or a TV show.

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:31.881
And there will be a colon in between them.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.396
We can have something like
Bear Man: Adventures in Alaska.

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.283
Another common use of the
colon as a separator is in

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:40.670
citations from a book or a poem,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.156
and pretty often the Bible.

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:45.404
For example, we can use
it to separate the number

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.208
of a Bible chapter from
the number of the verse.

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:51.203
If we want to reference First
Corinthians, Chapter 13,

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.165
Verse four, we can write it like

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:54.665
One Corinthians 13

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.058
colon four.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.958
Finally, we can use the
colon to separate the hour

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.164
from the minutes in the time of day.

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:05.480
If I want to tell someone what time it is,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.979
I can say it is now ten-oh-nine AM.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.426
And between the ten, which
is the hour of the day,

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:13.371
and oh-nine, which is the
minutes, we put a colon.

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:15.537
So that's how the colon
works as a separator.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:20.068
We can use it in titles,
citations, and times.

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:21.286
You can learn anything.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.119
Paige out.
