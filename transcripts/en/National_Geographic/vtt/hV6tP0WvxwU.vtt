( intro music )

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:10.143 line:0%
The next story that I proposed
was, you know, photographing

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.812 line:0%
one of the most pristine
places in the Indian Ocean.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.348
<i> It's this tiny atoll
 called Bassas da India.</i>

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.384
<i> This is all there is at
 high tide. That is it!</i>

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.487
<i>And it's this incredible place,
 it's in the cyclone belt</i>

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.155
<i> and of course, since you
 can't see it at high tide</i>

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.157
<i>there are shipwrecks everywhere.</i>

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.593
<i> And you know, the outer
 perimeter creates</i>

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.295
<i> this almost
 bathtub-like lagoon.</i>

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.932
<i> And this is a nursery ground
 for Galapagos Sharks.</i>

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.667
<i> Sharks and healthy reefs
 kind of go together</i>

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.237
<i> because the sharks govern
 the ratio of reef fish</i>

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.138
<i> of algae, of sea urchins
 and all those things.</i>

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.241
<i> So, sharks are critical
 for healthy coral reefs.</i>

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.142
<i> And these reefs were in
 incredible condition.</i>

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.210
<i> They're curious.</i>

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.244
( audience laughter )

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.279
<i> They are very, very curious.</i>

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.613
<i> I've always known
 Galapagos Sharks</i>

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.082
<i> as being very, very
 night active.</i>

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.816
<i> So, I also wanted to
 photograph them at night</i>

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.419
<i> and this is inside the lagoon
 on one of the coral reefs.</i>

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:57.022
<i> And, one of the most magical,
 you know, two hours of my life</i>

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.258
<i> just watching these sharks,
 like,</i>

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.425
<i> you know,
 moths to a flame.</i>

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.827
<i> They're just kind of swimming
 in and swimming out.</i>

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.929
<i> These images and this
 experience really just</i>

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.296
<i> you know,
 gave me hope again that</i>

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.167
<i> even though we've impacted
 our oceans in so many places</i>

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.734
<i> every time you get sort
 of, despair overcomes you</i>

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.538
<i> mother nature kinda taps you
 on your shoulder and goes</i>

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.807
<i> "I'm still around, you
 just have to go there."</i>

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:18.043
<i>And this is one of those places,
 etched into my memory forever.</i>

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:20.080
<i>Bassa da India in Europa Atoll.</i>
