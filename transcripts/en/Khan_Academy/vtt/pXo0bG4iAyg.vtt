00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.520
In this video I want to
introduce you to the idea of a

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.245
geometric sequence.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.720
And I have a ton of more
advanced videos on the topic,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.330
but it's really a good place to
start, just to understand

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.380
what we're talking about
when someone tells

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.450
you a geometric sequence.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.200
Now a good starting point is
just, what is a sequence?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.330
And a sequence is, you
can imagine, just a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.420
progression of numbers.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.730
So for example, and this isn't
even a geometric series, if I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.570
just said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.120
This is a sequence of numbers.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680
It's not a geometric sequence,
but it is a sequence.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.085
A geometric sequence is a
special progression, or a

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:52.370
special sequence, of numbers,
where each successive number

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.180
is a fixed multiple of
the number before it.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.080
Let me explain what
I'm saying.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.430
So let's say my first number is
2 and then I multiply 2 by

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.290
the number 3.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.420
So I multiply it
by 3, I get 6.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.590
And then I multiply 6 times the
number 3, and I get 18.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.230
Then I multiply 18 times the
number 3, and I get 54.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.280
And I just keep going
that way.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
So I just keep multiplying
by the number 3.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.860
So I started, if we want to get
some notation here, this

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.970
is my first term.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840
We'll call it a1 for
my sequence.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.170
And each time I'm multiplying
it by a common number, and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.140
that number is often called
the common ratio.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.420
So in this case, a1 is equal to
2, and my common ratio is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.670
equal to 3.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.680
So if someone were to tell
you, hey, you've got a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.310
geometric sequence.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.220
a1 is equal to 90 and your
common ratio is equal to

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.160
negative 1/3.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.570
That means that the first term
of your sequence is 90.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.770
The second term is negative
1/3 times 90.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.759
Which is what?

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.160
That's negative 30, right?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.340
1/3 times 90 is 30, and then you
put the negative number.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.000
Then the next number is going
to be 1/3 times this.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.930
So negative 1/3 times this.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.790
1/3 times 30 is 10.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.790
The negatives cancel out,
so you get positive 10.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.650
Then the next number is going
to be 10 times negative 1/3,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.250
or negative 10/3.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.500
And then the next number is
going to be negative 10/3

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.950
times negative 1/3 so it's going
to be positive 10/3.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.950
And you could just keep going
on with this sequence.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.040
So that's what people talk
about when they mean a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.360
geometric sequence.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880
I want to make one little
distinction here.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.280
This always used to confuse me
because the terms are used

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.940
very often in the
same context.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.980
These are sequences.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.860
These are kind of a progression
of numbers.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.330
2, then 6, then 18, 90, then
negative 30, then 10, then

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.030
negative 10/3.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.150
Then, I'm sorry, this is
positive 10/9, right?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.500
Negative 1/3 times negative
10/3, negatives cancel out.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.760
Right.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.550
10/9.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.830
Don't want to make
a mistake here.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.350
These are sequences.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.725
You might also see the
word a series.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.180
And you might even see
a geometric series.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.360
A series, the most conventional
use of the word

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.410
series, means a sum
of a sequence.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.850
So for example, this is
a geometric sequence.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.070
A geometric series would be 90
plus negative 30, plus 10,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.500
plus negative 10/3, plus 10/9.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.660
So a general way to view
it is that a series is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.910
the sum of a sequence.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.470
I just want to make that clear
because that used to confuse

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.690
me a lot when I first learned
about these things.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.550
But anyway, let's go back to
the notion of a geometric

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.240
sequence, and actually do a word
problem that deals with

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.520
one of these.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.959
So they're telling us that Anne
goes bungee jumping off

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.599
of a bridge above water.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.690
On the initial jump, the cord
stretches by 120 feet.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.750
So on a1, our initial
jump, the cord

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.260
stretches by 120 feet.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.510
We could write it this way.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.865
We could write, jump, and then
how much the cord stretches.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.370
So on the initial jump,
on jump one, the cord

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.870
stretches 120 feet.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.420
Then it says, on the next
bounce, the stretch is 60% of

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.910
the original jump, and then
each additional bounce

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.230
stretches the rope 60% of
the previous stretch.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.280
So here, the common ratio, where
each successive term in

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.400
our sequence is going to be
60% of the previous term.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.680
Or it's going to be 0.6 times
the previous term.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.400
So on the second jump, we're
going to start 60% of that, or

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.220
0.6 times 120.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.180
Which is equal to what?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.960
That's equal to 72.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.210
Then on the third jump, we're
going to stretch 0.6 of 72, or

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.470
0.6 times this.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.900
So it would be 0.6 times
0.6 times 120.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.410
Notice, over here, so on the
fourth jump we're going to

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:03.770
have 0.6 times 0.6 times
0.6 times 120.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.810
60% of this jump, so every
time we're 60% of

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.030
the previous jump.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.060
So if we wanted to make a
general formula for this, just

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.690
based on the way we've defined
it right here.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:25.960
So the stretch on the nth
jump, what would it be?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:39.900
So let's see, we start at 120
times 0.6 to the what?

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.570
To the n minus 1.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.330
How did I get this?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.410
Let me write this a
little bit here.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.620
So this is equal to 0.6,
actually let me write the 120

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:59.500
first. This is equal to 120
times 0.6 to the n minus 1.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.540
How did I get that?

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.610
Well we're defining the first
jump as stretching 120 feet.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.880
So when you put n is equal to 1
here, you get 1 minus 1, 0.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.995
So you have 0.6 to the
0th power, and you've

00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:13.360
just got a 1 here.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.920
And that's exactly what happened
on the first jump.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.360
Then on the second jump, you put
a 2 minus 1, and notice 2

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.050
minus 1 is the first
power, and we have

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.900
exactly one 0.6 here.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.620
So I figured it was n minus 1
because when n is 2, we have

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.560
one 0.6, when n is 3, we have
two 0.6's multiplied by

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.040
themselves.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.120
When n is 4, we have 0.6
to the third power.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.510
So whatever n is, we're taking
0.6 to the n minus 1 power,

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.940
and of course we're multiplying
that times 120.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.340
Now and the question they also
ask us, what will be the rope

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:54.390
stretch on the 12th bounce?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:00.790
And over here I'm going
to use the calculator.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.600
and actually let me correct
this a little bit.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.550
This isn't incorrect, but
they're talking about the

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.150
bounce, and we could call the
jump the zeroth bounce.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.190
Let me change that.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.150
This isn't wrong, but I think
this is where they're going

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.340
with the problem.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.300
So you can view the initial
stretch as the zeroth bounce.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.050
So instead of labeling it jump,
let me label it bounce.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.049
So the initial stretch is the
zeroth bounce, then this would

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.960
be the first bounce, the second

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.950
bounce, the third bounce.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.960
And then our formula becomes
a lot simpler.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:48.150
Because if you said the stretch
on nth bounce, then

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:57.180
the formula just becomes 0.6
to the n times 120, right?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.740
On the zeroth bounce, that was
our original stretch, you get

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.660
0.6 to the 0, that's
1 times 120.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.210
On the first bounce, 0.6 to
the 1, one 0.6 right here.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.860
0.6 times the previous
stretch, or

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.350
the previous bounce.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.390
So this has it in terms of
bounces, which I think is what

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.690
the questioner wants us to do.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.940
So what about the 12th bounce?

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.500
Using this convention
right there.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.240
So if we do the 12th bounce,
let's just get

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.930
our calculator out.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:41.790
We're going to have 120 times
0.6 to the 12th power.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.250
And hopefully we'll get order
of operations right, because

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.390
exponents take precedence over
multiplication, so it'll just

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.290
take the 0.6 to the
12th power only.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:57.930
And so this is equal
to 0.26 feet.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.990
So after your 12th bounce,
she's going

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.980
to be barely moving.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.450
She's going to be moving about
3 inches on that 12th bounce.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.760
Well, hopefully you found
this helpful.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.360
And I apologize for the slight
divergence here, but I

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.420
actually think on some level
that's instructive.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.750
Because you always have to make
sure that your n matches

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.740
well with what your
results are.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.080
So when I talked about
your first jump, I

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.730
said, OK this is 1.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.686
And then I had 0.6 to
the zeroth power, so

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:24.850
I did n minus 1.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.370
But then when I relabeled things
in terms of bounces,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.070
this was the zeroth bounce.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.960
This makes sense that this is
0.6 to the zeroth power.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.000
This is the first bounce,
so this would be 0.6

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.500
to the first power.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.250
Second bounce, 0.6 to
the second power.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.190
It made our equation a
little bit simpler.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.730
Anyway, hopefully you found
that Interesting.
