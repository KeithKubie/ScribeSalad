00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(music)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.070
Student:
So what I found interesting was his

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.850
Student:
interaction with Lexie.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.110
(music)

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.700 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
Yeah, I like Janet's idea that that could be a way

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
Chang-rae Lee:
to get right into the moment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.170 position:56%
Chang-rae Lee:
Because that's what story really is:

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.470
Chang-rae Lee:
character in the moment.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.230
(music)

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.800
Chang-rae Lee:
The journey was nearly over.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.200 position:89%
Chang-rae Lee:
The night was unusually chilly, the wind sharpened by the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600 position:77%
Chang-rae Lee:
speed of the train as it rolled southward through

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.300
Chang-rae Lee:
the darkened valley.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000 position:84%
Chang-rae Lee:
The cotton blanket June had stolen was large enough to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.400 position:83%
Chang-rae Lee:
spread as a tarp and at the same time wrap around her

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.600 position:97%
Chang-rae Lee:
younger brother and sister and herself, but it was threadbare,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.700 position:91%
Chang-rae Lee:
and for brief stretches the train would accelerate and the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.400 position:58%
Chang-rae Lee:
wind would cut right through to them.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.300 position:95%
Chang-rae Lee:
It had not been a problem the night before, but now they were

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.009 position:95%
Chang-rae Lee:
riding on top of the boxcar, as there was no more room within

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.770 position:69%
Chang-rae Lee:
any of them, even as the train was more than

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.019
Chang-rae Lee:
a dozen cars long.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.100
(music)

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.650 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
The opening chapter has a basis in a family story.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.799 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
My father lost two siblings during the Korean War.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.260 position:75%
Chang-rae Lee:
His sister died of pneumonia and his brother was

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.180 position:66%
Chang-rae Lee:
run over by a train. There wasn't any room

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.209 position:72%
Chang-rae Lee:
inside the train. That's why they were on top.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.100 position:91%
Chang-rae Lee:
In the middle of night the train lurched, his brother fell

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.129 position:80%
Chang-rae Lee:
off, and his leg got caught under the wheels of the

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:31.658
Chang-rae Lee:
train as it moved forward.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.600 position:86%
Chang-rae Lee:
He tried to carry his brother and catch up to the train

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.300
Chang-rae Lee:
as it was rolling away.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600 position:94%
Chang-rae Lee:
I didn't have any intention of writing that story as part of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.500 position:91%
Chang-rae Lee:
this book, but once I did, and once I wrote it, I realized

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.628 position:67%
Chang-rae Lee:
this is a wonderful and perfect overture to

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:48.550
Chang-rae Lee:
the rest of the novel.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.019
(music)

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.269 position:84%
Chang-rae Lee:
All literature is a record and celebration of trouble.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.229 position:75%
Chang-rae Lee:
Stories naturally want to explore what didn't go

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.390 position:77%
Chang-rae Lee:
right: poor choices, wrong ideas, wrong emotions.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.140
Chang-rae Lee:
We're fascinated by those things.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.319 position:89%
Chang-rae Lee:
What I try to tell my students is that they often want to

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.000 position:98%
Chang-rae Lee:
celebrate life and in that mode of celebration, I think, forget

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.907 position:88%
Chang-rae Lee:
that it's very hard to celebrate life, as in a party, in

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:17.579 position:91%
Chang-rae Lee:
literature. And the true celebration of life is when -- in

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.210 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
fiction, which is not like life at all -- is about

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.340 position:84%
Chang-rae Lee:
identifying those moments at which everything has gone

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.568 position:89%
Chang-rae Lee:
wrong, where the characters are challenged to their core.

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:33.817 position:88%
Chang-rae Lee:
So that's what I'm constantly asking my students: to put

00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:37.329 position:86%
Chang-rae Lee:
their characters in situations in which the exact wrong

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.228 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
thing will happen to them. And what I try to do in

00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:42.668 position:78%
Chang-rae Lee:
class, I try to unpack all those writerly choices.

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:47.300
(music)

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.700 position:80%
Chang-rae Lee:
What I thought was one of the real interests of the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.699 position:89%
Chang-rae Lee:
story was to try to, of course, capture the sense of this

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.508 position:59%
Chang-rae Lee:
micro-culture of the orchestra, right?

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.229 position:95%
Chang-rae Lee:
And so that's why I thought Jim was actually a good choice as

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.610 position:83%
Chang-rae Lee:
someone to tell this story, because he's an outsider.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.627 position:69%
Chang-rae Lee:
He's looking at this in the position that we

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:06.889
Chang-rae Lee:
might look at it.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.187 position:94%
Chang-rae Lee:
I don't think an "I" narrator should just be a video camera.

00:03:12.187 --> 00:03:16.210 position:77%
Chang-rae Lee:
You know it's just -- if that's the case, then it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.020 position:83%
Chang-rae Lee:
should be third-person. And then third-person in this

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.550 position:69%
Chang-rae Lee:
story would be advantageous in another ways.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.889
(music)

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.348 position:92%
Chang-rae Lee:
Yeah, I'm often asked how one teaches writing, and I always

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:26.860
Chang-rae Lee:
say that I don't teach writing.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.079 position:69%
Chang-rae Lee:
I don't think you can. I really believe that

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.935 position:66%
Chang-rae Lee:
writers are essentially wonderful readers.

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:34.992 position:95%
Chang-rae Lee:
They understand how literature happens -- not because they've

00:03:34.992 --> 00:03:37.110 position:67%
Chang-rae Lee:
written it -- it's because they've read it.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:57.636
