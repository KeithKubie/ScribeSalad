00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Did I trick you? Because this is not as tricky as it may look initially. Okay, so this 10¹³ cell.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's figure out what the net charge on this cell is.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What each cell has 10¹⁵ protons? Okay, that will contribute some charge 10¹⁵ times

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the charge per proton as 10¹⁵ neutrons, they don't contribute at all in 10¹⁵ electrons

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which will contribute the exact same charge that the protons contributed but negative.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The positive charges in the protons will cancel the negative charges in the electrons

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The net charge on the human body will be zero.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This explains why you don't feel the electric force everyday.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're much more familiar with gravity because your body doesn't have a net charge.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You could stay in pretty close to a charged object and you wouldn't feel much of anything.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This may have just raised more questions than it answered because well, let's see,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
if everything is neutral, why do we even care about charge?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How can we make something non-neutral? How can we give it a charge?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If lightning has electricity, well it seems like there's a whole lot of it moving around.

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Where does that come from? Let's answer those questions.
