AMANDA SURYA: Hi everyone.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.880
Welcome to our episode five of
the Women Techmakers series,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.030
and this is Part One.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.910
We are talking to an amazing
woman techmaker, Bettina Hein.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.230
And before we start, let
me just introduce

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.040
myself and my co-host.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.330
My name is a Amanda Surya, and
I've been here at Google for

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.530
about six years.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
I started off as an engineer
here at Google, and then I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.010
became a manager in the
developer relations team.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.720
And I currently manage developer
relations work for

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.440
YouTube and our Google
Commerce products.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.510
And let me hand it off to
Gretchen to introduce herself.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.170
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Hi everyone.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm Gretchen Howard.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.860
I run Google+ for brands, so
the business side of our

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.390
social business at Google.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.020
I've been here about seven
years, and worked always on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.310
the business side of the house
or in online advertising, in

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.130
particular.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.820
So welcome again Bettina.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.640
We would love--

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.595
as we said, you're the founder
and CEO of Pixability.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:17.380
We would love just for you
to introduce yourself.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.900
BETTINA HEIN: So, yeah.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.590
My name is Bettina Hein.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.980
I am the founder and CEO of
Pixability, and I'm a repeat

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.530
technology entrepreneur.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.270
I started my first company right
out of graduate school,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.770
as a spin-off of the Swiss
Federal Institute of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.970
Technology.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.770
And after that I founded
Pixability, which I founded

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.600
out of MIT.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.030
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Great.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.310
So just starting off, I would
love it if you could just give

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.280
us some background on how you
chose the name and just what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
is the business model of your
company for those that don't

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.070
know about Pixability?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.310
BETTINA HEIN: So the name?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.740
Well, it had to do--

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.500
I was trying to find a name
that was, when I started

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.770
Pixability, that had to do with

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.610
video, but not too closely.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.280
Because, as experienced
entrepreneurs know, your

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.770
company often doesn't turn out
doing the thing that you

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.380
envision at the beginning
that you'll be doing.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.260
So we programmed the [INAUDIBLE]
program that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.250
concatenated all these different
types of names,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.240
words together to find a name.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.570
And that was great, but none
of those were available.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.680
So I found Pixability for sale
and thought, oh, this is cool.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340
Pixel, video, that's
kind of related.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.460
So that's how I chose
the name.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.350
But what Pixability does is we
solve YouTube for marketers.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.690
So we basically make companies
successful on YouTube.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.280
We help them get more views
and get more customers by

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.375
increasing their convergence
on YouTube.

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:53.670
AMANDA SURYA: Awesome.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
I love the name Pixability,
and the story how you came

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.820
about with the name.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.610
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah, it's like
launching [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.760
just like we do it do at Google
here all the time.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400
So it's great.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.730
AMANDA SURYA: So, Bettina, since
I work on YouTube and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.140
I'm sort of familiar
with Pixability.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.150
So Pixability offers this very
interesting feature called

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.940
online video grader, right?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.210
Can you tell us more about that
and what sort of data

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.660
signals are you measuring,
in order to come

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.790
out with that grade?

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.060
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.110
So we have a free tool that's
called onlinevideograder.com,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.220
and it's a way for companies
to measure how well they're

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.560
doing with video marketing.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.630
At Pixability, we're also the
authors of "Video Marketing

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.230
for Dummies." That just came out
earlier this year, and so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.150
we've put a lot of thought
into what makes an online

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.540
video successful.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.610
And with the online video
grader, it's a free way to

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.720
check out how you're doing.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.790
So you get a score between
zero and 100.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.550
And it tells you how well you're
doing, in terms of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.880
having video on your website, in
terms of how well you come

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.360
up in search, in terms
of how well you're

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.980
doing with social media.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.230
And it's an automated tool that
anybody can use for free,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.585
and helps them also improve
their score.

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:21.029
It gives you tips on what you're
doing wrong, what you

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.089
should be doing.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.210
And it exposes a part
of our software.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.140
It's a little tidbit
that is free,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.370
that's useful for people.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.460
To also entice them to maybe
sign up for the paid version

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.830
of our software.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.420
GRETCHEN HOWARD: That's great.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.630
So it's a teaser to get them
started and get them

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.120
interested.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.060
I love it.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060
I'd love to hear more.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.410
Sort of building on that, as
you you're helping these

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.000
businesses meet their business
objectives through the use of

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.880
online video.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.240
How do you work with different
companies to understand what

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.980
the consumer trends are and
how to interpret that into

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.610
online video?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.990
BETTINA HEIN: Well, what we do
is we have a software that

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.040
sits on top of your YouTube
channel, basically as channel

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.710
management software.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.070
And what we help you do is we
help you analyze, first of

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.430
all, to start off, what are
people actually watching in

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.800
your topic space?

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.330
So we use these topic clustering
algorithms that tap

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.570
into YouTube's API, but also
look at Facebook, and Twitter,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.560
Google itself, LinkedIn.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.240
And we figure out, what
are people looking at?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.780
So let's say that you are
L'Oreal, one of our customers.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.670
And you want to figure out,
what are people watching

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.930
around dying their hair?

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.010
So we look at that.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.580
We really look at, what
are the most popular

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.730
videos in the space?

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.110
How many of them are there?

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.090
What links they have, how
socially popular they are, and

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.250
how people are talking
about them.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.640
All of that in the first step.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.860
And then we help them with
a workflow tool, with the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.590
creation of the video.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.990
So making sure that they can
approve edits of their

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.960
production people,
whether they're

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.540
in-house or external agencies.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.130
Then what we do is we help them
publish out those videos.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.530
So they publish them to YouTube,
but then also share

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.960
them out on Facebook, and
Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest--

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.966
GRETCHEN

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:27.640
HOWARD: Google+ [LAUGHING]

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.055
BETTINA HEIN: Sorry.

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.270
But yes.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.520
That's for the geeky types.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.940
Absolutely.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.200
So that's what we do, and
we help them also

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.290
optimize the video.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.770
So help them optimize all the
metadata around the video, the

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.200
titles, the tags, the
descriptions.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.250
And that's informed by this
data that we've collected

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.320
around millions of videos
on their video topic.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.010
And then we help them track--

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.950
we help them in short length
so that they can track

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.620
conversions off of that.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.250
We also help companies create
hyper-targeted add placements.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.250
So we encourage them to
use AdWords for video.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.870
We're big fans of that, of
the new TrueView formats.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:22.000
And we show them exactly on what
videos, and what channels

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.510
they should be putting
those TrueView ads.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.640
AMANDA SURYA: Awesome.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.890
So, Bettina, what advice would
you give a company who wants

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.600
to leverage YouTube as a
marketing platform, based on

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.810
your experience?

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.840
What advice--

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.770
how do they get started if
they're new to YouTube and

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.380
they're new to Pixability?

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.530
And what advice would
you give them?

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.270
How do they get started?

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.210
Why is it important to
market in YouTube?

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.550
What opportunities are there?

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.100
BETTINA HEIN: Well, I think
they should read "Video

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.820
Marketing for Dummies,"
first of all.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.980
[LAUGHS]

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.870
It's a long book that we wrote
about all of that, but it

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.230
really depends on a little bit
where they're coming from.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.650
So we work with two types
of companies.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.980
We work with big brands, but
we also work with smaller

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.160
companies that very much have
grown up in online marketing.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.200
So for the big brand marketers,
what I tell them is

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.930
that TV is dead.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.080
They really have to--
their audiences--

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.650
if they are marketing to
a youth demographic.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:37.010
Or even not so young people
anymore, they have to do

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.919
online video.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.299
And YouTube is where things
are happening.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.870
It's three times larger
than any other public

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.310
video network out there.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:52.710
So we do a lot of work doing
evangelism for YouTube.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.650
We know that young audiences
don't really bother with live

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.270
TV anymore.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.780
A lot of them don't.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.030
Often times, it's
very nonlinear.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.550
It's all YouTube,
Netflix, Hulu.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.610
And so we get the brand
marketers to understand that.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.240
That their 30-second commercials
is really not what

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.390
is useful anymore.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.510
If you're talking to online
marketers, the conversation is

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.980
a slightly different one.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.810
It's more around,
you're already

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.500
doing Facebook marketing.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.810
You already have a blog.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.000
You're doing all of this
online content.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.030
You should also be
doing video.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.870
So those two sort of are
converging, those two lines.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.720
And what we tell people is
that YouTube is really as

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.470
large as Facebook, in terms
of unique viewers a month.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.270
I think you have about 150
million unique viewers.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.030
Facebook has 158.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.090
So not a big difference there.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.890
And we see that there is a lot
of arbitrage to be had, to

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.170
speak in financial terms
a little bit.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.020
TrueView and AdWords for video
right now is a great

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.400
opportunity to get an audience
that you'd otherwise not be

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.610
reaching at super prices, better
than you can get with

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.010
regular AdWords.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.850
So we tell people to think about
the content that they

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.910
should be creating, but also
thinking of augmenting that

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.780
content creation with
some paid spend.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.140
GRETCHEN HOWARD: So it sounds
like everything from helping

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.530
businesses drive brand awareness
to acquiring new

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.500
customers, to really deep
engagement you focus on.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.270
It's really interesting.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:39.620
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:39.870
Yeah.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.650
We basically run the gamut
with our software.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.030
There are companies that are
focused on the Facebook

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.210
platform, like Buddy Media.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.010
We're very much focused on
the YouTube platform.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.620
And just help companies and
marketers understand that from

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.960
A to Z.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.620
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Great,
really important.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.690
I would love--

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.610
in your intro you talked about
that you're a repeat

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.490
entrepreneur.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.220
I would love if you could
talk about the

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.610
first company you created.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.700
I think it was a
speech company?

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.820
That would be great just to
understand that background and

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.430
sort of what has led you
to build companies.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.940
BETTINA HEIN: Well I've
never had a real job.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.290
So I like to say that.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.340
I like to brag with that.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.020
I started my first company right
out of graduate school,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.900
and it was a spin-off of the
Swiss Federal Institute of

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.270
Technology in Zurich,
Switzerland.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.600
And we were a text-to-speech
software company.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.860
And I'm proud to say that today,
over half a billion

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.420
people interact with
our technology.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.120
We are the text-to-speech
in Google Android.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.840
We're in Google Translate.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.880
We're in most premium cars in
the world, in the GPS system.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.420
So the voices that speak to you
there, that is my first

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.340
company's technology.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:15.560
So I started that company with a
bunch of engineers from ETH,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.960
the Swiss Federal Institute.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.000
And we raised $8 million
in capital for that.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.930
And we sold it for
$125 million and

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.070
made 11x for the investors.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.050
So made people lots of money.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.460
And so afterwards,
I thought, OK.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.690
I'm going to do this again.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.190
I'm going to try this
one more time.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:44.500
And in the second company,
Pixability is somewhat related

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.940
to what we did at SVOX.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.860
It's also software, obviously,
but SVOX was very much heavy

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.350
text analysis.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.700
And so we use text analysis also
in the algorithms that

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.370
create the recommendations
for Pixability.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.610
So there are some commonalities
between those

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.710
two businesses.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.880
And, yeah.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.140
I just love being
an entrepreneur.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.800
I come from an entrepreneurial
family.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.830
All of my four grandparents,
my grandmothers, my

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.410
grandfathers were entrepreneurs

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.350
in their own right.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.310
And I never had anybody in the
family that had a nine-to-five

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:27.100
job, so I really don't
know what it's like

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.860
to do anything different.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.980
GRETCHEN HOWARD: At least your
children will know what

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.930
they're going to be when they
grow up then, long history.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.040
[LAUGHING]

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.320
BETTINA HEIN: Or my little
daughter, Louisa, she may

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.332
rebel against it all and
become a civil servant.

00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:45.582
AMANDA SURYA: Or a Googler.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.400
BETTINA HEIN: Well that's an

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.080
entrepreneurial company, as well.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.115
I mean, you're much bigger
now, but yeah.

00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:54.650
I mean it's--

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.600
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I love that
we use your technology, and

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.780
Android, and Translate
and everything.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.240
I mean, I probably have used
your technology three times

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.830
today already.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.350
So it's great to see
that intersection.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.970
BETTINA HEIN: It makes me
so proud, you know?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.760
And I'm very grateful,
obviously, to Google for

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.930
making that possible, for
integrating that and being

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.610
part of my entrepreneurial
life story.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.710
AMANDA SURYA: And,
in both of them--

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.520
SVOX your first company, that
came out of a research

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.700
project, I guess, right?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.200
It was spun-off, so it was a
research project that you were

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.240
doing, right?

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.510
And then Pixability, was
that the same case?

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.280
Because you were coming
out from school too.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.270
BETTINA HEIN: --at MIT.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.940
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.090
I was writing my thesis on
business of software at MIT

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.790
and was looking for
my next thing.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.310
I'd already done the first
company and was taking a step

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.460
back, trying to figure out what
had just happened to me.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.230
Being a tech company founder
is a very intense thing.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.960
And you really have
your head down.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.670
And you're working really hard,
and you don't think

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.840
about anything else.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.950
It's like, day and night.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.480
That's all you do.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.280
So then I had this chance to
go to MIT for a year and

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.450
really reflect on what had
just happened to me.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.280
What is this train that just
hit me of technology?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.060
So I actually was able to
reflect a little bit on how

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.750
technologies get adopted, and
why it takes such a long time,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.350
and how technological
construction works.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:38.580
And I wrote a thesis about how
hardware and software are

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.980
integrated these days, and how
that makes a large difference

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.430
in value creation.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.400
So I had some time to reflect.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.410
And then I knew that I was going
to jump right back into

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.445
a new venture.

00:15:52.445 --> 00:15:53.080
AMANDA SURYA: That's awesome.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.930
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Yeah.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.050
It's interesting, too, that
you started one company in

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.460
Switzerland and one in the US.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.020
Our developer network
is international.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.270
What was some of the differences
of having the two

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.760
start-ups in very different
environments?

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:19.520
BETTINA HEIN: Well, in Europe,
I was born in Germany, and I

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.300
moved to Switzerland
when I was 19.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.650
Even though my grandparents were
entrepreneurs, there's

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.930
really not this entrepreneurial
ecosystem that

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.690
you have in the US here.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:35.370
So it was a dream to
come to the US.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.250
It's really the classic
American dream.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.510
I want to do a technology
company in the United States

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.950
and see if I can make it.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.500
It's sort of like New
York, New York.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.470
If you can make it here, you
can make it anywhere.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:54.510
So that's what I was thinking
when I thought, OK.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.800
Well I've done this company.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.020
Now I want to try it
somewhere else.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.950
And I decided to do that in
Boston because of the

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.680
geographic proximity
to Europe.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.200
To be able to go back and see
my family, even though I did

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.940
consider going out
to California.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.040
But I really found here a great
home in Kendall Square

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.310
for what I do.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.690
And it's a lot less lonely
here, as an entrepreneur.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.569
Specifically, as a female
entrepreneur.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:31.570
In Switzerland, I didn't think
there was any other female

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.790
tech entrepreneur in
the entire country.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.860
At least I never met anyone.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.680
And so--

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.100
AMANDA SURYA: You were a
pioneer, pretty much.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.260
BETTINA HEIN: Well I don't know,
I mean, it's very rare.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.540
Technology entrepreneurs
are not that common.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.500
I knew a fair amount of them,
because I already started out

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.120
of college.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.160
I started Start, which furthers
entrepreneurship

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.370
among European college
students.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.830
So I knew a fair amount of them,
but there weren't any

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.390
women there.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.160
So when I came here, and I
discovered that there are all

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.000
these women that are doing
startups, it was great.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.190
It was great to have
this sisterhood.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.480
And so I founded a group called
the SheEOs that I run

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.000
sort of as a hobby, where we
have 130 female CEOs in the

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.180
Boston area, that come
together every month.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.842
AMANDA SURYA: I love the name,
by the way, SheEOs.

00:18:25.842 --> 00:18:27.350
That's really creative.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:32.270
And why do you think it's
important to gather and form a

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.650
network of other women,
entrepreneurs and leaders?

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:44.690
BETTINA HEIN: Well as female
entrepreneurs we have, often

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.720
times, a little bit different
backgrounds than the typical

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.750
male founder.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.440
We have slightly different
networks.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.030
And so we may not
be tapped into

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.690
everything that's happening.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.750
Our conversations are often
slightly different than the

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.200
ones that the guys have.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.480
I'm going to be stereotypical
here, but they're probably a

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.870
bit less sports-related.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:16.970
Or we might be less into
first-person shooter games.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.860
That kind of stuff.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.490
So there's a little bit less
natural bonding going on

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.210
there, between the female
entrepreneurs and the male

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.500
counterpart.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.050
I can talk a good game for
sports and all of that.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.110
I've learned to do that because
I've work with men

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.300
most of my career.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.850
But with women, it's a different
conversation.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.370
And what we do at the SheEOs,
it's kind of a let your hair

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.400
down event.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.160
Everybody can be open about
what they're doing.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.440
And women are very

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.450
collaborative and like to share.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.410
And they're relatively honest.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:20:00.615
There's a lot less posturing
around I'm this cool guy, and

00:20:00.615 --> 00:20:03.550
I'm cooler than you.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.020
So we get to the bottom of
things pretty quickly, and

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.550
people will reach
out and help.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.970
So that's why I think it's
important to do that.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.243
I just think SheEOs offer a form
where women can do that.

00:20:19.243 --> 00:20:20.890
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I think
that's so great and so

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.990
important that you're helping
create a network like that.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.120
One of my favorite quotations is
from Madeleine Albright who

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.510
says, "There is a special place
in hell for women who

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.420
don't help other women,"
which I love.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.620
And I think you're representing
that really well.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.030
So, in that vein--

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.600
whether in this forum, or
outside of it-- what is the

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.650
best advice that you've been
given to help you succeed?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.890
It could be in your personal
life or professional life.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.065
And what advice do you give
other young entrepreneurs?

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.340
BETTINA HEIN: Well so my--

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.910
one of the best pieces of advice
that I ignored the

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:08.280
first time around was by my
grandmother, who had had her

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.510
own little grocery shop.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.310
And she founded it to help
support the family.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.240
And she told me when I started
my first company--

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.500
she said, Bettina,
you know what?

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.140
It's going to take a while for
you to get this established.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.220
Three or four years until you
really see it coming together.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.610
And I said--

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.465
the dutiful granddaughter--

00:21:33.465 --> 00:21:35.930
I said, yes, Grandma,
and smiled.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.460
But I thought in my head,
Grandma, I'm starting a

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.450
technology company, a
software company.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:49.230
We're going to go like this,
this hockey stick curve.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.910
Well, little did I know, that I
would be going to work every

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.620
single day for years.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.920
It seemed like an eternity
thinking,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.140
why am I such a loser?

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.080
Why am I such a loser?

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.770
And why is this company
not working?

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.100
And everybody can figure
out how to make money.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.450
I just can't.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.310
So I really then--

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.970
and, luckily, my Grandma was
still alive when I was able to

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.610
tell her, well, Grandma, your
advice was very correct.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.710
And, after three or four years,

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.730
magically, it started working.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.480
We got traction, all of that.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.670
So my advice to everybody is,
listen to your grandmother.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.650
They know more than you think.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.910
[LAUGHING]

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.470
AMANDA SURYA: So, basically,
listen to your grandma, stick

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.110
to what you're doing.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.800
It takes perseverance to make
a company successful.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.730
BETTINA HEIN: Absolutely.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.850
I tell tech founders--

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.080
I have this thing I
like to get back.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.280
Every week I have this
entrepreneurial office hour

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.840
where anybody can come
and talk to me.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.370
But I talk about that being
an entrepreneur

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.280
only needs three things.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.010
What you need is chutzpah.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.310
And first of all-- actually the
first thing that you need

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.330
is naivety.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.340
So that's the very
first thing.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.830
You have to be kind of naive
about what you're doing,

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.840
because if you knew what was
going to happen, you would not

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.500
create this company.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.810
And then the second thing that
you need is chutzpah.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.930
You have to have, really,
the audacity to put

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.750
yourself out there.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.880
And just tell people, this
is what I got to offer.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.080
Tell me if you like it.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.410
Tell me if you don't.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.970
And the third thing
is perseverance.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.880
So you've got to
see it through.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.930
It is going to be harder
than you thought.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:44.000
And you just have to
keep on going.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.040
And fake it till you make it.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.210
[LAUGHING]

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:48.940
GRETCHEN HOWARD: I love that.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.870
And creating that contagious
enthusiasm

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.630
around what you're doing.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.840
It sounds like you've done
a great job of that.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.920
And how have you helped your
company, and others, and

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.620
yourself, get through
some of those low

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.780
points that you mentioned?

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.010
To really make it through to
that four-year mark or

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.935
whatever that mark is, where
you could go back and tell

00:24:07.935 --> 00:24:09.620
Grandma, hey I really
made this.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.655
How did you get through
those low points?

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.980
BETTINA HEIN: You have to have
a good team around you.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.650
You have to like
coming to work.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.470
If you don't like your
co-founders.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:27.380
If you don't like your team, and
you don't like hanging out

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.360
with them, then it's going
to be really hard.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.170
You also have to kind of
understand that there is a

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:36.860
thing called the

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.270
entrepreneurial roller coaster.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.240
That one day you will
be high as a kite.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.210
Everything's wonderful, you've
signed on new customers.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.050
Investors love you, yay!

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:53.280
The next day, some customer
will say, this is useless.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.540
I'm not buying from you.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.970
Another investor will say, no.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.460
An employee will leave you.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.780
All of those things are
going to happen.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.930
And it's going to happen
in very fast cadence.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:03.950
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Sounds
like Google.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.210
We have that same product
development cycle and

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.320
interaction with customers.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.280
BETTINA HEIN: Well you're
probably still a young

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.660
company, in that regard.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:22.970
So if you understand that, it
helps you just keep the faith

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.935
and hold out for that success.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.090
I guess you have to be, also,
a pretty emotionally,

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.620
psychologically stable person
to be able to do that, to

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.040
really see a tech company
through its lifecycle.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.690
But, yeah.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.310
Just surround yourself with
others that are doing it.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.090
Because you'll see that, if you
just read TechCrunch, you

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.830
think everybody else is
killing it except you.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:58.050
But if you really talk to other
entrepreneurs that are

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.800
in the midst of doing things,
and buy them a beer, then

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.830
you'll hear the real story.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.580
AMANDA SURYA: That's awesome.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.890
I mean, that's really valuable
advice for me and our

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.660
audience, as well.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.690
And I think, unfortunately,
we're sort of out of time.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.710
And I just want to thank you
again, Bettina, for joining us

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.350
from Cambridge.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:28.000
And it's been really great to
just talk to somebody who's

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.150
actually building a company and
innovating on top of our

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.740
APIs and platform.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.390
I think that's really, really
cool, And shows a story that

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.145
you can be successful--

00:26:42.145 --> 00:26:42.840
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Twice over.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.090
AMANDA SURYA: Twice over.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.190
GRETCHEN HOWARD: And
I think you're also

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.600
doing a great job for--

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.070
a great role model for all
developers out there and

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.820
entrepreneurs.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.130
But especially women,
in particular.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.090
So thank you so very much
for joining us.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.040
BETTINA HEIN: Thank you very
much, and I really love the

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.720
dev relations team
over at YouTube.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.150
So thanks--

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.400
AMANDA SURYA: Great to hear.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.630
BETTINA HEIN: Yep.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.830
You help us a lot.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.980
So thank you for doing a
great job over there.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.450
AMANDA SURYA: All right.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.460
GRETCHEN HOWARD:
Thanks so much.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.290
AMANDA SURYA: Thank you.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:16.890
BETTINA HEIN: Bye bye.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:17.190
GRETCHEN HOWARD: Bye.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.440
AMANDA SURYA: Talk
to you later.
