00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
Hi, I'm John Green. Welcome to Crash Course Big
History. Today, we're going to look at the Modern Revolution.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.920
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! But, what does modern
even mean. I mean, I know that fax machines

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.040
and Super Nintendo are modern, but like people
used to think that toilets that flushed were modern.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.900
That's actually a pretty perceptive question,
Me From the Past, so if we are going to talk

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.740
about modernity, we should probably define
modernity. But first, I have great news.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.939
There is a future, me from the past, where
video games are so much better than Super

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.839
Nintendo. In fact, this machine plays 24,000
games, and it is in the office of future you.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.090
What were we talking about? Oh right, modernity.
So some historians date the beginning of the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.810
Modern Era with the beginnings of The 
Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.100
Some date it to the French Revolution in 1789.
Some push it further back to 16th and 17th century

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.800
European colonialism. And, some date modernity
with the European Renaissance and call anything

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.829
past the year 1500 "early modern."

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.649
But through a Big History Lens, all of these
are just signs of acceleration in human collective

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.459
learning, which was already underway and took
its first tiny steps in East Africa 250,000

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.519
years ago. Then again, it would be silly to call the
first human foragers "Early-Early-Early Modern."

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.759
So for the purposes of today, let's say the
"Early Modern" period began around 1500, and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.039
the "Modern Modern" period around 1750, with an
acknowledgement that it's all a little bit arbitrary.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.360
And I know what you're wondering, but no, 1750 was
several decades before the first flushing toilets.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.200
[Theme Music]

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.999
So, last week we looked at how Collective
Learning, which relies on population numbers

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.819
and connectivity to produce new ideas, grew by leaps
and bounds with the introduction of agriculture.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.980
By the year 1400, the human population had
advanced magnificently, but the world was

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:56.209
still divided into four isolated world zones: The
Americas, Australasia, the Pacific, and Afro-Eurasia.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.380
From a Big History perspective, what makes
the European explorations worthy of a place

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.950
in an episode called "Modern Revolution" is
that they eventually united all four world

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.319
zones into a global system. An increasingly
connected network of potential innovators

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.170
was great for collective learning.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.519
But why did the Europeans feel so motivated
to expand? Well, a lot of reasons. One, Ottoman

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.930
dominance of overland trade routes with Asia,
particularly after the conquests of Constantinople

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.890
in 1453, made Europeans seek alternative routes
to the populous and rich lands of the East.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.680
Two, European states were fairly small compared
to some of the vast empires of Asia, and needed

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.790
to compete for more resources to fuel their
almost constant wars.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.200
And three, the fruits of exploration undoubtedly had
positive effects. Whether it be the many advanced inventions and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.180
consumer goods imported from China, or the spices
of India and Indonesia, or crops from the Americas.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.700
That last one should not be underestimated.
Crops like the potato, which earned the nickname

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.870
"Ready Made Bread" because it was easy to
prepare combined with maize, and squashes,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.980
and tomatoes, and various yams allowed farms
in Europe to support more people.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.530
This was also good for Asia where these crops
were introduced in the 17th century. And,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.870
let us not forget about the vast amounts of
silver that the Spanish "acquired" from the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.590
Americas, or the many cotton, tobacco, and sugar
farms that Europeans bolstered their economies with.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.440
The unification of world zones also had many,
many negative effects. For instance, it was

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.570
terrible for people who worked on those cotton,
and tobacco, and sugar farms.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.520
Europeans increasingly relied on African slaves,
the first of whom were granted to the Portuguese

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.409
by African rulers, and then you know, several
centuries of horror ensued with an incomprehensible

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.359
number of African slaves dying in the appalling
conditions of the Atlantic crossing.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.689
Life was also pretty miserable for the slaves
that survived the journey, and generations

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.409
of their descendants. Also, because Afro-Eurasia
was a modestly connected, thriving cesspool

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.109
of disease, Europeans had developed many immunities.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.499
When they started arriving in the previously
isolated Americas in the late 1400's and 1500's,

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.930
the indigenous inhabitants had no immunity
to those diseases. This resulted in one of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.240
the most horrific events in human history. A cocktail of
various European diseases -- most notably smallpox --

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.020
killed off an estimated 50 million
people in the Americas in little over a century.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.980
A similar tragedy played itself out in Australia when
Europeans started arriving there in the 18th century.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.840
Now, along with all this horrific stuff, the
unification of the world zones was, nevertheless,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.840
a good thing for collective learning -- which
would eventually prove our salvation in many ways.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.930
And this global system continues to increase
in complexity and connectivity today. Which

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.700
is why people can now look at THIS on their
smartphone.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.040
Anyway, the unification of the world zones
did not in itself lead to a breakthrough in

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.590
the way humans harvested matter and energy.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.260
The last major shift happened with the arrival of
agriculture ten thousand years prior. The colonizing

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.700
European societies of the sixteenth, seventeenth, 
and eighteenth centuries remained agrarian.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.060
But the explorations did allow for a network
of exchange that eventually did lead to a

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.800
major breakthrough in how humans harnessed
more energy and produced more and more cultural

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.360
complexity, The Industrial Revolution.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.530
The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain,
as they'll be happy to tell you, in the 18th

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.880
century, but it was a global revolution involving
collective learning shared across the global system.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.979
But a number of innovations that kick-started
industry originated in Britain, like the more

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.330
intensified use of steam engines, or the use
of coke to refine metals. Not that Coke, yeah,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.210
that coke. Also, they invented many textile
machines, and Britain had lots of coal and

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.099
it was relatively easy to mine. Thank you
trees that died hundreds of millions of years

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.699
ago, we're going to turn you into industry,
and smog.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.979
But all those British breakthroughs wouldn't
have been possible without a huge global network

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.020
of trade that supplied raw materials, like
cotton, and that opened new markets where

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.560
Britain could sell its goods.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.180
And it wouldn't have possible to expand that
network of trade in the first place without

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.750
gunpowder, and the compass, which both came
from China. The methods of porcelain manufacture

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.159
that were important to the industrial revolution
in Britain also came from China via Germany,

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.190
and the improved methods of farming which
freed up many British farm workers for industrial

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.419
wage labour in the cities came from Flanders,
in the Netherlands. Early designs for steam

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.150
engines came from 18th century France, and
much of the designs for these machines depended

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.590
on mathematics preserved and transmitted by
Islamic and Hindu civilizations.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.919
So up until the end of the 18th century virtually
all production in human history was propelled

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.069
by human or animal muscle power, or else,
by wind and water power. But it turned out

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:34.460
that coal and oil had stored energy from the
sun that had built up over hundreds of millions

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.099
of years, and using those resources dramatically
increased the energy that humans could harness.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.940
Huge numbers of goods could be produced by
factories at relatively low prices which meant

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.720
that over many decades goods that had previously
been seen as luxuries by common people, were

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.819
suddenly viewed as necessities. By the 1900s
most Europeans enjoyed a standard of living

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.349
higher than the kings of the middle ages.
Coal and oil also allowed mechanization of

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.520
agriculture, which raised the carrying capacity,
increasing the population. And new modes of

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.990
connectivity beginning with the telegraph
and then later the telephone increasingly bound

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.370
the human species together allowing for swift
and rapid exchange of ideas. For 250,000 years,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.520
if I wanted to tell someone who lived a hundred miles
away from me something, it took me days to do so.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.520
For the last hundred years, it's
taken me seconds.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.099
Because a slight tweak in modes of production
in the 18th century and the adoption of fossil

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:32.780
fuels led to an explosion of productivity
and invention in the 1800's and 1900's, people

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.580
often compare The Industrial Revolution to the
Cambrian Explosion about 540,000,000 years ago.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.099
Remember, when a new skill or trait open
up new ways or 'niches' to extract energy

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:49.479
from the environment, evolutionary change can proceed
very quickly. In the Cambrian Explosion that

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.560
evolutionary change was biological. In The Industrial
Revolution that increased pace of change was cultural.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.680
Consider bike design. In the 1800's there
were many many different designs for bikes.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.409
Some of which look amazingly terrifyingly
unsafe. In the beginning of innovations for

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:10.189
bicycles a huge number of designs filled all
of the available niches. Eventually those

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:14.569
designs started competing with each other
and a few forms won out. You got the road

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:19.720
bike and the mountain bike and the BMX bike. Just a
little bit different variations of the same thing.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.780
Another example is the adaptive radiation
of electronics. Take a look at all the stuff

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:28.719
you needed in the 1980's to do what your average
cellphone can do today. And that was only

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:33.510
a few decades ago. Many new ideas sparked
an increase in the human standard of living,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.800
in the complexity of societies, in tons of
different ways. The explosion of cultural

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.750
evolution that started 200 years ago has yet
to cease.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.170
The Cambrian Explosion went on for millions
of years. The Agricultural Revolution proceeded

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.650
for thousands of years. We're still right
in the middle of the Modern Revolution; maybe

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.080
only at the beginning. The huge shift in human
activity and a rise in complexity may continue

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.320
long after our grandchildren's lifetimes.
That is, so long as we don't do something

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.620
stupid, which, you know with homo sapiens
is always a distinct possibility.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.680
And let's not forget about the rise in complexity
that's been happening since the beginning

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.660
of the universe 13.8 billion years ago. A
star is essentially a pile of hydrogen and

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.920
helium. It's extremely simple. By comparison,
a brain that arose via biological evolution

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.370
is an intricate network of billions of connections
and building blocks. Industrial society is

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.320
an immense whirring global network of millions
upon millions of brains, more closely connected

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.470
than ever before. The products of this society
raised complexity even further.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.330
Bottom line is this: if the first part of
this series, which looked at the vastness

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.900
of the universe, made you feel insignificant,
just remember that now at the tremendous heights

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.180
of technological progress humanity is, in
terms of networks and building blocks,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.800
the most complex system that we know of in the
universe.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.960
And there's currently no end to the potential
for rising complexity in sight.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.740
This brings us to a longstanding historical question:
"Why did The Industrial Revolution happen in Britain?"

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.100
Great Britain was certainly uncommonly
well-positioned. That said, so was China.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.020
So why didn't The Industrial Revolution happen in,
say, Song Dynasty China, between the 10th and 13th centuries?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.800
So we know the two main drivers of collective
learning are population numbers and connectivity,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.850
and China has had both for a long time. The medieval
Chinese had much more advanced agricultural

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.110
methods than Europe; they paid attention to
weeding and growing crops in rows, and frequently

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:25.180
used tools like the seed drill. And they were doing it all
centuries before that stuff was even heard of in Europe.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.620
In the 900's, the spread of wet rice farming
in Southern China raised the carrying capacity

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:35.030
even further because rice fields simply produce
more food. They are more efficient. Also,

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.230
rice is easier to prepare than the laborious
European process of turning wheat into bread.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.860
So, during the 10th and 11th centuries, the Chinese
population increased from about 50 or 60 million

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.930
to about 120 million. That's a lot of new
innovators. So many, in fact, that Song China

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.850
came close to having a modern revolution of
its own. I mean, coal was used to manufacture

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:02.250
iron, production increased from 19,000 metric
tons per year around 900 CE to 113,000 metric

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.680
tons by 1200 CE. The Song Dynasty was the
first to invent and harness the power of gunpowder,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.310
and then later, in the 15th century, Zheng
He conducted overseas explorations decades

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.600
before Columbus. Textile production showed
the first ever signs of mechanization in ways

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.800
similar to the European Spinning Jenny.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.960
But. China had dry coal, while the British
needed to pump water out of their coal mines

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.300
in order to mine coal, which led the British
to build steam engines.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.800
So, why didn't the modern revolution start
in China around 1000 CE? Well, it might have

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.190
been the cultural and political climate, and
a shift away from innovation and commerce

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:41.930
at the end of Song China in 1279. Possibly
because they hadn't united the world zones

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.330
in a network of trade and unified collective
learning. And possibly because the right combination

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.640
of cultural innovations required to launch a Cambrian
style explosion of growth just didn't happen.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.320
The point is that collective learning is such
a powerful force that from the explosion of

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.910
the world population from only 6 million people
10,000 years ago to 954 million by the end

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.320
of the Agrarian era, the right combination
of ideas that led to the industrial explosion

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.170
might have happened almost anywhere.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.210
So long as there are brains to think and exchange
ideas, so long as there are energy flows on

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.420
the earth, humanity has a tremendous potential
for rising complexity.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.680
The modern revolution was accompanied by explosive
growth in human population. It took 250,000

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:28.150
years for humanity to achieve its first billion
people. By 1900, the world's population was

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.320
1.6 billion. Today, there are over 7 billion
potential innovators who are now connected

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.700
by the lightning speed of the internet, and
collective learning is more powerful than ever.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.640
Humans now have unprecedented control and
power over the Earth's biosphere, which has

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.750
prompted some scientists and scholars to claim
that the Holocene is over and we now stand

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.830
on the threshold of a new era: the Anthropocene.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.740
During this age, we may continue to raise
complexity in our little pocket of the universe

00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:00.860
to wondrous new levels, hopefully to the growing
benefit of all humans rather than just a privileged few.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.900
Thanks to collective learning, our potential
is awesome. Unless, that is, we hit a wall

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.420
like agrarian societies did every few centuries
when their population growth outstripped

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.260
their rates of agricultural innovation.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.660
We are now in an era of immense danger, where
the modern global system of humanity might

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.090
exhaust the resources of the Earth, in the
same way that agricultural societies often

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.510
exhausted the resources of the field. More
on that next time.
