00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.105
- [Voiceover] James counted
the number of alligators

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:05.185
in various local bodies of water

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.633
and graphed the results.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.047
How many fewer alligators
are in Bite Swamp

00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:13.543
than Chomp Lake and
Reptile Creek combined?

00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:15.801
So, down here, we have this bar graph

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.301
that James somehow survived to create

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:20.864
after going to all these bodies of water

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.114
and counting the alligators.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.725
We'll hope he was behind
a fence or something.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.793
So then, we're asked how
many fewer alligators are

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:33.960
in Bite Swamp than in Chomp
Lake and Reptile Creek combined?

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.627
So, we need to know first
how many are in Chomp Lake

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:42.592
and Reptile Creek combined

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:45.823
before we can figure out how
many fewer are in Bite Swamp.

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:46.948
So, let's look down here.

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:50.089
Here's Chomp Lake sounding super scary,

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.862
and it's bar lines up to six,

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:55.980
so there's six alligators in Chomp Lake.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.147
Plus, in Reptile Creek, if we
go over here to Reptile Creek

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:03.070
this bar lines up to nine,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.225
so there's nine alligators
hanging out in Reptile Creek.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.975
Six plus nine, let's
see nine plus one is 10,

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.805
so we can make our six
into a a five and a one,

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.555
nine plus one is 10 plus
five more equals 15.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.830
So, there's total of 15 alligators

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.421
in Chomp Lake and Reptile Creek combined.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.588
Now, we can answer how many
fewer than 15 are in Bite Swamp.

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.544
So, Bite Swamp down here,

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:38.193
sounding the most dangerous of them all,

00:01:38.193 --> 00:01:40.693
has a bar that lines up to 12.

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:46.554
So, 12, there's 12
alligators in Bite Swamp,

00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:49.804
so how many fewer is 12 than the amount

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.645
in Chomp Lake and Reptile
Creek combined, 15,

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:57.085
so how much fewer is 12 than 15?

00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:00.573
Well, if we have 15 and we take 12 away,

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:02.740
that leaves us with three.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.423
Three fewer alligators in Bite Swamp

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:11.978
than there are in Chomp Lake
and Reptile Creek combined.
