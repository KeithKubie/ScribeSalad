00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.520
CSS3 introduces image-set, a new value for the background

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.220
image property that let's us specify different background image

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.920
files depending solely on the display density. This won't

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.210
let us change based on layout size but we

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.930
can do that using a media query. This works

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.350
great to switch between different versions of the same

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.190
image. Image, purely based on pixel density if that's

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.200
all you need. That is, your layout size in pixels

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.840
won't change and you don't mind using background images.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.720
If those are good for you, this is the way

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.830
to go. Foreground images are a bit trickier because you'll

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.670
either end up with an invalid HTML and no source

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.740
attribute. With problematic accessibility or you'll end up downloading

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.820
an image you don't need in the high device pixel

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.290
ratio cases. This is one place you probably don't want to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.520
roll your own solution but use a library to polyfill

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.110
until we get the right solution. There's a great

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.190
article written by Chris Coyier That has a collection

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.590
of solution libraries that he and Christopher Schmitt have

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.420
put together. My personal favorite of these is the Picturefull

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.590
polyfill, because I think it's most likely to be

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.440
relatively close to the eventual standard solution in its markup.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.620
But there are many other techniques with differing complexity.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.500
For example, the clown car technique designed by Estelle Wile.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.700
This technique makes use of SVG encapsulation, to make

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.370
each image a single reference. But to an SVG file,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.070
that inside it has its own media query that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.090
selectively sets a background image on the SVG object. Background

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.290
image, again, in order to prevent the browser from

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.870
downloading all of the image references early. This technique is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.110
quite workable but its also a bit complex and markup

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.640
particularly if you want it to work in internet explorer.
