resume method is tied to the activity

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:09.980
resume method is tied to the activity
 

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.740
resume method is tied to the activity
method and what we really need is

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:11.750
method and what we really need is
 

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.380
method and what we really need is
something so that when we display a

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:14.390
something so that when we display a
 

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.540
something so that when we display a
fragment on top of another one and then

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:16.550
fragment on top of another one and then
 

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.420
fragment on top of another one and then
dismiss that fragment that we get some

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.430
dismiss that fragment that we get some
 

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.550
dismiss that fragment that we get some
kind of callbacks so that we can refresh

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:21.560
kind of callbacks so that we can refresh
 

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.829
kind of callbacks so that we can refresh
that fragment the only thing that I can

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839
that fragment the only thing that I can
 

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.620
that fragment the only thing that I can
really find is the exact change listener

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:26.630
really find is the exact change listener
 

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.939
really find is the exact change listener
but it doesn't tell you anything about

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:27.949
but it doesn't tell you anything about
 

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:29.620
but it doesn't tell you anything about
what happened all that says is the back

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.630
what happened all that says is the back
 

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.570
what happened all that says is the back
stack change so I was wondering if

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:31.580
stack change so I was wondering if
 

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.230
stack change so I was wondering if
there's a

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240
there's a
 

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.810
there's a
a better way of getting a call back up

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:34.820
a better way of getting a call back up
 

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.780
a better way of getting a call back up
exactly what fragment became visible or

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:37.790
exactly what fragment became visible or
 

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.500
exactly what fragment became visible or
was hidden or whatever so are all of the

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:41.510
was hidden or whatever so are all of the
 

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.030
was hidden or whatever so are all of the
front so the one that's getting covered

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.040
front so the one that's getting covered
 

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.770
front so the one that's getting covered
up its attached the entire time that's

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:44.780
up its attached the entire time that's
 

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.720
up its attached the entire time that's
visible the entire time there's just

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.730
visible the entire time there's just
 

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.870
visible the entire time there's just
something else over it sorry it's not

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880
something else over it sorry it's not
 

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.460
something else over it sorry it's not
estable there's another fragment

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.470
estable there's another fragment
 

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.680
estable there's another fragment
completely covering it all right but I

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:53.690
completely covering it all right but I
 

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.810
completely covering it all right but I
but I mean I understand it's not visible

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:55.820
but I mean I understand it's not visible
 

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.760
but I mean I understand it's not visible
to the user but I mean it has like

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:57.770
to the user but I mean it has like
 

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.570
to the user but I mean it has like
there's a is visible property so it's

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:01.580
there's a is visible property so it's
 

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:07.060
there's a is visible property so it's
still enjoys it sizzle okay do we have

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.070
still enjoys it sizzle okay do we have
 

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.110
still enjoys it sizzle okay do we have
callback for invisible or anything like

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120
callback for invisible or anything like
 

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.780

there is a facility now that i think

there is a facility now that i think
 

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.010
there is a facility now that i think
about it for doing this just within

about it for doing this just within
fragments i think what you need to do is

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559
fragments i think what you need to do is
 

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:30.430
fragments i think what you need to do is
from within the activity have some

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440
from within the activity have some
 

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.169
from within the activity have some
business logic that's tracking what

remove the covering fragment when when

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:41.660
remove the covering fragment when when
 

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.240

that fragment detaches have a call back

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.250

just seems like I have to implement that

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360
just seems like I have to implement that
 

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.299
just seems like I have to implement that
logic and every fragment I have and I'm

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:52.309
logic and every fragment I have and I'm
 

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:55.680

moving forward um is it possible to

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400
moving forward um is it possible to
 

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.420
moving forward um is it possible to
change the theming of the overflow menu

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.430

the before we came on air that well the

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.140
the before we came on air that well the
 

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.659
the before we came on air that well the
way to fix that is to just change your

00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:42.669
way to fix that is to just change your
 

00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:44.520
way to fix that is to just change your
orientation every television right and

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.530

then your problem solved but that's

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:46.809
then your problem solved but that's
 

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:48.210
then your problem solved but that's
probably not what you're going for I

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:48.220
probably not what you're going for I
 

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.470
probably not what you're going for I
think what we're looking at is a

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480
think what we're looking at is a
 

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.470
think what we're looking at is a
limitation of that sort of output and

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480
limitation of that sort of output and
 

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.799
limitation of that sort of output and
the HDMI that cable so I think you're

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:58.809
the HDMI that cable so I think you're
 

00:26:58.809 --> 00:27:00.270
the HDMI that cable so I think you're
just looking at a hardware limitation

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:00.280
just looking at a hardware limitation
 

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.770
just looking at a hardware limitation
there and not something that we can we

00:36:52.759 --> 00:36:52.769
problem is here I think what you saying
 

00:36:52.769 --> 00:36:55.430
problem is here I think what you saying
is that that what what the question is

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440
is that that what what the question is
 

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.640
is that that what what the question is
is that if a activity plays a video and

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:58.650
is that if a activity plays a video and
 

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.539
is that if a activity plays a video and
the power button is turned off um when

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:02.549
the power button is turned off um when
 

00:37:02.549 --> 00:37:04.309
the power button is turned off um when
the power button is turned back on again

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319
the power button is turned back on again
 

00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:06.469
the power button is turned back on again
the activity restarts and the video is

00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:06.479
the activity restarts and the video is
 

00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:08.779
the activity restarts and the video is
playing in the background so this sounds

00:37:08.779 --> 00:37:08.789
playing in the background so this sounds
 

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:11.299
playing in the background so this sounds
like there's a little bit of red herring

00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:11.309
like there's a little bit of red herring
 

00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:13.099
like there's a little bit of red herring
if the problem really is that the video

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:13.109
if the problem really is that the video
 

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:15.799
if the problem really is that the video
is playing in the background then I

00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:15.809
is playing in the background then I
 

00:37:15.809 --> 00:37:17.089
is playing in the background then I
think what you're here you need

00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:17.099
think what you're here you need
 

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:19.039
think what you're here you need
something in your activity to say on

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:19.049
something in your activity to say on
 

00:37:19.049 --> 00:37:21.170
something in your activity to say on
pause and stop your video playback

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180
pause and stop your video playback
 

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.660
pause and stop your video playback
actually not it's not about your screen

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:23.670
actually not it's not about your screen
 

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.190
actually not it's not about your screen
orientation at this point it's more

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200
orientation at this point it's more
 

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.559
orientation at this point it's more
about does your activity have only its

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:27.569
about does your activity have only its
 

00:37:27.569 --> 00:37:30.349
about does your activity have only its
its methods implemented correctly so on

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359
its methods implemented correctly so on
 

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:33.019
its methods implemented correctly so on
pause and on let's spawn resume on Zoom

00:37:33.019 --> 00:37:33.029
pause and on let's spawn resume on Zoom
 

00:37:33.029 --> 00:37:35.719
pause and on let's spawn resume on Zoom
yeah undestroyed maybe but I'm resume

00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:35.729
yeah undestroyed maybe but I'm resume
 

00:37:35.729 --> 00:37:37.849
yeah undestroyed maybe but I'm resume
and on pause are the two methods and you

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859
and on pause are the two methods and you
 

00:37:37.859 --> 00:37:40.279
and on pause are the two methods and you
looking at to make sure that that video

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:40.289
looking at to make sure that that video
 

00:37:40.289 --> 00:37:42.920
looking at to make sure that that video
playback is stopped and in fact if you

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:42.930
playback is stopped and in fact if you
 

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.079
playback is stopped and in fact if you
look at the documentation for doing some

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:45.089
look at the documentation for doing some
 

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:48.620
look at the documentation for doing some
of the video recording and whatnot we

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:48.630
of the video recording and whatnot we
 

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.599
of the video recording and whatnot we
talk specifically about you know that

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:50.609
talk specifically about you know that
 

00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:53.080
talk specifically about you know that
you should implement on pause and

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.090
you should implement on pause and
 

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.540
you should implement on pause and
museum specifically to stop that kind of

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:55.550
museum specifically to stop that kind of
 

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.740
museum specifically to stop that kind of
behavior right because you do not want

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:56.750
behavior right because you do not want
 

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.660
behavior right because you do not want
video playing in the background right

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:58.670

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:14.950
question as well loaders so it looks
 

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.080
question as well loaders so it looks
like the question is about delaying

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:16.090
like the question is about delaying

to load in your fragment it might be a
good idea actually to do that yeah

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:24.850
good idea actually to do that yeah
 

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.010
good idea actually to do that yeah
because there's actually nothing in the

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:26.020
because there's actually nothing in the
 

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.230
because there's actually nothing in the
docs that says that this has to be done

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240
docs that says that this has to be done
 

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.830
