IKAI LAN: Hey everyone.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.300
Welcome to another edition of
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.600
We have a very special show
for you guys today.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.180
I know I always say that, but
I actually mean that.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.430
First off, let's take a look
at our fine crew today.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.330
Now, if there's something that
you're seeing that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.870
different, it's that there
are seven of us.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.430
So we have had the entire
developer relations team from

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.920
all around the world, and that
means Mountain View, New York,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000
here in our New York studio
today to talk to you guys

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.160
about some of our favorite
moments from the last year of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.570
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.520
And in addition, we have two
very, very special guests.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.890
People that you haven't seen
on this show before.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.350
One is Amanda, our
glorious leader.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.540
And Darryl, who's our
summer intern.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.310
So why don't we go ahead and
go around the room and all

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.400
introduce ourselves for the
viewers, just in case they

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.310
don't already know who we are.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.520
I am Ikai Lan.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.430
I'm a member of YouTube

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.610
Devleoper Relations, obviously.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.180
Let's not state the obvious.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.330
And I work here in
New York City.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.170
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi, everyone.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.989
I'm Ibrahim Ulukaya.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.350
I'm also New York city based.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.235
And I'm sure you guys
have seen me in

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.620
New York City before.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.023
So I'll hand it to Darryl.

00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:12.020
DARRYL: Hi, I'm Darryl.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.030
I'm the summer intern, and
I work in Mountain View.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.220
I'm a rising junior at Stanford,
and I'm working on a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.903
top secret project.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.660
AMANDA: Hi, I'm Amanda, and I'm
based in Silicon Valley.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm
Jarek, based in

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.660
Silicon Valley as well.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.470
JEFF POSNICK: I'm Jeff.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410
And I'm based here
in New York.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.190
JEREMY: And I'm Jeremy.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.720
And I'm also based in
Silicon Valley.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.280
IKAI LAN: So as I mentioned,
today we're going to be

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.420
showing you guys our favorite
moments from YouTube

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.200
Developers Live.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.760
So all of us have gone out and
picked out a short clip from

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.160
our favorite show.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.690
In many of the cases,
we are in the shows.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.020
So just putting that
out there.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.560
Why don't we go ahead and
get started, Jeff?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.840
I believe you're up first.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.340
JEFF POSNICK: Sure.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.910
Thanks, you guys.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.000
So yeah, I was a little biased
in choosing my clip.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090
This is a show that I was in.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.020
Its an interview that I did a
few months back with John

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.450
Luther, who's one of the product
managers for WebM and

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.100
for VP8, and a lot of the really
cool video and coding

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.390
technology that we use at
Google and YouTube.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.600
And in addition to being what
I think was a really great

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.220
show, I think it's a
really great topic.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.720
So I hope folks go back and
check out the full video

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.230
afterwards.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.120
But we're going to show a
short clip in which John

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860
reveals some of the secret
history behind VP8.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.583
And it goes back a little bit
further than you'd think.

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:32.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
-Get into a little bit more of
the details as to why somebody

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.440
would actually want to use WebM
and VP8 versus some of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.930
the other formats and codecs
that are out there.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.370
What are some advantages?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.990
-Well, one of the advantages
with VP8 is that it's a very,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.910
very efficient codec.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.810
I mean, it was developed
roughly 2009-ish.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.720
And then we acquired
it in 2010.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.970
So.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.440
-I was expecting you to
say 2,000 years ago.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.500
It's a very ancient codec.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.260
-Not that long.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.510
-Lots of papyrus, hardware
acceleration, stuff like that.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.830
-We were drawing the pixels
by hand when I

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.850
first started in this.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.320
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.100
JEFF POSNICK: So there you go.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.695
Now you know.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.860
And I'm going to hand things
over to Amanda.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.670
AMANDA: All right.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.240
So one of my favorite shows in
the session is basically the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.360
opening session from this year's
Google I/O, where our

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.520
product leader and our
engineering leader articulated

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.640
the areas of investment in the
YouTube platform that presents

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.360
a lot of opportunities for
developers to innovate and to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.200
leverage the YouTube platform
to grow their business.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.318
So let's watch a clip from
that session right now.

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:50.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.840
-So this is the first time we're
actually doing this and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720
actually consciously thinking
about, what are some of the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.460
segments we're excited about?

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.250
So the labels are still rough,
but I'll try to explain them.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.160
In the top left is creation.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.795
You saw things like live
streaming and capture.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:06.120
It's very exciting for us.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.540
We'll walk you through
some examples,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660
including a guest star.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.260
On the discovery and context
side, these are the true

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.290
viewer consumption
oriented apps.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.149
So folks like BuzzFeed, who
might be all about news and

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.920
really interesting moments.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.130
They are now integrating
video fluidly.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.060
So to keep engagement
in their apps high.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.970
Then we have folks on
the enterprise side.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.650
So enterprise is very hot right
now, partially because

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.190
there's a lot of money
flowing to it.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.460
But also, when we look to the
future, we think about tens,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.570
if not hundreds, of $100 million
run rate business

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.170
being born on our platform.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.200
And in order to do that, we need
platform companies out

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.427
there who are building
on our APIs to

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.230
service those verticals.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.970
So we'll talk--

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.630
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.390
AMANDA: All right.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.080
So if you are a developer
looking for ideas and examples

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.190
of what people have done on
the YouTube platform,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.600
definitely check the show up.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.650
And definitely contact one
of us to get started.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.210
And now, Darryl, do you
want to talk about

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.950
your favorite show?

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.300
DARRYL: Sure.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.910
So one of my favorite
presentations was actually the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.440
Topics API presentation.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.875
So why don't we roll the
video first, and I'll

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:21.212
talk about it afterward.

00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:22.640
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.100
-So not just to talk about what
you can do with these

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.930
narrow entities.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.900
But I actually kind of want to
show you what is possible with

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.390
the central annotations
that we have today.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.030
I'm not going to talk about
what the demo does

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.330
before I go into it.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.360
But you should know that this
is not the rules-based demo.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.680
That is, it's agnostic about
what kind of entity I'm

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.120
couriering for.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.000
And it's about maybe
60 lines of Python.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.380
So say, for example, I want to
explore origami on YouTube.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.770
I don't know what origami is
about, except it's about

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.710
folding paper.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.620
But I want to learn more.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.120
So I look up the entity
on Freebase.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.550
And how are videos categorized
if I use entities?

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.570
Well, it turns out that origami
on YouTube tends to be

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.510
different shapes of organisms.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.670
And I can use this to learn
how to fold origami.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.310
So I can start learning
folding roses, cats.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.580
And after I've spent enough time
indoors folding origami,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.230
maybe I want to go outside
and travel a little bit.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.430
So I want to look up,
what do we have

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.900
about travel on YouTube?

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.670
Probably videos, categorized
into countries and cities.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.980
And sure enough, we have travel
videos about different

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.177
countries, and different
cities, and so on.

00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:31.590
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.550
JEFF POSNICK: That LoCo Host,
man, that's like my favorite

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.800
website too.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.620
DARRYL: So in that clip,
Philippe demonstrated the

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.740
kinds of apps you can develop
with the YouTube Topics API.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.412
And I really like this
presentation because of two

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:47.150
main reasons.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.490
First, it shows you the power
of the YouTube Topics API.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.296
So in the app he developed, can
search for a keyword, and

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:57.290
it will return a list of search
results grouped by a

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.630
secondary topic such as
travel destination.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.040
And I think the Topics API
really opens up a lot of

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.500
possibilities for developers
who are interested in using

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.350
semantic data.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.130
And second of all, they
explained the ranking

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.850
mechanism that YouTube uses in
order to generate the topics

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.770
for each video.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.080
So we use three main things.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.310
We use text annotations.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.460
We use audiovisual
data from videos.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.400
And we also use comments data
to generate these topics for

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.310
each video.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.285
And the result is that US
developers get concise and

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.090
accurate lists of topics
for each video to

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.140
use as semantic data.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.430
So I recommend that anyone
interested in using semantic

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.350
data for videos takes
a look at the video.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.740
And with that, I'll pass
it off to Jeremy.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.120
JEREMY: Great.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.810
So actually, mine took place
in space and underwater.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.680
So why don't we roll the clip
and then I'll answer.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.972
IKAI LAN: This is going to be a
tough act to follow, Jeremy.

00:07:50.972 --> 00:07:51.430
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.750
-This is what they
were showing.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.910
And you can actually click.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.370
So let's say I'm in space now,
but I want to be underwater.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.420
I just click, and see, it takes
me now to an underwater.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.610
So this is using your
APIs, correct?

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.150
-Yeah, this is using the API.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.100
So from this app, we can
retrieve the first image of

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.080
the different video files
that are loaded into the

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.330
application.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.170
And then, when you click here
on the top of it, it sends a

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.030
message to our FTPI, which
triggers a switch of the

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.930
background.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.200
-Yeah.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.700
Yeah, this is really cool.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.800
And of course, our favorite
YouTube dev sticker.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.440
-And then, this is all happening
in real time.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.450
We're doing all this
processing only

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.710
by using our software.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.800
So it's in a very
powerful tool.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.600
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.402
JEREMY: OK, maybe there is
a couple more in there.

00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:39.703
JEFF POSNICK: It looks like
my wallpaper at home.

00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:42.050
Just the YouTube Developers
logo.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.470
JEREMY: Yeah, I actually
was plugging the

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.680
stickers quite a bit there.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.310
So that was one of our
partners, Cappella's,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.850
students, who actually uses our
new live streaming API.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.810
And they did a really
good job with it.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.375
And we actually did feature them
also at Google I/O and

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.980
our YouTube sandbox.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.360
And they did some really cool
things with software, doing

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.030
the green screen while they're
streaming to YouTube, using

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.410
that live streaming API.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.450
So I just wanted people to see
that it was one of the cool

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.045
things we had at I/O.
So with that, I'll

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:14.220
turn it over to Jarek.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Thanks, Jeremy.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.330
All right, so I picked a show
about the YouTube Android

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.150
player API.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.300
In fact, it was a very difficult
decision for me

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.140
which show to pick.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.490
Because I think we've all done
a lot of interesting shows in

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.160
the last few quarters.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.990
A lot of new APIs have
been launched.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.240
And we interviewed a lot
of wonderful partners.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.940
But let's roll the tape, and
then we'll talk a little bit

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.740
about that show.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.060
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.440
-The video wall is an example
of what you might be able to

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.420
do with the app, by
putting all the

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.280
components of the API together.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.550
And so it's a simple demo
of thumbnails flipping.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.450
And then, one of the thumbnails
will flip in and

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.780
turn to a video.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.720
So that shows you how
you can embed the

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.180
videos within your UI.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.125
And play and close them
programmatically.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.660
-And moving along.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.410
There is a simple player view
demo included as well.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.420
Can you tell us when one might
want to include this code?

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.740
-Sure.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.510
So Simple Player View is just
the simplest possible approach

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.900
to using the API and embedding
video into your app.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.580
So this is just embedding
a simple player

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.750
view into the UI.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.040
I have nothing else apart
from a text view.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.332
But you can put whatever
you want above.

00:10:29.332 --> 00:10:32.410
And it's just showing how simple
it is to embed it as a

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:32.950
player view.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.890
And we also have the simple
player fragment, which is

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.350
basically--

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: There are
three reasons why I actually

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.830
think this is a really
interesting show.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.100
Number one, the API that
we were featuring

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.420
is extremely powerful.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.920
So if you're building a mobile
application, and you are not

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.160
embedding YouTube content in
your application, take a look.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.590
It's very easy to do.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.260
And we went into details with
Ross McIlroy, who hopefully is

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.520
watching us right now from the
UK, where part of the show

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.690
took place.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.220
The second reason is, this
show was actually kind of

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.130
challenging to film.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.990
We were in two different
locations,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.980
really around the world.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.040
So I was in Mountain View, and
Ross was actually in our

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.250
London studio.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.430
And we're trying to pretend like
we are actually operating

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.550
the same equipment together.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.300
And it all kind of worked out.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.680
Number three, actually there
were some challenges.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.270
So we had very memorable
moments.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.880
We had to film the show
twice, and then

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.530
edit it for many hours.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.300
So it was painful, but
it was worth it.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.020
And I really encourage
you to check out

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.140
that API if you haven't.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.730
With that, I'll hand
it over to Ibrahim.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.350
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Yes.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.770
I actually picked as well from--
it was a Broadcast

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.310
Yourself video.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.520
And I was talking about the
Live Streaming API.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.800
And we wanted to give a demo
to show how it was easy to

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.210
just go to live.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.940
And I wanted to stream from
my Android device.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.770
But I was real scared, because
I was going a public network

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.800
that everyone was
already on it.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.420
And we had an aha moment that
it's not going to work.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.650
But it really worked.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.510
And that was a great
moment for me.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.290
Why don't we just take
a look and see it?

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.000
-In this.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.850
And I will start streaming
right now.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.210
And it looks like I
started streaming.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.090
So let's see on the
YouTube website.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.950
This time I will just click.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.815
And my event is about
to start.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.410
Let's give a few seconds.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.240
-Give it a couple of seconds.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.160
It looks like the demo gods
are being favorable today.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.260
Can we blame the network?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.660
-Sorry?

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.730
-Can we blame the network?

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.450
-Yeah, sure.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.320
Why not?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.080
-Give us a couple of seconds.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.330
And--

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.040
-No.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.230
I/O '13 was actually--

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.940
the question was, if
I was streaming to

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.370
I/O '13 or this event.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.780
As I just did here, actually,
seemed to do a

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.240
live streaming event.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.600
I/O '13 was when I used it
from my Java Eclipse.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.830
So today I showed the Eclipse.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.390
But you are free to use the
language of your choice, as

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.820
well as something
is happening.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.280
And yep, you are live.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.705
-There we go.

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.630
We should get the audience on.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.330
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.097
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Yeah,
in this one, this

00:13:21.097 --> 00:13:23.220
was our product manager.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.153
He decided to cover me up with--
rather than not being

00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:28.482
happy with me, saying, oh maybe
the network is not on in

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:29.732
this moment.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.370
But as a side note, actually,
it makes my civic platform

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.280
more available, all the way down
to 100 subscribers now.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.020
And I really encourage you to
use the Live Streaming API.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.610
And we really want to see
amazing apps built on the Live

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.510
Streaming API.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.460
And by saying that, I want
to hand it back to Ikai.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.350
IKAI LAN: All right.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.905
So everyone here has shown some
really cool videos with

00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:57.270
some really good content.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.210
One of my favorite I/O
talks is the one

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.320
Darryl was talking about.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.890
So that's on our playlist.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.500
And you can get to
our playlist at

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.670
youtube.com/youtubedev.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.630
My favorite part from
that playlist is--

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.020
there a few different parts.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.080
And Darryl and I debated a
little bit about that.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.020
There was one bit where we're
talking about cute baby

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.850
annotations.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.360
And there's another really funny
bit about Kim Jong Il.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.930
So definitely, if you haven't
seen the semantic annotations

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.030
talk, I double recommend
that talk.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.250
So I'm going to show you guys
another clip from I/O. There's

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.540
no meat in this content.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.170
This is purely just fluff.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.110
I'm only here for comic
relief, as this

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.760
clip will show you.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.266
So why don't we go ahead
and run this clip?

all the goodies, right?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.180
We call that the Oprah moment.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.380
And today, I'm happy to announce
that you get a

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.650
and you get a YouTube.

in this audience.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.575
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:55.895
It's good to see your energy
level is still up.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.020
I like that.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.680
You've had a lot of learning
thrown at you.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.760
And you're going to have some
more thrown at you today.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.240
My name is Ikai Lan.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.950
I'm a member of the YouTube
Developer Relations team.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.890
I'm based out of
New York City.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.800
Today we're going to be talking
about best practices

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.800
when working with mobile
platforms and the YouTube API.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.600
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.480
IKAI LAN: That's just the intro
to the I/O talk, where

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.380
I'm talking about mobile
best practices.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.210
Which really is kind of a pile
on onto the show Yarek was

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.290
talking about, using the
Android player API.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.440
So I was nervous at that
one for different

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.140
reasons then Ibrahim.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.340
I can't blame the Wi-Fi
if my jokes fall flat.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.630
So I think that's--

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.250
yeah, right?

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.030
So there you have it.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.730
There are some of our
favorite moments.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.260
It's really hard to pick.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.360
So a little bit of ego there,
of what I call humble brag.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.850
And that was my clip.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.160
So Jeff.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.700
JEFF POSNICK: It's been really
great having everybody in New

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.710
York for this show.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.850
And I'd actually want
to reiterate

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.220
what Ikai had mentioned.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.690
We put together a playlist that
collects all the videos

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.690
that we featured on this show.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.640
So there's a link to that
playlist from our main

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.960
youtube.com/youtubedev
channel.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.440
Be sure to subscribe
to that channel.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.670
And also, I'd recommend
subscribing to

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.100
youtube.com/googledevelopers
as well.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.340
We'll put video annotations on
this video, linking to all the

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.670
individual shows.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.340
So that you could get to them
more easily when you're

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.560
watching this.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.010
And just as always, going to
plug the fact that Google

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.540
Developer Relations is hiring.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.870
I do not know that we have more
room in this studio for

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.620
another team member.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.650
I guess that's kind
of a nice--

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.380
AMANDA: You need to build
a bigger studio.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.120
JEFF POSNICK: It's the kind
of nice problems to solve.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.360
To have such a big team that
we need more space.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.130
So if you're interested in
learning more about what we

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:51.460
do, you could go to
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.150
And that's it for this
week's show.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.670
It's been great having
everybody here.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.920
And bye, everybody.
