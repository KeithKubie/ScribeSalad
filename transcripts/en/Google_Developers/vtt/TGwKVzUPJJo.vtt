00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:03.560
RETO MEIER: Hi, I'm Reto Meier.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm a developer
advocate at Google,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.180
I'm joined here today by the
director of Android Wear, Dave

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.940
Singleton.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.726
Hi, Dave, thank you
for joining us today.

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:12.100
DAVID SINGLETON:
It's a pleasure.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.624
RETO MEIER: So we heard all
about some of the new features

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.540
from Android Wear at the
keynote this morning.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.160
I was wondering if
you could tell us,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.784
what are some of the
biggest highlights

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:21.050
from your perspective?

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.174
DAVID SINGLETON: Yes, so
today's been really great.

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:25.270
This is our second time
as part of the keynote

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.190
at Google I/O. Last
year, obviously,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.110
we announced that
we were working on

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.620
Android Wear, and also the
first couple of devices.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.010
So what's been
really great today

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.260
is that we really
gave an update.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.410
And we also talked about
some of the new capabilities

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.460
of one of our latest updates.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.380
So in terms of the
update we gave,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.200
it's been really great
over the last year

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.710
to see the diversity of designs,
and devices, and applications

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.430
coming out, which
really gives everyone

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.020
who wants to use an Android
Wear watch a lot of choice.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.950
So when we announced last
year, we had two models.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.830
And we now have seven, with
some others in the works.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.190
So it's really cool to have
lots of different shapes

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.970
and sizes of watch available.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.570
And also apps-- so
this time last year,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.480
we'd been working with
just a few folks that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.380
had been helping us to make
sure we had the right API's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.379
in place, and that we
were thinking about things

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:25.370
the right way.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.180
Today, we were able
to announce that we've

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.850
got over 40,000 apps
specifically designed

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.720
for Android Wear.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
It's been really great to see
how much innovation developers

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.860
have brought to the platform.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.510
I think it's really exciting.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.134
This is kind of the
first time that you

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:42.060
can wear a general-purpose
computer on your wrist.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.880
And by using the same tools
and the same API's that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.914
exist on Android for
phones and tablets,

00:01:47.914 --> 00:01:49.830
I think that's pretty
powerful for developers.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.470
At least, that's what I
thought before we launched.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.320
It's pretty powerful that folks
could just kind of imagine

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.840
what they want to do with the
completely new form factor,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.420
and hopefully do
it really quickly.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.620
And it's amazing to see
everything that's out there.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.590
So some of what we talked
about in the keynote today

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.750
were some of the
apps that we've seen,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.280
that really get us excited
because they take advantage

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.199
of a lot of those capabilities.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.190
One that I love is called
Golf Swing Analyzer,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.890
and it uses the accelerometer
and the gyroscope

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.277
in your watch to kind
of track your swing.

00:02:17.277 --> 00:02:18.360
It's actually really cool.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.446
So you start it.

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.570
It says, stand at the ball.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.150
And you start taking a swing.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.920
It realizes
automatically that you've

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.110
started to take your swing.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.660
And then it records the whole
accelerometer gyro path.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.451
And then you can play
it back in your phone

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.330
to see how well you're doing.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.900
I'm pretty bad at golf.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.500
RETO MEIER: Not for long, right?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.960
DAVID SINGLETON:
Hopefully that's the case.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.740
So that's an example.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.110
But I think maybe something
that folks watching this

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.609
might be most
interested in are some

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.630
of the new capabilities
of the platform

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630
that we talked
about on stage today

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.150
and we're just releasing in
an update that's rolling out.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.250
It's on some devices
already, and it's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.833
rolling out to the
rest of the devices

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.800
over the next few weeks.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.110
I think the most exciting
feature is something

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.400
we call Always On apps.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.920
So it's been possible
with Android Wear watches

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.589
since the beginning to
have an always-on display.

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.130
So it was either on by default
or something you could enable,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.620
so that you can always just
glance down and look at time.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.010
And obviously, at
the end of last year,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.390
we opened that up to
developers because we publish

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.760
the API's for watch faces.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.700
And there are over 1,500 watch
faces, which is really cool.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.140
Because you can have designs
that help express your style.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.935
But also, if you're
an app developer who

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:30.575
has some really
interesting information

00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:32.150
that the user cares about,
you can put that right

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.600
on the watch face.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.760
So that's really cool.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.260
But what we have on
ice today is Always

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.950
On apps for regular apps.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.360
So you can take an application
like Maps or Citymapper--

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.660
things that the user
starts the application,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.240
and you know that
they're still going

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.430
to want to refer back to it.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.790
They're still kind of involved
in this ongoing activity

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.640
in the real world.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600
And you can actually
make your app stay

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.640
in the foreground, even when
the user drops their wrist

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.409
and their device goes back in
to the low-power, ambient mode.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.200
And we showed a bunch
of examples on stage,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.575
but I think that
something that's

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.092
going to be really
exciting for developers.

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:09.550
RETO MEIER:
Absolutely, I mean, one

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.300
of the things you were
saying this morning

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.170
was that you can have
full-blown apps effectively

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.149
running on the watch
device itself, which

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.360
seems like it's an awesome
opportunity for developers

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.760
to create things which are
more than just an extension

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.410
of an app that
runs on the phone,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.046
but something which is unique
to this different form factor.

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:30.170
When it comes to sort of
the senses and things that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.750
are on the device, do you think
we've kind of hit a plateau

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.080
in terms of the sorts of things
we're going to find on devices?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.580
Or is this something
that you expect

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.352
is going to continue to expand?

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:39.810
DAVID SINGLETON:
I definitely don't

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.893
think we've hit a plateau.

00:04:40.893 --> 00:04:45.060
I think that when we started
thinking about Android Wear

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.070
and what we could
do in this space,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.070
we realized that all
technology that we were seeing

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.170
in phones and tablets
was on this amazing path

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.440
of miniaturization.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.440
And that really, last
year was the first time

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.040
that you could put
everything together

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.690
into a package that
was small enough

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.190
and power-efficient enough
to wear on your body all day

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.520
long, and have it continue
to work all day long.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.090
And a lot of the sensors
that are in today's devices

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.790
obviously started
in mobile phones,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.990
where they had to be
low-power and small.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.700
But now that there's
this kind of explosion

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.480
in wearable devices,
I think we're

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.780
going to see a lot more
innovation in the sensors

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.220
that you would have here.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.775
And I'm really excited
by some of the technology

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:30.520
that you hear about
in research labs

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.935
and in even computer science
and engineering departments

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:35.310
in universities
around the world,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.260
and how those will now start
to become miniaturized, and go

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.244
into wearable devices.

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:40.160
It's going to be cool.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.000
RETO MEIER: That's incredible.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.720
I mean, what do you think?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.320
If you're a developer
and you're out there

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.220
and you think, this is
kind of interesting,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.595
what do you think
are the biggest

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.506
opportunities for someone
who's thinking maybe

00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:51.005
I want to move past
the smartphones.

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:53.720
I want to move into
something completely new.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.500
Maybe this wearable
thing is a thing.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.390
What are the biggest
opportunities,

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.640
do you think, for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.350
DAVID SINGLETON:
Right, so I actually

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.980
think that the Always
On apps' functionality

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.630
that we announced
today is actually

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.460
probably one of the biggest
opportunities for developers

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.020
in this space to have
come along any time,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.660
really, since we
started the platform.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.410
Because if you think
about it, if you

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.550
want to build a
special-purpose wearable

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.030
for a specific
application-- for instance,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.270
maybe you want to have a
remote control that figures out

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.660
which room of your house you're
in, and controls your lighting

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.486
or your TV or whatever.

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:31.610
That's a really great idea.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.068
Wouldn't it be
awesome if you could

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:35.570
build a dedicated
wearable that does that?

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.480
And I think a couple years ago,
maybe even just a year ago, you

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.690
would have had to hire a design
team, an industrial design

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.630
team, an electrical
engineering team,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.470
or somehow find people that
had all of those skills.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.800
And you'd have to probably do
it a Kickstarter, some kind

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.700
of crowd funding to get
your initial seed capital,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.252
fund manufacturing, go through
multiple runs of iteration,

00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.710
just to produce the device so
that you could bring that use

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.970
case to life.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.030
But with Always On apps,
you can take advantage

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.010
of all of the
sensors, and the fact

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.360
that you have a general-purpose
compute platform here,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.670
and have your applications
stay in the foreground

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.720
the whole time while the user's
engaged in that activity.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.650
And so for that
example I suggested,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.570
it would be possible to build a
remote-control application that

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.450
maybe starts when you tap your
watch as you enter your home,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.160
and then just stays
there all the time.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.610
And so you actually can
turn your watch from a watch

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.245
that you could go in and do very
quick interactions on-- which

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:34.119
is still a very core
part of the Android Wear

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:37.080
experience-- into a watch
that, when you want it to,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.420
can become this very special
purpose device for as long

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.490
as you need it to be.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.340
And for developers, I think
that means you go from the idea

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.250
that these use
cases are important,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.140
or this particular
problem you want to solve

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.450
is valuable, to a real,
fully fledged special purpose

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.576
device really quickly.

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:56.950
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.530
And I'm really excited to see
what people are going to build

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.460
on top of these API's.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.890
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.598
It seems like there's
a great opportunity

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:03.932
to weave this wearable computing
stuff into the internet

00:08:03.932 --> 00:08:05.848
of things things which
we heard about as well,

00:08:05.848 --> 00:08:06.850
with Brillo and Weave.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.390
DAVID SINGLETON:
Right, definitely

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.460
very excited about that.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.670
So a lot of what
they've announced

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.060
are making some of the
processes of getting

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.740
set up with internet of things
devices really seamless.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.115
And I'm excited about how
watches and other kinds of form

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:24.781
factors of wearable are going to
be able to work that over time.

00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:26.750
It's definitely going
to be a great area

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.404
to see people innovating.

00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:29.320
RETO MEIER: Fantastic.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.720
Thank you so much for
coming and speaking with us.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.600
I feel like I have to ask
you before you leave us.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.280
What Android Wear watch are
you wearing at the moment?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.690
DAVID SINGLETON: So right
now, I'm wearing the Moto 360.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.950
This is the one that I was
wearing on the stage earlier.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.780
I love the Moto 360.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.460
In fact, you see the band here?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.690
This is a nice,
Horween leather band,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.790
but I've actually
had it laser etched

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.810
with a little Android of my
own, which was a lot of fun.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.220
The watch that we were doing
the demos on on stage today

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.150
is the LG Watch Urbane,
which was the latest

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.972
one to come to market.

00:09:02.972 --> 00:09:04.930
And it's really great
just to see the diversity

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.905
of designs and styles.

00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:08.280
RETO MEIER: All right, thank
you very much for your time.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.404
DAVID SINGLETON: Thank you.

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:11.500
It's been great talking.
