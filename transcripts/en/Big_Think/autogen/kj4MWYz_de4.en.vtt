I think one of the really scary and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
I think one of the really scary and
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.440
I think one of the really scary and
overwhelming things about terrorism can

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
overwhelming things about terrorism can
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600
overwhelming things about terrorism can
be the idea that it's this giant

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
be the idea that it's this giant
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.629
be the idea that it's this giant
boogeyman that is really difficult to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
boogeyman that is really difficult to
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.940
boogeyman that is really difficult to
comprehend and is terrifying and comes

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950
comprehend and is terrifying and comes
 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.950

along in the night out of nowhere and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
along in the night out of nowhere and
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.319

away and for me my life's work has

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
away and for me my life's work has
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.450
away and for me my life's work has
really been understanding the small

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
really been understanding the small
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.850
really been understanding the small
logical puzzle pieces that when taken

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860
logical puzzle pieces that when taken
 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.690
logical puzzle pieces that when taken
together create that boogeyman so that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
together create that boogeyman so that
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
together create that boogeyman so that
you can take it apart into manageable

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
you can take it apart into manageable
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410
you can take it apart into manageable
pieces and actually begin to understand

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
pieces and actually begin to understand
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.740
pieces and actually begin to understand
what drives these inconceivable actions

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
what drives these inconceivable actions
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.229
what drives these inconceivable actions
so when you take this overwhelming

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
so when you take this overwhelming
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.810
so when you take this overwhelming
boogeyman of terrorism and you begin to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
boogeyman of terrorism and you begin to
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790
boogeyman of terrorism and you begin to
tease it apart based on the data and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
tease it apart based on the data and
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.430
tease it apart based on the data and
look for patterns that turn up again and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
look for patterns that turn up again and
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040
look for patterns that turn up again and
again each time a terrorist plot is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
again each time a terrorist plot is
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.090
again each time a terrorist plot is
planned in a different territory

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
planned in a different territory

planned in a different territory
throughout the historical data you begin

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
throughout the historical data you begin
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.279
throughout the historical data you begin
to notice patterns that might not seem

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
to notice patterns that might not seem
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.729
to notice patterns that might not seem
obvious to begin with so things like the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
obvious to begin with so things like the
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950
obvious to begin with so things like the
percentage beneath livable wage that a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
percentage beneath livable wage that a
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929
percentage beneath livable wage that a
border guard gets paid which of course

gives rise to the possibility of

accepting a bribe to let somebody just
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.580
accepting a bribe to let somebody just
sneak across the border or hand a

sneak across the border or hand a
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160
sneak across the border or hand a
package to you if that bribe is the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
package to you if that bribe is the
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.319

there are strategies for taking

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109
there are strategies for taking
 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.340
there are strategies for taking

without those strategies in place it can

without those strategies in place it can
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.900
without those strategies in place it can
seem very jarring and we experience that

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
seem very jarring and we experience that
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.700
seem very jarring and we experience that
even in a mature democracy like ours

another example would be the ratio of

another example would be the ratio of

another example would be the ratio of
hookah bars to madrasas and there you

hookah bars to madrasas and there you
 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.210
hookah bars to madrasas and there you
begin to see you know tensions between

50% in that youth demographic there's a
 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.710
50% in that youth demographic there's a
big cultural rift there that can often

big cultural rift there that can often
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.470
big cultural rift there that can often
give rise to lack of understanding or

another really interesting one that we
 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.830
another really interesting one that we
see is how good machine translation is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840
see is how good machine translation is
