00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.219
Why doesn't this look right?

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.920
UNRESOLVED GESTALT!!!!!

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.750
Hey there intelligent designers, I'm Trace,
this is DNews.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.940
Your brain evolved to look at the natural
world, and you might think, what a mess!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.349
There's dirt and leaves and plants and stuff
scattered EVERYWHERE!

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.489
But that's not really true.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.460
When you look at a tree you don't see a branch,
and a leaf, and trunk -- you see a tree.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.929
But… why?

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.950
In 1912, in Germany, three psychologists named
Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.450
Koffka started the Gestalt Psychology movement.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.100
Gestalt means -- "placed," or "put together"
with the base idea being: "the whole of anything

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.880
is greater than its parts."

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.560
A great example of Gestalt psychology in action
is watching a movie.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.510
It's really a collection of still images,
but together, the still frames become so much

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.510
more.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.620
Another example is this… you see it as lights
moving around the marquee, but if you think

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.230
about it, you know that's not what is really
happening.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.869
If you were to look at one lightbulb, it simply
turns on, then off for a time, then on again.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.689
Our brains create the movement, and story.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630
That's not actually the reality.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.560
There are numerous Gestalt principles: Similarity,
Continuity, Prägnanz (simplicity), Symmetry,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.670
Closure, and Common Fate… just to name a
few.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.450
The law of Proximity or grouping: says our
brain groups things that are near each other,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.450
together.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.770
Unless of course, they're different, in which
case the law of Similarity: says we'll group

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.060
similar things first.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.450
We'll also assume because of the law of continuity
-- that the smoothest curve is the "correct"

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.759
path to follow7.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.340
Though, if that curve intersects another,
we'll see the overall group in it's simplest

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.049
form -- a.k.a. is Pragnanz.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.979
And of course, we prefer symmetry, we don't
see these as 1 2 2 1, but rather 2 2 2 -- our

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530
brain turns them into sets.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.359
Of course, you don't have to see anything
to perceive something.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.659
The principle of closure describes how your
brain does it for you…

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.060
like here in the "Implied Triangle" -- there's
no triangle there, but you see one.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.920
Then if this group moves, we assume they move
as one -- because of the principle of common

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.200
fate.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.720
All these things are ways our brain organizes
visual information.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.560
Over last century, psychologists and designers
have been studying how our brain perceives

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.250
the world around us, and the stories it tells
our conscious mind.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.890
That's important because how we see the world
affects decision-making, bias, causal reasoning,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.950
memory formation… you name it.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.140
Some would argue, perception is far more powerful
than reality.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.200
In fact, according a fascinating study in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.700
Sciences, these design principles are what
allow us to read.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.290
When humans look at words, we see them as
shapes.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.040
Grouping them, recognizing the shapes, and
following along with the lines on a page,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.730
or around in a circle along the curves.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.210
Think kinetic typography.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.840
You can follow what I'm saying, not because
you're reading it, but because of design understanding,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.540
psychology, and neural pattern recognition.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.340
When you're reading scrambled text, you're
still getting their shape, and using a bunch

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.540
of brain regions to process visual cues.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.980
Brains are awesome.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.180
Understanding how our brains organize visual
information is super important, because decoding

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.370
all that information takes EFFORT.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.370
It burns ENERGY.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.870
Maybe this is why we like well-designed spaces,
because it takes less cognitive resources

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.940
to understand them, or to accomplish tasks
while in them, but what do you think?
