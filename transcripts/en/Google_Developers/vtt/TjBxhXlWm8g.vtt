00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.030
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the stage, President

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:04.150

Great China, Scott Beaumont.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:13:02.530
SCOTT BEAUMONT:
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.930
OK, time to change channel.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.120
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.370
It's great to see you all here.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.650
And as I said, one of
the things that I really

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.920
love doing when I'm in China
is traveling the country.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.200
You really get to see the signs
of progress, the innovation,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.360
and the pace of change.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.960
And actually, the
developer community,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.510
you're here in the room
and the live stream.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.370
This is what you represent.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.500
And today is actually
part the day's

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.310
to celebrate your achievements
and to congratulate all of you,

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.640
and to give you the
opportunity to mix together.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.970
It's also an opportunity
to talk to you

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.300
about how Google can help
you develop your ideas

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.427
and can help you go global.

00:13:52.427 --> 00:13:54.260
And we're going to
explore that a great deal

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.090
over the course of today
and the breakout sessions.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.840
For those of you who
work with us already,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.180
hopefully we inspire you
to even greater heights,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.480
and for those of you
who don't know us yet,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.870
today should be a good day.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.326
OK, first off, let's
talk a little bit

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:12.950
about something you
all know very well,

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.010
which is digital China.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.040
It's said that every
seven minutes in China,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.300
a new business is created,
and 50% of those businesses

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.730
are digital only.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.890
We live in a market where over
half the population is online,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.880
and 92% are using the web
through their mobile devices.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.920
And actually the great
majority of those

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.400
are using the web only
via their mobile phone,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.960
or their mobile phone as their
preferred method of access.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.170
We live in a market which
is one of the biggest

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.260
markets worldwide in
terms of app installs.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.220
Our users aren't just
idly, casually browsing.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.060
They're using the phone
to engage and to transact

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.120
in huge numbers.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.910
Just look recently, for
one example, Singles' Day.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.270
Again, this year, huge
growth, an astonishing event

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.310
on a global scale.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.020
83% of all the transactions
on Singles' Day

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.360
were via the mobile phone.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.120
If you were compare that
to Black Friday or Cyber

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.730
Monday in the US, the
corresponding number is 35%.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.720
Why is this important?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720
You know this already.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.350
It's important because
when you think about it,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.400
you are developing in one
of the most advanced markets

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.040
in the world with some of
the most advanced consumers

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.580
in the world.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.230
And so you are
ready to go global.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.570
When you look at app
usage around the world,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.110
app usage is doubling
year on year.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.070
Users are spending about
an hour a day in apps,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.910
and when you combine
that with high growth

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:59.060
that we see in markets such as
Indonesia or Brazil or India

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.590
or Vietnam, there is huge
opportunity for all of you

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.600
to take your ideas beyond China.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.080
And we're going to explore some
of the products, the tools,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.450
the services that you can
use from Google to help

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.150
you do that today.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.410
We're going to talk about
things like Sand Hill.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.970
Sand Hill is a
project within Google

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.670
where we connect with the
venture capital community

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.676
and we explore with
them their investments

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:26.300
and think about which
of the developers

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.990
they're working with could
benefit from Google's tools,

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.120
the goal being for
the entrepreneur

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.350
to go bigger, faster, cheaper,
so actually your equity

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.400
is worth an awful lot more.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.050
We're going to have a panel
on that later on today.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.010
I could talk to you
also about 5miles.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.300
5miles is a developer
based here in Beijing,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.190
actually co-located now
in the US, a great team.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.090
They have a mobile
classifieds app.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.510
But their browse
product wasn't as good,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.010
and it was causing
a lot of leakage.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.343
They couldn't convert people
from their first impression

00:17:03.343 --> 00:17:06.290
of 5miles into the app.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.420
And so we worked with
5miles and we created what

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.030
we call a progressive web app.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.500
And it creates an app-like
experience in the browser.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.770
The results were startling.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.390
The bounce rates halved,
and the conversion rates

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.920
increased by over 60%.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.180
Even outside of product,
we hope we can be useful.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.500
I could talk to
your about MeToo.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.240
MeToo is a photo editing app
that many of you no doubt use.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.770
They were interested
in Indonesia

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.670
as one of those high
growth markets, very

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.990
mobile ready markets, but
they don't know anything

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.110
about Indonesia.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.180
We were able to put them
in contact with our team

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.700
on the ground to give them a
little bit of insight in terms

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.500
of the operating environment,
the regulatory situation, how

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.080
users interacted with devices,
where to find those users, what

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.994
those users might cost.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.410
And as a result
of that, they were

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.140
able to make a far more
educated decision in terms of

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.000
whether or not Indonesia
was right for them.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.832
These examples and
more you're going

00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:11.290
to hear throughout the keynote
and throughout the different

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.980
break outs during the day.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.130
It's really a celebration
of your entrepreneurship.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.340
Actually, I'm going to
give you one more example.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.450
And actually, I'm going
to focus on gaming.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.550
To be honest, I
have lots of choice.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.844
Chinese app developers
lead the way,

00:18:29.844 --> 00:18:32.010
whether it's more about
lifestyle apps, productivity

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.150
apps, entertainment apps.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.650
But gaming, in particular,
is a very hot area.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.900
We've seen 150% growth
in mobile gaming revenues

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.180
over the last two years,
and it is actually

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.270
an entertainment giant.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.330
It's 2 and 1/2 times the
size of the movie business.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.350
A lot of this, of course, is
built on the Android platform,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.450
which is the most scaled
platform globally,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.750
and actually within Android
as a way of reaching users,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.410
you have Google Play, which
can reach consumers in over 190

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.430
markets worldwide.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.710
ELEX knew that.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.330
ELEX, the creators
of Clash or Kings,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.680
built their app in China, for
China-- a multiplayer game,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.837
fantastic fun.

00:19:15.837 --> 00:19:17.670
But they can actually
see that actually they

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.350
can connect with consumers
all around the world.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.120
And they've done so
to tremendous effect.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.940
In fact, let's hear
from them directly.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.328
Let's play the video.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.180
SCOTT BEAUMONT: Very good.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.920
It's stories like these that
really inspire us and motivate

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.130
the teams within Google.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:04.526
So it's-- hopefully
you can still see me.

00:22:04.526 --> 00:22:05.900
And there are many
more examples.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.290
And you saw some of the
products and services

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.195
that we brought
to bear for ELEX.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.820
You're going to hear
from Ben and Naomi

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.430
about still more of
those as we go forward.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.450
Before I hand over, let
me just reflect again,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.630
thank you all for coming,
welcome you here, and also

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.050
remind you the GDD
events, the developer

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.870
events we run both here
in Beijing and Shanghai,

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.300
or the events we run
in China generally

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.400
are the largest
such events that we

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.240
run the whole of Asia-pacific.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.450
As a consequence of that,
you've got a lot of Googlers

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.050
in the room.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.300
You've got Googlers in the
room from our local offices

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.590
here in Shanghai and Beijing,
you have team members

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.820
from around Asia, and you've
got a lot of our product team

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.260
also, across from the US.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.560
Please take advantage of it.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.620
Speak to us.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.880
What do you need?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.080
What's the killer feature
that you are missing?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.340
What is the product
that you'd like to see?

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.620
What does the niggle that
you have in the everyday

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.780
that you would like
to see corrected?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.850
Talk to us.

your ideas to life

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.450
and we want to
help you go global.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.150
Very good.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.020
Shall we get started?

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.060

begin our product journey.

Please welcome to

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.440
and Product Management, Google

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.470
BEN GALBRAITH: Pleasure to be
here with you this morning.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.300
[CHINESE] Ben.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.020
That's all the Chinese I
can manage this morning.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.640
It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.990
I've had the opportunity
to visit China three

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.440
times this year.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.840
And I have loved coming here.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.560
In fact, recently
this past summer,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.960
I was able to bring my
wife and our eight children

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.002
to travel throughout East Asia.

00:24:33.002 --> 00:24:36.200
Thank you.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.570
My family would spend their
days learning mandarin

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.690
in immersion school while
I met with developers.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.860
And then in the evenings
we'd get together

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.110
and experience the
wonders of China

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.730
and other countries
in the region.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.010
It's well known that
the Chinese developer

00:24:55.010 --> 00:25:02.290
community is world class in
your talent and your skill.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.960
But I've been particularly
impressed in the time

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.670
that I've spent here with the
warmth and the friendliness

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.270
of the people that I've met.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:17.250
It's truly a pleasure for me to
be able to spend time with you.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.640
And I wish that those of
you on the live stream

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.060
could be here with me as well.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.670
We're on a mission at Google
to make developers successful,

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.260
to help them succeed
at what they're doing.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.720
And we've been investing
in helping developers here

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.220
in China.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:42.920
For example, back in May we
partnered with Youku and LeTV

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.850
to stream our Google I/O
Keynote here in China.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.630
And over 1 million
of you tuned in

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.770
to hear our latest
announcements.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:59.390
I was thrilled with the
participation that we saw.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.170
We also have many local
events and training programs

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.360
happening on the ground here.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.440
You can stay connected to all of
this through our WeChat account

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.690
called Google Developers.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.600
We've really enjoyed having
this channel to stay connected

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.190
with the developer community.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.710
Our teams have absolutely
loved using it.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.110
Please, follow along with us.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:25.540
I think we have a QR code for
it that we'll show in a moment.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.380
So you can follow
right now on WeChat.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.620
I'm also pleased to announce
this morning that we've just

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.280
launched three developer
sites on China domains,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.930
each with content in
simplified Chinese.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.280
And we've created a section that
showcases the technologies that

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.610
are most relevant to
local Chinese developers,

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.010
and that showcase our
local developer programs.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.840
And we're also
announcing this morning

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.170
that we're bringing our Google
Developer agency program here

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.930
to China, which
offers certifications

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.870
to those agencies that are
building the highest quality

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.090
apps.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.130
And I think it's going to be
a great way for us to connect

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.790
top quality development shops
with businesses that are

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.180
looking for a trusted partner.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.770
This is just a
sampling of what we're

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:24.870
doing to support Chinese
businesses and developers.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.140
Now I want to shift gears
and talk to you about some

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.370
of the technologies that
we've been working on.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.950
I want to start with the web.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.860
So for the past
year or so, we've

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.050
been focused on making the
web fantastic on mobile.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.410
This is about expanding
the web's capabilities

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:52.210
and it's also about making
the web really fast.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.700
Now, we've done a ton
of work in this area,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.750
including enhancing our
own Chrome web browser,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.910
working with web
standards bodies,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.780
and launching many, many new
products to help developers.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.160
This morning, I want to focus
on two of these initiatives

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.190
that we've launched to
help web developers.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.220
First, we've worked together
with the web community

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.820
to develop and promote something
that we call Progressive Web

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.576
Apps, or PWAs, for short.

00:28:22.576 --> 00:29:09.810
[AUDIO OUT]

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.240
In addition to
service workers, PWAs

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.990
include many other
notable, new capabilities.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.130
I'm going to go
through a few of them.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.710
One, it gives you native-like
background notifications,

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.290
and these work even when
the browser is closed,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.610
which brings that up to
par with native apps.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.280
PWAs also give your
users a new, easy way

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.970
to add an icon shortcut
to your web experience

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.820
to their launcher, just
like with native apps,

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.580
and it's one of the things that
helps users keep coming back

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.690
to these PWA experiences.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.290
They also offer a new
sign in experience

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.720
that enables web sessions
to persist much longer

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.600
than before, similar
to with native apps,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.100
so users don't have to log in
as often into your experience.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.830
And they integrate with
the new web payments

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.790
API, which gives us
a powerful new way

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.240
to make buying things through
a web browser really friction

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.630
free and really easy.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:17.940
In addition to these benefits,
PWAs use HDTPS all the time

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.010
for enhanced security.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.870
And if you do it
right, they can have

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.650
buttery smooth, 60
frames per second updates

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.530
to your user interface, which
makes them really, really

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.610
fun to use.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.030
And they can resize
gracefully to displays

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.460
of all shapes and sizes.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.850
PWAs are truly the next
generation of the web.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.260
Developers who have made PWAs
are seeing great results.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.580
Scott just told you about 5miles
which is a great case study.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.730
I want to talk to
you about Alibaba.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.030
We're all familiar with
Alibaba's incredible success

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.820
worldwide in over 200 countries.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.200
They're one of many world
class Chinese innovators.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.230
They recently
built a PWA, and it

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.370
led to a 76% increase
in conversion

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.870
for their web users, which
is a fantastic improvement.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.860
And because they
implemented features

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.440
like Add to Homescreen, and use
the push notifications that I

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.240
described, they've brought
their re-engagement

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.000
a measure of how often
users keep coming back

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.960
to that experience on the
web up to the same level

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.530
as it was for their native app.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.429
All right, so that's PWAs.

00:31:36.429 --> 00:31:38.220
The second initiative
I want to talk to you

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.840
about is called
Accelerated Mobile Pages.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.720
We just call it AMP for short.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.900
And while PWA was
about expanding

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.630
the capabilities
of web browsers,

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.450
AMP is really more
about streamlining

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.340
what we do with
the web to deliver

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:03.630
a trimmed down, open source web
format that loads instantly.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.500
It works by defining
a subset of HTML

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.270
and using web
components to create

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:17.370
a set of HTML that loads
without blocking on any network

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.610
resources.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.380
So it shows up instantly, and
the images and JavaScript load

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.820
asynchronously, and you're
guaranteed when you use AMP

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.160
that none of these
resources, as they load,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.210
will cause the web page
to have to repaint itself.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.952
We call it a reflow when it
has to lay itself out again

00:32:35.952 --> 00:32:37.410
because something
that's loaded has

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.320
caused it to change its layout.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.620
As a result, these things
create just a really fast, fast,

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.510
fast experience
that pulls users in.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.960
We found that over
700,000 domains are now

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.200
serving at least
AMPed page, and it's

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.130
compatible with more than 70 eds
and analytic solutions, which

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.930
are important as you
monetize and measure

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.230
what's happening on your site.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:08.630
Many popular web platforms like
WordPress, Drupal, Squarespace,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:12.440
and Shopify, have integrated
AMP into their platforms, which

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.290
makes it super easy for
you to take your content

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.260
and make it AMP compatible.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.500
And these are just web pages,
so anyone can host them.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.770
But we've created something
called the Google AMP

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.850
Cache, which is a
free, global caching

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.980
service for all AMP content.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.930
Anyone can use this
thing, and it's

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.890
another one of the ingredients
that makes AMP really fast,

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.650
because when they're
hosted with this cache,

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.410
pages load even faster than if
users pull them from the origin

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:42.910
servers.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.200
We're seeing a lot of industry
adoption of AMP pages,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.020
with sites like Bing,
Twitter, Pinterest,

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.930
and of course our own Google
Search linking to AMP pages

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.950
and using the AMP
cash when available.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.520
We're also continuing
to evolve AMP.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.420
We're working with e-commerce
companies such as eBay

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.330
to take what we've done and
to expand its capabilities

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:11.514
to work even better in
domains like e-commerce.

00:34:11.514 --> 00:34:12.889
And one of my
favorite sayings is

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.219
that we've integrated
AMP and PWAs together

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.170
which, when you think
about it, is a pretty

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.570
compelling combination.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:25.389
Because with AMP we can serve
a page instantly to users,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:29.139
super fast, and then while
users are browsing that content,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.699
we can load a PWA
in the background

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.719
and users can then convert
from the end page to the PWA

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.460
and have a rich,
interactive experience.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.810
It's a great way to
keep your users engaged.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.631
All right, so that's what
we're doing with the web.

00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:46.630
I want to talk to you a
little bit about Android

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.500
for a few minutes.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.320
It's really hard for me to wrap
my head around the sheer scale

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.070
of Android, whether
we're talking

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.940
about the users that
are engaged with it,

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.260
the number of devices
in the ecosystem,

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.010
or just its sheer
global presence.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.900
As Scott mentioned, it's the
most popular mobile operating

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.190
system in the world, with
over 1.4 billion people

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.030
engaging with it.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.460
And we're hard at work
at making Android better.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.200
And in August of
this year, we just

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.100
rolled out to consumers the
latest version of Android

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.037
called NuGet, in
a gradual rollout.

00:35:25.037 --> 00:35:26.870
I want to highlight
some of the new features

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.790
that this release brings
with it, because it's

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.480
got a lot of great stuff for
both consumers and developers.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.510
These features include
multi windows support,

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:39.130
which is a feature
that enables users

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:42.560
to run two apps on the screen at
the same time in a split screen

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.730
mode.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.520
It also gives enhanced
notifications.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.790
And by this, I mean
we now support actions

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.582
in a standard way within
the notifications,

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.873
it's easier than ever for
developers to change the look

00:35:53.873 --> 00:35:56.810
and feel of these notifications,
and related notifications are

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.055
bundled together with NuGet.

00:36:00.055 --> 00:36:02.180
I also want to talk to you
about enhanced DOS mode.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.910
So in Marshmallow, we introduced
something called DOS mode,

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.570
which is a low power state.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.420
When the device's
screen is off and it's

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.320
laying flat on a table, we
enter this special DOS mode

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.110
that saves battery.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.670
And with NuGet get we're
extending it further,

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.450
so that when the screen is off
but the device is in motion,

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:29.030
like in your pocket, we
trigger this low battery state.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.790
And finally, NuGet
includes Vulkan,

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.820
which is a new,
industry standard,

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.840
low level graphics API that
delivers advanced performance

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.800
on the latest hardware.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.830
NuGet also introduces
another major feature

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.520
I want to tell you about-- VR.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.290
So we've been playing
with VR for a while.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.750
Two years ago we launched
Google Cardboard,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.050
and it's done a fantastic
job at giving people

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:01.040
a taste of what VR can be like
through short form experiences

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.000
that work on iOS and Android.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.140
And frankly, the adoption
and success of Cardboard

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.270
has surpassed our expectations.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.710
So with NuGet, we're
introducing a new platform

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.960
that we call
Daydream, that takes

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.510
our vision of
affordable, ubiquitous VR

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.800
to the next level.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.130
Daydream is comprised
of three key elements.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.250
It introduces a standard
for new Android handsets

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.330
that ensures that they can
deliver immersive, high quality

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.370
VR experiences.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.610
It also includes a reference
design for a high quality VR

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:47.750
headset that's powered
by a Daydream handset,

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.380
and it includes a
reference design

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.440
for-- we call it
positionally aware controller

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.840
that knows where it
is, and that users

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.720
can use to engage in these
immersive virtual environments.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.050
We launched the first
Daydream compatible device,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.790
the Pixel Phone by Google,
earlier this year in the fall.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.120
And we also launched
our own Daydream headset

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.910
and controller.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:21.950
More devices are coming in early
2017 from partners like Waway,

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.350
and you can start developing
for Daydream today.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.330
We've also partnered
with younity

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.290
to make it easy for you
to create new, immersive,

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.230
virtual worlds for
people to engage with,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.870
and developers like NetEase
are already creating

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.730
apps for the Daydream platform.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.630
Out on the floor, we've
got a few Daydream headsets

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.140
out there.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.479
And I encourage you to go
out and engage with these

00:38:47.479 --> 00:38:48.270
and play with them.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.440
I think you'll find
they're really cool.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.430
All right, so the best way to
actually develop for Android

00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:00.380
is with Android Studio,
our official Android IDE.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.780
You can download it today
from the Android developer

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.180
site on the China domain
that we just launched.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.630
We recently updated Android
Studio to Version 2.2,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:16.310
and we focus these updates
around three major themes,

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.200
speed, smarts, and
Android platform support.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.770
I'll just summarize
these briefly.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.722
For speed, you can
develop faster,

00:39:26.722 --> 00:39:28.430
with a new feature
that we're introducing

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.940
called the New Layout Designer.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.180
Now, for ages, we've been
hand-coding our layouts

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.350
on Android, and this
designer makes it really,

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.110
really easy to create
complex layouts that

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.740
resize to all sorts of
different screen sizes,

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.880
and adapt to
orientation changes.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.270
And it does it with a new,
intuitive layout design

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.560
interface.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.510
It is really, really nice,
and you should check it out.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.770
In terms of smarter,
Android Studio 2.2

00:39:55.770 --> 00:40:00.320
includes out new ABK analyzer,
an enhanced layout inspector,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.310
expanded code analysis, the
latest IntelliJ features,

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.560
and much more.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.970
And finally, as the official
IDE for the Android platform,

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.780
Android Studio 2.2
includes support

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.740
for all the latest developer
features in Android NuGet,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.740
like code completion to help
you implement multi windows

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.220
support, or the
redesign notifications

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.450
that I talked to you about
in just a moment ago.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.520
And it includes
faster than ever,

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.060
built-in Android emulators for
you to test all this stuff out.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.670
Once you've made
a fantastic app,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:43.890
Google Play is the best way
to make your app available

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.760
globally.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.930
Google Play had more
than 65 billion apps

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:52.300
installed just last year.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.270
It's creating a phenomenal
market for Android developers

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.830
to build globally
successful businesses,

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.350
and as Scott mentioned
earlier, Chinese developers

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.590
are seeing great success
introducing their apps

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.140
to the global marketplace
through Google Play.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:18.030
With these updates to the web
and to the Android platform,

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.380
we're increasing the
capabilities of what

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.199
you can do on mobile devices.

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:26.490
I now want to talk to you a
little bit about what we're

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.890
doing to make it easier for
you to develop experiences

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.850
on top of these platforms.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.750
To do that, I'd like to
introduce a colleague of mine,

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.660
Naomi Black, to talk to you
about an open source project

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.210
that we've developed
at Google called

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:46.980
Angular that's received a lot
of traction here in China.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.510
With that, I'll turn
it over to Naomi.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.010
Thank you.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.100
SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.886
Please welcome to the stage,
lead for Angular, Naomi Black.

00:42:42.144 --> 00:43:03.320
NAOMI BLACK: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.820
I'm sorry.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.225
I'm missing some of my notes.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:37.260
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.450
Hi.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.810
I'm Naomi.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:45.260
I'm one of the leads on Google's
open source Angular project.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.120
Back in 2009, when client side
development was still new,

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.030
we created Angular
to help developers.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.620
Our goal was a
framework that could

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.990
make web development easier.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.570
Since then we've seen
tremendous growth with Angular,

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.090
with millions of developers
around the world,

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:06.320
and thousands and thousands of
apps built with the framework.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.540
In China, we know
Angular is well-loved.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.240
Visitors from China are
the second largest segment

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.090
of our developer population.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.600
Because of the enthusiasm of
the developer community here,

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.320
and thanks to our dedicated
team of Chinese contributors,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.550
this year we launched
Angular's first localized site,

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.260
angular.sn, where you
can find Chinese versions

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.150
of all our developer guides and
our growing WeChat community.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.810
We also have a Chinese
language talk this afternoon

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:42.550
on local adoption from our
China developer PM, [CHINESE],

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:48.820
with some of our partners, Hi-R
group, ZTEsoft, and [CHINESE],

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.570
presenting their
experience in Angular.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.150
To the many Angular
developers here today,

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.920
I want to say thank you.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.890
It is so exciting
to be here in China,

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:03.740
and we are here because of you.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.740
To those of you here who
don't know Angular yet,

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.950
let me introduce the framework,
our history, and some

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.970
of the problems we're solving.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:15.860
We started Angular seven
years ago as a framework

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.660
to make client side
developers more productive.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.800
Our team gained
years of experience

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.240
in knowing what it takes to
build and support a front end

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.520
framework and make it
fast and performant.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:32.690
The web has changed tremendously
since Angular began.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.030
This September we
released a new Angular,

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.142
rebuilt for modern
cross-platform development.

00:45:38.142 --> 00:45:39.850
Today I'm going to
cover what is included

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:42.040
in Angular for
developing applications,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.700
for mobile, desktop and web.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.820
So first, let me
talk about how we've

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.760
made Angular more modular by
better defining and Angular's

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.380
core.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.240
The core API has
provided a foundation

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.300
that you need to build all apps.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.510
Angular's core APIs include
declarative templating that

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:04.280
allows you to use standard
HTML and Angular markup

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.490
to create powerful
UIs, automatic change

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.570
detection, dependency
injection improved

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.300
from our pioneering
implementation in Angular 1,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.080
an intuitive component model
that allows you to structure

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.090
your apps with
reusable architecture

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.510
and natural separation
of concerns,

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.330
and our new compiler, which
is capable of static analysis,

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:29.080
giving you not only small
and fast apps, but also

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.340
improved error messaging
and automatic refactoring,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.610
the ability to swap
renderers, so you get true Dom

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.870
independence, and you can target
platforms where no Dom exists.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:44.320
And this is really
critical for mobile.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.474
Beyond these foundational
building blocks.

00:46:46.474 --> 00:46:47.890
There are many
more things that we

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.720
know most applications
will need,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.870
for example, UI components.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.360
We knew that we could make
developers more productive

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.770
by providing APIs
for these use cases.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.400
But we also wanted to
keep Angular flexible.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.440
So you can choose,
as developers,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.300
use our implementation,
you can write your own,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.570
or you can find
one of the options

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.760
out there in our
growing ecosystem.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.420
So among the additions
we have in Angular,

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.470
we now have Angular
material, which

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.530
is a tool of beautiful
design UI components

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:23.110
so you can go from ZeroApp
to Beautiful App really fast.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.260
We have IET and PIs for your
internationalization needs.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.590
We brought a
powerful forms module

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:34.570
for quickly developing user
input forms with validation.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.900
We have animations so that
your apps look and respond

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.150
with style, and users
will enjoy using them.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.510
And last, we have
ngUpgrade, which

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.490
allows you to mix and match
old and new Angular components

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.290
in the same application.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.680
So if you're one of the millions
of Angular 1 developers,

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.740
you can migrate
at your own pace.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.970
So I've talked about the
building blocks of Angular.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:02.030
What about all the other places
that you need your apps to run?

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.320
First, Angular is great
for progressive web apps.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.200
We have a full talk from
developer advocate Stephen

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.310
Fluin on this in the mobile
web track later today.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.100
And for many consumer
apps, an app store presence

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.220
is essential.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.600
So we've partnered with
Ionic and with Onsen UI, two

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.060
solutions that let you use
all of the goodness of web

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.220
technologies, but
then package that up

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.860
for the app store presence.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.780
If you prefer Native,
Telerik's NativeScript

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.590
works by swapping out our
renderer for one that can

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.990
render to a native mobile OS.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.260
And this is possible
because of Angular's Dom

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.010
independent renderer.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.760
Finally, for the desktop,
with GitHub's electron,

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.720
you can build in Angular
and take advantage

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.140
of all the machine resources.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.650
If you've used VS code,
that's an electron app.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.040
So as with native mobile,
there are more places

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.510
where there is no Dom.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.030
And we wanted Angular
to run there to you.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.090
So Angular now includes
server side rendering,

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.800
so that the server can
render our component's view.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.400
This currently works in
Node and asp.net today,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.180
and the new Angular can
deploy to many platforms.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.670
So I've talked about the
building blocks of Angular

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:18.870
and where your apps can run.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:23.190
But what about the tools
that you use as a developer?

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.040
You can write an Angular
application using

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.040
plain ES5 or ES6 JavaScript.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.480
But we think that
most developers

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.430
will want to use TypeScript.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:32.960
We like TypeScript
because it makes

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.790
it a lot easier
to write and think

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:37.730
about Angular applications.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.370
We actually used TypeScript
to write Angular ourselves.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.790
And I would love to tell you
the beautiful engineering

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.520
story that happened when
the love between our two

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.950
open source projects at
Microsoft and at Google

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.260
came together, but
I'm going to save that

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.410
for our TypeScript
in Angular talk

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.930
this afternoon, which
we are co-presenting

00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:01.010
in Chinese and in English, with
Microsoft engineer [CHINESE],

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.350
from the TypeScript team.

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:08.660
So why did Angular adopt
TypeScript for our own code?

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:12.320
First, we could write
code and find beds faster.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.420
The readability of
our code in TypeScript

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.230
was greatly improved.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.830
And this was critical because
we had many engineers working

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.050
together in many different
parts of the framework,

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.900
and they needed to
quickly understand what

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.280
the other engineers had done.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.556
They found they could
collaborate much more easily.

00:50:28.556 --> 00:50:29.930
And we found that
we could easily

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.192
build much better
tooling, like Angular CLI.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:40.070
So with Angular's command line
interface, you can type ngnew

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.110
and we'll create all
the scaffolding and all

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.101
the boilerplate
plate for you, so

00:50:44.101 --> 00:50:46.100
that when finally these
commands finish running,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.280
you can simply type ngsurf.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.950
Then you move over
to your local browser

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.730
and your app will magically
be there, fully functional,

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.850
so that you can focus
on application logic,

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.390
not on the boilerplate plate.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.370
The CLI is one way
that we're investing

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.060
in tooling, to make it easier
for you to write Angular code.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.410
We also provide Protractor,
which enables full end

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.140
to end testing.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:22.400
Angular and also works great
with your favorite IDE,

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.550
and will give you helpful error
messaging and refactoring tips.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:30.860
Last, our partners at
Rangel.io have built

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.500
a tool called Angular Augury.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.350
Augury gives you real time
insight into performance

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:37.920
and things like
routing in your app,

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.250
so you can debug and see
what's happening in your app

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.020
much faster.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.810
This is just a taste of what
the new Angular can do today

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.180
for mobile, desktop,
and the web,

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.779
and how we improve
developer productivity.

00:51:49.779 --> 00:51:52.070
We hope that you'll join us
in the sessions later today

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.590
to learn more, and look
for the Angular apps

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:58.620
on the app showcase
board on the third floor.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.410
So now I'd like to
introduce my colleague

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.590
Ben to come back on stage.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:03.474
[CHINESE]

00:52:09.767 --> 00:52:11.100
BEN GALBRAITH: Thank you, Naomi.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.465
That's fantastic.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:21.200
So as excited as I am about
all the new developments

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.990
that we've shared you this
morning around the Android

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:28.070
and the web, you know, it's
still quite a lot of work

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.920
to create a high quality
mobile experience

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.470
on top of these platforms.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.930
Part of that reason is
because user expectations

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:38.330
continue to raise
from what they want

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:42.050
to see from a high quality app.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.300
We know this first hand,
because at Google, we've

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.170
created some of the world's
most popular mobile apps,

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.600
and we've learned a
lot in the process,

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.520
and we've built a
lot of infrastructure

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.390
to support those applications.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.430
Some time ago, we
decided to take

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.140
some of the internal
infrastructure

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:03.380
that we'd built, along
with our experience,

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.110
and packaged it up
together in a way

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.740
that we could share
with other developers.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.770
And we decided to go
beyond the web and Android,

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.460
and offer solutions to help
iOS developers as well, which

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:21.350
was natural for us because
we're iOS developers ourselves.

00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.130
The result is something
that we call Firebase.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:28.820
We shipped it earlier
this year at Google I/O.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.960
It's a comprehensive set
of tools to make it easier

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.870
to create high quality mobile
apps on iOS, on Android,

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:41.070
or the web.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:45.680
It has many features, such
as free and unlimited app

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.050
analytics, crash
reporting, asset

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:53.780
hosting with CDN integration
automatically provided.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.670
It's also got a powerful
remote configuration

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:58.220
service that lets you adapt
what your application does

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.960
on the fly, and much more.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.550
Each of these features is
designed to be used standalone.

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.650
You can take just what you want.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.540
But we've also
designed these features

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.200
to work really well together.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.430
For example, Firebase
Analytics, you

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.420
can define groups of
users called audiences

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.860
and then reuse these audiences
in Firebase remote config

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.660
to change the way your app
behaves for different groups.

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.390
Or you can send messages
to these different groups

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:41.330
of users, to these audiences,
using Firebase notifications.

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:45.320
One of my favorite integrations
is between Firebase Crash

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.980
Reporting and
Analytics, because when

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.160
your user's experience
a crash, heaven forbid,

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.210
you see a breadcrumb trail of
all the analytics events that

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.060
occurred leading up to that
crash right in the crash

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.050
reporting tool without the
need to do further analysis.

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:05.360
It's pretty cool.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.100
Since we released this in
May, over 750,000 projects

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.480
have been created on
the Firebase platform.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.820
And since launch, we've
shipped a steady stream

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.290
of improvements and new
features to our developers.

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:24.230
I can't wait for you to learn
more about Firebase today,

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.720
about how it can help
you build great apps,

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.020
grow your user base,
and earn more money.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.200
Our vision here is to
free up more of your time

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.540
so that you can
spend it on creating

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.310
innovative new features
for your users,

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:41.810
and not reproduce infrastructure
that other people have already

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.172
created.

00:55:43.172 --> 00:55:44.630
We've got a bunch
of sessions today

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.000
that go into depth
on these features,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.700
and how Chinese developers,
such as YeeCall,

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.750
have used features like Firebase
Analytics and Remote Config

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:58.670
to power their own
global applications.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:01.229
We're deeply committed
to this space,

00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:03.020
and we look forward to
delivering many more

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.924
enhancements to Firebase
in the years to come.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.910
Finally, before I go,
there's one last topic

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.650
I want to cover--
machine learning.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.930
Machine Learning,
or ML for short,

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:24.800
is at the heart of many of
the magical software features

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.710
that we've shipped in
Google products recently.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:31.405
It's also what enabled AlphaGo
to defeat Go Champion Lee

00:56:31.405 --> 00:56:33.560
Sedol earlier this
year, which was

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.650
a tremendous technical
achievement, well beyond what

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:39.440
many thought was the state
of the art for our industry

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.680
by many, many years.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:47.060
And I'm thrilled that we've made
the same ML framework that we

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.540
use internally at
Google available to you

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.194
through an open source
project called TensorFlow.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:02.040
TensorFlow works by giving you
a way to define a data model,

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.030
and then use that model to
analyze large amounts of data.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.120
And it's these large data sets
that enable your TensorFlow

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.520
model to identify patterns.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.140
And these patterns lead to
these magic-like inferences

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.680
that can be identifying
people in a photo,

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.500
or extracting the meeting
from a body of text.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.260
Our CEO, Sundar
Pichai, frequently

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:34.440
talks about how Google is now
becoming an AI-First company,

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.920
and it's technologies
like TensorFlow

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.120
that are behind this transition
and some of our latest products

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.940
and most exciting features.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.280
I'm really pleased that
today at the event,

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.830
you'll have the opportunity
to attend sessions that go

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:51.740
into more detail on TensorFlow.

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.620
An example of one of
the products that we're

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.290
shipping that's powered
by machine learning

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:03.850
is the new Google Assistant, our
conversation oriented platform

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.370
that's embedded in several
of our consumer products,

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.400
like Google Home and Pixel.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.580
Back in October, we
announced that we'd

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.640
be partnering with the
developer community

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.860
by creating an integration
platform for the Google

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.700
Assistant.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.477
We call this Actions on Google.

00:58:23.477 --> 00:58:25.060
And the first version
of this platform

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.540
is launching just a little
bit later this month.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.050
We also acquired
recently, a company

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:37.420
called Api.ai, which
creates a web based platform

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.060
that makes it really
easy for you to create

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.730
compelling conversation
experiences that

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:45.220
work not just on the
Google Assistant,

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.890
but on many of the other
conversation platforms

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:51.520
that are emerging
in today's market.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.310
Real, viable
conversational interfaces

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:58.860
are an exciting new
frontier for our industry,

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.140
and I'm super excited that
we can go on this journey

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.520
together.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.120
Stay tuned to our WeChat
account for further developments

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.550
as this space evolves rapidly.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.520
And we have Google Home

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.861

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:19.598
All right, thank

Today is our opportunity
to work together

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.770
to learn about all
these technologies.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:32.220
We have over 35
breakout sessions

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.650
that go even deeper in all
the stuff that I've mentioned.

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:37.860
We've got a demo
area where you can

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.640
speak with many Googlers and
some of our developer partners

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.250
who have been creating
apps in the ecosystem.

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:47.610
And we have a special
app showcase area.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:51.630
This is a tradition
for our GDD events,

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.660
where we've highlighted
50 apps that

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:58.950
showcase the amazing innovations
that Chinese developers are

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.680
bringing to the global market.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.690
