00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.610
- One of our panelists,
Max Price in South Africa,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.290
was unable to fly here
to be with us today,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.870
but he has recorded
his presentation,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.940
which we will see.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.140
And he will join us
live via video feed

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.350
from Cape Town during
the question and answer.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.840
And so, we're still taking the
cards for question and answer.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.980
Our moderator for this panel
is Alejandro de la Fuente.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.740
And he is the Robert
Woods Bliss Professor

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.950
of Latin American
history and economics

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.530
and professor of
African American studies

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.300
and history at Harvard.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.900
He's also the director of the
Afro-Latin American Research

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.740
Institute, and the co-chair
of the Cuban Studies Program

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.886
at Harvard--

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:03.858
Alejandro.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.300
- Thank you.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.270
Thank you, Evelyn.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.180
And thank you all for staying
for a Friday afternoon--

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.200
a beautiful Friday
afternoon, in fact.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.130
I want to take a second to
say thank you to the faculty

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
organizers of this
magnificent conference,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
and thank you to Dean
Cohen and her staff

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.330
for hosting this event.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.480
I am particularly
pleased to be here

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.750
and to be part of this panel
on universities and slavery

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.470
globally, because as a
scholar of race and slavery

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.920
in Latin America, I very much
hope that this conference

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.040
and that these conversations
will resonate in the region.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.580
Of course, connections between
universities or institutions

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.990
of higher learning and slavery
are not just a US phenomenon.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.039
We heard, actually, a lot about
that in the previous panel.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.800
And by the time
Harvard was created,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.280
a dozen universities already
existed in the Americas.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.080
Starting with the
first of them--

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.870
the Universidad Santo Tomas
de Aquino in Espanola in 1538.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.510
And each of these institutions--

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.130
Santo Domingo, Quito,
Lima, Mexico, La Paz--

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.800
all of them were built
by African slaves.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.260
Yet this conversation has not
really begun in Latin America.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.620
And that, to me, is by itself
a very interesting question.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.100
In fact, if you do a
search in Spanish--

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.870
universidades y esclavitud--
universities and slavery--

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.270
you will get a few hits.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.890
But they speak about
Brown University.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.290
They speak about
the Yale University.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.620
They speak about Georgetown, not
about Santo Domingo or Havana.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.330
I'm also pleased
to see this panel,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.240
because Harvard's own
relationship with slavery,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.590
of course, lasted
much longer than 1783,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.870
as the previous panel
also made very clear.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.550
And I was thinking about
the paper about Soledad,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.220
about the Cuban plantation.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.520
And being Cuban myself,
we all know that Soledad

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.920
was operated by slaves.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.390
And we also know that the
botanical garden was somehow

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.540
linked to Harvard.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.270
That knowledge exists.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.090
But there is a big
difference between knowledge

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.090
and acknowledgement, right?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.440
The knowledge is there, but
somehow the urgent questions

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.930
that we are trying
to deal with here

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.070
are not felt in some
of these places.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.800
To lead us into
this conversation,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.390
we are joined by three
distinguished panelists.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.150
We will start with Vice
Chancellor of the University

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.130
of Cape Town, Max Price.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.959
As Evelyn said,
Professor Price could not

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.430
be here with us today, but we
do have a recorded presentation.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.720
And he will be joining us via
live feed from South Africa,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.100
if technology helps.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.490
We are also joined here--

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.310
and I am honored to have met--

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.350
Congresswoman and
former Minister

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.930
of Justice Madame
Christiane Taubira.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.200
And we are also joined
here by Vice Chancellor

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.710
of the University of West
Indies, a renowned scholar

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.370
of slavery in the Caribbean,
Sir Hilary Beckles.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.000
And we will start with the
presentation of Vice Chancellor

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.890
Max Price.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.030
- Good afternoon.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.890
It's a privilege to
have been invited

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.790
to participate in this panel
on slavery and universities.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.880
I apologize that I
can't be with you.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.610
It's our first week
of the academic year.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.950
And as Vice Chancellor,
I needed to be here,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.040
at the University of Cape Town.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.170
Let me start by saying
that while South Africa has

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.600
a history of slavery,
it was abolished

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.200
when slavery was abolished
across the British empire

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.050
in 1834.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.550
And the universities
in South Africa

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.700
were almost all established
long after that.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.550
The University of Cape Town was
started as a college in 1929,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.430
but in truth, there is
very little direct link

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.870
with slavery.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.920
The only link currently
is that, as part of some

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.720
renovations that we
did on the campus,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.590
we uncovered a slave graveyard
from the 18th century.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.330
And we have built a
memorial to the slaves,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.550
partly as a way of
recognizing people

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.280
who used to live on this
land before it became

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680
the university, and partly--

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.820
and most importantly-- as an
educational tool for students

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.690
today to learn more
about the history.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.850
Given that limited
impact of slavery

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.430
on the University
of Cape Town, you

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.550
might well ask, as I
did of President Faust

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.970
when she invited me to
participate in this colloquium,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.540
why it was thought I would
have something to contribute

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.560
or why the University
of Cape Town

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.810
might have something
to contribute.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.860
I presume it is because of the
parallel and analogous events

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.080
and student movements
that have forced

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.740
us to take a hard look at
how the university was built

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.250
upon and embodied
the values, not

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.550
of slavery but of
colonialism and apartheid.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.356
Those protests have
forced us to assess

00:06:57.356 --> 00:06:59.230
the extent to which the
institutional culture

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.810
today still reflects
and reproduces

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.070
those colonial values, and to
confront how that environment

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.790
today offends and alienates
the descendants of those

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.190
who are oppressed,
disenfranchised, and excluded.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.020
But yet today, those descendants
are present on our campus.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.420
Not only are they
present, they actually

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.010
form the majority of the
students on our campus.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.310
These student-led
protests started at UCT

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.880
with the campaign to remove
the iconic statue of Cecil John

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.320
Rhodes.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.020
This campaign started
off similar campaigns

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.030
on other campuses across
the country, and in fact,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.950
around the world.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.585
The so-called hashtag roads must
fall campaign, in some sense,

00:07:46.585 --> 00:07:49.750
has led this battle charge.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.800
Rhodes was the perfect
symbol of this problem.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.450
A supreme colonialist,
he was on the one hand

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.480
a generous benefactor,
having gifted

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.820
to the nation the land on which
the university is now built,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.640
and of course, many
other commitments--

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.620
financial commitments
to education

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.790
of future generations.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.470
He was also a remarkable
businessman, a diplomat,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.820
a politician, and ultimately
the prime minister

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.110
of the Cape colony.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.560
Yet on the other hand, he was
responsible for conquering

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.040
and annexing land
for the empire,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.950
was ultimately responsible
for military massacres,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.059
particularly in what
is now Zimbabwe--

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.850
exploited labor on the mines
through the manipulative use

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.240
of legislation, which
forced people off the land

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.539
into the cash economy, and
perhaps most importantly,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.700
removed the vote from
many black people

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.560
in the Cape colony
who previously

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.790
had the right to vote.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.470
Partly because the university
is built on the land he gifted,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.740
he was nevertheless
honored in the 1930s

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.340
with a large, breeding
bronze statue, positioned

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.150
in the central focal point of
the architecture on the campus.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.340
No other significant
statues of individuals

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.140
exist on the campus.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.710
Thus it would seem that UCT was
honoring Rhodes, presenting him

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.320
as a role model, and someone
who embodies the values of UCT.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.850
While for many students if
they cared to know something

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.370
about Rhodes and the
history, the statue

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.000
represented the victory
over the colonized masses,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.730
revering a man who had
deprived their ancestors

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.660
of numerous different rights--

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.400
rights to land, to the
vote, and even to life.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.350
Although the statue
was never intended

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.340
to be a tool of exclusion,
that's what it had become.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.380
The campus could not
be considered inclusive

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.600
while it stood in its
prominent position.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.030
After a month of
consultation and debate,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.480
in 2015, the Senate
and the Council--

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.616
which is the governing
body of the university--

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:55.990
agreed that it
should be removed.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.870
But it was not only
about the statue--

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.250
far from it.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.480
The statue symbolized
the colonial culture,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.050
that through the
statue the university

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.396
continued to valorize.

00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:14.770
The university
does, indeed, have

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.160
its roots in the
colonial era, and is

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.800
modeled on the Oxbridge
models of universities.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.540
You look at the architecture
of UCT, of the university,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.260
and it tells you
something about what

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.940
the university aspires to be.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.190
If you walk through the
passages of the departments

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.380
of the university,
the walls are lined

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.660
by portraits and photographs of
previous heads of departments,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.490
professors, and deans,
almost all of whom,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.565
not surprisingly,
are white males.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.300
The buildings and
rooms of the university

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.240
are mostly named after
white males, some of whom

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.810
were academics, some of
whom were benefactors,

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.310
and some of whom were
political leaders

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.510
from the colonial period.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.900
In the curricula, there is
often little or no recognition

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.510
of thought leadership
that comes from societies

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.960
other than Western civilization
or that other civilizations

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.400
have contributed to some of
the collective canon that

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.200
is what we today consider
the sum of human knowledge.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.230
The curriculum often
rejects or refuses

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.850
to recognize the validity
of other belief systems--

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.260
say, for example,
in health sciences,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.960
belief systems about
the role that ancestors

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.930
play in one's health.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.690
The message that students
construct about the attitudes

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.410
and values of the university
is derived, therefore,

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.970
from what is reflected
back to them--

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.880
back from the walls,
back from the curricula,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.090
back from the role models
they have as lecturers

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.820
and professors, what
is reflected back

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.280
to them as examples
of excellence,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.150
as examples of the culture
of the institution.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.636
And what is reflected
is a white culture.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:02.010
And so, for black
students, there

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.580
is a pervasive
sense of alienation.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.210
And it is exacerbated by many
other experiences, such as how

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:09.870
people--

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.280
both black and white--

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.400
respond to other black people,
based on the stereotype

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.790
assumptions that they have
internalized, based on cues,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:23.610
such as color, accent,
dress, and much more.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.330
The choice of artworks
and sculptures

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.950
on display in public places is
another source of alienation.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.010
Some students come from
cultures where nudity--

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.870
especially of older people--

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.765
is considered so disrespectful
towards older people

00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:40.390
that they will not
bring their children

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.970
to see their workplace,
because they do not

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.130
want to have to explain why
such nudity is on display.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.290
And then they challenge
us with the question,

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.710
how is this an inclusive campus
if I cannot bring my children

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.700
to work?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.050
Artworks that were created--

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.900
say, 40 years ago during
the apartheid period--

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.590
depicting the wretchedness of
black life under apartheid.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.350
Often, these were courageous
political statements

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.350
at the time, some of the
works by black artists

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.150
and photographers.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.970
But these today, ironically,
may be regarded out of context

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.020
as simply a further repetition
of the black person's typical

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.890
and even expected
station in life.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.040
There are no whites depicted
this way in these artworks

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.700
and photographs.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.050
So the young black student,
born post-apartheid,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.960
does not see this as an
anti-apartheid statement.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.930
She sees this as a statement
about the university,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.580
and how the university--

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.870
and how white people--

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.262
view black people
as an underclass.

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:45.720
These are the issues
that have been

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.710
dominant on our campus
over the last two years,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.030
in the equivalent
of what in the US

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.170
are the Black Lives Matter
campaigns, which here tend

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.990
to take the form of
arguments about coloniality

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.170
and decolonization.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.780
And these are the issues that
we have needed to address.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.440
So what have we done?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.530
We have initiated a
number of interventions

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.099
to begin to address
the concrete elements

00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:12.640
of the environment
that are signaling

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.000
this exclusive colonial culture.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.220
Transformation is therefore
no longer primarily

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.640
about racial demography, though
that remains an unfulfilled

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.190
challenge, especially
in the level of faculty.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.130
Now transformation
is about changing

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.540
the institutional culture.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.510
It is also more than just
recognizing and representing

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.010
the different heritages of
those who now constitute

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.520
the new university community,
such as through naming

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.020
buildings after struggle heroes
or in indigenous languages.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.180
It is more about
removing and changing

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.460
the names of buildings
that honor people

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.280
who were oppressors,
even if they may only

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.060
be regarded that way in the
light of today's value systems.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.020
It is about revealing
artworks that cause offense,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.780
and either contextualizing
them adequately-- if possible--

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.300
or placing them in galleries
rather than in public

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.530
places, where people can
choose to view them or not.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.350
It is about rethinking the
pageantry of ceremonies,

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.050
such as graduation
or commencements,

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.300
to reflect less
colonial traditions

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.830
and incorporate local
traditions and music.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.230
Perhaps the hardest
intervention is

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.030
engaging with the
challenges of what

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.690
some consider "epistemic
violence," quote, unquote--

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.150
the nature of knowledge and
pedagogy in higher education.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.200
This may refer to curricular
content, such as including

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.470
intellectual contributions
from non-western and especially

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.580
African thinkers, to teaching
about indigenous belief systems

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.000
as part of co-curricular
in some professions,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.240
to ways of learning
and teaching.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.120
The extent of such
curriculum decolonization

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.240
will vary by discipline and
profession, and much of this

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.600
is still notional and unformed.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.880
It cannot be imposed
on academics.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.580
They have to be persuaded
to take up the challenge,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.370
to listen seriously to
the concerns of those

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:16.530
who feel marginalized, and who
feel that the curriculum does

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:21.180
not speak to them, and to
seek out these problems

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.370
and find ways of
addressing them.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.430
At core, in
transformation, therefore,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.630
is a change in attitude to
what is meant by inclusiveness.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.500
Previously, we meant by
inclusiveness helping newcomers

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.060
adapt to and succeed in
the institution as it is,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.400
with its historic culture.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.120
This entailed removing
barriers, affirmative action,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.710
academic support, bridging
programs, acculturation,

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.390
writing skills--

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.380
essentially, becoming
more like us,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.530
more like the historically
dominant group.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.580
The newcomer was expected
to fit in, to assimilate,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.790
and we would do
everything to assist that.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.740
Post-grads must fall.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.089
Inclusiveness means changing
the culture of the institution,

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.819
too, to reflect the different
cultures, and heritages,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.760
and values of those who
constitute its community.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.246
It is actually a change in our
identity as an institution.

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:24.079
Thank you very much.

00:17:27.516 --> 00:17:29.971
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.420
- Good evening.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.870
Good afternoon to each of you.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:43.680
I'd like to spend a few
seconds to tell you how pleased

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.490
I am being here with you.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.090
At the critical time
of the world life--

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.010
so critical time.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:59.210
I'd like to thank Mrs.
President, Mrs. Drew Gilpin

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.880
Faust, and Mrs. Dean.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.430
Lizabeth Cohen for
this invitation,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.110
because it's very
important for me

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:15.340
to share with you our thoughts,
our works, our prospects

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:22.550
about certain sensitive matter
as slavery and universities.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.270
That means slavery
and knowledge, slavery

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.510
and ethical matters.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.950
At this very beginning
of this statement,

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:39.230
I think it is important for
me to make clear two points.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.900
First of this point-- because
I'm going to speak about

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.250
the French experience--

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:51.400
first of this point is that
during the time where France

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.280
was involved in slave
trade and slavery,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.550
this slavery was not practiced
on its own territory.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:10.460
You know what was the
so-called Triangular Trade?

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.180
You know the facts.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.320
It was a very
lucrative activity.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.600
The facts are that boats
leaving European harbor

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.050
carrying different
kinds of goods,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:31.220
reaching the African
coast, and then dealers

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.510
could buy these woman,
these men, these children,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.290
who were captured in their
villages, in the cities,

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.060
all over the African continent.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:58.100
And then these boats cross what
became a huge, deep cemetery,

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.580
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.575
Where are your
monuments, your martyrs?

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.950
Where is your tribal memory?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:20.130
Souls in that grave of the sea.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.730
The sea has locked them up.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.220
The sea is history.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.670
That's a part of a poem of
Derek Walcott, a Saint Lucian

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.110
Caribbean poem, Caribbean poet.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.120
The sea is history.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.830
And so, once arrived in
America and the Caribbean

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:52.430
islands, the same boats
unloaded from and chain people.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:58.790
These people were driven to the
slave market to be sold again.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.190
In the same boat,
the same boats were

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:14.310
loaded with sugar, coffee,
coco, gold, silver, spices,

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:20.340
tobacco, and so forth, and
is sent back to Europe.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.570
That was this Triangular Trade.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.620
And it was the way it
worked during four centuries

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.250
as a rule.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.290
I said to you that it's
a very important point

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.120
to understand that
slavery was not practiced

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.740
on the own territory of France.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.160
So, for French people,
slave trade and slavery

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.380
is something very far.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.810
It's just trade.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:00.770
It's something colonial, unless
for philosophers, writers,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:08.620
some workers, some citizens,
too, who protested against it.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:15.000
They protested during the time
of slave trade and slavery.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.830
But it was far.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.940
And in the French
collective consciousness,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.440
slave trade is
something far, far, far.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.650
Slavery is kind of
colonial matter,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.840
even maybe a private
one, although there

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.170
were public companies
settled and managed

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.410
by the power of the state.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.950
So during this is
hard and very dark

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:50.480
period when slave trade
and slavery were practiced,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.860
there was not a massive
physical presence in France.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.380
So there was not a
massive confrontation.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.360
It's a very important point.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.160
The second important point
is that France is not

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.950
a federal country like the
United States of America.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.580
France is a centralized country.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.390
That means that political
or legal decision

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:25.020
applies on the spot and
all over the territory.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.780
So when the French
Parliament voted

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:34.350
the law that settled that
slave trade and slavery is

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:41.570
a crime against humanity,
the law applies on the spot

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.760
all over the territory.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.780
It took two years for the
bill I wrote to become a law,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.730
arguing with the House
of Representatives

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.230
and the Senate. and the senate.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:05.080
This law contains a solemn
and official proclamation

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.770
that slave trade and slavery
is a crime against humanity,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.920
that slave trade
was not a trade.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.840
It was a crime, and
not any kind of crime--

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.400
a crime against humanity.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.830
That means the enslaved
people were not slaves.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.110
They were not goods.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.210
They were not materials.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.390
They were not furnitures.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:41.160
They were, they are woman,
man, children, human beings.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.910
That's what this
proclamation means.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:50.350
Other provisions of this
law deserve to be mentioned.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.770
According to
Article 2, the state

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.400
is compelled to organize
the teaching of its history

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:05.060
in all public schools,
from primary to university.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:12.300
In France, more than 80% of
the schools are public schools.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:18.810
And the state is compelled to
encourage facilitate, support--

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:24.660
including financial--
research, cooperation

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.170
between universities,
between universities

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.660
and other institutions in
the country and abroad.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.410
Article 3 founded a
national committee

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.540
for memory and
history of slavery.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.560
This committee has
in charge all kind

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:54.700
of actions likely to make this
story well-known, better known

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.370
in the whole country.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.750
And this committee, up
to now, give every year

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:08.500
a price on the order of
7,000 euros for a high level

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.350
work of a student.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.950
Every year, there is another
prize for a scholar--

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.930
that means children
and teenagers--

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.650
called the flame of equality.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:28.730
Every year or two, they
organize a big civic meeting.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:34.530
They have in charge to
organize seminars and symposium

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:40.690
to lead relationship
with UNESCO and others.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.530
And last year, for
instance, 150 events

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.970
were organized all
over the territory.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:55.230
I must say that there was
an article in the bill

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.730
relevant to reparations.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.550
After months and
months of polemics,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:08.390
this article was removed, but
the debate is still there.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:15.020
The following article sets
up a debt, a national debt,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.810
for an official and
solemn ceremony.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:23.270
The ceremony is shared
by the French president

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.980
of the republic.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.615
It takes place in the
heart of Paris, the Jardin

00:27:31.615 --> 00:27:37.840
de Luxembourg, and last
year, the guest of honer

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.330
was the Reverend Jesse Jackson.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.240
And in the world
territory, there

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.670
are ceremonies--
local ceremonies

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.540
organized by sub-prefects.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:54.630
Sub-prefects are high public
servants representing the state

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.180
all over the territory.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.190
We have a different situation.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:05.626
For instance, in Bordeaux,
it's also in 2009

00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:10.210
that the first local
ceremony took place.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:14.900
I must remember that two
years debating the law--

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.800
the bill before law.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.230
The national committee
was set up only on 2004.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.930
The first national
ceremony official

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:32.690
took place only on 2006,
and the first local ceremony

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.340
in Bordeaux in 2009.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:40.260
But we have also a counter
example, such as Nantes.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.040
Nantes is a big
city that tackles

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.400
with this story
since many years.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.720
In 1985, for instance, Nantes--

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.980
when I say Nantes, I speak of
association and the city hall.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:04.970
They organized an event
remembering the third century

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.400
of the Black Code.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.690
The Black Code stipulated
that slave and enslaved

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.750
people were furnitures.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:20.580
In 1992, Nantes
organized an event.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.820
[FRENCH] talked about them.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:31.790
[FRENCH] remembering
the fifth century

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:37.910
of Christopher Columbus'
journey in West Indies.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:46.040
And in 2012, Nantes opened
this wonderful, beautiful, very

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:52.010
powerful memorial, very
important in the city.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.170
So we have this counter example.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:30:00.390
Anyway, we observes that
we faced push backs.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.900
That means so
between historians,

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.700
but mainly I talked
about Bordeaux.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.290
That is a big, rich
city, nice city

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.110
that was the second
important harbor--

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.480
French harbor
during slave trade.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.210
Nantes was the first one.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:26.450
And people pay attention to
the sociology of the city.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:33.360
I mean, which is that professor,
teachers are very, very careful

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:40.810
not to upset the families whose
fortune comes from slave trade.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:49.130
So it's a real break
against facing this history.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.600
But we try to deal with that.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.550
And even if we are
facing these push backs.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.260
We keep working on it.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.500
And more and more
people are involved

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:11.240
in this truth of the history,
and the way this history

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.160
has shaped the society
and the mentality.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:23.480
So this example shows that
when, at the level of the state

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.570
of a country, the decision--

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.100
the courageous decision
is taken to recognize

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:36.800
a crime against humanity and
to take all the consequences

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.370
of this reconnection, its a
way to drive the whole society,

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.090
to tackle, to
grapple this history,

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:52.100
and to include it in
the day to day life.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:59.470
So I will conclude considering
all these elements.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.740
I remember some words
of James Baldwin.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:11.560
James Baldwin was criticizing
what the President JFK--

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.730
John Fitzgerald Kennedy-- said.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.940
It was on 1962.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:25.550
He said it's quite
conceivable that in the United

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:33.550
States within 40 years, there
will be a black president.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:39.870
And James Baldwin said for
people living at the present,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.210
this far prospect
is unacceptable.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:48.096
I'm concluding--
is unacceptable.

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:51.480
And he was right.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:59.160
And the fact is that you
had a black president

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.110
more than 40 years later.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:09.420
And it shows after the power
of this black president--

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:15.320
excuse me, but what a backlash.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.760
What a backlash.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.400
Anyway, this helps
us to understand

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.560
that opposition is not amazing.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.000
It's not amazing at all.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:41.810
We just have to remember
that it's about people.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.690
So we are not
allowed to give up.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.910
We must stand up, because
it's about people.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:54.390
It's about broken
personal destinies.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.580
It's just for money.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:05.240
It's about people living
today, people hearing a nigger,

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.330
a bambula, a boy.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:18.440
It's about people who are
shot with no reason but--

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.730
it's about the children.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:28.560
Boys, girls, we are not
allowed to go to school.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.380
We are working in
the plantations.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.719
We are working in the house--
in the master's house,

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.730
serving the masters, the
mistress, the children

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.090
of the master, of the mistress.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.420
It's about these people--

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.350
some of the people think
they have no predestination

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.190
to go to university
or to win Nobel Prize.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:35:00.160
It's about children who
have no right of childhood.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.400
So we can't give up.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.680
We just can't give up.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.210
We have to stand up for that.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:14.970
In a poem Langston Hughes, the
title is "I Too Sing America."

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.045
Some say that it was
a sort of response

00:35:17.045 --> 00:35:21.870
of Walt Whitman's poem.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.620
It says I am the darker brother.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.080
They send me to the
kitchen when company comes.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.990
And I love, and I eat
well, and I grow strong.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.520
I, too, sing America.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.840
Maybe he's right.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:51.343
Maybe we are the darker
brothers, the darker sisters.

00:35:51.343 --> 00:35:55.030
But we are.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.878
We just are.

00:35:56.878 --> 00:35:59.370
We are.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:05.990
That's what it's not about race.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.330
It's not a racial topic.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.570
It's not a racial matter.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.370
It's a human one.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.040
It's a social one.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:29.680
It's an ethical one because
we are all created equal.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.054
Thank you.

00:36:31.054 --> 00:36:33.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:46.717 --> 00:36:47.300
It was a fact.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:02.670
- Madame President, colleagues,
and friends, good afternoon,

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.540
everyone.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.310
It is an honor to be a
part of this discourse,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:15.820
this conversation, and to
speak from the perspective

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:22.910
of the Caribbean and to
give voice to my identity

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:27.860
as the Vice
Chancellor of the only

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.540
regional university
in the Caribbean,

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.420
the University of
the West Indies--

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.250
which, as you know, has
three landed campuses

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.350
in Jamaica, Barbados,
Trinidad and Tobago,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.730
and university centers scattered
all across the region--

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:57.050
a university that has been a
part of this epic Caribbean

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:01.840
struggle against slavery
and colonization,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.420
a part of this enlightenment
journey of Caribbean peoples

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:13.150
who have been very intolerant
and rebellious within

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:18.860
the context of this history,
whether from the traditions

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.990
of [NON-ENGLISH] that covered
the entire region through

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.050
to the Haitian Revolution where
the people of the Caribbean

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.070
were the first in this
hemisphere to uproot slavery,

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.320
remove it, and criminalize it.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.850
Through to all of the other
revolutionary struggles

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.390
in the Caribbean for
justice and for democracy,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:50.270
this university I lead is
a part of this history.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:54.440
It originated in the workers'
revolution of the 1930s

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.180
where the people stood up
against British colonization,

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.690
demanded an end to
the colonial regime,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:07.180
and stood up for democracy,
for social justice.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.320
The British government
responded to this

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.340
by establishing a
University College, which

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:23.860
originated as a college of the
University of London in 1948.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:29.200
So that is the nature of
the university's origin.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.180
But by 1963, we had
de-colonized that relationship

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.210
and declared an
independent University

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.240
of the West Indies, independent
of the University of London.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.260
The journey, of
course, is not over.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.830
There are still colonial
relationships in the Caribbean.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.270
There are still
colonies of France.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:59.760
There are colonies of
America, colonies of England.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.580
The majority of our societies,
yes, have been de-colonized,

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.820
but there are still some
outstanding communities

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.760
across the archipelago
that are still trapped

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.430
in the colonial relationship.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:15.360
And everywhere, the
legacy of slavery

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:21.480
is not only immediate, but
very aggressive in its agency.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.830
And so, for us, the entire
environment, the ecology

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:30.330
of our existence is surrounded
by these institutions rooted

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.090
in slavery, built
by slave owners--

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.830
whether they are
physical structures,

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.080
ideological structures.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.940
We are still surrounded by it.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.840
And for us, slavery
is not remote.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.190
It is immediate, it is pressing.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.130
There are still
people in our region

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:57.400
whose great grandparents were
born in a slavery circumstance.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.420
But our campuses are located
in the most beautiful

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.840
environments.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.440
This is an image, a Google
Map of the campus in Barbados.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.370
As you can see, it's a beautiful
campus overlooking the ocean,

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.050
but surrounding a
cricket field, which

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.850
is the quintessential
British model of building

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:25.530
a campus with a cricket
field at its core.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:30.100
That is a model derived from
the classical British tradition.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.390
That is an image of
the Barbados campus

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.200
at Cave Hill, where I
had the pleasure to be

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.440
the provost there for 15 years.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.550
This is an image of the Jamaica
campus-- the Mona campus,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.590
the long beautiful
Queensway leading

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.830
into the heartland of the
campus with the magnificent Blue

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:57.960
Mountains of Jamaica
in the background.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.540
But it's important
to realize, though,

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.940
that these beautiful
environments, these really

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:10.620
wonderful, charming, and
picturesque communities,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.100
all of these campuses
are built on lands

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.790
that were slave plantations.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:22.500
Here at Mona, the
beautiful Mona campus,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.040
this was the lands
occupied by the Mona sugar

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.810
plantation, where hundreds
of enslaved peoples

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:35.670
toiled and were buried.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:42.810
We have the list of all of
those enslaved persons who

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:48.480
were emancipated, the
British Act in 1833.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.620
We have excellent documents
of all of these people

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:59.400
who were the last among the
enslaved on the Mona estate,

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.680
the land we now occupy as the
Mona campus of the university.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.090
And as you can see
here from these images,

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.950
the vast majority of
these enslaved persons

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.100
were described as
Creole, that is,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.910
born in Jamaica, as opposed
to imported from Africa.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.310
It's a very long list.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.980
And I will not go through this.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.800
But our campus at Mona
is associated also

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.570
with all of the traditions
of crimes against humanity

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.090
that we are now treating with.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.940
The indigenous peoples
who experienced a genocide

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.490
under the Spanish
colonial project,

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:52.230
they also lived on the land
that is now the Mona campus.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.500
And here are some shacks.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.040
These were buildings that were
constructed on the land that

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.410
became our campus, to house
those Jewish refugees who were

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.830
able to escape the Third Reich.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:13.150
And these structures were
built to rehabilitate

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.800
some of those Jewish people
who fled through Gibraltar

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.960
and found their way into
the hands of the British.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.570
The British took care of
them and brought them here

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.840
to this land site.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.840
And there are many
prominent members

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.620
of the Jewish community
whose parents were actually

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.950
housed in these structures
before the structures evolve

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:36.980
into the university.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.750
So we have the history
then on our Mona campus,

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:45.400
not only of indigenous slavery
but also African slavery,

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:52.310
and also, indeed, the Holocaust
against the Jewish community.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.060
This is a structure that
was designed to accommodate

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.680
the Jewish refugee camp.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.880
And here you can
see Jewish persons

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:11.570
in this facility
in the mid 1940s.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.040
This is an image of
the campus chapel,

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.080
which was built by enslaved
persons, first as a sugar mill.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.380
In the 18th century,
this was a mill

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.880
of the sugar estate, which was
dismantled and the stones were

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.600
brought from the Jamaican
countryside to the Mona campus

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.900
and reconstructed as a chapel--

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:41.070
so from a sugar mill, which
was destructive of the lives

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:47.310
of enslaved Africans, to a
Christian chapel of reflection.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.350
These are some of
the ruins that still

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:55.100
exist on the campus, the
legacies of the slave estate.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.540
But here is an
interesting image.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.910
This is an image of the new
medical faculty complex, which

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.560
was constructed four years ago.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.220
It's a beautiful facility
built on the campus,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.550
because the university
campus here started

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.150
in 1948 as a medical faculty.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:18.800
And some six years
later, we decided

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.470
to build a state of the art
teaching and research complex.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:27.140
But while we were doing this--
so while we were getting

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.180
ready to do this,
something extraordinary

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.980
happened on the campus.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.360
The contract was allocated.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.850
A major Chinese
multinational firm

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.060
won the contract to
build this complex.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.650
And they came on
the site and were

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.470
preparing to excavate
the foundations to do

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.150
what they had to do.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.740
And guess what?

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.690
The bones began to
come up from the earth.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:57.170
We then discovered
that this facility

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:01.040
was about to be constructed
on the burial ground

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.410
of the enslaved Africans.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:09.140
And no one knew that this was
the site, the ceremonial site.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.260
This was a site where
hundreds of Africans

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.906
were buried in unmarked
graves on the soil.

00:47:16.906 --> 00:47:21.640
Of course, we had to
stop the construction.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.520
We did all of the excavations.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:30.340
We removed all of the
bones of these ancestors.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.660
We took them out.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.240
We did what was necessary
and what was appropriate,

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.070
and then we constructed
a memorial on the site.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:41.230
And there you can
see Danny Glover,

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.230
who was a part of
that conversation.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.020
And here, now, we
have a memorial

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.560
with the names of all
of the enslaved Africans

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.060
that we were able to find--

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:58.030
in the records on this monument.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.990
I moved to the Barbados
campus, the Barbados campus

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:09.670
at Cave Hill, also built on a
slave plantation-- or a series

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.620
of slave plantations.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.830
Celebrating the 50th
anniversary of this campus,

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:23.065
four years ago, we carried
out a major analysis--

00:48:23.065 --> 00:48:26.980
a historical analysis
of the community that

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.530
now constitutes the campus.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.190
We were able to identify
all of those-- or most

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:36.240
of those enslaved
Africans who were

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.110
on that land that
is now the Cave Hill

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.040
campus of the university.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.280
This is a major publication
that sets out this history.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.680
And here is a monument
on the campus,

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.380
on the periphery of the campus
overlooking the Caribbean

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.430
Ocean.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.550
And this monument is
called Quaw's Quest.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.920
Why Quaw?

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:10.370
We discovered that in 1793,
a three-year-old child

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:15.620
from the Congo was sold
into slavery in Barbados

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.380
on the auction
blocks in Bridgetown

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.940
and was bought by the owner
of the land, which we now

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.730
occupy as our campus.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.850
The gentleman who
bought the young Quaw,

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.150
he had a three-year-old
white child

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.380
and he wanted a
toy for his child.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.990
And so, he bought Quaw.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:40.930
Quaw grew up on this
land, and it was soon

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.470
discovered that he was a
remarkable and phenomenal

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:45.872
child.

00:49:45.872 --> 00:49:50.280
And so, he acquired literacy
through his own efforts.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.890
And at the emancipation
in 1834, we

00:49:54.890 --> 00:50:00.080
discover that Quaw
is now a teacher

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.900
of children on the estate.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.370
The Church of England
built a chapel on the land,

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:13.890
and Quaw was invited to become
the sexton of the chapel,

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:18.210
becoming the first black sexton
of an Anglican church, anywhere

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.300
in the world.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.550
He is now a teacher.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.750
He conducts Sunday
school classes

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.000
for the kids on the estates.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.690
In this sense, therefore, Quaw
becomes the first teacher.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:36.230
He becomes the first teacher
and academic of the Cave Hill

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.640
campus.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.670
So we see him as our ancestor.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:47.252
He is the first to be involved
in the profession of teaching--

00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:52.820
and not bad for a child who
was thrown into slavery.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.100
At the age of three,
his parents were killed

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.780
in the raid on his village.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.720
And now we memorialize
Quaw on the campus.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.520
And in the background
there of that symbol,

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.020
are plates made of
fiberglass with the names

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:18.030
of all of the enslaved persons
who worked on the soil that

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.260
is now the Cave Hill campus.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:27.760
And these are the list of all
of those enslaved Africans,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.870
where they were born, whether
in Africa, in Barbados,

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.640
and other islands
of the Caribbean,

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.990
their names, their profession,
their color, all of that.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.060
So we have all of these lists--
males and females, children,

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.130
boys and girls.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.850
And we see Quaw there
at emancipation.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.450
These are the huge books
that carry their names

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.020
so that students can
leave the classroom,

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:59.770
go to Quaw's monument, and see
the journey of their ancestors

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:02.110
on that space that
is now the campus.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.510
And why do we call
it Quaw's Quest.?

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:09.190
He died in the cholera
epidemic of 1854.

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:13.450
And while in his
last hours of life,

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.500
he gave his testimony
to the local priest.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:21.320
And he said, well, I was
brought here as a child

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.110
without a family.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:24.770
Now, I'm a teacher.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.260
I'm a free man.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.040
I have a wife.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.540
I have four children.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.010
My quest is complete.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:37.310
And so, we call this
monument Quaw's Quest.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.490
But we did not end
there in this process

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.760
of engaging the environment
and rehabilitation.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.660
We did not end there.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.920
Six years ago, the task--

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.200
it was my responsibility to
construct a new administration

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.060
building on the campus.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.290
I assembled a team
of architects.

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:08.260
And I said, OK, we are now
going to build a facility

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:16.070
on this campus that represents
the administrative function

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.575
of the institution.

00:53:19.575 --> 00:53:28.170
And we thought-- why not design
our administration building

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.520
with the architectural motif
of the African golden stool,

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.490
the golden stool of the Ashanti.

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:40.480
The golden stool of the
Ashanti, the first rebellion

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.290
on the island of Barbados--

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.720
the first attempt
at revolt was 1675.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.840
An Ashanti man by
the name of Kofi

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:56.535
was meant to become
the king of Barbados.

00:53:56.535 --> 00:53:59.600
He destroyed the slave
owners, destroyed slavery.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:05.540
Kofi was going to be installed
in a ceremony of state,

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.130
and he would become
King Kofi of Barbados

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.660
in classical Ashanti fashion.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.170
They had a stool made of wood.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:20.110
And he was meant to be installed
on the 12th of June, 1675,

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.120
when the revolt had succeeded.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.910
Well, they did not succeed.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:32.120
Kofi was beheaded
and burnt alive,

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.710
he and all of his followers.

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:37.400
And the stool they had made
of wood for this ceremony

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.220
was also burnt.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.840
We took the decision--

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.950
the bold decision-- of
giving King Kofi his stool.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:49.070
And now Barbados,
the Cave Hill campus,

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:53.720
on a land built for
slavery and plantation,

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.070
now the home of the campus,
King Kofi of the Ashanti

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.540
now has his golden stool.

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:05.050
And there we go, the
golden stool of King Kofi.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.750
When this structure
was completed,

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.840
the vast majority of
people in Barbados

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.100
assume it was a
Chinese building.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.150
So detached were the
citizens from their history,

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.970
their Ghanaian roots-- and the
vast majority of the Africans

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.800
on the island are from
what we now call today--

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.710
or what was called
then the Gold Coast.

00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:34.080
The majority were
Ashantis, Gas, and Fantes.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.097
This would have been a common
symbol for their ancestors.

00:55:38.097 --> 00:55:39.930
Their ancestors would
have known immediately

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.800
what this represented, but
the descendants do not-- so

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.190
detached they are from
their history, so detached

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.910
they are from their
historical, cultural roots,

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:53.250
which is fundamentally one
of the crimes of slavery,

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.810
to be detached from your roots.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:02.100
And now, the schoolchildren come
to the campus on a weekly basis

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.970
to receive historical lessons
in their African history

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.910
and culture, and to
understand the significance

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:13.770
of this structure as a
proud symbol on a campus

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.830
where thousands of enslaved
Africans worked and died.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:23.530
And allow me to
say in conclusion

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:27.640
that we didn't end there
with the management

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.670
of the physical environment--
our teaching, our research,

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.720
our public advocacy, our
professional training.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:38.560
We engaged this
history every day.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.080
Our university
sees itself as part

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.890
of that mandate to clean
up the legacies of slavery.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.770
All we do, we confront it.

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:48.670
We engage it.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.960
We are cleaning this up--

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.030
whether it's in the area
of public health, diabetes,

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.770
hypertension, whether it's
the issues of anti-poverty,

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:58.990
all the issues, all the
legacies of slavery.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:02.500
This university engages
these legacies daily.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.570
This is where our
resources are allocated.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.560
And we have taken
one final step.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.860
Three months ago, the
University of the West Indies

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.920
established the Institute
for Reparations Research.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.240
This institution comees
in against the background

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.230
of the establishment
of the Caribbean

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.870
Commission for Reparations.

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:32.260
We are going to construct
the evidentiary basis

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.860
for the reparatory
claim, which will

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.130
be made against all
of those in power

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.810
and institutions and governments
of Western Europe, including,

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:44.440
of course, the financial
institutions, all

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.960
of those who were
criminally enriched

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.745
in this process of enslavement.

00:57:48.745 --> 00:57:53.680
And so, this institute is
seen as a critical step

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.490
towards the process of
developing a social justice

00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:00.760
pedagogy within the university.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.320
And we really do hope it will
be a part of a global network

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.980
of similar institutions
that will help us to move

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.010
this conversation forward.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.364
Thank you.

00:58:12.364 --> 00:58:15.316
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:27.940
- So we have now live from South
Africa, Vice Chancellor Price,

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.970
who will speak to us
live for a few minutes.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:33.134
Can you hear us?

00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:33.800
- I can, indeed.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.341
Can you hear me?

00:58:35.341 --> 00:58:35.840
- Yes.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.100
We hear you.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.990
- Thank you very much.

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.080
Thank you, and I enjoyed--

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.620
let me greet you and greet
Sir Hilary and Madame Taubira.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.750
Thank you all for
the opportunity.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:50.750
And thank you, President
Faust, for the opportunity.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.280
I was connected
already to listen

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.820
to the video of my presentation.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.252
And I thought I would--

00:59:00.252 --> 00:59:04.520
I had understood I needed to
speak only for 10 minutes.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.320
So thank you for giving me
just a few more minutes.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.590
As I watched my own
video, I realized

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:12.980
that in the short time, there
was a risk of over-simplifying

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.510
a number of issues.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.945
And so, the opportunity
just gives me--

00:59:16.945 --> 00:59:21.320
it gives me an opportunity to
highlight some nuances that I

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.940
didn't.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.600
The first was in talking
about de-colonization

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.620
and coloniality, of course,
the key challenge is,

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.600
what constitutes the colonial?

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.180
What constitutes the
colonial in, say, artworks--

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.720
which, as we know,
belies the way

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.400
in which contemporary
artworks are

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:47.150
the sum of inferences from many
heritages and many sources.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:52.070
And so that when one comes to
grappling with what it means

00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:56.075
to de-colonize an
environment, that becomes,

00:59:56.075 --> 01:00:00.200
of course, hugely contested,
and there aren't easy answers.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.410
I think, as I presented it,
it sounded a whole lot simpler

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:04.430
than that.

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:08.090
The second, I think,
is that students do not

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:10.040
speak with one voice.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.037
There are many different
views-- and certainly

01:00:12.037 --> 01:00:13.870
many different views
amongst black students.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.530
There are many
black students who

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:20.530
would say of artworks
that the purpose of art

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.210
is to move one out of
one's comfort zone.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:28.280
So while there will be some
who will feel and take offense,

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.770
others will say that's
what art is about.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:35.210
And so, then who gets to
decide on a campus as diverse

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.810
as we are, and as one would
expect to find in a country

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:40.340
like South Africa?

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.110
Who gets to decide
then, and how does one

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:47.990
resolve what it means to be
an inclusive environment?

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.950
This relates from
everything-- architecture,

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:55.760
names of buildings, artworks,
curricula, role models.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.740
I think with respect
to some of these,

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.220
one of the lessons we've learned
as the debates have proceeded

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.440
is that as much of it resides
in the question of curation

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.160
and curation policy, as in
the artworks themselves.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.980
And that is often not
any individual artwork

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.040
that is the problem,
but the sum of them,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.300
and how they are presented and
often decontextualized or not

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.520
sufficiently contextualized.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
And the final
point-- thank you--

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.300
that I'd like to add with the
extra minute offered is that

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.020
in reflecting on my
talk, I think, again,

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.650
I was in a shorthand
trying to highlight--

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.870
it would have come across
as a significant rupture

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:41.630
from the pre-Rhodes
[INAUDIBLE] period

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:45.710
to the post-Rhodes [INAUDIBLE]
period, as if prior to Rhodes

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:48.190
there was no debate
or no consciousness

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.880
of this coloniality
and no challenge of it,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.730
perhaps even a pride in a
particular dominant culture.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.860
And that wouldn't be correct.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.190
Over many decades, in
fact, those debates

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.210
have been going on.

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.930
And it's an interesting
question too,

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:08.450
but separate from this
discussion about why this

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:14.650
suddenly bubbled over in 2015
and what the national dynamics

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.000
were and the global dynamics.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.440
But there were certainly plenty
of debates going on before.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.000
Perhaps the key shift was the
success of transformation,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.380
that the number of black
students and black faculty

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.630
in the university had reached
a critical mass where that--

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.830
what was a hegemonic
culture-- could be more easily

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:39.860
challenged, where people
found their voice--

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.010
not only as individuals who
had always found their voice,

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.510
but as collectives--

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:51.260
which surfaced the issues in
very graphic and sometimes

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:55.310
violent forms, and has resulted
in the protest movements

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.322
we've seen over
the last two years.

01:02:57.322 --> 01:02:59.030
But thank you, again,
for the opportunity

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:00.240
to add a few comments.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.460
And I look forward
to the discussion.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.870
- Thank you, Max.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.790
So we have limited
time left, and I'm

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.640
going to try to summarize
some of the questions.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.340
We have received a few from
the different audiences,

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.420
including some from
Twitter, which apparently

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.130
can be used for good purposes.

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.297
And you know that.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.880
And I'm going to
start with a question

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.000
that I think can
actually be addressed

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.490
by all of our panelists.

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:31.540
And the question
reads as follows.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.950
Madame Taubira spoke of how
France's centralized governance

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.350
made action possible.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:41.010
Can each of you reflect on
the differences between action

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:44.100
that comes from the
top and action that

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.350
begins at the grassroots?

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.362
How are these forms different?

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:57.592
- I'll try to answer
with my English.

01:03:57.592 --> 01:03:58.840
- Your English is impeccable.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.050
- That is a light luggage.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.740
I do believe that
it's very important

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:14.960
that the citizens feel concerned
by this topic, because it's

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.780
about their lives, their
history, our history, our past.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.230
But let's go.

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:30.200
Let's watch-- what
was this past?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.170
It was public organization--

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.570
states, public companies.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.640
It was a monarchical time.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:48.320
Maybe I must thank the
Consul General de France.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.060
He maybe will help me
between French and English?

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:58.610
And I see him.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:04.750
I see that the
ambassador is there, too.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:08.360
I'll try to explain.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:13.970
Slave trade and slavery
were organized by the state.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.244
It was a public activity.

01:05:20.244 --> 01:05:24.740
The societies were organized
around this activity.

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.367
It was a main economic activity.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:37.880
And moreover, there was at this
time in the European countries,

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:44.890
there were every time wars
between them, every time.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:49.900
The countries were
not still stabilized.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:57.300
And all of them agreed that when
they have a conflict, they call

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:03.990
the Pope, the
Vatican, no [FRENCH]

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:08.880
And the Pope was the one
who said the king here

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.960
and the king here who
are fighting, you stop.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.760
Because I say that,
you, I give you that.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.320
You, I give you that.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.900
That's what happened
between Spain and Portugal

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:32.750
when the Pope decided the
Tordesillas Treaty, which

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:35.230
divided South America--

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:39.580
not only South America, South
America and Africa, too--

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.670
divided the west for Portugal--

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:50.910
and the east for the Portugal
and the west for Spain.

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:56.530
So that's the way it was
working at this time--

01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:01.140
the government, the
monarchy, the Pope.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.400
So today, when we
deal with this issue,

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:11.520
we can't just do it between
citizens, between associations,

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.270
between--

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:19.600
we need that public power
say something about it,

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.310
organize a few things about it--

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:26.990
such as teaching in the
schools and the university,

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:33.770
and helping researchers,
teachers to make research

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:37.310
and to help us to understand,
to know very well,

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:38.710
and to understand.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:45.120
Not to be irked by that,
but to feel stronger--

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.650
to feel stronger, to understand
that we are survivors,

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.890
that we're invincible.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:55.130
I should say that
we are immortal.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:57.280
How do you say this is English?

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.380
Immortal.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.220
It's OK.

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.510
Generation from generation,
we are immortal.

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:07.040
That means that we grow
stronger, stronger,

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.120
and stronger--

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.820
so next generation, stronger
than the former one.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.260
That's a rarity of this history.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:21.180
So we need the implication of
the states to organize that,

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:26.840
to make it penetrating
the world society.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.917
That's what I think.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:30.310
- Thank you.

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:36.260
- Three years ago, the
governments of CARICOM

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.649
agreed to confront
this history--

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:45.210
not only in respect of
financial institutions,

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.660
academic institutions,
and the legacy of slavery

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:54.410
and colonization,
but to see how they

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.399
can play a role in furthering
what is really a civil society

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.170
discourse.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.720
Governments had been
reluctant to participate

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.600
in this conversation
for a hundred years.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.569
As I said we still in an age in
which the colonial structures

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:16.060
are still very much a part
of the Caribbean world.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.350
My friend here,
I'm from Barbados.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.290
Just 15 minutes away
from Barbados by flight

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.930
is Martinique.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.640
You arrive at
Martinique, and there's

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.520
an enormous, oppressive
sign at the airport which

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.310
says welcome to France.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.859
And we find that
very offensive--

01:09:36.859 --> 01:09:42.160
to arrive in the neighboring
island and welcome to France.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.210
That is extremely
horrific for us,

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:47.149
who have fought for
our independence

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.569
and who have
established our nations.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:51.920
Now, so there is
this conversation

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.250
of ongoing colonial aggression.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.400
But each time governments
come on board,

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.990
they do so not to initiate.

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:05.690
They do so to join an
existing conversation,

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:10.820
where public opinion has
tilted in a certain direction.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:17.890
And in respect of
confronting this history,

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:22.690
I would say that for the better
part of the 20th century,

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:26.830
the political posture of
most governments-- colonial

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:30.400
and the first generation
of independent states--

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.670
was let us forget the
history and move on.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:38.160
There was this pedagogy
of forgetfulness.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.850
Let us put the past
behind and let us move on.

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:43.560
Civil society was saying no.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.960
But we are living with
this history every day.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.070
We need to deal with it.

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:49.150
The governments were
saying, no, let's move on.

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:53.040
And we had this enormous
rift between civil society

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.690
and governments.

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.090
Then suddenly, the governments
came on board, because

01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:03.090
of a realization that
you're caught in a trap.

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:07.400
You do not want to look back
and you cannot go forward.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.200
And if you cannot move forward
and you don't want to go back,

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.790
where are you?

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:13.590
And therein lies
this conversation

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:16.780
that it has to be addressed.

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.540
And, therefore,
the question of all

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.670
of these institutions--
and not only the

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:24.360
academic institutions
but the churches.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.230
We are living in a world
in which the largest--

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:30.360
some of the largest slave
owners in the Caribbean

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.550
were clergymen.

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:37.910
In Barbados, my island,
the largest slave owner

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:42.620
in the decade of emancipation
was a Reverend John Brathwaite,

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.940
a well-known theologian.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.870
The Church of England and
its corporate identity

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:55.340
was the owner of 3,000
slaves on the island.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.990
It bought and sold them
in many of thje same ways.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:01.040
The slaves were stamped C of E--

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.310
Church of England, and it was
stamped on their back, Church

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:05.270
of England.

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:07.410
So these are the histories.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.470
And, yes, the academic discourse
is a part, the university

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:15.020
and slavery, the church and
slavery, the banks and slavery,

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.900
the industrial
corporations and slavery.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.570
All of these major
institutions in our ecologies

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.820
were built upon slavery
and sustained by it.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.760
So this-- the
university and slavery--

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.750
is a part, an element of a
wider conversation, which I hope

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.690
we can also get to.

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.270
- Max, would you like
to add something?

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:35.000
- Thanks.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.360
I'm going to interpret
the question perhaps

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.170
a little more in the context
of the theme of slavery

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:42.110
and universities.

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:48.320
And I think one of
the challenges is--

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.920
within a university is the
idea of academic freedom

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.330
and the autonomy
of universities.

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:58.040
And so, one question is, what
should the role of government

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.100
be in relation to
universities when it is--

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:06.770
if it wishes to memorialize, or
to encourage debate, or to push

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.840
a particular line?

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:13.130
For example, the law that
we heard passed in France

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:17.190
that every school child should
have in their curriculum

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:19.970
knowledge of the
history of slavery

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:22.370
is certainly an example
of leading from the top

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:24.140
and imposing from the top.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.510
I think that the universities,
in our environment,

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:29.750
would be very reluctant
to be told what they have

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:33.710
to teach and to have a
central government determine

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:34.280
a curriculum.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.780
Now, I know that
the law probably

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.420
applies to the schools,
not to universities.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.070
I don't know if that does apply
to the universities in France.

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:43.520
But in trying to answer
your question more directly,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.010
I think that, with
respect to universities,

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:49.930
the question of authority
top-down, the autonomy

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:53.120
of universities and the
issues of academic freedom

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.720
raise other issues,
which for me are

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.470
very precious, core to the
values of these institutions.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.410
And so, I would not
want to see that kind

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.790
of central authority exercised.

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.200
And, in fact, I think
it trickles down

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.890
within the institution, too.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:14.360
And part of the challenge for
all of us as university leaders

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.720
is that you can't--

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.680
it's not easy to lead
from the top, in the way

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.180
you march in a
corporate environment

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.790
or in a political
environment, to say

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:25.130
we will transform the
curricula in this way,

01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:28.020
or we will de-colonize
in that way,

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.210
or we will reflect
our relationship

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:33.770
with slavery in the other.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:37.700
Because academics themselves
value and treasure

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.130
the autonomy to teach
what they want to teach,

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:43.160
and who they want to teach,
and how they want to do that.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.590
And so, I think that the
role of university leadership

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:52.130
has to be much more one of
mobilizing, and persuasion,

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:58.800
and cajoling, and building a
consensus, building a movement.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.240
Certainly, if we look
at how, in our own case,

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.830
the debates around Rhodes--

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:07.642
the Rhodes statue and other
examples that I gave--

01:15:07.642 --> 01:15:09.350
some have not been
successful, because we

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.990
haven't been able to
build sufficient support.

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:16.040
Some quickly caught on.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.000
Many of the successes
have become successes

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.340
because they started as
grassroots activities, which

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.755
gathered support, found a
sympathetic ear, I think,

01:15:27.755 --> 01:15:30.500
[? here ?] in most
cases, but could not

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:36.010
have been successful if it
wasn't a dialectical process.

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:42.630
- I think I have a
slightly different approach

01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:43.710
to this issue.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.100
In our university's
charter, there

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:56.860
is reference to the
institution being

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:02.220
expected to be not only
excellent but also ethical.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:09.460
And within this discourse of
been excellent and ethical,

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.560
and we have focused,
generally speaking,

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.400
as university administrators
on the discourse about been

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.620
excellent and all of the
quality assurance systems

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.580
we put in place, and we
invest significant resources

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.480
in the trajectory
towards excellence.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.390
But we tend to get
a bit soft, I think,

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.770
around how we interpret
the ethical part.

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:36.900
Now, I believe that, in
respect of slavery, that--

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:40.540
and colonization, apartheid,
and all of these other crimes

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:47.200
against humanity, we have
exercised a very low level

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.560
of expectation.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.420
And it has always been
strange to me why,

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.930
in respect to many of the
crimes of the 20th century--

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:03.970
for example, we
showed a level of rage

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.550
and we don't show the
corresponding rage in relation

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:08.870
to slavery.

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:13.750
I do not believe that
any president or provost

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:23.684
in this country would accept
a monument of a Nazi general

01:17:23.684 --> 01:17:24.350
on their campus.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:32.590
I believe that if you
examine the economic history

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:33.520
of this country--

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.490
and in the first phase
of nation-building,

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:41.032
all of the monuments of King
George and the British generals

01:17:41.032 --> 01:17:41.740
were taken down--

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.700
the Duke of Portland,
the Duke of Marlborough,

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.990
all of these British
warmongers, all these generals

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:54.080
were taken down from
the public spaces,

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.440
taken down from the public
squares and from the campuses.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.630
Because the nation
was emerging and it

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:05.840
was intolerant of
British imperial symbols.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.950
Even the game I love, cricket,
was removed from this country.

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:13.550
Because Abraham Lincoln
said I have no doubt cricket

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:15.860
is a greater game than
baseball, but alas, it

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.610
will not serve our purposes.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.720
It is a British
colonial product.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.910
It must go.

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:26.060
So all of that took place in the
first stage of nation-building.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.160
Now we come to this stage
and all the monuments

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.170
of the slave owners are there.

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:31.580
Why is there this tolerance?

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.730
Why did we-- why are we
tolerating slave owners

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.800
on our campuses and
we don't tolerate

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.850
British imperial
generals on our campuses?

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.960
Why did we take down King
George and we cannot take down

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.450
Jefferson?

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.610
Why is that so?

01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:52.410
If we confront that
fact and we say,

01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:55.620
OK, this is the second phase
of American nation-building.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.670
Let us now look at how we
deal with our environment.

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:01.350
Those who say take
down the monuments

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:03.141
are not doing something
for the first time.

01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:06.775
This is the second phase of
the monument's discussion.

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:08.400
And the first phase
was very effective.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:16.500
I think that sometimes we
hide behind our prejudices

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.380
and we find very skillful
academic reasons to say

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.480
we must not act.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.410
We must not act, we cannot act
because academic freedom, blah,

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:25.350
blah, and so on.

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:29.040
Which I respect,
but the threshold

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.340
is always oftentimes
too low on the questions

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.300
of the black history.

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.460
We set a low threshold.

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.680
I would not be a part
of a conversation that

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.740
would defend Jewish--

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.320
defend those persons
who committed atrocities

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.820
against the Jewish people.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:48.100
I would not have those
monuments on my campus.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.900
I don't think my students would.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.580
Those persons who
committed crimes

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.070
against the African
peoples by enslaving them,

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:57.740
that is the same threshold,
the same level of threshold we

01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:00.257
hold for those who
committed war crimes

01:20:00.257 --> 01:20:01.340
against the Jewish people.

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.520
We hold that same
threshold against those

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.720
who committed crimes
against the African peoples,

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.750
and we keep a common standard.

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:10.510
So I do not accept
this notion that people

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:16.050
like Cecil Rhodes, who was
really, in fact, effectively

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.550
a genocidal maniac, really--

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:21.760
people like Cecil Rhodes can
be defended by any principal

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.850
or provost that we have
Cecil Rhodes on our campuses

01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:28.620
because our intellectual
freedom says let him stay.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:34.230
I'm sure that if you apply the
same threshold that you have

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.620
applied to the Holocaust
against the Jewish people

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.710
to the African people, you would
have a different conclusion.

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:42.920
And I say one final
point on this.

01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:49.430
When the Nuremberg Trials
were about to commence

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.770
and the judges were having
tremendous difficulty

01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:55.580
in litigating this crime
against the Jewish people,

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:59.180
there was no precedent
in law for these crimes.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.380
There was no jurisprudence
they could use.

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.060
There was no body
of legal thought

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.240
to guide them through this.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.290
And they were becoming
a bit disillusioned.

01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:12.230
And one of them actually
said, in the midst

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:15.350
of their despair of not
knowing how to proceed,

01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:18.890
we are walking into the
desert and somewhere out

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:20.840
there there is water.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.040
Let us go and find it.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.539
And with that metaphor, they
moved through those trials

01:21:26.539 --> 01:21:28.080
and brought those
persons to justice.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.620
Now, I believe
that all of us who

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.610
are leaders of
university institutions,

01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:36.840
we are walking into the desert.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.910
And somewhere in
that desert, there

01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:41.930
is an oasis we need to find.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:45.450
And I think we should brace
ourselves, prepare ourselves,

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.020
and walk into the desert.

01:21:50.628 --> 01:21:53.340
- Let me move to
the next question.

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.080
- No, no, no.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.160
It's very important,
because it's--

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.740
- Well, go ahead.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:03.870
- I'm quite sorry, but yes,
it's about the question

01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:08.160
of the government who
says what to teach.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.600
It's not the point.

01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:19.350
I mean, what I said, what I
explained about this law that

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:23.190
compels the government
to organize teaching

01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:30.720
of this history is not to teach
what the government think.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:37.710
It's putting the agenda, and
the teachers make their job.

01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:40.920
And in the same
article, the government

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:47.580
is compelled to finance
research and cooperation,

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.450
in order to know exactly,
to know this history, all

01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:54.180
these aspects of this history.

01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:00.720
So it's not a government that
decides what people must know,

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.580
but to stop not knowing
anything about it, to stop that.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.800
Because it's very
important for people

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.210
to know children, and teenagers,
and people to know what

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:15.020
is this history.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:18.920
Because this history is
the key to understanding

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.810
the present world--

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:23.190
the present world.

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:25.300
I mean, just to--

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.570
I'm not a Martiniques.

01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:29.420
But I'm not sure there
is Martiniques in there.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:35.610
But let me tell you,
we cannot wonder why--

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:42.200
it seems to me that the chief of
state in your country is still

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:48.680
the [NON-ENGLISH] the
queen of Great Britain,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.560
and your countries, and all
the Caribbean countries belong

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.550
to commonwealth.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:24:04.881
That's at the 20th and 21st
century, that's the trust.

01:24:04.881 --> 01:24:05.755
How do you say trust?

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.590
Trust?

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:10.100
- Trust.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:10.750
- Trust?

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:13.900
Yes, trust of this history.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:19.690
And I don't think that
stigmatizing a whole people

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:24.170
is a way to escape of the
traces of this history.

01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:30.600
There are kinds of links
different between ex-metropolis

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.090
and ex-colonies.

01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:38.760
And that the way it is, it's a
question of collective destiny.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.920
It's not a question of judgment.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.190
What I think is very
important for the government

01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:51.750
to be involved in this history
in teaching the history--

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.750
not the content, but the
teaching, and searching,

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:58.200
and knowing more and more.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.340
It's because it's at
the level of a state you

01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:07.485
may have the means to
know exactly what it was.

01:25:07.485 --> 01:25:09.540
It was violence, sure.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.220
It was violence.

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.150
It was quite awful, horrific.

01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:19.440
But it was resistance.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.420
It was resilience.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.610
It was creativity.

01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:25.830
It was music.

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.150
It was art.

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:29.040
It was literature.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.580
It was singing,
joy, and happiness,

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:39.300
and fighting, and
crying, and laughing.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.130
It was all that.

01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:42.780
And we have to know it.

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.670
We have to invest
in all of that.

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:50.040
We have to know all these people
bring to the world humanity--

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.560
languages, new languages,
new religions, new hearts,

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.460
and new music--

01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.250
jazz, blues, rag time, soul,
salsa, calypso, everything.

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:06.170
We have to know that to
understand what we bring.

01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:09.090
That's why we are invincible.

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:10.740
But we have to know that.

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.570
We have to share it.

01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:15.690
We have to give it
to our children.

01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:17.640
So I can't do it myself.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.460
An association
can't do it itself.

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:27.540
We need the public means to know
all of this, to know how rich

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.670
and how strong we are.

01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:33.315
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:39.680
- I don't think we could
have ended on a better

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.390
place than this one.

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:44.300
I want to thank the three
panelists for being with us

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.330
today.

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.018
Thank you.

01:26:46.018 --> 01:26:48.946
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:48.946 --> 01:26:50.410
- I'm sorry.

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:53.830
- I just sent it to ask you
another question, that's all.

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:57.261
- Thank you very
much, Alejandro.

01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:59.390
You can take your seats.

01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:04.412
Thank you for that fantastic
panel, all three of you--

01:27:04.412 --> 01:27:05.386
all four of you.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.260
My name is Dan Carpenter.

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.020
And I teach in the government
department here at Harvard,

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.410
and I direct the social sciences
academic ventures faculty

01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:27.450
director at Radcliffe.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:29.700
And I want to offer--
before giving some thanks--

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:35.010
two reflections on today, one
personal and one professional.

01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:37.200
I learned so much today.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.000
This isn't my field
of study, primary.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.040
But what I learned about
actually my own past

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.060
in listening to stories about
Georgetown and other places

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.550
was a way of putting together
parts of a larger story.

01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:54.450
I grew up in a small
town, a very small town

01:27:54.450 --> 01:28:00.750
of about 800 people in Northern
Michigan, entirely white.

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:04.980
I then went to college at
Georgetown in Washington DC.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:08.070
I then went to graduate school
at the University of Chicago,

01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:10.027
the south side of Chicago.

01:28:10.027 --> 01:28:12.360
And then my three academic
jobs have been at Princeton--

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.680
which we heard a lot
about yesterday--

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.846
University of Michigan, and
now, of course, Harvard.

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.320
I learned today that
every place along the way

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.630
of my own academic journey was
spent at an institution that

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:37.570
supported me, housed me,
educated me, credentialed me,

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:41.650
and that owed its
existence, or its endowment,

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:46.080
or its buildings to
slavery, and/or which

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.380
sat amidst, but
comfortably isolated

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:52.110
from structures of
racial oppression

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:54.390
right in its neighborhood.

01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:57.000
And I had limited, partial
awareness of these stories

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:57.810
today--

01:28:57.810 --> 01:28:59.790
before today, excuse me.

01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:01.680
I knew some about
Georgetown's history

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.430
when I was there as a student.

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:06.180
I knew a bit about
Chicago's environment

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:10.350
and what Ta-Nehisi Coates
referred to as Rob Sampson's

01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:16.080
important research on racial
segregation in Chicago.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.450
I knew something-- many
thanks to Sven Beckert

01:29:19.450 --> 01:29:22.890
about the history of Harvard.

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.450
But today gave me
the opportunity

01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:28.350
to weave these threads
together into a fabric, which

01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:32.730
like a wampum belt or maybe
even a [INAUDIBLE] cloth,

01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:33.660
I could read.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.970
And what a sobering
reading that is

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.270
to know that my entire-- just
my entire educational career

01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:43.320
has been spent at a lineage of
institutions supported, funded,

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:48.080
subsidized, structured
by slavery themselves.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.830
And that is one that
I'm going to continue

01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:51.810
to read in the months,
and years, and weeks

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:55.626
to come, just as a person,
as a student, as a scholar.

01:29:55.626 --> 01:29:57.750
And I hope that today's
conference has given others

01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:01.710
the ability to read anew
our past, individual

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:04.530
and collective, our president,
and our universities,

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:07.400
and what they ought to
do with their futures.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.800
I hope, as a professional
remark, and second,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.790
that we can move--

01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:13.520
as Ta-Nehisi Coates
said we should--

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.360
to forms of reparation,
and that we universities

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.170
think more thoroughly, and
elaborately, and specifically

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:23.480
about what to do next.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.010
Let me say as a
political scientist

01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:27.710
that I don't think that
conversation about slavery

01:30:27.710 --> 01:30:29.210
in the university--

01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:34.420
either interrogating its past or
discussing its future repair--

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.450
can advance without
consideration of the state.

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:42.070
And here, I am so thankful
that Madame Taubira just stole

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:45.430
my point 10 minutes ago,
and said it far better

01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:48.520
than I'm about to
convey it to you now--

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.640
the state by which I mean our
government, our political,

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.050
judicial, and administrative
institutions, our laws.

01:30:56.050 --> 01:31:01.060
As the histories inform us,
slavery prevailed and profited,

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:05.880
in part, because laws defined
bodies of color as property.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.190
And the state
enforced those laws

01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:12.210
and legitimated those
bodies rendered as assets.

01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:17.550
Expanding the geographies
of slavery with armed force,

01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:19.890
and with treaties
and other strategies

01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:22.920
of Native American
dispossession,

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.980
structuring the contracts
by which slaves were sold,

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:30.210
including the
Georgetown sale of 1838,

01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:33.750
and were executed
and made enforceable.

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:39.480
Enslavement was
government, I think, maybe.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.730
Beyond the history, it seems
difficult to think about

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:45.870
repair, given the enormous
weight of slavery and its

01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:48.930
legacies-- that Mr.
Coates talked about

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:50.310
in today's keynote--

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:52.560
without considering
the role of powers

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.940
that can possibly bear
some of that weight.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:59.060
Not just the resources but the
authority of our governments

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.880
and their ability-- like that
of universities-- to host

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.820
and structure free
dialogue must be

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.980
brought to any repair effort.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:10.290
Now, exactly how that
enlistment of the state occurs,

01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:13.070
of course, is something
probably for another conference

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:14.090
altogether.

01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:17.030
And invite those
far better equipped

01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:22.350
and more knowledgeable than I
am to advance that discussion.

01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:25.050
I now want to turn to
acknowledge the many people who

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:27.840
made today happen.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.480
The Office of the President
and Provost at Harvard

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.250
made the decision to
hold this conference,

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:34.470
and they funded it
and supported it.

01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:37.440
I want to thank President Drew
Gilpin Faust and Provost Alan

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:41.190
Garber for putting their
enthusiasm and their commitment

01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:42.090
into this event.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:44.920
Thanks to both of you
for your leadership.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:47.550
It's not a coincidence, I
think, that this happened.

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:52.860
This event, this committee,
this searching examination

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:56.550
of Harvard's history happened
under the university presidency

01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:58.680
of a historian.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:06.480
And I know, and we all know,
that President Faust has

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.210
expressed great
concern and an interest

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:11.820
in issues of racial justice
for her entire life,

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.080
going back to her childhood.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.730
So, again, Drew, thank you.

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:21.630
Dean Liz Cohen graciously and
energetically took up the call

01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:23.774
from President Faust
and Provost Garber,

01:33:23.774 --> 01:33:25.440
and brought her
training and perspective

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.350
as herself, a renowned
historian of the United States,

01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:29.010
to the event.

01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:31.200
And let me just say it is
a privilege and an honor

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.000
to work with her.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.270
Sven Beckert and Evelyn
Brooks Higginbotham,

01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:38.970
thank you for so much
for your hard work.

01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:40.950
You have changed
the conversation

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:43.330
at Harvard and the way that
we think about ourselves.

01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:45.330
And it's an honor to have
collaborated with you.

01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:49.080
Thanks for bringing a political
scientist along for the ride.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.490
I greatly appreciate it.

01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:56.640
Radcliffe Institute,
if I may say--

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.250
having spent a number of
years here both as fellow--

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:02.820
is really a wonder to behold,
especially in its ability

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.590
to host conferences.

01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:07.950
All of the speeches and
conversations you saw today,

01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:11.340
and many of the things that
you didn't and that I didn't,

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.860
happened because this
institute marshals

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.790
such intense and passionate
commitment from many people,

01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:21.930
from those who plan, those who
cater, those who broadcast,

01:34:21.930 --> 01:34:25.020
those who wire the
event, who clean up.

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.710
These people are ably led by
Rebecca Wasserman and her staff

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:32.250
at Radcliffe Institute
Academic Ventures,

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.490
by [? Nisha Mongia ?]
and [? Chandra Manning ?]

01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:36.870
in the office of the dean.

01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:39.970
Thank you also [? Chandra, ?]
who served on the committee--

01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:43.350
by [? Jessica Vickland ?]
and her crew in events.

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:46.440
And thanks to the many
speakers and moderators

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.100
who gave their time and
talent to our event today.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.630
Finally, thanks to those of
you who listened and entered

01:34:51.630 --> 01:34:54.930
into today's dialogue, who
took the time to join us.

01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:57.352
The conversation, we
know, will continue.

01:34:57.352 --> 01:34:58.336
Thank you.

01:34:58.336 --> 01:34:59.812
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.430
- It's been an incredible day.

01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:11.310
I think we've all been left
with a lot to think about.

01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:15.170
And I hope conversations
will only now begin, not end.

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:21.290
But I think it's time to relax,
to have some food and drink.

01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:22.940
And you've earned a reception.

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.090
So please join us
next door for one.

01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:28.420
Thanks again for
coming, and I hope

01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.170
we'll see you again
soon at the Institute.

01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:33.220
