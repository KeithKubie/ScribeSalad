00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.335
- I'm Poppy.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.871
(loud poof)

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.038
Oh, hello.

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.373
What's your name?

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.541
- Um, Andrew Luce.

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You look like you
make electronic music.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.381 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well, yeah, I
happen to be a DJ.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
(upbeat synthesizer music)
Whoa!

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.386
- Do they play your
music on the radio?

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.087
- Well, not yet.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.790
- If you get on the radio,
you'll be a lot more famous.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.893
- Okay, well, how do I do that?

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.260
- All you have to
do is keep doing

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
what people like
over and over again.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.798
- Oh, that seems easy.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:34.600
I know how to copy and paste.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.603
- Electronic DJs copy and paste

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.272
better than anyone
else on the planet.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.573
The only part of the song

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.708
that people care
about is the drop,

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:45.944 align:start size:84% position:16%
so make a drop over
and over again.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.413
- Why didn't I think of that?

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.982
- Because I'm Poppy.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.717
(upbeat electronic music)
- Hey, this is really easy.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.587
Wow, I can't wait until I'm
more famous like you, Poppy.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.125 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Being famous is really
fun, but everyone still dies.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.827
- Wait, what?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.295
- Forever.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.764 align:start position:0%
You never get to come back,
even though everybody tells you

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.500
that you get to live
forever in Heaven.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.068
- Can I leave now?

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.606
- Fame is important because
it validates our existence.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.574
- Please, can I go home?

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.910 align:start size:84% position:16%
I really don't wanna
do this anymore.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.945
- Everybody wants
to be remembered,

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.448
so some people dress up
as a cartoon character

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
in pursuit of likes
and followers.
