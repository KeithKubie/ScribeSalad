I spent a lot of time looking at foreign

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760
I spent a lot of time looking at foreign
 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.410
I spent a lot of time looking at foreign
models actually chaired this year the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420
models actually chaired this year the
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.900
models actually chaired this year the
health governor's at the World Economic

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910
health governor's at the World Economic
 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.760
health governor's at the World Economic
Congress in Davos and I'm the current

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770
Congress in Davos and I'm the current
 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.249
Congress in Davos and I'm the current
chair of the International Federation of

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259
chair of the International Federation of
 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.590
chair of the International Federation of
health plans and that's health plans

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600
health plans and that's health plans
 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.330
health plans and that's health plans
from 80 countries around the world and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340
from 80 countries around the world and
 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.250
from 80 countries around the world and
so I meet all the time with health plans

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260
so I meet all the time with health plans
 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.979
so I meet all the time with health plans
from from those other countries and I've

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989
from from those other countries and I've
 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.759
from from those other countries and I've
been looking hard to figure out which

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769
been looking hard to figure out which
 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.950
been looking hard to figure out which
attributes of those plans would fit in

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
attributes of those plans would fit in
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.600
attributes of those plans would fit in
the US and one of the things I've

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610
the US and one of the things I've
 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.130
the US and one of the things I've
learned from working with all those

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140
learned from working with all those
 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.560
learned from working with all those
countries is that every single one does

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570
countries is that every single one does
 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.899
countries is that every single one does
it a little differently so the model in

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909
it a little differently so the model in
 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.329
it a little differently so the model in
Germany looks a lot like the Netherlands

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339
Germany looks a lot like the Netherlands
 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.369
Germany looks a lot like the Netherlands
but it's not quite the same Austria

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379
but it's not quite the same Austria
 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.320
but it's not quite the same Austria
different than both those but quite

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330
different than both those but quite
 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.450
different than both those but quite
similar in fact the model that Governor

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460
similar in fact the model that Governor
 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.729
similar in fact the model that Governor
Schwarzenegger proposed in California

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739
Schwarzenegger proposed in California
 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.939
Schwarzenegger proposed in California
last year looks suspiciously like the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949
last year looks suspiciously like the
 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.869
last year looks suspiciously like the
Austrian model the every country does it

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879
Austrian model the every country does it
 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.760
Austrian model the every country does it
slightly differently but if I were going

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770
slightly differently but if I were going
 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.660
slightly differently but if I were going
to pick a model that I think would

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670
to pick a model that I think would
 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.240
to pick a model that I think would
transplant well it's actually the Dutch

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250
transplant well it's actually the Dutch
 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.460
transplant well it's actually the Dutch
model I think the Dutch have done some

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470
model I think the Dutch have done some
 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.480
model I think the Dutch have done some
really good things and the thing that

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
really good things and the thing that
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.010
really good things and the thing that
they have added to their model more

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020
they have added to their model more
 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.880
they have added to their model more
recently is a risk adjuster between the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890
recently is a risk adjuster between the
 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.800
recently is a risk adjuster between the
health plan so when the health plans go

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
health plan so when the health plans go
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.220
health plan so when the health plans go
out and recruit members and enroll

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230
out and recruit members and enroll
 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.120
out and recruit members and enroll
people the government in the end does a

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130
people the government in the end does a
 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.040
people the government in the end does a
an assessment who got the healthy people

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050
an assessment who got the healthy people
 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.990
an assessment who got the healthy people
who got the less healthy people and if

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000
who got the less healthy people and if
 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.880
who got the less healthy people and if
any health plan got a disproportionate

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
any health plan got a disproportionate
 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.260
any health plan got a disproportionate
number of healthy people they have to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270
number of healthy people they have to
 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.550
number of healthy people they have to
actually pay some money back into the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
actually pay some money back into the
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.670
actually pay some money back into the
pool and any health plan got too many

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680
pool and any health plan got too many
 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.470
pool and any health plan got too many
sick people they get more money from the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480
sick people they get more money from the
 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.930
sick people they get more money from the
pool and so what that does is strongly

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940
pool and so what that does is strongly
 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.210
pool and so what that does is strongly
encourage as we were saying earlier to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220
encourage as we were saying earlier to
 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.649
encourage as we were saying earlier to
health plans to go after the sicker

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
health plans to go after the sicker
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.899
health plans to go after the sicker
people and do a really good job taking

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909
people and do a really good job taking
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.340
people and do a really good job taking
your sick people because I know in the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350
your sick people because I know in the
 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.860
your sick people because I know in the
end they get a risk adjuster from the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870
end they get a risk adjuster from the
 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.719
end they get a risk adjuster from the
other plans that enrolled healthier

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729
other plans that enrolled healthier
 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.940
other plans that enrolled healthier
people so I think the Dutch model of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
people so I think the Dutch model of
 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.340
people so I think the Dutch model of
having a payroll deduction individual

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
having a payroll deduction individual
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.559
having a payroll deduction individual
choice health plans and then a risk

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569
choice health plans and then a risk
 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.930
choice health plans and then a risk
adjuster in the back end has a lot to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940
adjuster in the back end has a lot to
 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.640
adjuster in the back end has a lot to
offer it's a federal model they

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650
offer it's a federal model they
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.800
offer it's a federal model they
basically in the end of the year run the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
basically in the end of the year run the
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.030
basically in the end of the year run the
core information about each health by

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
core information about each health by
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.410
core information about each health by
how many diabetics that they have how

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
how many diabetics that they have how
 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.820
how many diabetics that they have how
many congestive heart failure patients

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830
many congestive heart failure patients
 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.900
many congestive heart failure patients
how many asthmatics they sort

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
how many asthmatics they sort
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.880
how many asthmatics they sort
the whole thing and then basically run a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
the whole thing and then basically run a
 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.550
the whole thing and then basically run a
formula and if you have enrolled a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
formula and if you have enrolled a
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800
formula and if you have enrolled a
disproportionate number of people with

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
disproportionate number of people with
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780
disproportionate number of people with
those expensive diseases in a high level

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
those expensive diseases in a high level
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.340
those expensive diseases in a high level
of morbidity they increase your payment

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
of morbidity they increase your payment
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.080
of morbidity they increase your payment
or it's a low level decrease your

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090
or it's a low level decrease your
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.650
or it's a low level decrease your
payment and actually we do that some

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
payment and actually we do that some
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.630
payment and actually we do that some
degree in this country on our Medicare

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
degree in this country on our Medicare
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330
degree in this country on our Medicare
Advantage program there's already we

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
Advantage program there's already we
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.950
Advantage program there's already we
have a risk adjuster formula that works

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960
have a risk adjuster formula that works
 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.930
have a risk adjuster formula that works
in America it's a pretty good formula

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
in America it's a pretty good formula
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.610
in America it's a pretty good formula
it's not perfect but it's a lot better

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
it's not perfect but it's a lot better
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.340
it's not perfect but it's a lot better
than no formula and so we we already

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
than no formula and so we we already
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.840
than no formula and so we we already
have a history of doing that we could

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850
have a history of doing that we could
 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.470
have a history of doing that we could
could adapt to the Dutch model fairly

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480
could adapt to the Dutch model fairly
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.660
could adapt to the Dutch model fairly
easy
