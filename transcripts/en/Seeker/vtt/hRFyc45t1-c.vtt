00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.670
Graphene is the sexy new wonder material that
seems to have a million and one uses.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.130
From thin flexible screens to solar cells
that work when it’s raining, people are

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.469
finding all sorts of potential applications
for this one-atom thick sheet of carbon.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.340
Now scientists have added another trick to
graphene’s repertoire; making seawater drinkable.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.750
Desalination is not a new concept; Israel
gets over a quarter of its fresh water from

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.220
the mediterranean sea.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.750
But graphene could make the whole process
much more efficient.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.650
The main technique used for large scale desalination
is called reverse osmosis.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.469
Normal osmosis is where water flows across
a semipermeable membrane to areas of higher

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.819
saltiness, if you were one of those kids that
poured salt on snails, causing the snail to

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:44.269
shrivel up as the water leaves its body, you’ve
seen it in action and also, dude, c’mon.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.739
The reverse osmosis used for desalination,
however, is when pressure is applied to saltwater

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.620
to force it in the directions it doesn’t
normally flow, through special membranes to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.570
areas of lower salinity, separating the H2O
and telling the salt Na Na Na Na, hey hey

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
hey, goodbye…

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.449
Get it because sodium is…

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.449
NA.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.250
Anyway, this all sounds great but it’s not
perfect: water from desalination is very expensive,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.410
costing anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 per
acre foot, which is about the amount of water

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.180
10 people use in a year.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.190
Generally it’s cheaper to just use less
water and recycle the water you do use, but

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.460
for some particularly dry places there’s
no other option.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.010
Part of the expense comes from pre-treating
the water, but pumping the water through the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.560
jelly-roll-like plastic membranes uses a lot
of energy.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.120
Computer models have predicted that if we
could use super-thin graphene sheets instead

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.850
of these thicker membranes, the amount of
energy needed for reverse osmosis could be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.710
reduced anywhere from 15-46%.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.450
Less energy used for pumping means less expensive
water, and that could make a huge difference

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.240
to people in the world’s poorer and drier
places.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.760
Unfortunately reality doesn’t always cooperate
with computer models, and making graphene

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.850
that can separate water from salt isn’t
as straightforward as it appears.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.991
Researchers found that when their graphene
oxide membranes were submerged in water, they

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:57.320
swole a little bit.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.560
They would still filter nanoparticles, organic
molecules, and even larger salts but not the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.940
common salts found in seawater, which are
dangerous to drink because they just lead

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.150
to more dehydration.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.250
That’s normal osmosis at work again.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.110
But now new findings from the same group of
researchers have figured out how to prevent

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.260
the swelling and control the pore size.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.030
Now the dissolved salts and the water molecules
they bind to can’t get through the pores,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
but free water molecules can, and do so surprisingly
fast, which is a good thing when you’re

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.870
trying to make fresh water as quickly as possible.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
The researchers hope that their discovery
can make desalination more affordable, which

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.030
would be a huge boon to poorer drought stricken
countries who can’t afford to build billion-dollar

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.620
desalination plants.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.760
With climate change threatening to make droughts
even worse, graphene could do more than just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.720
make flexible screens, it could help saves
lives.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.140
