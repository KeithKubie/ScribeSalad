00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:40.900 align:start position:0%
and so finally it kind of deserved that
 

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.950 align:start position:0%
and so finally it kind of deserved that
so<00:13:41.770><c> I</c><00:13:42.250><c> think</c><00:13:43.030><c> that</c><00:13:43.150><c> need</c><00:13:43.330><c> to</c><00:13:43.450><c> review</c><00:13:43.690><c> a</c><00:13:43.750><c> lot</c>

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:43.960 align:start position:0%

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that need to review a lot

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:51.289 align:start position:0%
and I think anyone that gets to know him
 

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
and I think anyone that gets to know him
so<00:24:51.500><c> it</c><00:24:51.590><c> comes</c><00:24:51.740><c> across</c><00:24:52.010><c> those</c><00:24:52.730><c> same</c><00:24:53.090><c> elements</c>

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:53.690 align:start position:0%
so it comes across those same elements
 

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
so it comes across those same elements
but<00:24:54.010><c> even</c><00:24:55.010><c> with</c><00:24:55.159><c> that</c><00:24:55.309><c> said</c><00:24:55.370><c> there's</c><00:24:55.820><c> things</c>

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.090 align:start position:0%
but even with that said there's things
 

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
but even with that said there's things
you<00:24:56.240><c> still</c><00:24:56.480><c> admire</c><00:24:56.840><c> about</c><00:24:57.080><c> him</c><00:24:57.490><c> and</c><00:24:58.490><c> and</c><00:24:58.820><c> it's</c>

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:58.970 align:start position:0%
you still admire about him and and it's
 

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.789 align:start position:0%
you still admire about him and and it's
just<00:24:59.179><c> this</c><00:24:59.539><c> constant</c><00:24:59.750><c> back</c><00:25:00.200><c> and</c><00:25:00.230><c> forth</c><00:25:00.470><c> and</c>

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
just this constant back and forth and
 

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.710 align:start position:0%
just this constant back and forth and
again<00:25:01.039><c> I</c><00:25:01.070><c> think</c><00:25:01.220><c> that's</c><00:25:01.490><c> the</c><00:25:01.760><c> fascination</c><00:25:02.330><c> I</c>

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
again I think that's the fascination I
 

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.509 align:start position:0%
again I think that's the fascination I
think<00:25:03.200><c> if</c><00:25:03.260><c> he</c><00:25:03.350><c> just</c><00:25:03.559><c> turned</c><00:25:03.799><c> over</c><00:25:04.190><c> a</c><00:25:04.220><c> new</c><00:25:04.370><c> leaf</c>

00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:04.519 align:start position:0%
think if he just turned over a new leaf
 

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.940 align:start position:0%
think if he just turned over a new leaf
and<00:25:05.179><c> was</c><00:25:05.480><c> like</c><00:25:05.690><c> oh</c><00:25:05.899><c> now</c><00:25:06.260><c> he's</c><00:25:06.500><c> always</c><00:25:06.649><c> nice</c>

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
