00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:03.187
 I will ask you a question that I think is interesting. 

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:06.286
 Did you happen to be in a room at room temperature, 

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.353
 say about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), 

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.814
 looking at a glass of water, 

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.270
 in which suddenly a cloud of ice appears? 

00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:16.138
 I guess you did not happen to see something like that. 

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.895
 Naturally, you can not see spontaneous ice formation, 

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:22.285
 especially at room temperature, 

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.619
 because it is above the freezing temperature of the water. 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.824
 But my question is - why not? 

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:28.659
 This does not contradict 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.352
 none of the physical laws of Newtonian physics. 

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:33.704
 Neither the first law of thermodynamics. 

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.194
 Let's think how this could happen. 

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.905
 Imagine some water molecules 

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:40.403
 in a liquid aggregate state. 

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:44.785
 I have some water molecules in the liquid state. 

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.260
 I'll do a lot of them. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.757
 They have a certain temperature. 

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.451
 Remember, the temperature is related to the average kinetic energy. 

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.725
 But each of these molecules will have its own speed, 

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.292
 own impulse. 

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.719
 Everybody will move 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.623
 in different directions. 

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.527
 They also have hydrogen bonds with each other. 

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.753
 This is why the water is liquid at room temperature, 

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.181
 and not in the gaseous state. 

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.607
 We have hydrogen bonds between molecules. 

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:14.234
 But I will not stop at this for a long time. 

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.187
 Imagine that all molecules bounce in random directions, 

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:20.950
 but there is some probability, 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.319
 they interact in the right way, 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.860
 maybe this molecule is here 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.158
 can hit this in the right way. 

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:33.187
 So it transmits most of its impulse to the faster molecule. 

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:37.460
 That's why this molecule loses its impulse and slows down. 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.584
 While this happens, 

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:41.349
 one of the other molecules can 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.112
 to pass the bulk of its impulse to some other molecules. 

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:45.710
 This will slow down. 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.168
 He'll be late. 

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:51.508
 Everybody will have a lesser impulse. 

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.586
 And then perhaps this, right at the same time 

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:54.921
 can do the same. 

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.217
 He 's late. 

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:03.396
 Then all the other molecules to which impulse is transmitted, 

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:04.627
 will move faster. 

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.984
 This has received an impulse. 

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:09.050
 That too. 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.187
 This is an impulse. 

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.218
 This one too. 

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:15.552
 And this impulse is transmitted. 

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.385
 Now these molecules here 

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.091
 have a small enough impulse and 

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.717
 slow enough, 

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:24.480
 so the hydrogen bonds 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.920
 take control and can begin 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.752
 to form a grid. 

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:30.917
 We can say that the molecules become cold enough, 

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.001
 to freeze. 

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:36.635
 So these molecules turn into ice. 

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.208
 Why can not this happen? 

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.980
 In the description I just spoke only about colliding 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.580
 molecules that impart impulses. 

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:45.708
 I am talking about energy that is not created and is not being waxed. 

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:49.086
 This seems consistent with the first law of thermodynamics. 

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.987
 It seems that in theory 

00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:56.087
 spontaneous ice formation is possible. 

00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:57.748
 But perhaps it is possible to look at the issue in another way. 

00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:01.056
 Maybe we can start with a system, 

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.554
 which is relatively homogeneous. 

00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:04.621
 There is an average temperature. 

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.618
 But perhaps it is possible to form a cold pocket, 

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:08.452
 when warming the rest. 

00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:12.905
 Maybe initially all water is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. 

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.909
 Everything I show you is at the neutral 70 degrees Fahrenheit. 

00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:20.793
 But maybe there's a chance ... 

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:23.127
 We have no creation or loss of energy, 

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:25.019
 but spontaneously part of the energy in the environment, 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.067
 can go to the outside and warm it up. 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.540
 I will color this in a different color. 

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.752
 Maybe all this water outside ... 

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:35.050
 maybe this is a painting of the water seen from above. 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.878
 Maybe all of this water gets hot. 

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:39.822
 Maybe all of this water gets hot. 

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:41.819
 And all the water in the middle is cold. 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.758
 But they have the same 

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:46.091
 common kinetic energy. 

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.321
 So we have not created or lost energy. 

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:51.084
 Just spontaneous 

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:54.160
 we managed to transfer energy from the middle to the outside. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.053
 And even when the water in the middle became a bit colder, 

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.154
 we could carry more energy 

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:02.821
 from cold water to hot. 

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:05.085
 We get this sort of arrangement. 

00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:08.220
 In fact, this seems possible 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.552
 according to the physics we know so far. 

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.640
 But some deep-seated people like these gentlemen here, 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.659
 this is Carnot, considered the father of thermodynamics. 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.946
 Kelvin, Rudolf Clausius. 

00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:23.673
 They have repeatedly found that this is not happening in nature. 

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:26.552
 Especially Kelvin and Clausius. 

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:28.421
 They say, "Look, we do not watch 

00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:33.750
 heat transfer from cold to warm. " 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.061
 "And if we do not see him, 

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:38.754
 let's add a second law of thermodynamics. " 

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:42.853
 The second law on thermodynamics is based on empirical observations. 

00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:44.385
 The second law on thermodynamics, 

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.813
 according to Rudolf Clausius, 

00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:47.253
 I will paraphrase it, 

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.157
 says we do not see spontaneously ... 

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.515
 I will write it. 

00:04:50.515 --> 00:05:00.105
 Second Law on Thermodynamics. 

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:02.560
 He said we did not see a spontaneous transfer 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.519
 of heat from cold to hot zones. 

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.155
 Second law on thermodynamics: 

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:13.380
 no spontaneous transfer ... 

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.761
 We can use work 

00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.693
 in things like cooling systems, 

00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:21.717
 to make the heat flow 

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:24.190
 from cold to warm, to cool something. 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:36.920
 But there is no spontaneous heat transfer from cold to warm. 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.455
 I will emphasize warmly 

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:42.487
 with orange here. 

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:44.020
 This law is based on observations, 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.552
 because we do not see this happening spontaneously, 

00:05:45.552 --> 00:05:49.221
 we can not see the water suddenly organizing in 

00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:51.415
 separate warm and cold zone, 

00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:52.948
 which would become so cold, 

00:05:52.948 --> 00:05:54.654
 to freeze spontaneously. 

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.117
 But if we put ice in the middle of the room 

00:05:56.117 --> 00:06:00.160
 at room temperature we see the opposite. 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.860
 We'll see a heat transfer from ... 

00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.166
 I'll draw a glass here. 

00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:08.656
 We will see heat transfer 

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.349
 from warmer to cooler areas. 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.502
 Here are cubes of ice. 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.400
 And that's water. 

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:21.770
 Here's the water. 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.980
 We will see heat transfer in the opposite direction. 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.846
 This is an empirical observation, 

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.388
 which seems to be true when tested experimentally. 

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:33.972
 But why is it happening? 

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:36.648
 It turns out there is 

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:39.991
 some very, very, very unlikely 

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:41.187
 this will happen 

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:42.894
 in the real systems we are talking about. 

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.053
 And thermodynamics is more a science of systems, 

00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:47.724
 not the individual molecules we talked about. 

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:48.710
 And when we talk about a system, 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.450
 we are talking about many more molecules, 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.260
 many more actors from these three molecules here. 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.415
 If we talk about the number of molecules in a glass of water, 

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:04.291
 we are talking about a number of 20, 24, 25 zeros, 

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:07.008
 depending on the size of the glass of water. 

00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:09.388
 We have a huge, huge number of molecules. 

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.955
 Statistical ... 

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:12.476
 Statistics were not thought 

00:07:12.476 --> 00:07:14.252
 to the time of Boltzman ... 

00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:17.747
 But statistically, the chance of this happening is small. 

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.417
 Especially when we are not talking about just three molecules, 

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:24.690
 but we talk about a lot, many more than three. 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.380
 So many molecules that we can never see something like this. 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.419
 Let's look at things at the molecular level. 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.184
 Do not just look at the macro level. 

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:37.943
 So we will understand the reason. 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.180
 If you have a vessel. 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.840
 I will draw a court here. 

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.533
 If you have a vessel, 

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:51.393
 and on the left, 

00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:54.766
 we will start with several molecules that are warm. 

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.076
 They have high kinetic energy. 

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.787
 These molecules here 

00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:02.707
 have high kinetic energy. 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.000
 These molecules. 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.580
 And on the right side of the court 

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:13.556
 we have some molecules that are the same type, 

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:15.536
 but have low kinetic energy. 

00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:17.695
 Their temperature ... 

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.791
 On average they have low kinetic energy. 

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.055
 There may be some that have high kinetic energy, 

00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:24.542
 but the average kinetic energy is low. 

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:28.823
 We see, 

00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.983
 that the temperature here is lower. 

00:08:30.983 --> 00:08:32.336
 I'll write it down. 

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:36.840
 The right side has a low temperature. 

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:39.992
 The left side has a higher temperature. 

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:41.490
 What will happen? 

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.591
 These molecules can interact, 

00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.054
 to collide. 

00:08:45.054 --> 00:08:47.190
 Molecules with high kinetic energy 

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.593
 will strike at others with low kinetic energy. 

00:08:49.593 --> 00:08:52.461
 And all these molecules will mix. 

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.654
 But even if they did not mix, these molecules would hit those 

00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:57.906
 and to carry their impulse. 

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:00.925
 So over time we will get 

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.706
 a system that looks like this. 

00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:05.894
 All molecules will have 

00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:10.190
 medium kinetic energy. 

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.150
 There will still be differences in their kinetic energies, 

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.890
 but they will not be separated in this way 

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.638
 between left and right. 

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:21.771
 All molecules will mix 

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:26.316
 and we will see that neither left nor right 

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.609
 will have a higher temperature. 

00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:31.157
 What is the end result? 

00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:33.479
 We had energy transfer 

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:36.643
 from warmer molecules to cooler ones. 

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:40.724
 Therefore, the energy we are talking about is warmth. 

00:09:40.724 --> 00:09:42.734
 We denote the heat with Q. 

00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:45.066
 We have transferred energy from warm to cold. 

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:48.514
 Statistically unlikely, very unlikely, 

00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:50.012
 nearly impossible, 

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.520
 this is an infinitely small chance to happen 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.900
 but it was not observed, to go backwards. 

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:58.972
 We are talking about many, many, many, 

00:09:58.972 --> 00:09:59.985
 We are talking about many, many, many, 

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:03.386
 millions, millions, millions, millions of molecules. 

00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:05.685
 We will see those with higher average kinetic energy 

00:10:05.685 --> 00:10:08.054
 to mix and deliver it 

00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:10.085
 of those with lower kinetic energy. 

00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.490
 That is why we can say, 

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.313
 "Hey, we do not see a spontaneous heat transfer 

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.555
 from cold to warm ". 

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:16.854
 The transfer always goes 

00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:20.111
 from warm to cold.
