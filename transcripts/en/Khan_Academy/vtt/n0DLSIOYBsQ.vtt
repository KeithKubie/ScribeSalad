00:00:00.532 --> 00:00:02.875
Voiceover: Let's review the unit circle definition

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.535
of trig functions a little bit.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.516
Right over here I've draw a unit circle, and when we say

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:11.367
a unit circle we're talking about a circle with radius one.

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.286
For example this point right over

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.359
here is the point one comma zero.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.970
X is equal to one, Y is zero.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.690
This point is the point zero comma one.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.412
This is the point negative one comma zero and

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:27.783
this is the point zero comma negative one.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.313
The radius over here, the distance from the center

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:33.014
of the circle which is at the origin to any

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:35.564
point in the circle or any point on the circle,

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:39.625
I should say, this radius is equal to one.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:43.156
The unit circle definition of trig functions

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:45.867
leverages this unit circle, that's why

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:47.677
it's called the unit circle definition,

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:50.937
and we saw that if we define an angle as the

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:53.258
bottom side of the angle being along the positive

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:56.035
x-axis and then the other side of that angle,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.767
thinking about where it intersects the unit circle.

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.271
Let's say this is the angle theta.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:07.302
We define sine of theta and cosine of theta,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:11.133
or cosine theta and sine of theta as the x and y coordinates

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.274
of this point at which this side of the angle,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.144
the side that is not the positive x-axis,

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.835
where that intersects the unit circle.

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:24.096
For example this point right over here. We would call this,

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.676
the x coordinate of this point,

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:27.736
so this value right over here,

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.486
we would call that cosine of theta.

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:36.137
The y coordinate of that point, which is this point

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:41.588
right over here, we would call that sine of theta.

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:43.118
In the previous videos on the unit circle we

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.968
talked about why this is really just a natural

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.119
extension of the so cah toa definition.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.309
What's useful is it starts to work for negative angles,

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.510
it even works for 90 degree angles, it works for angles more

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.961
than 90 degrees, it works for angles less than 90 degrees,

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.671
so it's really, really, really useful.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.841
What I want to do is leverage what we already

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:02.882
know about the unit circle definition of trig

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:06.713
functions to help prove the Pythagorean identity.

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:09.654
It almost falls out of the fact that this point right

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:14.124
over here is on a circle, a circle of radius one.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:16.965
What is the equation of a circle with

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.656
radius one centered at the origin?

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:25.697
Well the equation of that is x squared, x squared ...

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:28.858
We have other videos where we really prove this

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.569
using the distance formula, which is really

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.789
just an application of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.930
The equation of a unit circle centered at the origin

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.662
is x squared plus y squared is equal to one,

00:02:45.662 --> 00:02:48.303
is equal to the radius squared.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.014
This distance right over here is equal to one.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.354
We've already said that we're defining cosine of

00:02:54.354 --> 00:02:58.135
theta as the x coordinate of this point and we're

00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:00.356
defining sine of theta at the y coordinate of this

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:02.526
point and this point is sitting on the circle.

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:06.447
It has to satisfy this relationship right over here.

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:10.338
That means if we're defining cosine of theta to be the x,

00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:14.058
to be this x value, sine of theta to be the y value and

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:16.478
it has to satisfy this relationship that means that

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:24.747
cosine of theta squared plus sine squared of theta

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:29.389
needs to be equal to one.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.180
Or sine square theta plus cosine squared

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.181
of theta needs to be equal to one.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.040
That's just from the point.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.461
This is the x, cosine theta is the x coordinate,

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:38.212
sine theta is the y coordinate.

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:40.523
They have to satisfy this relationship

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.024
which defines a circle so cosine squared

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:46.446
theta plus sine squared theta is one.

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:49.803
This is called, as we've seen in other videos,

00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:53.174
this is called the Pythagorean identity.

00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:54.594
You say, "Why is that useful?"

00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:57.704
Well using this, if you know sine of theta you can figure

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:01.415
out what cosine of theta is going to be, or vice versa.

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:04.726
And if you know one of cosine of theta and then you could --

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:06.696
Say you know cosine theta then you use this to figure out

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:08.556
sine of theta, then you can figure out tangent of theta

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:11.347
because tangent of theta is just sine over cosine.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:14.627
If you're a little bit confused as to why this is called

00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:18.427
the Pythagorean identity, well it really just falls

00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:21.518
out of where the equation of a circle even came from.

00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:23.688
If we look at this point right over here,

00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:26.239
we look at this point right over here,

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:28.409
which we're saying is the x coordinate is cosine theta

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.039
and the y coordinate is sine of theta,

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.240
what is the distance between that point and the origin?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.079
Well to think about that we can construct a right triangle.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:41.390
This distance right over here.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.301
So that we could deal with any quadrant I'll

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.112
make it the absolute value of the cosine theta

00:04:49.112 --> 00:04:51.032
is this distance right over here.

00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:54.083
And this distance right over here is

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:57.206
the absolute value of the sine of theta.

00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:03.593
I obviously don't have to take the absolute value

00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:05.703
for this first quadrant here but if I went into the

00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:07.423
other quadrants and I were to setup a similar right

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:10.144
triangle then the absolute value is at play.

00:05:10.784 --> 00:05:12.975
What do we know from the Pythagorean theorem?

00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:14.295
This is a right triangle here,

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.006
the hypotenuse has length one,

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:18.106
so we know that this expression squared,

00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:22.987
the absolute value of cosine of theta squared,

00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:26.188
plus this expression squared, which is this length,

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:30.630
plus the absolute value of the sine of theta squared needs

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.203
to be equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared, which

00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:36.174
is the same thing which is going to be equal to one squared.

00:05:36.174 --> 00:05:39.685
Or we could say, this is the same thing.

00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:41.578
If you're going to square something the sign,

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.358
if negative it's going to be negative times a

00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:45.098
negative so it's just going to be positive so this

00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:47.329
is going to be the same thing as saying that the

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:56.170
cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is equal to one.

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:01.617
This is why it's called the Pythagorean identity.

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:02.837
Actually that's even where the equation of

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:05.528
a circle comes from, it comes straight out of the

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:10.701
Pythagorean theorem where your hypotenuse has length one.
