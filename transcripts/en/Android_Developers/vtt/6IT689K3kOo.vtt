[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.900
JONATHAN CHEUNG: Hi.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.430
I'm Jonathan Cheung, tech lead
on the Google Play Console

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.480
working on go-to-market tools.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.960
And I'm here today with
my colleagues, Ignacio,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.100
on the Play business
development team,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.950
and David, product
manager on Play Console.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.750
We're excited to talk to you
about what Play Console tools

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.080
you can take advantage of
when building and managing

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.180
your games.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.640
Fact-- in the last few years,
the number of Android players

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.150
who have installed a game
has more than doubled.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.710
Players from all
around the world

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.020
and from all
different backgrounds

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.500
are enjoying an unprecedented
amount of new gameplay

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.340
experiences on Android.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.420
As game developers, this
is your chance, your chance

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.550
to build new experiences,
to connect to more players,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.220
and to find success
in the market.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.830
Whether you're a new developer
building your first game

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.410
or a seasoned veteran
of the industry,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.680
the opportunity
is yours to grasp.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.560
That being said,
with opportunity

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.840
comes a degree of risk.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.000
Games development on mobile
is an ever changing landscape,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.940
and player expectations
of mobile games

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.270
has never been higher.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.100
There's more competition than
ever before in the marketplace.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.550
There are already one million
games live on the Play Store,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.630
and new games are launching
all the time on Google Play.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.530
Development costs are increasing
due to the demands of a higher

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.900
fidelity on mobile games.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.680
And consumers are expecting
more feature-rich experiences

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.450
on mobile.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.020
Finally, marketing games is
getting increasingly more

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.900
difficult. Use
acquisition spending

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.370
is increasing, as developers
are moving towards fewer, larger

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.930
launches in a single year.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.729
At Google Play, we
understand these problems

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.680
and want to help you where we
can to bring as much success

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.470
as possible to your games.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.080
We are committed
to building tools

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
to help you plan and
de-risk your launches

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.530
and to help you maintain
and support your games

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.260
after a successful launch.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.890
Let us take you on a journey
from pre to post-launch, which

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.890
will hopefully provide
some insights into some

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.640
of the exciting tools we
have available for you.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.630
We will be covering
some existing tools,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.510
share some interesting
anecdotes and best practices,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.940
and show off some
new tools, which

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.520
we feel will help you
on your road to success.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.860
First, pre-launch.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.280
This phase is critical
for making sure

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.850
you are delivering the right
experience for your players,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.600
whether that be in the
gameplay experience

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.070
itself, the stability and
performance of your game,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.460
or in the content
roadmap you have planned.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.950
We're going to be going
through some areas of focus

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.990
during pre-launch
and also walk through

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.950
some of these tools we feel
are helpful at this stage.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.720
First, and perhaps most
importantly, testing.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.660
It is crucial to get your
testing strategy right

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.880
when launching a new game.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.670
As you know, launching
and maintaining games

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.960
is an expensive proposition.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.230
It is critical to make
sure that, when you launch

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.340
your product, it will
be stable and bug free,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.700
resonate with your players
from a game play perspective,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.990
and have a sustainable roadmap
to keep your players invested

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.010
in your game.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.190
Internal testing allows you
to publish and distribute

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.300
your APKs in seconds,
instead of hours,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.340
so you can push your
daily builds to your team

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.020
immediately.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.110
It also features
integrations with our API

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.530
and other third-party
plugins, such as Gradle.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.130
Finally, it benefits from
all the Google Play products

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.839
you've come to love, such as
in-app product support, country

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:26.180
targeting, LVL, and of course,
the newly announced Android app

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.030
bundle.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.980
Developers are
using this new track

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.750
to do rapid, iterative testing
for launching new games,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.290
as well as for adding
features to existing games.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.570
For instance, using it to push
the daily builds to QA in order

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.700
to make sure the releases
meet their bar for quality,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.660
or using it to push experimental
builds to a group of friends

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.490
and colleagues in order to play
test new gameplay mechanics.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.320
Here are some things
to think about when

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.510
using internal testing.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.100
Its a great opportunity to
focus on stability and bugs

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.180
in order to judge every release
against your bar for quality.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.290
If possible, it can also
be useful to start testing

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.200
on a wide variety of
devices so that, when

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.540
you decide to roll
out to more players,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.240
you can be certain they will
receive the quality gameplay

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.460
experience that you will
want them to receive.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.590
One of our most used
feature for game developers

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.800
is closed testing.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.240
Closed testing is
a great opportunity

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180
to build a tight-knit
community of testers

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.090
who will be able to provide
you with valuable feedback

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.560
before and after launch.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.800
Users can be invited directly
from the Play Console,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.250
using email lists
or Google Groups.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.290
They can then opt-in via web
app, as shown in this picture.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.140
Once opted in, they can
install the game directly

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.360
from the Play Store.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.980
Over 60% of game developers on
Play already use this feature

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.194
and have found great
success with it.

00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:07.860
Let's take a quick
look at a case study.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.710
BRAVOCO, with the game,
"Forces of Freedom",

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.690
really took to
heart the philosophy

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.630
of building a strong tester
community for their closed

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.000
test.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.830
They focus on recruiting
the right sort of players,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.100
even reaching beyond the
usual online communities

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.590
to find the sort
of player they felt

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.980
would have affinity with the
theme of their game, which

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.990
is a military shooter game.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.100
As you can see in this picture,
they went to this airsoft event

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.900
and recruited players
on-site to play their game.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.250
During the testing
period, BRAVOCO

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.190
made sure that they
were available 24/7

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.180
via social media, and
especially instant messaging.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.830
This allowed them
not only to gather

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.860
very specific valuable
feedback, but also

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.847
to build connections
with individual testers

00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:01.430
of their game.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.370
This dedication to building
a strong test community

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.700
paid off dividends
both during testing

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.540
and even after launch
and early access where

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.070
"Forces of Freedom" has
now attracted more than 10

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.690
million players and counting.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.220
In conclusion, here
are some things

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.000
to think about when
using closed testing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.820
Create a strong and
diverse tester community.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.360
Remember, these players
will be critical in shaping

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.180
the initial direction
of your game.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.330
Experiment with new gameplay
mechanics and content.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.574
Don't be afraid of
negative feedback.

00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:41.990
Remember, your
ratings and reviews

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.550
are still not live
at this point.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.820
And finally, think
about reaching out

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.200
to your tester community to
gather very specific feedback.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.815
This is your chance to ask them
what works, what didn't work,

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:55.850
and how do we improve.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.310
Next, open testing.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.190
Once a game is technically solid
and your main gameplay hooks

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.010
are built in, it's time
to think about expanding

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.500
your test to more
players in preparation

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.750
for your big launch.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.980
Open testing allows your game to
be discoverable and installable

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.430
on the Play Store
and for players,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.380
after a developer defined
cap, to opt in and install

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.250
your game.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.910
Players won't be able to leave
ratings until the game fully

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.730
launches, but can provide
anonymous feedback

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.000
to the developer at any time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.309
Open testing comes
in two flavors,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.240
depending on the
state of your game.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.470
If you don't have a
production release already,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.330
or in the same country as
you are running your test in,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.800
users will be able to
install your game directly

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.160
from the Play Store
without needing to opt in.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.710
We call this early access.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.480
Your game will be
tagged as unreleased,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.470
as shown in this image.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.180
If you have a production
release already--

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.330
for instance, you may have soft
launched in the same country--

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.540
you can still continue
to use open testing.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.820
Existing users will continue to
get updates on the test track,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.560
and new users can opt in via
a console provided web link

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.700
or through the card, which
is shown on the screen

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.870
here at the bottom of
the game's details page.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.810
Players opted into an
open test in this state

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.840
will see the game
tagged as Beta.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.380
So bringing together
these forms of testing,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.830
of internal tests and closed
tests, you, as the developers,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.630
have control over who can
install and play your game.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.230
Early access tests
can be installed

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.170
and discovered directly
from the Play Store

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.110
and are a great way to
expand your tester base,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.590
as well as building hype
around your big launch.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.940
Finally, open tests can be
used to continue testing

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.950
with a wide audience, even
after your production release.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.140
Utilize these testers to try
out new features and tweaks

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.980
to your game before rolling
out to all your players.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.510
Moving on-- pre-launch
reports can also

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.810
help developers iron out
quality and performance issues

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.120
prior to launch.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.900
Whenever a test APK is uploaded
and nondeterministic bot

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.760
will crawl your game
while it's running

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.020
on a real physical device
in one of our test labs.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.730
Game developers have
found a lot of value

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.620
in the pre-launch report.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.560
90% of developers don't
push to production

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.430
if the report shows issues.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.420
Demo loops goes even
further for game developers.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.590
Record and upload a game demo
loop using Firebase test lab

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.340
and receive a PLR report on
crash and performance metrics,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.690
including the all important
frames per second.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.960
This allows you to discover
rendering issues even faster

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.770
and launch with
greater confidence.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.560
Half Brick Games, the
developers of titles

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.740
such as "Fruit Ninja"
and "Jetpack Joyride"

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.950
have found great
values in demo loops.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.510
They've evolved
their QA processes

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.880
around using PLR
demo loops, as it

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.020
allows them to check for
visual glitches, crashes,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.290
and performance, among
many other things.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.840
They rely on the fact that
PLR will automatically

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.740
run on a wide range of
devices and device specs

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.050
for every test release.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.150
So how did they do this?

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.630
Their new game, which
is "Endless Runner",

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.120
has a built-in
replay functionality

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.430
which are used to record and
save interesting game runs.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.410
With a few simple
lines of code, they

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:49.380
can instrument PLR demo loops to
run on these recorded sessions.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.750
Whereas before, it was
a very manual process

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.710
to kick off their benchmarking,
now, with PLR demo loops,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.002
it's automated for them
for every test release.

00:11:59.002 --> 00:12:00.960
They can look at these
metrics and compare them

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.990
to every previous
release to make sure

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.880
that their game has no
regressions in terms

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.460
of performance.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.350
Before we move
over to launching,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.860
another important
aspect of pre-launch

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.110
is to plan your
strategy around content.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:22.000
As such, don't be afraid to
test longer and to test earlier.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.040
Consider using longer term
metrics, like D14 and D30,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.190
in order to predict
future success.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.670
Measure the rate of content
consumption during your testing

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.900
phase.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.390
This can be useful
for planning ahead,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.550
so that you have enough
content for your players

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.240
when you launch until
your first big update.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.960
Also, this phase is
a great opportunity

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.540
to test what sort
of LiveOp events

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.700
will resonate with
your player base,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.920
so that you can create the
content your players will

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.750
want to receive.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.570
It is also important to consider
how different forms of testing

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.050
can be used to achieve
different purposes.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.230
All testing tracks can be used
in unison with each other,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.620
allowing you to target
different experiences

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.090
to different groups of testers.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.580
For instance, you
may want to consider

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.790
to run your daily builds past
your internal test track users

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.790
to check for regressions
at the same time

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.790
as you're running a large scale
open test with early access.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.370
Closed testing can also be used
to fine tune specific gameplay

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.310
mechanics with a select
audience before rolling out

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.490
to your production users.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.190
Finally, you should
always keep in mind

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.490
that mobile games development
is an ever-changing landscape.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.670
New technology is opening
up new ways to play,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.750
and player expectations on
mobile are ever changing.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.300
Remember to continuously
evaluate your processes

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.150
around development and testing.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.980
See what works,
what doesn't work.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.690
And most importantly, do
not be afraid of change.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.780
With that, I would
like to hand over

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.240
to Ignacio, who's going to talk
to you about launching games

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.868
on Google Play.

00:14:11.868 --> 00:14:13.275
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:17.264 --> 00:14:18.680
IGNACIO MONEREO:
Thanks, Jonathan.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.830
Hi, everyone.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.020
I'm Ignacio.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.390
I'm part of the Play
team based in London.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.040
And I have the
privilege and honor

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.530
to work with many game
developers, like you.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.380
So let's talk about
launching your game.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.960
I'm pretty sure that, by now,
you have tested and tested

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.190
your game.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:39.050
And you are 100% confident,
or let's say at least 95%

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.800
confident, that your game is
ready both from the backend

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.870
and frontend to
receive a lot of users.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.810
That as well, your
customer teams

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.670
are ready to manage
the community,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.740
create new live events,
or deal with the feedback.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.270
But above all, that your
game is lots of fun.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.710
And so you have a launch date.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.600
And it's still is scary, right?

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.290
So we are lucky in the Play
team, in the Play Console,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.750
you have some tools that
will help you to reach

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.500
those levels of confidence.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.670
And today, for the large part,
we're going to talk about three

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.812
in particular.

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.520
We're going to talk
about Device Catalog.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.560
We're going to talk
about preregistration,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.760
and then last,
country targeting.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.480
Let's look at them
in further detail.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.760
So device catalog-- this
feature, it's very popular.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.650
And the reason is because it
helps you make better decisions

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.460
when prioritizing back fixes and
delivering the right experience

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.050
for each device.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.790
Since launch last year, we have
seen that 66% of developers

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.490
are using it on a monthly basis.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.000
We all know that Android is
an incredibly rich ecosystem

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.070
with hundreds of manufacturers
and thousands of devices.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.130
So let's turn these
into an opportunity

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.380
and try to deliver the
best experience based

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.860
on relevant factors such
as SOC, RAM, or CPU.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.330
But during this process, there's
one key thing to remember,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.960
which is essentially
to think big.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.240
And what I mean by
think big is just

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.950
let's try to include as many
devices by default as possible.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.530
Excluding devices should
be a temporary measure

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.950
until some of these
bugs are fixed.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.750
Let's look at the
device detail page.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.130
The device detail
page is a feature

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.900
that allows you to
review individually

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.770
thousands of devices,
identify relevant criteria,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.780
such as RAM, SOC, or CPU.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.520
Since last year, we've
added new filtering methods,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.520
so for example, the screen size,
density, and application binary

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.750
interface.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.380
As well, since last year, we
added the unsupported reason.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.670
So you can very quickly
identify why a device

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.640
isn't supported by your game.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.250
Lastly, I wanted
to highlight also

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.490
some interesting information
that the device detail

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.480
page is providing--

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.610
essentially, the number
of active devices

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.060
in this particular game,
the average rating,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.930
and the revenues generated
by inner purchases

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.280
or subscriptions
in the last month.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.810
So what some of the developers
are saying about this.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.440
So Digital Legends, a mobile
developer from Barcelona,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.660
they actually launched a very
popular game, "Respawnables",

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.940
which was launched in 2014.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.730
And since then, they have seen
more than 30 million installs,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.250
and what is more important,
more than 2 billion battles

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.710
played by the players.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.350
So Digital Legends, two
or three times a week,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.690
they check the device catalog.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.650
And essentially,
they do three things.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.530
The first one, they
exclude those devices

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.980
that do not meet the minimum
requirements in order

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.010
to deliver a great
user experience.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.410
Then second, they
isolate the bugs.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:59.360
And then third, they prioritize
device support and, as well,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.320
these bug fixes.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.040
So thanks to this
feature, Digital Legends

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.730
has seen an increase in the
user experience and ratings,

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:13.050
as well on the overall quality
and performance of the game.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.830
So in conclusion, I wanted
to highlight three things

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.220
to remember.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.300
So the first one, think big,
and support as many devices

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.570
as possible.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.340
Second, if we have to
exclude some devices,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.370
try to do it in a temporary way,
so we can fix all those bugs

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.430
and increase our chances
to reach a bigger audience.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.310
And then last, use
the device detail page

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.010
to get very relevant
information, such as,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.970
for example, the unsupported
reason, or the average revenues

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.160
or average rating.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.890
And with this, let's move
onto the next functionality

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.060
feature--

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.170
preregistration.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.830
We all know that, in
gaming, creating excitement

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.750
before even launch
is increasingly

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.890
critical and popular.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.690
So the preregistration
feature has two benefits.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.590
As a player, it's clear.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.770
You can pre-register, and then
when the game is launched,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.890
you will receive a notification
to install the game.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.730
We all know that in certain
type of games, multiplayer,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.140
social games, competitive
games in general,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:21.970
it's critical to get
on early into the game.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.960
However, from a
developer perspective,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.390
I can see that there's
two main benefits here.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.440
The first one is you can start
marketing early and capture

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.600
the audience interest.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.420
As well, by monitoring
the pre-reg count,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.980
we have an indication of the
influx of users at launch.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.510
And we can plan ahead not
only from a server side,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.020
but also like marketing.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.910
So let's look at a case study.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.290
Nexon is a Korean
developer and the creator

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.290
of some popular games, in
particular "Durango Wild

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.810
Lands", which was
launched in Korea the 25th

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.000
of January, 2018.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.890
So they started
the pre-reg process

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.440
six weeks before
launching the game.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.730
And during this time, they saw
2.5 million preregistration

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.850
users.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.350
Out of those 2.5 million
users, pre-reg users,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:16.150
46% were coming from the Play
pre-registration feature.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.670
And what is very
interesting here

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.530
is that the day
seven conversion,

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.440
meaning from launch date
until the day seven,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.950
the first week, the conversion
for Play pre-reg users

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.060
was about 70%, which
is seven times higher

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.077
than the other sources.

00:20:32.077 --> 00:20:34.410
So as Kiki [? Heelman, ?] the
head of platform relations

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.050
says, "Google preregistration
is essentially a very effective

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.270
marketing tool."

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.700
So how is Nexon using
for other games?

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.210
So Nexon has launched
20 games in 2017

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.190
and has used the
pre-registration feature

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.940
in 10 games last year.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.880
They saw a 50% conversion
from pre-reg users

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.070
to actual users
downloading this game.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.500
They have seen also that
the CPIs are quite lower.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.170
They're 60% lower in pre-launch
than in post-lunch period.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.810
And as such, this has led
to a decision to allocate

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.340
the marketing budget 50%
to the pre-launch state ,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.838
rather than in post-launch.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.920
So far, the preregistration
pilot has been very successful.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.710
In 2017, we've seen numbers,
such as more than 50 developers

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.490
using this
functionality, as well,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.850
200 million players registering,
and 100 million players

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.550
actually downloading
those games, and then

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.380
a total of 400 launches across
both small and big developers.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.280
Indeed, this is exciting.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.850
But what is even more
exciting is to know that,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.950
today, we are
announcing that pre-reg

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.280
is becoming available to
all developers very soon.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.350
So what are some of
the things that we

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.930
need to take into account
if we want to have

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.300
a good experience with pre-reg?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.540
So three things, as well,
that I wanted to remember.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.630
So the first is allow some
time to build excitement.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.080
So in between three
to six weeks is enough

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.160
in order to gather all
this audience interest.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.000
But as well, use
all the channels

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.390
that you have available in
order to build that excitement,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:20.470
for example, media, communities,
forums, your own website.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.420
And across all
these channels, make

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.820
sure that you have
a clear action--

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.830
in this case, preregister
in Google Play.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.510
With this in mind, let's
jump into the last tool,

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.550
which is country targeting.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.520
Country targeting is
a very powerful tool.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.020
And essentially, it
allows two things.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.010
So first, we can have
different tracks per country.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.860
And then we can run
separate closed, open tests

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.050
or production in a
specific geography.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.520
This is very useful
as the quote mentions,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.460
for soft launching processes.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.400
Where for example, we want
to have one particular region

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.080
in production to test user
acquisition or monetization.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.830
Secondly, it's key during
launch because we can use

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.742
a staged rollout per geography.

00:23:06.742 --> 00:23:08.200
And this means that
you can control

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.000
the rollout in
different countries,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.310
and then monitor which users
are getting into the app.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.600
This allows us to test server
performance or user feedback.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.750
So let's look at how
some developers are

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.880
using this functionality.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.340
So Wargaming, Ukrainian
developer and behind the game

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.130
"World of Warships Blitz",
they launched this game

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.830
in January, 2018, as well.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.740
And the game has already seen
more than 3 million installs

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.210
in Google Play.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.880
By the way, 100
million ships destroyed

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.610
and more than 15 million
planes shot down.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.060
So incredible numbers,
as well, on that side.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.730
And we spoke with
Raymond Cheung,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.670
who is the marketing
manager in Wargaming.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.980
And he told us that they
used the country targeting

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.880
during the soft launch period.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.990
This soft launch period
took about six months,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.490
and they divided
it in three stages.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.420
So the first stage, they select
a few number of countries.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.850
And they were testing
things like stability--

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.930
so crash rates, monetization,
lifetime value, and CPI--

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.230
and then engagement, which is
user engagement and duration

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.820
of the games.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.680
On the second stage, they opened
up to a few more countries,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.310
and they were testing
mostly server capacity

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.740
and ensuring the
stability of the game.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.920
And then on the
third stage, they

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.050
opened up to already
more countries

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.790
across all continents with the
intent of testing monetization,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.560
mostly.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.890
So lastly during
this whole process,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.340
Wargaming was testing,
as well, and monitoring

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.230
the ratings and the
reviews and reacting

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.330
based on the user feedback.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.500
So in conclusion, regarding
country targeting,

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.370
two things to remember today.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.090
So the first one is like we
can use country targeting

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.380
during soft launch, but also
during the open and closed

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:06.510
Beta test processes, as well as
during even like future updates

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.810
or post-launch period.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.000
And the second
thing is, at launch,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.720
plan ahead what is
going to be the rollout

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.170
to the different countries.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.560
So [INAUDIBLE] all the
work, and download the game,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.780
and enjoy it quickly,
but without any issues.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.960
And with this, I would like
to call my colleague, David.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.802
Thank you.

00:25:24.802 --> 00:25:26.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.260
DAVID WIESENFELD:
Thanks, Ignacio.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.740
I'm David, product manager on
Play Console Go To Market Tools

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.700
and Google Play Games Services.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.710
Now we're moving
on to post-launch.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.395
At this point, you've
developed your game, tested it

00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:48.390
with a growing
cohort of testers,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.090
had a good launch day
and a strong launch week,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.669
and the dust is settling.

00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:54.210
What are the things
that you're going

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.396
to be thinking about next?

00:25:57.396 --> 00:25:59.770
Three post-launch activities
that we're going to focus on

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.580
are growing your audience to
get as many people as possible

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.940
playing your great
game, engaging

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.470
your players by delivering a
great experience that they want

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.120
to keep coming back
to, and earning money

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.010
so you can keep running your
game or build your next one.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.590
Let's start with
audience growth.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.830
Players are becoming harder
and more expensive to acquire

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.690
and retain.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.160
Game developers
like you are using

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.322
lots of different
strategies to acquire users.

00:26:28.322 --> 00:26:31.940
UA is common, but so are
other less trackable methods--

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.230
cross-promotion in other games,
leveraging YouTube influencers,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.470
utilizing social channels,
third-party website marketing.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.260
And I'm sure you have
other great methods too.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.570
You can track clicks
and installs from ads.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.330
But players who install your
app organically from the Play

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.050
Store who may get there,
say, via search after reading

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.630
about your game on a
third-party website

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.780
are a black box while accounting
for the majority of installs

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.920
for most developers.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.180
Using the new tools in Organic
Acquisition Insights report

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.310
in Play Console, you can
now see the breakdown

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.680
of how many new
installers have accessed

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.510
your listing either via search
or by browsing the Play Store.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.380
Most users find games in
Google Play using search.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.560
And with this tool, you
can dive deeper into search

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.780
and see the specific
search terms

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.510
that drive users to your game.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.340
Organic Acquisition
Insights reports

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.604
is coming soon for
all developers.

00:27:30.604 --> 00:27:32.020
The developers
we've talked to are

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.150
excited to use these
insights in order

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.570
to assess the
acquisition strategies,

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.350
change their store
listing and screenshot

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.790
to reflect what their
users are looking for,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.910
and even optimize
in-app onboarding

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.210
experiences to ensure that
it references the features

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.150
and benefits that the
users find most appealing.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.200
This is a powerful new tool
that I hope you'll explore.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.632
To find out more about
Organic Acquisition Insights,

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.340
you can go to this
talk tomorrow morning.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.010
Next, we'll talk about
Google Play Instant.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.620
Growing your game involves
getting users excited about it.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.890
And a great way to do that is to
give them a quick and easy way

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.510
to experience it.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.480
For quick background, we
launched Instant Apps at I/O

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.330
last year.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.640
And since then,
we've been very busy.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.370
There are more than
a billion devices

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.960
that support Instant Apps.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.710
And we've improved our
tooling to make building

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.740
Instant Apps even easier.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.380
And as you may have
heard, we announced

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.370
that we're bringing Instant Apps
to games at GDC six weeks ago.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.160
And as of today,
Google Play Instant

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.600
is now available to
all game developers.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.580
So why should you consider
making an instant game?

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.370
Instant games allow players to
try your game before installing

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.710
it and make it easy to
install the full game

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.900
at the end of the instant
game experience using

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.180
the install prompt API.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.100
Being able to try a
game before installing

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.380
is a hit with players.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.550
And after publishing
their Instant game,

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.140
Mighty Battles has seen a 19%
increase in acquisition rate.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.300
So what's the difference between
Instant Apps and Instant Games?

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.670
What we've done is adapt
the Instant App frameworks

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.930
so it better meets the needs
of game developers like you.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.670
There are three
things we've changed.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.760
We've increased the size
limit to 10 megabytes.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.560
We've enabled
progressive download

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.480
of executable code and assets
using the [INAUDIBLE] API.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.090
And very importantly,
we've added full support

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.100
for native code
and are integrating

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.530
with game engines and Open GL.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.480
This means you can
use the same codebase

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.100
and tools as your full game
to build your instant game.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.840
And by creating an instant game,
you open up a lot of surfaces.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.650
Players can experience instant
games directly from ads,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.620
in the Play Games app
arcade, via a link you

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.590
can send with a messaging
app, and of course,

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.270
in the Play Store.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.550
While we're on the topic
of Google Play Instant,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.790
we need to touch back just for
a moment on launching tools.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.250
Pre-reg is a very
successful program.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.780
And we're bringing
the Instant games

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.720
to Play Store's
preregistration feature.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.670
Now players that
preregister can get

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.160
a sneak preview of your game.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.690
And when you promote
preregistration

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.690
through social media,
email, or on your website,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.400
users will be able
to play instantly

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.020
from any Android device.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.320
It's an awesome way to introduce
your game to the world.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.870
To learn more about
Instant games,

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.910
you can attend this
session on Thursday.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.250
Next, we'll look at engagement.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.250
Android Vitals is designed
to help you identify issues

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.880
at scale so you can create
a better, more fluid, more

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.870
optimized, and more engaging
experience for your players.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.330
There are a number of new
vitals features launching,

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.370
including benchmarks
for all vitals,

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.329
and new vitals, including
startup time, which

00:30:51.329 --> 00:30:53.120
were discussed in the
Android Vital session

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.070
earlier this afternoon.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.050
Of particular interest
for game developers

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.080
like you, are stability
and battery vitals.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.720
Stability vitals include
A and R's and crashes.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.770
And batteries include stuck wake
locks and excessive wakeups.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.500
We're now showing these
vitals against a bad behavior

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.880
threshold.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.160
Exhibiting bad
behavior in vitals

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.490
will negatively affect the
user experience in your game

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.490
and can result in bad ratings
and poor discoverability

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.100
in the Play Store.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.280
We also have vitals for
rendering and startup time,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.742
though, these are
informative at this point.

00:31:26.742 --> 00:31:28.200
And with the new
vitals benchmarks,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.800
you can see how you stack
up against similar games.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.870
It's important to know
that Android Vitals is

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.640
a powerful tool not
just for app developers,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.700
but for game developers too.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.550
Using Vitals, game
developer, Kiloo,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.090
whose game "Subway Surfers"
just passed 1 billion installs

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.735
on Google Play, was able to make
drastic improvements to their A

00:31:49.735 --> 00:31:53.545
and R rate, reducing it from
around 2% to below 0.1%.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.020
So to help you ensure your
users enjoy playing your game,

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.660
how should you be thinking
about using Vitals in your day

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.130
to day?

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.490
Keep an eye on A and
R's, crashes, wake locks,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.190
and wake ups, which will be
easier with the notifications

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.890
and alerts built
into Play Console.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.157
And use the Vitals dashboard
as part of your toolkit

00:32:16.157 --> 00:32:17.115
to chase down problems.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.560
Now, we wanted to share
with you something

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.829
we've been working on.

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:24.620
It's not ready for
general consumption yet.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.670
That's coming.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.720
But we're excited to be working
to bring LiveOps to play.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.240
We are creating new
experiences in the store

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.520
and in the Play Games
app to show players

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.550
the events that are
happening now in their games.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.550
This is proving very
popular with players,

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.590
and we're going to continue
exploring in this direction.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:47.610
And finally, let's
move on to revenue.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.420
Google Play has had
subscriptions since 2012,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.560
but they've mostly been
the domain of subscription

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.220
for access apps.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.560
Games typically monetize through
IAPs in ads or are paid games.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.720
But a number of developers
have been experimenting

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.130
with subscriptions,
and we wanted

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.740
to share their experiences.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.870
You may be wondering,
what's the business case

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.470
of adding subscriptions
when I already have IAP?

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.370
Developers who
implement subscriptions

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.270
report an increase in
engagement and retention

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.730
not just for the subscribers,
but for their overall user

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.860
base, as well, as you can
see from Monster Strike's

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.070
experience with "MonPass."

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:27.270
Many, including Scopely, also
notice minimal cannibalization

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.760
of IAP, resulting
in incremental gains

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.410
to overall revenue driven by
both subscriptions and IAP.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.970
Another developer who's found
successful subscriptions

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.210
is Network in "Legendary
Game of Heroes."

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.429
They use subscriptions for
their VIP loyalty program.

00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:48.970
This program has proved popular
with players, as you can see,

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.980
and had created a
new revenue stream

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.100
for "Legendary Game of Heroes"
with strong positive impact

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.120
on overall revenue.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.730
There are two best practices
in using subscriptions

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.740
to provide value to players--

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.920
loyalty programs for your high
value users and a new access

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.000
point to premium experience
for traditional non-buyers.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.280
The target audience
will influence how you

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.590
choose to design your offering.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.810
Some examples of a
VIP loyalty program

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.730
features include exclusive
or early access to content,

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.760
special in-game VIP status
and title, or a bonus

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.357
payout with each purchase.

00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:29.190
This is the most popular
subscription design

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.719
we've seen so far
and, as you can

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:33.120
see from Ludia's "Jurassic
World, The Game,"

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.780
implement here.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.290
Developers have also
found that subscriptions

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.989
can be effective in converting
traditional non-buyers.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.010
These players are motivated by
getting a good financial deal.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.929
You can see Network's
implementation here,

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.940
which is a VIP
loyalty program aimed

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.969
at these traditional non-buyers.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.699
Of course, as with any
monetization system,

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.719
be aware of potential downsides.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.830
And keep a close pulse of
player feedback and community

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.490
sentiment.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.620
To help you with your
subscription program,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.010
Google Play has a very robust
subscriptions infrastructure

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.290
with a lot of rich features.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.310
We support you with billing
tools and analytics insight

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.020
reports throughout the
entire user funnel.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.020
And we can take care of
useful subscription features,

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.090
such as flexible billing,
free trials, account hold,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.310
so that you can focus on
testing and implementing

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:30.394
an effective in-game
subscription design.

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:31.810
To learn more about
subscriptions,

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.880
you can watch the
recording of this session

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.570
from earlier this afternoon.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.110
We've gone through
some of the tools

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.160
that you can take
advantage of post-launch.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.900
But as we draw to
a close, I want

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.000
to loop us back to the
beginning of our talk

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.160
and call out testing again.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.990
It's good to always be testing.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:53.110
In comparison to apps, this
can be tricky for games,

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.510
as some games need users
to be on the same version

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.130
to function properly.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.800
But think about how you can
effectively use Play's testing

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.590
tracks, which will all work
as well post-launch as they

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.780
do pre-launch, to
ensure your updates

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.220
live up to the quality
bar set for your game.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.770
To wrap up, we've
discussed a number

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.610
of tools in Play
Console you can use

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.600
in various stages of
your game's lifecycle.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.250
There's a lot going
on in mobile gaming

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.910
right now with
fantastic gamer growth,

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:23.810
loads of high quality
games being released,

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.594
and lots of competition.

00:36:25.594 --> 00:36:27.260
It's your own fault,
as you keep raising

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.620
the bar higher and higher
in terms of graphics, story,

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.700
and gameplay.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.485
Well done.

00:36:32.485 --> 00:36:34.610
We're excited to see what
you're able to build next

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.710
and where gaming goes from here.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.510
The tools we've talked
you through today

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.540
can help you along your
journey in a few key places

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.022
and give you some abilities
and insights you can

00:36:44.022 --> 00:36:45.230
leverage to help you succeed.

00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:50.710
We'd also love to hear your
feedback on this session.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:54.660
Thanks, for your time.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.380
We're around for
the rest of the day.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.640
And you can also check
out the sandbox over here.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.140
Thank you.
